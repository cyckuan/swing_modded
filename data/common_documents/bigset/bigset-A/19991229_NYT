MILIC SHOWS WAY FOR NORTHRIDGE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the little things that made Neda Milic's
performance so valuable to the Cal State Northridge women's
basketball team. The little things, and the fact that she scored 25
points in 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't her aggressive defense, it was her offensive
presence in the post that helped the Matadors maintain their lead.
After a tough 19-point loss to Illinois last week, the Matadors
refocused and easily disposed of Towson University 75-58 Tuesday
night at Northridge. Milic sweetened the victory with a half-court
shot at the end of the game just as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just active today,'' said Northridge coach Frozena
Jerro of Milic, who was 10 of 14 from the field. ``She was
rebounding (and) making good decisions with the ball.... The
Illinois game really hit home for us. We had a first-hand look of
where we're trying to get to. We want to be one of the top teams in
the nation and I think she really took that to heart and took it
upon herself (to start the team in that direction). She knows what
our weaknesses are and with her ability she's able to help us
combat those weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Milic, the Matadors (6-3) kept the Tigers (2-6) scoreless
over nine minutes in the first half to jump to a 37-25 halftime
lead. CSUN finished the game with 48 rebounds, including 21
offensive boards. Forward Myesha Saleem pulled down a team-high 11
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors got more offense from Edneisha Curry, who scored 10
points, and Jamilah Jones, who had 11. CSUN also had an offensive
spark off the bench in freshman guard Shakira Bryant, who added
five assists.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Tigers cut a 20-point deficit to 12 at
56-44 off a Shniece Perry layup. But the Matadors' defense stepped
up and prevented any more rallies. Perry, one of the Tigers' top
rebounders, collected only five rebounds but made up for it
offensively with 13 points. Michele Lanigan led Towson with 15
points and seven assists.

CURBING ONLINE SALES OF DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GONDERINGER   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Four Internet drug companies in Arizona have been
sued by out-of-state authorities accusing them of deceptive
practices. A Florence doc tor has been disciplined for selling
Viagra without prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a threat by such ``rogue operators'' around the country,
Pres ident Clinton on Tuesday proposed requiring that Internet
sites obtain federal approval for selling prescrip tion drugs in
cyberspace or face stiff fines.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Board of Medical Examiners says several more doc
tors are under investigation, and legislation is expected to be
intro duced in January to strengthen state statutes. Arizona's
attorney general is also working on its own investiga tion.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's plan, if approved by Congress, would be the
biggest step so far. It would give the Food and Drug Administration
unprecedented new powers to review and certify hundreds of
drug-dispensing Web sites. Violators would face half-mil lion
dollar fines for each infraction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said prescription drug sites give consumers good opportu
nities to obtain medicines more affordably. But, he said, they also
leave consumers vulnerable to ex ploitation by those who dispense
drugs without prescriptions or li censes.
</P>
<P>
   The move would mark a signifi cant shift in the regulation of
both the Internet and pharmaceuticals. The Internet has been
largely unre gulated, with policymakers loath to stifle its
development. And the regulation of drug sales is largely the
province of state government.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have moved against Web operators. Just this
month, Michigan ordered 10 online phar macies, including KwikMed
Inc. of Tempe and a Las Vegas &UR; company tied to a Phoenix area
doctor, to stop selling in their state or face legal action.
Illinois filed suit against four operators in October, including  &QL; 
Expressrx.net and expresstoday.com, based in Gilbert, and MDHealth
line.com of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners punished
Dr. William Clemans of Florence for prescribing Viagra via the
Internet without having a physician-patient relationship. He was
put on proba tion for five years.
</P>
<P>
   But states are hampered when the patient lives in one state, the
pharmacist in another and the oper ator in a third, said Dr. Jane
Henney, FDA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the traditional safe guards that have been in place
for many years are breaking down,'' she said. ``We have to have a
way to keep some semblance of a safety net in place.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy. Although they see it as a big problem, officials
at the Arizona Board of Pharmacy haven't spent much time trying to
find local companies selling online drugs without prescriptions
because they are difficult to track down. The officials were
unaware of the four local companies that had been targeted this
year by the attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually not in favor of federal regulation. But in this
case, it might be the only way to tackle this problem,'' said Llyn
Lloyd, executive director of the pharmacy board.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Claudia Foutz, executive director of the Board
of Medical Examiners, think Congress should mind its own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any evidence of states throwing up their hands
saying, `Golly gee, we can't handle this,' '' she said. ``We moved
very swiftly in Arizona when we became aware (of unauthorized
Internet sales).''
</P>
<P>
   Foutz thinks the best approach would be to educate the public
about the dangers and to treat the sales like any other
get-rich-quick scheme, prosecuting violators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question Congress will be looking at is: Do you kill a fly
with a sledgehammer?'' Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House initiative in cludes a request for $10 million
next year to hire about 100 investigators and upgrade computers.
Like the new laws, new money would have to be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, legitimate online pharmacies make it easy and con
venient for consumers to get the drugs they need. Online drug shop
ping is particularly useful for people in rural areas and those who
have trouble leaving their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been several cases where Web sites sent drugs out
without a valid prescription or dispensed drugs that were not le
gally available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA recently uncovered ille gal at-home AIDS tests sold over
the Internet that didn't work, mean ing some people may have
thought they were healthy when they actu ally had the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also has pointed to a 53-year-old Chicago man who died
after taking the impotence pill Viagra, which he ordered over the
Internet. He never saw a doctor, who might have advised him that he
was at risk of heart disease, which makes taking Viagra dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, there have been several safeguards to protect
con sumers against unsafe use of drugs,'' the White House said in a
fact sheet. ``The Internet makes it easy to bypass these
safeguards. Unethical doctors can illegally pre scribe pills online
to consumers they have never met in states where they are not
authorized to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the FDA opened a consumer-advice Web page
(www.fda.gov) to help patients en sure that they're buying from
legiti mate stores instead of quacks.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy is certifying
legitimate online pharmacies. Cus tomers can check www.nabp.net to
see whether a particular Web phar macy is safe.
</P>
<P>
   But those are voluntary efforts. By contrast, the federal plan
would:
</P>
<P>
   Require online pharmacies to get FDA certification that they are
legally operating or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Impose fines of $500,000 for each time a site sold a
prescription drug to someone without a valid prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Give the FDA new power to subpoena the records of online sites
while investigating these operators.
</P>
<P>
   Even if implemented, it is unclear how these rules would affect
Web sites operating out of other coun tries.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also plans a public education campaign, using
$250,000 of FDA money budgeted this year for a variety of other
programs. The campaign will in clude ads on health Web sites and
public service announcements for television telling consumers how
to order drugs safely over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tough getting Congress to give new money or power to
the FDA, which did not get most of its budget requests it sought
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Henney is optimistic. ``We think Congress is interested in
the Internet overall,'' she said. &QL;

PANAMA CANAL HAS MISSOURI CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When the United
States hands over the Panama Canal this week, some of Missouri will
go with it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be an unknown quantity of Missouri limestone, which
an Atlas Portland Cement Co. plant near Hannibal mixed into cement
that it sent to Panama in the early part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Less tangible will be the labor of immigrants who came from all
over Europe to work at that cement plant. Today, some of their
descendants live in Sugar Creek, a small Missouri River community
northeast of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The community known as Ilasco, Mo., which grew up around the
cement plant near Hannibal, no longer exists. A new memorial,
however, marks the location.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Sugar Creek names on that monument,'' said
Sugar Creek, Mo., Mayor Stan Salva, whose late father, John, was
born in Ilasco in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   That was the same year the federal government awarded the Atlas
Portland Cement Co. a contract calling for 4.5 million barrels of
cement for the Panama Canal. Mammoth project
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the Panama Canal, which cost the United States
$350 million to build, was small.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1977 book The Path Between the Seas, David McCullough
called the project ``one of the supreme human achievements of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, its needs reached far beyond Central America. An
average of 5,000 Americans worked on the project as it was being
built by the United States from 1904 through 1914.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Albert R. Waters.
</P>
<P>
   A 1912 graduate of the University of Missouri engineering
program, Waters found initial work with the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Through the years, the corps would have many officers
working on the canal.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Waters took an examination for potential canal
engineers. After a freezing day spent surveying on the Kansas
River, Waters returned home and found a telegram from the Panama
Canal Commission ordering him to report to Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Waters spent 1913 and 1914 there making topographical surveys
and engineering reinforced concrete designs used in the
construction of canal support facilities. It was a vivid experience
for Waters, who later would help establish the Carter-Waters Corp.
of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about the canal often,'' said Richard Newlin of
Prairie Village, Waters' son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Waters died in 1979, just two years after the United States and
Panama signed treaties giving full sovereignty and responsibility
for the canal to Panama. The transfer will occur Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was not pleased about the treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said that `if I'd have known they were going to give
it away, I'd never have built it,' '' Newlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kansas City connection to the canal is George S.
Morison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, Morison was considered America's premier civil
engineer. That year the U.S. Senate was debating whether to build
the isthmus canal through Panama or Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Morison, testifying before the Senate canal committee, assured
the senators that a Panama canal was feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morison was the star professional witness,'' said Louis Potts,
history professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and
co-author of a study on Kansas City's Hannibal Bridge, Morison's
first engineering assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morison basically said that we could build it, that the canal
was professionally feasible and that the Panamanian isthmus could
be overcome by civil engineering,'' Potts said
</P>
<P>
   A scion of one of Boston's first families, Morison had taken a
job out of Harvard University with a New York law firm, but soon
left it for engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He started at the bottom, which in 1867 put him on the muddy
banks of the Missouri River at Kansas City. Though Morison would
rise to become the chief assistant to Octave Chanute, head of the
Hannibal Bridge project, he started as a ``chain man'' for a survey
crew, the most menial work being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morison cut his teeth here and moved on rapidly, building
bridges across the Mississippi,'' Potts said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas City was as good a place as any, Potts added. After
the Civil War, he said, only two principal schools turned out civil
engineers: the military academy at West Point, N.Y., and what is
now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Other engineers learned by doing, by building railroads or _ in
Morison's case _ bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would claim back then that you were better off as
an engineer if you went to the school of hard knocks,'' Potts said.
</P>
<P>
   Building the Hannibal Bridge fit that description, Potts added.
Constructed in 1869, it was the first railroad bridge to span the
Missouri River. Cement connection
</P>
<P>
   After the canal changes hands, a new Kansas City connection will
be forged in Panama. Along with a partner, the Kansas City Southern
Railway Co. has been designated to rebuild and operate a 47-mile
rail line that runs along the canal from the Pacific Ocean to the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But Missouri's biggest tie to the canal itself, however, is
probably through its cement industry.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is now the third-largest source of limestone in the
country. Limestone is a principal ingredient in cement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, agents for the Atlas Portland Cement Co. began buying
land near Hannibal. Company officials had been swayed by a report,
compiled by a University of Missouri geology professor, that the
bluffs overlooking the Missouri River at Hannibal contained rich
deposits of limestone and shale.
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened in 1903. The company quickly built barracks and
boardinghouses for the Slovak, Italian, Hungarian and other
immigrants who arrived to provide the bulk of the plant's labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.5 million Panama Canal contract, secured in August 1908,
enabled the company to fight its way out of a slump brought on by a
national recession that had begun the year before. Eventually the
Atlas Portland Cement Co. furnished practically all of the cement
for the canal, said Gregg Andrews, a Hannibal native and the author
of City of Dust, a 1996 history of the Ilasco community.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that cement came from the company's plant in
Northampton, Pa., Andrews said. He's not sure why. Still, a portion
came from Ilasco, sent down to Panama in sacks either by rail or
barge.
</P>
<P>
   The canal contract apparently brought prestige to Atlas. The
company prepared an exhibit championing its contribution to the
canal for a 1912 cement products exhibition in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fortunes of the Ilasco cement plant rose and fell, as
did the lot of its immigrant laborers. In 1907, hundreds had been
forced to leave Ilasco during the national recession, and many
other employees were let go during a similar economic downturn in
the early 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those workers came to Sugar Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Cement manufacture began in Sugar Creek in 1905 and continued
under several names, among them the Missouri Portland Cement Co.
and the Lafarge Corp., which acquired the operation in 1991. It's
not likely that any cement was produced for the Panama Canal out of
Sugar Creek, said Steve Kidwell, environmental and public affairs
manager for Lafarge in Sugar Creek.
</P>
<P>
   But back at the turn of the century, an immigrant population
already had begun arriving to work at the Standard Oil Co. plant in
Sugar Creek, which opened in 1904. News of the employment options
probably was exchanged between Ilasco and Sugar Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were these kinds of chain migrations taking place,''
said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Mikula of Sugar Creek is the son of Andrew Mikula Sr., who
left Ilasco for Sugar Creek in the 1920s. The elder Mikula worked
at the Sugar Creek cement plant for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me this was the best rock in the United States
for making cement for bridges,'' Mikula said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's back at the former Ilasco town site, where the cement
was good enough to build the Panama Canal, that the Mikula name is
on a new memorial dedicated this past October.

EXPERTS ANSWER Y2K QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Admit it. You're not
prepared for Y2K.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And why should you be?
</P>
<P>
   True, the White House and lots of experts are telling us to
prepare for Y2K as we would a bad winter storm.
</P>
<P>
   But they also say computer problems after Jan. 1, 2000, will be
like potholes in the road _ minor irritants.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Y(awn)2K has set in. But before you turn the page,
let's give the experts a final shot at answering some of the tough
questions you probably would ask them if you could track the down.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this, then, ``The Skeptic's Guide to Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Experts tell us to prepare for Y2K as we would for a winter
storm. But the extent of my winter preparations have never been
more than a shovel and some sidewalk salt. Why should I bother to
do more?
</P>
<P>
   A: Peter de Jager, Canadian computer expert who first sounded
the alarm about Y2K
</P>
<P>
   You're underestimating the power of a winter storm. Montreal in
January of 1996 was without power for three weeks because of an ice
storm. Unless you intend to be using that salt to flavor the snow
you shovel, you're not doing enough to handle a real storm.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the winter storm analogy is used is because it's a
simple way of describing a level of preparedness that we believe is
both responsible and sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The White House says everything is going to be fine, but
stock up on food and supplies for at least three days. So what
message do you want me to listen to?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dean Katerndahl, director of the Mid-America Regional
Council's Government Innovations Forum
</P>
<P>
   This is a question we have been asked at several of our Y2K
forums. I believe that local governments and critical services have
done an extraordinary job addressing potential Y2K issues. But we
will always be somewhat vulnerable. Therefore, having a contingency
plan for the unexpected is just a part of good preparations for Y2K
and any potential event.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Y2K is such a big deal, why hasn't the president or vice
president had a fireside chat with the American people about what
to do to prepare for Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   A: Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah, chairman of the
Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem
</P>
<P>
   People often ask why the president hasn't been more up front
with regard to Y2K. To his credit, he appointed a very capable
person, John Koskinen, to carry the direct authority of the
president in preparing the nation for Y2K. John has succeeded
without making this vital national challenge into a partisan issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several dates throughout 1999 were considered ``doom dates''
or triggers of when we might see Y2K problems crop up, and yet
almost none panned out. How many times can you cry wolf?
</P>
<P>
   A: Katerndahl: It has been my experience that the technical
people and others seriously engaged in addressing Y2K issues never
considered such dates as doom dates. I believe the media, in an
attempt to make Y2K more exciting, created doom dates. To some
extent, even Jan. 1, 2000, is not a doom date, but just the most
prominent of a series of dates. In fact, Y2K problems have been
popping up continuously, are being successfully dealt with, and
will continue to appear for some time into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Kansas City has spent $17.5 million on Y2K fixes, about the
same amount as repairing Turkey Creek and one of the city's major
bridges. You say all city departments are ready. So what's left to
worry about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don Eatherton, Kansas City's Y2K coordinator
</P>
<P>
   The first thought that comes to mind ``Isn't this the same logic
used by the planners of the Titanic when they shorted the ship on
lifeboats?''
</P>
<P>
   But if everyone behaves in a rational manner over the next few
weeks, I personally don't believe there will be any major problems.
KCMO along with many other municipalities are planning to have a
command center open and additional personnel to address Y2K as well
as other problems that may result from New Year's Eve celebrations.

CASINO OPERATORS COMPLAIN ABOUT HIGHER TAXES WITH OPEN BOARDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Despite robust
November revenue, Kansas City's casino operators are complaining
that open boarding hurts them with a hidden tax increase, and they
vow to lobby the Missouri General Assembly next year for a tax
break.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This issue affects every casino in the state,'' said Michael
St. Pierre, general manager of Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP;
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a way to normalize the admission tax to
pre-open-boarding days,'' St. Pierre said. ``For some of us, the
change in the effective tax rate we pay is well over 2 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Gaming Commission allowed Kansas City casinos to
drop restrictive boarding times Nov. 15. Since then admissions have
skyrocketed _ along with admission taxes at the rate of $2 a head.
</P>
<P>
   At Station Casino Kansas City, the increase is projected between
$3 million and $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking chump change,'' said John V. Finamore,
Station's Midwest president. ``The fundamentals of our business
have changed pretty significantly. No business in the world wants
to pay more taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize this doesn't play well with the public. The
perception is we're raking in all this money ... but revenues don't
equal profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public only realized how little is left at the end of
the day to pay our expenses ... our debt service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Harley-Davidson or Sprint. We're casinos, so people
don't see this the way we do ... but I've still got to make up a $3
million to $4 million shortfall, and I don't know how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Kansas City market experienced its most crowded
gambling month in history, according to the November report by the
Missouri Gaming Commission. Patrons spun area casino turnstiles a
record 1.97 million times, leaving $40.9 million behind.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Argosy Riverside Casino is open boarding's big
winner. The casino saw its monthly attendance jump 23.3 percent,
while its revenue grew 21 percent to a record $7.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo Hilton Casino wasn't far behind, as attendance
ballooned almost 30 percent while revenue hit a property record
$5.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Performance growth at the one-boat casinos came mostly at the
expense of Station and Harrah's, whose two-boat operations were
affected much less by the old rules because they could stagger
their boarding times.
</P>
<P>
   November attendance was up modestly at the two larger casinos,
but revenue at both was essentially flat.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, larger crowds and higher taxes and admission
fees took an extra bite out of casinos' revenue gains. For example,
Harrah's November 1999 revenue was up $206,713 from November 1998,
but the casino kept only $34,809 of that after state taxes and fees
were paid.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the change in November revenue for the other casinos,
followed by how much they got to keep:
</P>
<P>
   Argosy: $1,356,302; $953,152.
</P>
<P>
   Flamingo: $520,337; $255,532.
</P>
<P>
   Station: (-$217,358); (-$251,141).
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre said such year-to-year comparisons didn't tell the
whole story _ which is worse.
</P>
<P>
   During the three months before open boarding, the Kansas City
market averaged $41.4 million in revenue, with admissions around
1.77 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With just two weeks of open boarding during the month, said St.
Pierre, revenue was down slightly at $40.9 million, while
admissions hit a record 1.97 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's a $400,000 bump in admission taxes, he said, in the face
of a flat revenue trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any definition, that is more than a fair return for the
state and the home dock city,'' St. Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, Station and Harrah's staggered their
boarding times, attracting customers with waiting times of no more
than 15 minutes, compared with 75 minutes at one-boat casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his casino's gain under open boarding, Argosy General
Manager Larry Kinser said he also was looking for relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been such a dramatic impact on taxes,'' he said.
``Missouri already was the most heavily taxed gaming jurisdiction
in the United States.'' Despite that, he said, ``it would
definitely be nice to be back to pre-open-boarding tax rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Miller, interim general manager at the Flamingo, said that
he also would welcome a tax rollback to pre-open-boarding days but
that he didn't expect change without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `You asked for open boarding and you got it,'
and there's some truth to that,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miller's Flamingo has moved to the top of the charts
as the home of Kansas City's loosest 25-cent gambling games. The
phrase is industry jargon for the highest percentage of electronic
jackpot payouts to customers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gaming Commission financial records and six-month
average payouts calculated by The Kansas City Star, the Argosy
surrendered the title to the Flamingo in November by just .005 of a
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy held the title for the most popular 25-cent games for
more than two years and continues to operate the market's loosest
5-cent and $1 games, and has the loosest combined rate.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the casino did not change any computer programs that
govern slot machines' long-term payout rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' he said. ``We haven't changed a
thing. It's just a natural function of the cycling through of the
machines.''

COMPUTER DOODADS AND TV TOP LIST OF NOTABLE CREATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only days left in the 1900s, what better time to ponder
what this momentous epoch hath wrought? In other words, it's a time
for lists, and this one includes your Uncle Fearless' nominations
for the most notable economic events since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   - Most powerful invention: All the doodads that made computers
possible (tie).
</P>
<P>
   - Invention of most dubious benefit to humankind: Television,
which is still the wasteland it was characterized as more than a
generation ago, and getting more so each day.
</P>
<P>
   - Biggest marketing gaffe: Introduction of new-formula Coca-Cola
to howls of criticism and protest by Coke lovers throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
   - Most miraculous marketing triumph: Introduction of new-formula
Coca-Cola, because the publicity created the immensely popular
opportunity to reintroduce the original product as Coca-Cola
Classic. Some called the whole schmear stupid, while cynics said it
was planned. A top Coke exec said the company was neither that dumb
nor that smart.
</P>
<P>
   - Worst economics textbook: Paul Samuelson's intro Economics,
which in various editions praised taxation and government
regulatory intervention and claimed as late as 1989 that the Soviet
economy was proof a socialist command economy could not only
function, but also thrive.
</P>
<P>
   - Most successful marketing scam: Convincing tens of millions of
Americans that it's in their best interest to buy bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   - Best economics textbook: Anything written by Thomas Sowell.
</P>
<P>
   - Worst prediction: Paul Ehrlich's prediction in The Population
Bomb that overpopulation would render the planet incapable of
providing for the basic needs of its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   - Second-worst prediction: Warnings that Japan would overtake
the United States as world's greatest economy by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   - Most gratuitous regulation: Low-flow toilet mandate by
Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   - Worst market call: Columbia prof Irving Fisher's prediction
that the stock market was healthy and America was on a permanent
plateau of prosperity only a few weeks before the crash of '29.
</P>
<P>
   - Greatest innovation: Sliced bread. (At least that's the
consensus.)
</P>
<P>
   - Greatest innovation, runner-up: Anything characterized as
``the greatest thing since sliced bread.''
</P>
<P>
   - Greatest innovation, personal favorite: Individually wrapped
cheese slices.
</P>
<P>
   - Least appreciated great innovation: The paper clip.
</P>
<P>
   - Worst political innovation: Income tax and Social Security
(payroll) tax (tie).
</P>
<P>
   - Most fortuitous investment decisions: Getting 100 percent into
cash in mid-August 1987, and being fully invested after Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   - Most widely mixed blessing: Air conditioning, which made the
world infinitely more comfortable, but allowed the U.S. Congress to
remain in session year-round.
</P>
<P>
   - Greatest scam artist: Charles Ponzi, whose monumental talent
for robbing Peter to pay Paul and himself inspired the U.S. Social
Security system.
</P>
<P>
   - Boldest economic experiment: Creation of euro, Europe's common
currency.
</P>
<P>
   - Most incredible consumer fads: Pet rocks, Beanie Babies and
Pokemon (tie).

AGGIES STUFFED BY PENN STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Texas A&AMP;M has taken great pride in the fact that
it has one of college football's winningest programs in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Aggies closed the page on a decade in which only five
other NCAA Division I-A programs recorded more victories, they
found themselves once again only an associate member of the
nation's elite programs.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State handed the Aggies their sixth postseason defeat of
the decade against only two victories, winning Tuesday night's
Alamo Bowl, 24-0, before a record Alamodome crowd of 65,380.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with tremendous emotion all year long. At no time
this year did this team dog it,'' said Penn State coach Joe
Paterno, who avoided what would have been a fourth consecutive loss
for the first time in his 34 years as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I would say we played with some emotion but more
concerned for winning the game first. This team was too good to go
out with four straight losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions quarterback Rashard Casey, who ran for a 4-yard touchdown
and completed 8 of 16 passes for 146 yards _ including a 45-yard
score _ was voted the game's outstanding offensive player.
All-America linebacker LeVar Arrington recorded 14 tackles, helped
cause three of four Aggies interceptions and gained most valuable
defensive honors.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M has played some of the best teams in college football among
its eight bowl appearances in the past 10 seasons. They have won
against that caliber of opposition only twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, if we had won half those bowl games we would be
seen a lot differently than what we are,'' said Aggies coach R.C.
Slocum, who is 2-7 in bowl games. ``In all but one of those games,
we were underdogs to pretty good football teams and we haven't been
able to pull off the big upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I, the players and the fans are upset about.
We've played and competed well enough to get into some games
against those teams over the years. We've done some very good
things, but this is an area in which we have not been successful,
and it is very disappointing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat marked the third bowl game of the decade in which the
Aggies have failed to score a touchdown and their second shutout of
the season _ after having not been shut out for 142 games. A&AMP;M
moved the ball at times with its Jumbo Set backfield, keyed by
265-pound running back Ja'Mar Toombs, but the Nittany Lions'
defense forced four interceptions off the arm of quarterback Randy
McCown that prevented the Aggies from cashing in on the yards
gained in the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's Derek Fox intercepted two passes, returning one 34
yards for the Lions' initial touchdown. He later stole another to
stop an early fourth-quarter Aggies drive. But the killer theft was
by Penn State's Ron Graham after Arrington tipped the ball and
Graham hauled it in at the Lions' 10-yard-line on a third-and-seven
play from the 14.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M was down only 14-0 at the time and had moved from its 20 in
12 plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, that was a big series,'' Slocum said. ``To go
down the field and come up short and get the interception. We had
the momentum going. we make it 14-7 and we have a chance to make it
a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Two series later, the Lions moved 72 yards in five plays. Casey
scored on a bootleg on the first play of the fourth quarter for a
21-0 lead. A&AMP;M's Bethel Johnson fumbled the ensuing kickoff,
leading to Travis Forney's 39-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, in his first bowl start, had a dismal beginning to a
dismal performance before being relieved late by backup Mark
Farris. McCown's first two passes were intercepted, sandwiched
around a sack for a 10-yard loss. Penn State couldn't convert after
the first pick, but Fox snatched McCown's second pass out of the
air at the A&AMP;M 34 and raced down the left side of the field for a
touchdown that gave the Lions a 7-0 lead at 6:31 of the opening
quarter. Fox snagged the third-and-20 pass intended for wide
receiver Leroy Hodge a play after end Justin Kurpeikis had dropped
McCown for the loss at the Aggies' 10.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M then kept the ball for 17 plays, but a drive stalled at the
Penn State 19 when the Aggies incurred a 15-yard holding penalty on
second-and-five. A&AMP;M couldn't make up the lost ground, and Shane
Lechler missed a 44-yard field-goal attempt wide right.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions then struck quickly, completing a seven-play, 73-yard
scoring drive when Casey hit wide receiver Eddie Drummond running
free inside the 5 behind Aggies corner Sedrick Curry for a 45-yard
TD. Penn State took that 14-0 lead at 8:54 of the second quarter
and kept it at the half. nn

   ESSEX, Conn. _ Three decades after pesticides and bounty hunters
nearly eliminated them, bald eagles have become familiar winter
residents in Connecticut. Between 60 and 80 of them spend the
season at scattered waterfront sites. That number may seem small,
but not when compared with a statewide survey in 1980, which found
only 11 of the birds.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate, the Connecticut Audubon Society is organizing a
two-day Eagle Festival in mid-February on the banks of the
Connecticut River in Essex, in the hope of drawing bird-watchers
from all over. Even though eagles have recovered some of their
numbers in most of the country, the organizers say the Connecticut
event will be the first of its kind on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The national bird, which was on the federal endangered-species
list for 28 years, until 1995, now enjoys celebrity status. The
giant scavengers attract nature enthusiasts to the winter homes
they have picked in Connecticut, where some bird-watchers say they
seem less shy of people than they did a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The festival site in Essex provides the right combination of
tall trees, undeveloped land and open water, enabling the eagles to
hunt birds and snatch fish with their talons.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles also go to Point Folly, a peninsula on the northern shore
of Bantam Lake in Litchfield, and seem well established near the
Shepaug Dam on the Housatonic River. Northeast Utilities maintains
a public viewing area near its hydroelectric plant there.
</P>
<P>
   The birds also like the Kings Island Wildlife Management Area
along the Connecticut River in Enfield, where two pairs of eagles
have built 10-foot-wide nests and stay all year.
</P>
<P>
   But probably the largest group of bald eagles in Connecticut
congregates near Essex, where the festival will be held on Feb. 18
and 19 under a tent near the Connecticut River Museum at the foot
of Main Street. Bird experts will lecture and display captive
eagles that were injured by flying into power lines. People can go
in groups to seven sites to watch for the birds, and anyone willing
to pay $40 may take one of several boat cruises to observe the
eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see these birds, their appreciation for them
increases,'' said Cathy O'Donnell, communications director of the
Connecticut Audubon Society of Fairfield, which is organizing the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell said that the event would be the first bird
festival on the East Coast, and that the events were popular in
Washington state, Alaska and the Midwest. ``I think the nearest one
to us is Indiana,'' she said. ``We're on to something unique
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bald eagle is a gigantic bird of prey, which can reach a
height of three feet with a wing span of seven to eight feet. It
eats fish, but its favorite meal is the common merganser, a duck.
An eagle will also eat animal carcasses it finds, but it is illegal
for people to use those to bait eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Trappers, bounty hunters and the pesticide DDT decimated the
bald eagle population throughout the contiguous 48 states between
1900 and 1970. The first federal law to protect them was passed in
1940, and in 1967 the government declared eagles an endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   Government-sponsored recovery plans started in the early 1980s,
and in 1995 the bald eagle was listed as ``threatened,'' a less
serious designation.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Mitchell, who lives in Portland, Conn., worked in the
recovery program that transported young eagles from places like the
Chippewa National Forest in Minnesota to Massachusetts and
Connecticut in the 1970s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first pair they let go they called Betsy and Ross,'' he
said. ``Ross stayed around here, and he's still here in the area.''
The pair's nest is on the Quabbin Reservoir in Massachusetts, but
they come south to Connecticut for the winter, Mitchell said,
adding that he knows Ross by his leg band and by ``a very peculiar
wingbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell says he has noticed in recent years that some eagles
seem unfazed even if someone stands right near a nest. At other
times they may fly off a perch because someone is standing a
half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Even from that distance, eagles still look big to people _ and
people come into clear focus for eagles, Mr. Mitchell said. ``Any
of the raptors can pick a person out,'' he said. ``It's an ability
they have that people don't. Even seagulls can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter eagles are trying to rest, said Patricia Pendergast, a
member of the board of the Connecticut Ornithological Association.
``They'll sit in trees sunning themselves for hours.'' Ms.
Pendergast, a Chester resident, will be leading some groups to
watch the birds.
</P>
<P>
   She said that as much as she wants to teach people about birds,
she worries that the festival hubbub could disturb the guests of
honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are people within my organization who worry
about too much traffic on the Connecticut. If you get too close to
anything that's wild, they're going to try to put some distance
between you.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Vince Carter road show provided its nightly sellout and sent
ESPN its fix of slams and high-wire highlights. Cuttino Mobley
matched jackrabbit first steps, beating his buddy into the lane in
a blur.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mobley went after Carter. Carter took on Mobley and half the
Rockets. The NBA's next big thing and the Rockets' young answer
went after one another possession after possession, matching
unstoppable, explosive quickness and grabbing their teams' fate
until something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   In walked Charles Oakley. High flying made way for the rooted.
High speed was one-upped by no speed. Standing as still as the
basket, Oakley, the Raptors' earthbound 14-year veteran, swished a
pair of long jumpers to take over where the scene-stealers left off
and lift the Raptors to a 100-99 win Tuesday over the Rockets at
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakley hit one big shot to tie and another big one to win,''
Rockets center Kelvin Cato said. ``He was one step inside the
3-point line. He's not supposed to make that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oakley has made those shots throughout his career. And the
Rockets had no intention of allowing him to take target practice in
the last minute, especially when he nailed a 22-footer to tie the
score. But rather than leave guard Tracy McGrady, they left Oakley
open, and he burned them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad rotation when we came off McGrady,'' Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``It was no rotation. We sagged off
him. That's the way it's been. So many times it's a step too late
and we get stung. Hopefully, those kinds of mistakes will register
far down the road. Some of our younger guys were doing it earlier,
and we're better at that. Now our bigger guys have to learn that
lesson, and hopefully down the line it's not going to happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors did not put the Rockets in a position for it to
happen until rallying in the final minutes with Carter scoring 10
consecutive Toronto points. Carlos Rogers, with his left eye
swollen and his vision blurry from a finger he caught in the first
half and, he said, by a Kevin Willis fist, made two free throws for
an 89-86 lead with 2:55 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter answered with a drive, on which Cato was called for
goaltending, and a three-point play. Mobley beat Carter into the
lane, drawing a foul. He made both free throws to regain the
Rockets' lead. But Carter came back again with a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley passed to Cato, who was fouled inside and quickly
restored the Rockets' lead. But that was a cue for Oakley to take
over.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two, Oakley nailed a 22-footer to tie the score at
93 with 1:04 left. And after Mobley missed on a tough drive, Oakley
put the Raptors ahead 95-93 by swishing a jumper from the other
side with 29.7 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit those shots like it was the first quarter,'' Carter
said. ``He has a big heart, and he stepped up and hit the big
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Down by two, the Rockets again isolated Mobley on Carter. But
this time, Mobley pulled up for a 16-footer. He got the shot off
but left it short, saying later Carter had clipped his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me a little bit. It's all right, though,'' Mobley said,
adding that his friend later acknowledged the contact. ``That comes
with the game. I should have gone to the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Raptors in position to run out the clock, the Rockets
fouled Alvin Williams, who made his second free throw to build the
margin to three.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Drew, who played down the stretch for Steve Francis,
missed the first of two free throws, leaving the Raptors ahead by
two and allowing them to make just enough free throws to remain
beyond the Rockets' reach.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Christie made two free throws to push the lead to four.
After Walt Williams scored on a drive, Carter made two more from
the line, pushing the lead back to the four the Raptors needed when
Drew nailed a 3-pointer at the buzzer to come up just short.
</P>
<P>
   Carter finished with 35 points and 12 rebounds. Mobley _ who was
elevated to the starting lineup to allow Shandon Anderson to move
to forward to defend Carter _ had 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Francis struggled with his shot, going 2-of-9, and finished with
just five points, his second-fewest of the season (he had three
points when he was ejected in the second quarter of a loss in
Dallas). Still, Francis had 12 assists and seven rebounds but sat
out down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't sharp,'' Tomjanovich said of Francis. ``During that
(isolation) deal, the only guy that made an outside spot shot was
Bryce. We're going to the Cuttino matchup and hoping to free him up
for a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the only player freed for open outside shots was on the
other end of the court. The Rockets had rallied from 12 down in the
first quarter. Rogers had carried them early, making four of the
Rockets' first five shots. But even when they lost him to the
scratch on his left eye, they rallied to within one by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   When Francis twice set up Cato for consecutive layups in the
fourth quarter, the Rockets took a lead with 7:11 left that they
held until Oakley's second late jumper.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many games, for all the Rockets did right, doing
just a little wrong at the wrong time was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept our turnovers down, played a good defensive game,''
Tomjanovich said. ``We've been addressing the free-throw problem
and did a great job there (22-of-29). It seems we're just a smidgen
away from getting that reward. I'm disappointed. But it isn't like
we underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like so many of these games, I guess that's where we are. It's
going to be a gradual process of getting over that hump. That's
where we at.''

CLIPPERS' WINNING STREAK BROKEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ They didn't look like a team with a nice little
three-game winning streak. They looked like the Los Angeles
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the team that vowed two weeks ago after a rout by
the Lakers to play every night like they belong. After Tuesday's
128-105 loss to the improving Denver Nuggets, the Clippers will
spend the next week looking for answers before facing the Lakers
again on back-to-back nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the last time we played the Lakers, we just wanted to
prove that we weren't a joke,'' said rookie Lamar Odom, who scored
just 10 points on 4-for-13 shooting. ``Things have been better but
it means nothing now. Mentally we weren't in this game. We have to
want to come out every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (9-19) move on to Houston where they play the
Rockets on Thursday then get four days off. But it is certain they
will replay this one a few times in their minds. They fell behind,
got close then fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   After playing a sluggish first half, the Clippers trimmed a
24-point Nuggets lead to seven points by the end of the third
quarter. Maurice Taylor scored 13 of his game-high 30 in the
quarter and it looked like the Clippers might be able to steal one
despite off nights from Odom and center Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Olowokandi running on a bad knee, the Clippers
outscored Denver 22-12 in the low post during the third quarter.
They shot 65 percent overall and took the crowd of 14,035 at the
new Pepsi Center out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers finished the quarter with dunks by Tyrone Nesby and
Keith Closs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked great at that point,'' Clipper guard Troy Hudson
said. ``It looked like we had put all the bad stuff behind us. But
then it really got bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes into the final quarter, Denver was closing out a 7-0
run that included a three-pointer by former Laker George McCleod
and ended with a timeout called by Clipper coach Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for a period,'' said Nick Van Exel, another
former Laker, who finished with 13 points and 13 assists. ``When a
team makes a run you have to go out there and put the fire out.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom was not a factor after picking up his fifth foul late in
the third quarter. He played six minutes in the fourth but did not
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime we looked ourselves in the mirror,'' said Odom,
who came in averaging 17 points per game. ``No one wants to lose
especially to get embarrassed. I felt like we were making a serious
run when my fifth foul took some air out of me and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCloud hit another 3-pointer. Keon Clark, who
finished 9 for 10 from the field, scored nine points and grabbed
eight rebounds in the fourth. The Clippers hot shooting turned
cold, hitting just 22 percent in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Had they spent too much energy trying to come back? Or were they
just playing over their heads on the road?
</P>
<P>
   Denver came in winning four of five, including an 86-84 victory
over NBA champion San Antonio on Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   They are now 12-3 at the Pepsi Center and their balanced offense
is a reason why.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets had six players in double figures, including Antonio
McDyess with 22. Raef LaFrentz and Ron Mercer added 20 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had seven players score 10 or more, but Olowokandi
struggled to get his 11. He scored just two in the first half when
the Nuggets got the bulk of their 31 fast break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it looked like the knee was still bothering him,''
Clippers coach Chris Ford said of Olowokandi. ``We asked him
throughout the game if he was having problems, but he wanted to
stay in there.''

NORTHRIDGE RACES TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Run, run, fun.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team
found itself against St. Francis Tuesday night _ in an
NBA-of-the-1980s fastbreakathon. And while the Matadors pride
themselves on the defensive strides they've made this season,
dunking and draining 3-pointers was pleasing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a band, and it felt, as CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said
afterward, ``a college basketball game. The atmosphere was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors started slowly, but beat down every second-half
rally by the visiting Terriers of New York in an 88-79 victory in
front of a season-best 936 at Matador Gym. CSUN improved to 6-3 and
will see its RPI rating inch a little higher, from No. 78, which is
where it stood Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come home to a crowd - finally - and running and dunking,''
said CSUN senior forward Andre Larry, who had five dunks and 20
points. ``It felt really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors fed off the enthusiastic crowd, which was
entertained by the fast pace - even though the teams combined for
40 turnovers. Braswell said it was a somewhat ugly win, but it's
better than an ugly loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``(CSUN) is a good team,'' said St. Francis coach Ron Ganulin.
``I was petrified coming in here. I'm kind of satisfied we played
this close.''
</P>
<P>
   What a compliment for a Matadors program that four years ago was
one of the worst in Division I, that an opposing coach was happy to
lose by only nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned about (St. Francis),'' Braswell said.
``(The Terriers) play a lot of games on the road. They know how to
play in tough places.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing against CSUN's transition Tuesday night made it tough
for St. Francis, which dropped to 5-4. The Matadors had nine dunks,
helping their shooting percentage to a respectable 49.2 percent
(29-of-59).
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis scored 100 points last week in an overtime win over
Iona and also scored 90 and 95 points in two other wins this
season. The Terriers tired badly in the second half, though, going
two minutes without a field goal at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out and play like we've played all year,''
said CSUN center Brian Heinle, who scored a team-high 21 and also
had nine rebounds. ``(St. Francis) scores a lot of points... we
just made the winning plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were on defense. Hewitt Rolle, a senior forward at
CSUN, was strong inside with 10 rebounds. He was one of several
Matadors were pestered the shorter Terriers into wild shots.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis shot 45 percent (27 of 60) but also had 21
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is trying to be our main focus this year,'' said
redshirt freshman center Dan Read, who had nine points - on 3-of-3
shooting - in 13 minutes. ``When it came time... we got the stops
we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenetic pace led to a 48-42 halftime lead by the Matadors.
Larry dunked off a nice pass by Read on the first play of the
second half to make it 50-42, but St. Francis didn't let the
Matadors get away.
</P>
<P>
   At the 7 {-minute mark, CSUN's lead was 71-66. A layup by St.
Francis' Steven Howard cut the lead to 79-75 with 1:39 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 32 seconds remaining, a 3-pointer by the Terriers'
Richie Dominguez made it 83-79.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolle made one of two free throws with 26.4 seconds left,
starting a 5-0 Matadors run to finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   Larry's dunk with two seconds left was an appropriate finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense was important for our defense tonight,'' Braswell
said. ``It was one of those games where we knew we weren't going to
run away from them.''!dlim! &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

UCLA SURVIVES AGAINST PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looked good in person, and it looked good on
tape. But officially, Pepperdine guard Craig Lewis' game-tying
follow shot was ruled too late, and no matter how much the Waves
ranted and raved, it wasn't going to change.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won a game it probably shouldn't have Tuesday night at
Pauley Pavilion, escaping with a controversial 68-66 victory
despite Pepperdine's protestations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as (Lewis) released the ball, I looked right at the
red light,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``When he
let it go, the red light had not gone on. The ref that was farthest
away ultimately makes the call. I don't know what his justification
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The final sequence began with 1:02 left, when Lewis made one of
two free throws to give the Waves a 66-65 lead. UCLA, playing
without guard Earl Watson (fouled out), went to forward Jerome
Moiso, and his short bank shot gave the Bruins a 67-66 lead with 41
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After Pepperdine's Kelvin Gibbs missed a difficult turnaround,
Moiso grabbed the rebound and made one of free throws for a
two-point lead. The Waves had two chances in the final seconds, but
Brandon Armstrong missed a 3-pointer, and Lewis' follow of David
Lalazarian's miss at the buzzer was ruled too late.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed one-tenth of a second remained when Lewis shot,
and Lalazarian, screaming, chased the officials as they bolted off
the court.
</P>
<P>
   It was UCLA's fourth win in five games since losing to Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (7-2) returned from Hawaii on Friday morning and took
two days off for Christmas. They practiced Sunday afternoon with
fresh legs and full stomachs, but two days simply was not enough
time to correct the myriad glitches that surfaced in the Pearl
Harbor Classic _ especially in the loss to Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went longer and harder than we would have wanted,'' Bruins
coach Steve Lavin said of the practices. ``We tried to cover a lot
in a short amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA held a 16-10 lead with 13 minutes left in the half when its
offense stagnated. The Bruins went six possessions without a
basket, enabling the Waves to grab an 18-17 lead on Tezale Archie's
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged baskets until six minutes remained, when
UCLA's shot selection turned horrid and Pepperdine hit several open
jumpers. Lalazarian's 3-pointer and Tommie Prince's hook gave the
Waves a 37-32 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The margin could have been larger, but the Waves shot just 32.5
percent and failed to convert most of their 12 offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense found its groove early in the second half. Rico
Hines scored from the lane, Jason Kapono hit Watson for an
alley-oop, and Dan Gadzuric drained a short turnaround. But it
didn't last. After several wasted UCLA possessions and Armstrong's
uncontested layup, the Waves had a 52-44 lead with 12:36 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, the Bruins responded with their best stretch of the
game. They outhustled and outscored Pepperdine 13-2 _ turning a
54-46 deficit into a 59-56 lead on Watson's short jumper.
</P>
<P>
   But the Waves didn't wilt, and the Bruins couldn't maintain
their precision play. UCLA went eight possessions without a field
goal, and with a minute left the teams were tied 65-65.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Rush update:!off! Barring a last-minute development,
UCLA's portion of the JaRon Rush investigation is expected to
conclude in two or three weeks. At that point, the school will
forward its findings to the Pac-10 and the NCAA, then await a
verdict by the NCAA. That could take a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA appeals _ a distinct possibility, since Missouri
appealed the NCAA's 13-game suspension of Rush's brother, Kareem _
the situation probably won't be resolved for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush was suspended for taking several hundred dollars in
cash and merchandise from former AAU coach Myron Piggie. Because
Rush's financial ties to Piggie are deeper, sources said, his
punishment could be more severe than 13 games.

NORTHRIDGE HOPES WINS BRING FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Penny Braswell breathed a little easier when she
saw the security guard sitting across the court from her at the
Matadome on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The few people who can say without fibbing they are familiar
with the Cal State Northridge basketball team's homecourt will
attest it's not a menacing place.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The post office on the corner drew more of a crowd on Christmas
Eve than does the average CSUN game.
</P>
<P>
   A woman changing her car tire on the shoulder of the 405 gets
more looks than the Matadors' basketball team. All this despite the
fact the Matadors are off to a marvelous start this season, with
nonconference wins over two projected top-40 programs (Fresno State
and Oregon).
</P>
<P>
   The team's piddling profile bothered Penny Braswell, who has a
vested interest in seeing CSUN's gym stacked with spectators. No,
she doesn't operate the concessions stand. She's higher on the food
chain than that; she runs the household that the Matadors'
fourth-year coach Bob Braswell repairs to at night.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Braswell wanted to help her husband out, and since she
doesn't have any more college eligibility she did the next best
thing. Monday she corralled a family friend, Yvonne Corcoran, and a
dozen kids and they fanned out to a couple of local grocery stores
to deliver fliers advertising CSUN's game against St. Francis of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell recognized a security guard in the stands as one of the
many people she delivered her recruiting pitch to before losing her
voice. He was among the 936 fans who filed into the Matadome to
watch CSUN defeat St. Francis 88-79.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at it, the evening was a success. The Matadors
improved to 6-3 and the announced crowd was only 185 fewer people
than watched CSUN play in its first two home games, wins over Cal
State Dominguez Hills and Oral Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere felt like a college basketball game,'' Bob
Braswell said. ``It was great to be able to talk in the huddle and
not have everybody in the crowd hear what you're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he encourages his players to do, Braswell acknowledged
the assists doled out by his wife and Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not seem like a Division I team should have to do
something like that,'' Braswell said, alluding to the great paper
chase. ``But it's for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell's players were happy for the band's presence and all
the extra fans, too, if only because the increased noise made it
harder for other ears to hear every blasted thing Braswell was
screaming at them when they goofed.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included the 13-member boys' basketball team from
Palmdale High, alma mater of Matador Markus Carr. It was the second
game of a decidedly different doubleheader for the Falcons, who
arrived fresh off a defeat to Saugus High at a holiday tournament
at Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Indians coach Garry Phelps gave his team a choice and his
players voted unanimously to make the trek from Santa Clarita to
Northridge to check out Carr. Unfortunately, they didn't make it to
the gym in time to see Carr deliver the smoothest pass this side of
The Broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a 6-foot-1 sophomore, appeared to be doing a quick crowd
count when, without peeling his eyes from some point in the
vicinity of the stands he whipped the ball to Hewitt Rolle in the
low post for the Matadors' first points.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Matadors were off and running. At times it was
hard to tell whether CSUN was playing basketball or doing baseline
wind sprints. Nine of their 15 baskets in the first half were
layups or dunks.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis should have said a collective prayer of thanks at
the half for the fact it was down by only six; The Red Flash _ on
this night the nickname seemed better suited for the Matadors _
could have been staring into next year had the Matadors not missed
six layups or dunks.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, posing and preening just a little for the benefit of the
Palmdale contingent, easily would have surpassed his season average
in assists (6.3) in the opening 20 minutes if his shooters received
a little more cooperation from the rim.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 10 assists. Brian Heinle led the Matadors in
scoring with 21 points (he added nine rebounds) and Rolle
contributed 10 rebounds and 12 points in 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were at least as entertaining as Tuesday's ``That
'70s Show'' rerun (they were dressed better, too). That sitcom
didn't attract much attention at first but has since developed a
healthy fan base. So maybe there's hope yet for the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to show the Valley we're a good team,'' Larry
said.
</P>
<P>
   With a home record of 3-0, they're off to a pretty convincing
start.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ LaVar Arrington left little doubt Tuesday night as to
who rules the linebacker roost this season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Arrington and Penn State, which left Texas A&AMP;M in the dust
24-0 before a crowd of 65,380 in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington put pressure on Aggies quarterback Randy McCown early
and late, directly leading to three of the four interceptions
thrown by McCown, tying an Alamo Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
   Five Texas A&AMP;M turnovers led to 10 Penn State points as the
Aggies were shut out in a bowl for the third time in school history
and the first time since losing 20-0 to Southern Cal in the 1975
Liberty Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies finished the season 8-4, but after not being shut out
for 142 games dating to 1988, they were blanked twice in the final
four games of the 1999 season. They lost 37-0 at Nebraska on Nov.
6.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies closed the 1990s with a 94-28-2 record, but their 2-7
bowl record under coach R.C. Slocum since 1989 and a 2-6 mark in
this decade overrides some of that regular-season success.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question if we had won half those bowl games, we would be
seen as a different team than we are,'' said Slocum. ``In all but
one of those games, we were underdogs to pretty good teams, and we
haven't been able to pull off the upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I, the players and the fans are upset about.
We've done some very good things, but this is an area in which we
have not been successful, and it's very disappointing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington was a major force in Tuesday's shutout. He was named
the Defensive Player of the Game with 14 tackles, one sack and a
near-constant presence in the Aggies' backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a little better job tackling in this game than we did
the last three games of the season,'' said Penn State coach Joe
Paterno, whose team finished 10-3 after losing its final three
regular-season games. ``This team was too good to go out with four
straight losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, the winner of the Butkus Award as the nation's top
linebacker, took exception that A&AMP;M called itself Linebacker U. in
the team's media guide and that A&AMP;M linebacker Jason Glenn strongly
backed up that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penn State is Linebacker U. and always will be,'' Arrington
said two days before the game. ``Anybody else who says they are
Linebacker U. is just wannabes.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, a junior who will make a decision soon on whether he
will declare himself eligible for the NFL draft, showed Tuesday he
is the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go home (Pittsburgh) and talk to my parents
tomorrow and then call a press conference shortly,'' said
Arrington, who has nothing left to prove at the collegiate level.
``I'm not totally sold on whether to go pro or play one more year
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, he pressured McCown into a wobbly pass
that was intercepted by David Macklin on the Aggies' first
offensive play.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Arrington twice tipped passes just as McCown
released the ball. The first interception stopped the Aggies' best
drive of the night to the Penn State 13-yard line. In the fourth
quarter, Arrington tipped another McCown pass and strong safety
Derek Fox picked it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got the chance, I would punch his arm when he was
trying to throw the football,'' Arrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Said McCown: ``Even going into the second half (down 14-0) we
thought we'd be all right. But you can't keep turning the ball over
and expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite 70 rushing yards from Ja'Mar Toombs and 41 by D'Andre
Hardeman, the Aggies were never in the game after falling behind
14-0 midway through the second quarter. McCown was 13-of-22 for 105
yards in his final game as an Aggie, and the four interceptions
kept A&AMP;M off the board.
</P>
<P>
   The first four offensive plays by the Aggies were disastrous.
After A&AMP;M forced Penn State to punt on its first possession, McCown
was pressured by Arrington as he rolled left and tried to throw
across his body, which seemed an odd play with which to open the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington blasted McCown as he released the ball, and Macklin
intercepted at the A&AMP;M 40-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies caught a break when Travis Forney missed a 30-yard
field-goal attempt after Penn State took points off the board.
Earlier, Forney hit a 38-yarder, but Chris Taylor of the Aggies was
called for running into the kicker and Penn State took the penalty.
Four plays later, Forney missed.
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to be a turn in momentum favoring the Aggies
dissipated in 90 seconds. After Toombs was stuffed for no gain,
McCown was sacked by Justin Kurpeikis. On third-and-20, McCown
looked for Leroy Hodge but threw into double coverage and was
picked off by Fox at the Aggies' 34.
</P>
<P>
   Fox turned upfield and went into the end zone to put the Nittany
Lions ahead 7-0 with 6:31 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M offense finally got in sync on its next possession. The
Aggies moved to the Penn State 20 before a blocking-below-the-waist
penalty on guard Chris Valletta pushed them back 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Lechler's 44-yard field-goal attempt was wide right. The
Aggies came away empty despite moving the ball 56 yards on 17 plays
and eating up 8:40 off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State then struck quickly to take a two-touchdown lead.
Aggies cornerback Jay Brooks blitzed on third-and-11, but he
overpursued Rashard Casey and allowed the Nittany Lions quarterback
to scramble for 17 yards to the Aggies' 45.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Casey hit speedster Eddie Drummond, who easily
beat Aggies cornerback Sedrick Curry and streaked into the end zone
untouched. With just under nine minutes left in the second quarter,
the Aggies were behind 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies trailed by that score to start the second half. They
moved the ball smartly on their first drive, using Toombs and
Hardeman up the middle for 50 yards on nine carries. The Aggies
seemed on the verge of getting back into the game, but Arrington
had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-seven from the Penn State 14, Arrington rushed
McCown and tipped the pass. Nittany Lions linebacker Ron Graham
came up with the interception at the Penn State 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question that was a big series,'' said Slocum. ``To go down
the field and come up short and have the interception we had the
momentum going, had a chance to make it 14-7 and make it a
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Aggies never again threatened to get back in the
game. Penn State scored 10 quick points in the fourth quarter,
getting a four-yard touchdown run by Casey and a 39-yard field goal
by Forney 73 seconds later after Bethel Johnson fumbled the kickoff
return at the Aggies' 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know our fans would like to win more of our bowl games,''
said Slocum. ``So would I.''

Unimaginative Aggies prove usual postseason selves
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By John P. Lopez &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ The Texas A&AMP;M offense, keeper of tradition that it
is, apparently couldn't bear to usher in the 21st century without a
nostalgic look back at what carried this storied program through
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it the 19th century?
</P>
<P>
   On this night it was next to impossible to distinguish the
difference between the Aggies on the cusp of a new millennium and
the Aggies back in the days of foldaway leather helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be too hard on the good ol' Ags _ Penn State was hard
enough in a 24-0 whitewashing at Tuesday's Alamo Bowl _ but
creativity must be a four-letter word in Aggieland. Either that or
an elective.
</P>
<P>
   The script of A&AMP;M plays looked as if it was written on the back
of a napkin _ ``Run, run, play-action.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno had more swing than the
Aggies' offensive attack, giddily leading fans in cheers at the
postgame award ceremony. Apparently, JoePa did not realize that
beating the Aggies in a bowl is not all that momentous an
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question if we would have won half those bowl games that we
lost we would be seen a lot differently than what we are,'' said
A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, whose bowl record dropped to 2-7. ``It's an
area in which we haven't been very successful, and it's very
disappointing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Helpful hint for the new-millennium Ags: Score points.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Alamodome been a discotheque Tuesday night, the final
score might have been Mambo No. 5, Aggies 0.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M plan was about as electric as Penn State's uniforms. And
if you were looking for execution, all you got was a lethal
injection of Lions linebackers LaVar Arrington and Brandon Short.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another opportunity lost against a quality bowl
opponent, the Aggies hoping to finish 1999 with a bang only to
realize how difficult a task that is to accomplish with a pop-gun
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M offense managed just 202 total yards _ 77 in the first
half, when the Lions took a 14-0 lead _ and had just one play gain
more than 14 yards all night.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, things rarely are as bad as they appear, and in the
Aggies' case that's probably true even amid this whipping.
</P>
<P>
   Monstrous tailback Ja'Mar Toombs (19 carries, 70 yards) had his
moments, and a couple of A&AMP;M drives gobbled up 50 or so yards and
even took on the appearance of being somewhat threatening.
</P>
<P>
   But against a team of Penn State's defensive prowess, that's a
mere blip on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when your quarterback known for his lion's heart,
Randy McCown, is purring through one of those forgettable games he
is wont to have. The upset the Aggies craved never was going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   All night, Penn State made the field as long as the odds of the
Aggies winning.
</P>
<P>
   No A&AMP;M drive began beyond the Aggies' 30-yard line, and McCown
threw a pair of interceptions on his first four snaps from
scrimmage, one for a Lions touchdown. He tossed four picks
altogether and went just 13-for-22 passing, with a fourth-quarter
22-yarder to roommate Matt Bumgardner his longest play from
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to throw it all on McCown's shoulders _ he certainly
wasn't helped by the predictable play-calling. And you always hate
to see coaches yank out a senior who directed his team to one of
its most memorable wins in his last outing against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But it was obvious from the start that McCown was the least
feared A&AMP;M weapon on the mind of retiring Lions defensive
coordinator Jerry Sandusky.
</P>
<P>
   Sandusky decided the only way McCown would beat his staid and
true Lions defense would be if McCown made huge improvisational
plays along the lines of what Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey
did.
</P>
<P>
   McCown didn't. As it was all season, the Aggies had to live and
die with McCown's heart and determination leading the way, hoping
his abilities would rise to the level of his grit.
</P>
<P>
   But as was the case all year, every time it seemed the A&AMP;M
offense might turn the corner under McCown's hand, reality and a
truly good defense slapped it back in his face.
</P>
<P>
   This was nothing like McCown's performance in the win over
Texas, his steady hand on the way to a 3-0 start and No. 5 ranking
to open the year, or his nice game in a 51-point outburst against
hapless Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   This was more reminiscent of Texas Tech 21, A&AMP;M 19 as Penn State
stuffed the middle of the A&AMP;M ground attack and limited the Aggies
to 2.1 yards per carry, daring McCown to throw.
</P>
<P>
   This was more reminiscent of Nebraska 37, A&AMP;M 0 as the Aggies'
defense held on admirably for half the game but ultimately crumbled
because of no help on the other side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season began, the Aggies had not been shut out since
1988, a streak of 142 games without the goose egg. But Tuesday's
Penn State onslaught marked the second shutout of the Aggies this
season, a dubious distinction not handed any A&AMP;M team in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, nostalgia.

UCLA SURVIVES AGAINST PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looked good in person, and it looked good on
tape. But officially, Pepperdine guard Craig Lewis' game-tying shot
was a split-second late, and no matter how much the Waves ranted,
no matter how much they raved, it wasn't going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as (Lewis) released the ball, I looked at the red
light,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``When he let
it go, the red light had not gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won a game it probably shouldn't have Tuesday night at
Pauley Pavilion, escaping with a controversial 68-66 victory before
8,244 fans despite its lethargic, sloppy play.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, the Bruins (7-2) rebounded poorly,
defended poorly and took a season's worth of bad shots. But they
had enough fuel in the final minutes to rally from an eight-point
deficit and collect their 12th consecutive victory over Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when clearer heads prevail, I'll probably see (Lewis'
shot) was before the buzzer,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``I'll think how fortunate that we don't have (instant replay),
like in the NFL... or we'd probably be in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   The final sequence began with 1:02 remaining, when Lewis made
one of two free throws to give the Waves a 66-65 lead. UCLA went to
forward Jerome Moiso, who hit a short bank shot and one free throw
to give the Bruins a 68-66 lead with 23 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves had two chances, but Brandon Armstrong missed a
3-pointer from the left wing and David Lalazarian missed a jumper
from the right corner. Lalazarian's shot caromed to the left side,
where Lewis plucked it from midair and banked it home _ before the
red light flashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked good, and it felt good,'' Lewis said. ``I thought I
got it off in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee Andy Rios, standing in front of the Waves' bench, meekly
held up two fingers. However, referee Ruben Ramos, stationed at
midcourt, waved it off. Lalazarian chased the officials off as they
bolted off the court, and Pepperdine (8-4) was left to ponder an
overtime that wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't look back,'' said van Breda Kolff, whose team plays
at Pacific on Thursday. ``We've got to get on the bus and go home.
Today is yesterday's news.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bruins, Tuesday was more of the same. They lacked
passion for 28 minutes. They took bad shots. They played
inconsistent, undisciplined defense, and their rebounding was poor,
especially in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us to the punch on the boards, and they were sharper
and crisper at both ends of the court,'' Lavin said. ``They
completely had their way with us in the first 20 minutes. But I
thought our players did a great job finding a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso led the Bruins with 15 points, while Jason Kapono had 13
points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tezale Archie led a balanced Pepperdine attack, but the Waves
shot just 35.9 percent from the field and missed back-to-back
layups midway through the second half when UCLA was struggling to
keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we didn't play very well,'' van Breda Kolff said.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what it's come to for the Bruins: Pepperdine doesn't
play well, yet the Waves are a blown call away from overtime in
Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Rush update:!off! Barring a last-minute development,
UCLA's portion of the JaRon Rush investigation is expected to
conclude in two or three weeks. At that point, the school will
forward its findings to the Pac-10 and the NCAA, then await a
verdict by the NCAA. That could take a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA appeals _ a distinct possibility, since Missouri
appealed the NCAA's 13-game suspension of Rush's brother, Kareem _
the situation probably won't be resolved for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush was suspended for taking several hundred dollars in
cash and merchandise from former AAU coach Myron Piggie. Because
Rush's financial ties to Piggie are deeper, sources said, his
punishment could be more severe than 13 games.

WELCOME TO ROLLERBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
(Fifth of a five-part series on Tomorrowland in sports) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the 21st Century. Welcome to Rollerball.
</P>
<P>
   You probably didn't read the short story, nicely written by
William Harrison, but you may remember the intriguing and often
absorbing film by Norman Jewison, which starred James Caan.
</P>
<P>
   The story was a treatise on the future of sports and the loss of
self in a future society. Six corporations ran the world, and the
violent game of Rollerball -- mayhem on a skaters oval, with bikes
and spiked gloves chasing a silver ball shot out of a cannon -- was
crack for the masses. The star athletes, like Jonathan E, wore the
crown of celebrity, but they had little control over anything.
Especially not the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Harrison: ``The game, the game: here we go again. All
glory to it, all things I am and own because of Rollerball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team stands in a row, 20 of us in salute as the
corporation hymn is played ... 80,000 sit watching in the stands
and another two billion viewers around the world inspect the the
set of our jaws on (television).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Jonathan E ... I'm the core of the Houston team and for
the two hours of play -- no rules, no penalties -- I'll level any
b------.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing anyone needs as the time odometer makes the
biggest flip of our lives is another apocalyptic notion. The year
2000 already has too many doom-touting absurdists running amok, as
if any real power in the cosmos would be so precise (or cliched) as
to end things on 1-1-2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the theme in Rollerball is central to a phase in sports that
is sprinting with great momentum into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Like most every aspect of our modern, capitalistic culture, the
games are now owned and operated by corporate types who gain wealth
from our base attraction to the games. Once upon a time, there were
sportsmen around, but the Dan Rooney, Bill Veeck and Peter O'Malley
types are now gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's media heavyweights like Fox, Disney and Time-Warner,
who control the teams and the airwaves. It's the NFL as one
all-powerful unit. It's the Olympic Games, now serving as the
largest, most corrupt sports clearing house ever.
</P>
<P>
   The power they wield is tremendous. The huge throngs in the
stadiums, the rapt attention of the TV audience, the billions and
billions of commerce dollars ... the NFL motto du jour, ``Feel the
Power,'' has never been more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, and because the selling of this product is the
be-all and end-all, the sports consumer is becoming very
desensitized toward sports. We have come to accept the bizarre and
uncouth as part of the package, like the latest catfight of
Springer, without consider how debasing it may be for the product
and consumer, not to mention long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   There may be voices in the wilderness with a moral thought to
convey, but they are too faint to hear in the din of sports beating
its chest.
</P>
<P>
   Again, from Harrison's short story:
</P>
<P>
   ``The giant lighted (score)boards circling the track monitor our
pace, record each separate fact of the slaughter, and we have
millions of fans who never look directly at the action, but study
those statistics. A (television) survey established this.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes only a few minutes to put together a list of examples
of our desensitized sports culture.
</P>
<P>
   One day Latrell Sprewell chokes his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, the
next he is getting cheered in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Browns' Orlando Brown premeditatedly pushes a
referee to the ground after an unfortunate accident.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's Bill Romanowsk, when he's not spitting at people, has
made the helmet-on-helmet hit a personal trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Raider crowds continue to behave poorly. There were more than 30
incidents at the Raiders-Chargers game in San Diego Sunday. As
sports consultant David Carter recently noted, ``When the Raiders
began selling club seats, their fans thought that meant they each
got a club.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Philadelphia cheer when Michael Irvin is strapped on a
gurney with a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Carruth allegedly kills the woman carrying his baby.
</P>
<P>
   Reprobate Lawrence Phillips keeps getting chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson bites the ears of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That opponent, Evander Holyfield, has spread his seed all over
America.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali's daughter has taken up boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Morrison wants to fight despite having HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar spits in the face of an umpire who cursed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, the poster child for punk athletes, openly tells
employers he'll make trouble if he doesn't play.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes at Arizona State and Northwestern shave points.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush can't play because he took a few Franklins from a
dirty agent, but the NCAA can cash a $6.2 billion check for TV
rights to his games.
</P>
<P>
   A team forfeits its Little League World Series crown because it
used players old enough to shave.
</P>
<P>
   Age-group coaches sexually prey on teens and pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   Kids barely in their teens join professional tours, where they
are introduced to pressures a 30-year-old might find difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Smith crashes after jumping from high school to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Marv Albert is convicted of assault one day, returns a few years
later to crack wise with David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the top four athletes on ESPN's all-time Top 100 list
included Michael Jordan, who may have had a gambling problem; Babe
Ruth, who wasn't discreet when it came to alcohol or women; and Jim
Brown, who has been accused several times of sexual battery.
</P>
<P>
   This desensitization is nowhere more evident than on Monday
nights. Two separate high-testosterone wrestling shows compete on
cable and, combined, draw almost as many viewers as the Monday
Night Football game on ABC. The WWF on USA Network averages a 6.1,
and the WCW on Turner a 3.7, and their key demo is men 12-34.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, the WWF shows are a hoot. The wrestlers overact
sensationally, the scripts exude faux drama, and they are to be
commended for the physical nature of their act.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not part of the core audience. The core audience is made
up of teens who may not make the distinction between the camp
staging and the images being sold. Like the Hannibal-like mask on
Mankind's face, or the mannequin's head Al Snow carries with him,
or the cross-dressing tag-team, or the beer can Steve Austin
crushes on his skull, or the sexually-suggestive hand movements of
some wrestlers, or the T-and-A elements of the show.
</P>
<P>
   In Rollerball, a former coach tries to serve as the moral
compass for Jonathan E, even though he knows things are way out of
his control. ``Sometimes on that committee,'' he says, ``I feel
like I'm the last moral man on earth, sitting there and insisting
there should be a few rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In the climactic last game in the film, the oval is strewn with
dead bodies and burning motorcycles. The concept of winning and
scoring is second to the violence, which is the product, of course,
and always has been.
</P>
<P>
   The last man standing is Jonathan E, having KO'd a biker and the
last skater. But rather than take a final killshot on the skull of
the opponent, he walks away, finds the ball, and stuffs it in the
goal. His final truth is realizing all he has is the game.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to think, hope, we'll have more choices.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cautiously optimistic in the third millennium
 &HT;    (Eds: This column, which normally moves on Thursdays, is moving
a day early to accommodate early holiday deadlines.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In marked and disturbing contrast to our forebears at the turn
of the last century, we are entering the 21st century and third
millennium vaguely ill at ease, if not downright anxious.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there were naysayers the last time around, too. (And
doomsayers a thousand years ago among the few who had a rough idea
what time it was when the first common-era millennium clicked over
into the second.) But in the main, 1900 found the breathing room
that a broad optimism allows. The '90s were gay. Mightn't the '20s
be roaring?
</P>
<P>
   Science, newly productive, was beginning to deliver the goods,
and an enchanted population could imagine increasing wonders coming
into their personal and corporate lives like marvelous surprise
presents from a benevolent relative. If a growing comity could not
be assured _ human nature remained stubbornly human _ surely some
good times impended.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, horrors did, too. The starvation and mass murder
of Armenians that accompanied the fall of the Ottoman empire. The
grinding, insane trench warfare of The Great War. The Holocaust and
racist war of Nazism. The mass deaths by which Soviet and Chinese
communism enslaved two peoples to a political abstraction. The
Khmer Rouge's murder of the Cambodian people. Lately, like the
three dots of an ellipsis leading from one century to the next,
Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   How, given the experience of this century, could we possibly
delight at the prospect of the next?
</P>
<P>
   Not easily, to be sure, but cautiously after all. For an
evolving international consensus leans against predatory politics
and punishes war criminals as no previous time did. With
dislocations and pain, the world is drawing together into networks
of commercial and cultural trade that bind us into common
interests. There is in all that as much potential for resolution as
for conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century brought marvels near unto miracles in medicine,
and a momentum that promises more soon. We went to the moon, for
goodness sakes, and watched Earthrise, and we are building _
building! _ in near space. We began to catch on to the obligations
that come with our stewardship of the planet. We peered deeply into
time, perhaps even glimpsing the creation. Science lived up to the
hopes for it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is human nature a lost cause. The Russians threw off
communism; the Chinese may be wiggling loose of it. Democracy
continues to fascinate even where it has not settled. In much of
the world, in a truly epochal turn, women strode out from under an
ancient pall. We study on how to bring food where hunger lingers,
health to illness, ease to want. We have given up fatalism.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, it is a less giddy humanity that carries in the new
century, the new millennium, but it is not a hopeless humanity. The
20th did leave the 21st century one abiding example of humankind's
ability to pull its worst impulses up short. We invented the means
to destroy all life and used it only once _ and then to stop a war,
not to wage one.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your fingers crossed.

<P>
   If you want to celebrate the arrival of the millennium hour by
hour _ or track the effects of the Y2K computer bug _ here's what
to watch for around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY, DEC. 31
</P>
<P>
   5 a.m. (EST) _ The Year 2000 arrives at the international date
line, the imaginary marker running north and south through the
Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii. A celebration will be held at
Millennium Island in the Republic of Kiribati, the first bit of
land north of Antarctica that will see the sun rise in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. _ Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, becomes the
world's first metropolitan area to welcome 2000. Computer experts
will be watching closely to see whether the Y2K bug triggers
software failures in this industrialized nation. Midnight will be
marked with a synchronized fireworks display, accompanied by fire
dancers and Pacific island drummers.
</P>
<P>
   7 a.m. _ Midnight passes the mostly empty Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   8 a.m. _ Sydney, Australia, enters 2000 by staging what it calls
the world's biggest fireworks show. The display above the city's
harbor will be linked to the 2000 Olympics, to be hosted by the
city.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m. _ The United States gets its first taste of 2000 when
Guam, a U.S. territory, rolls over into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m. _ As Tokyo moves into 2000, Y2K worries abound. Business
and political leaders insist that critical software has been fixed,
but many computer experts believe Japan got too late of a start to
conquer the problem. Small- and medium-sized businesses are
considered particularly vulnerable to Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fears of terrorism are growing. In the past week,
two homemade bombs have exploded at rail stations. More than
106,000 police officers will be on duty amid tightened security.
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. _ Beijing hasn't shown much interest in celebrating
2000. Computer experts also fear it has shown too little interest
in preparing computers for the date rollover. The government's
secretiveness makes it difficult to assess Y2K readiness in
critical sectors, such as banking and aviation. Global
manufacturers are waiting to see whether suppliers in China have
fixed computers well enough to avoid factory shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Noon _ The Y2K bug will roll over into several heavily populated
cities, such as Jakarta and Bangkok. The recovering economies in
many Southeast Asian nations could be seriously damaged by computer
breakdowns. Y2K experts say risks are high because so many
manufacturers in this part of the world use pirated software that
could be filled with bugs.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. _ Dhaka, the capital of poverty-plagued Bangladesh, is
not heavily computer-dependent, but Y2K experts say its power
generation system is vulnerable to software bugs.
</P>
<P>
   2 p.m. _ Residents of New Delhi, India, plan to stage carnivals
in the hours leading to up to a midnight fireworks display. In
recent months, India appears to have made big strides in preparing
its computers for the date rollover. No big problems are expected.
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m. _ Oil companies will be watching as the new year reaches
the United Arab Emirates. This oil-exporting country appears to be
well prepared to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m. _ When midnight arrives in Moscow, many fear
computer-related failures in vital services, such as heat and light
generation. The State Department is so concerned about Y2K flaws in
the power grid that it authorized the voluntary departure of
employees and family members at the U.S. Embassy, and urged
Americans to avoid traveling to Moscow. Many fear Russia also will
be plagued by transportation and telecommunication disruptions. In
worst-case scenarios, aging nuclear power plants shut down or
become unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   5 p.m. _ Perhaps the scariest moment on the New Year's Eve
clock. This is the hour when midnight comes to Israel, which will
be teeming with religious pilgrims celebrating the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem. The Palestinian
Authority, which controls Bethlehem, is planning a music festival,
but many fear that Christian fanatics may cause violence in the
hopes of triggering the Apocalypse. Arab terrorists also may be
planning attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In this same hour, midnight will be reaching the Pyramids at
Giza on the outskirts of Cairo in Egypt, where large crowds of
tourists might make attractive targets for terrorists. Y2K experts
say Egyptian hospitals and hotels may experience numerous equipment
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, midnight also will come to Eastern Europe, where a
swarm of Y2K bugs could get unleashed. The State Department has
issued travel warnings for Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus because of
the high risk of prolonged disruptions in heat and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. _ Another dicey hour. In Rome, a half-million people are
expected to accept Pope John Paul II's invitation to celebrate the
beginning of the 3rd millennium of Christianity. The gathering may
be seen by terrorists as a juicy target. Also, Italy is widely
regarded as being among the West's worst-prepared countries for
fending off Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the Eiffel Tower will burst into a massive, pulsating
show of light flashes. A fireworks display will follow. Then the
action shifts to the Champs Elysees, where 23 large Ferris wheels
will turn.
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. _ The aviation world will be paying close attention to
this hour, which marks midnight in Greenwich, England. Because
aviation operates worldwide on Greenwich Mean Time, this could be
the moment when Y2K bugs turn up in air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich is the site of a huge Millennium Dome, built to call
attention to the borough's status as home to the prime meridian, or
0 degrees longitude. The Dome will be inaugurated on New Year's Eve
by Queen Elizabeth II. Large screens in the Dome will show the
ringing of the Big Ben chimes in London at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. _ The midnight hour passes over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. _ The new year arrives in this hemisphere in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. Celebrations will be centered around the city's
Ipanema and Copacabana beaches, with musical events, fireworks
displays and samba. But amid the partying, computer experts will be
worrying; Brazil is widely seen as being at high risk for
Y2K-related problems, especially in private industry, which uses a
lot of pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   10 p.m. _ Chile rolls over into 2000 amid praise for its efforts
to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m. _ Venezuela enters 2000 in poor shape. Because of recent
floods and political turmoil, the country already is in virtual
chaos. To add to that misery, computers are at high risk, say Y2K
experts. Breakdowns may be likely in power grids, telephones,
customs services, air traffic control, ports and the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY, JAN. 1
</P>
<P>
   Midnight _ New York plans to hold its largest-ever New Year's
Eve party in Times Square. City officials expect as many as 2
million revelers, about four times the norm.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the nation's monuments and the White House will
become stages or backdrops for events that will culminate with a
massive fireworks display at midnight. Unfortunately, some
terrorism experts believe that both New York and Washington could
be targeted for violence.
</P>
<P>
   1 a.m. _ Navy Pier on Lake Michigan and the Chicago River will
become the backdrop for the Windy City's laser and firework
displays.
</P>
<P>
   2 a.m. Denver is keeping a very low profile. For the first time
in 11 years, the city has canceled its family-oriented First Night
celebration and has planned no public events.
</P>
<P>
   3 a.m. _ Las Vegas will rock. Officials estimate a million
people will crowd the Vegas Strip for the party, which includes a
light show on Fremont Street and countdown clocks on several
hotels. Big events for high rollers will be staged indoors.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and San Francisco, most public events have been
canceled because of lack of interest. But police are worried that
rowdy street parties may break out.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the mayor canceled his city's millennial event at
the famed Space Needle because of fears of a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   4 a.m. _ The new year will be welcomed into the Anchorage,
Alaska, area with a midnight fireworks display over Alyeska Ski
Resort, following a torchlight parade.
</P>
<P>
   5 a.m. _ Hawaii, the last state to enter 2000, will stage a
smattering of New Year's events, including midnight fireworks
displays and festivals on many islands.

<P>
   &UR; BULLET WITH A NAME ON IT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many robberies and homicides go unsolved because there is no way
to trace a bullet found at the crime scene back to a specific gun
and, ultimately, to the person who fired it. So Todd Lizotte, head
of development at NanoVia, has devised a technology to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte, a handgun enthusiast, spent years working with lasers
to shape machine parts. Then he realized that the same process
could enable a gun to emboss bullet casings with a unique symbol.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, he laser-etched a half-millimeter-wide pattern into
the tip of a gun's firing pin. When the gun is fired, the pin slams
into the casing of a bullet, leaving a tiny stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mark could indicate a gun's serial number, which is
already recorded when someone buys it. Casings left behind at a
crime scene would thus contain a signature of the gun from which
they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ballistics experts can match casings with their guns
only if the weapon has been recovered. A serial number, in
contrast, would provide an instant ID.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte is getting feedback from law-enforcement personnel and
</P>
<P>
   from a committee at the United Nations, which is looking for
ways to track arms from peacekeeping missions that find their way
onto the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmakers, however, are reluctant to embrace an idea that makes
gun ownership less private.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company wants to be the first,'' Lizotte says. ``I plan to
approach politicians about introducing tax breaks to manufacturers
who implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: CLAWBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bridge inspectors will be able to abandon their precarious ropes
and scaffolding when they work with ROMA.
</P>
<P>
   This climbing robot, built by Carlos Balaguer, Mohamed
Abderrahim and their fellow engineers at the Carlos III University
of Madrid, nimbly navigates steel I-beams on bridges and sends back
video to a human sitting safely on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA has two arms with pincerlike grippers. The robot can turn
</P>
<P>
   corners by pivoting its whole body on its wrist, or flip one arm
up sideways to grab a column and clamber upward.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in map of the structure, along with laser and camera
sensors, makes sure every step is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of ROMA will be able to automatically find and
report cracks or corrosion, and stay on the bridge for long periods
of time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CHAMPION OF CHIMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between chimps and humans is looking blurry these days.
First we thought that only humans use tools. Then we learned that
chimps do too.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, primatologists found that chimps, like humans,
have distinctive cultural habits that vary from group to group.

<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the significance of the discovery of chimp culture?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There's a long tradition in Western thought that humans are
not shackled by biology, whereas animals are pure instinct
machines. The chimpanzee story is telling us that animals may be a
lot closer to us in this regard than we think.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  So what does separate us from chimps or other animals?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Chimps don't have language. Humans actively instruct others
about how things should be done. Chimpanzees probably pick up
cultural traditions by observation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Can chimpanzees create art?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are beautiful examples of art done by chimpanzees in
human care. Chimps also have a rain dance: They react to thunderous
noises of rainfall by swaying around rhythmically, their hair
standing on end. Some people have called this dance a superstition,
in that the animals may think that they can stop the rain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Are we doing enough to protect wild chimpanzees?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The conservation situation is the worst it's been in a long
time. In Borneo there have been big fires; in Uganda there are
rebels who threaten chimp researchers. In Africa the biggest threat
of all is the bush meat trade. People are shooting apes, snaring
them, hacking them to death and eating them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Would you want to live in a chimp society?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd prefer to live with humans. I think humans are marvels
of conflict resolution and cooperation. Look at New York City,
which has more than 7 million people living crowded together. I
don't think you could put 7 million chimpanzees in a city and have
anything decent going on.

<P>
   Although Mars hogs a lot of headlines, scientists have been
building a case that Saturn's giant moon Titan is covered with
oceans of organic chemicals, evidence of complex chemistry similar
to what occurred on the young Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's atmosphere and dense smog have kept scientists guessing
about what is going on below. Astrophysicist Claire Max of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory recently used the giant Keck I
telescope in Hawaii to examine Titan in infrared light, which can
pierce the global haze.

<P>
   She and her colleagues then took a series of high-speed
snapshots to freeze the blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence,

Titan seemingly divided into bright continents and dark oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's seas probably consist of methane or ethane mixed with
more complex organic molecules-liquid natural gas combined with
tar, basically.

<P>
   The Cassini spacecraft, now bound for Saturn, will drop a probe
through Titan's clouds in 2004 for a firsthand look. Meanwhile, Max
plans to use the Keck telescope to make a crude map of Titan's
composition.

<P>
   &UR; BULLET WITH A NAME ON IT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many robberies and homicides go unsolved because there is no way
to trace a bullet found at the crime scene back to a specific gun
and, ultimately, to the person who fired it. So Todd Lizotte, head
of development at NanoVia, has devised a technology to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte, a handgun enthusiast, spent years working with lasers
to shape machine parts. Then he realized that the same process
could enable a gun to emboss bullet casings with a unique symbol.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, he laser-etched a half-millimeter-wide pattern into
the tip of a gun's firing pin. When the gun is fired, the pin slams
into the casing of a bullet, leaving a tiny stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mark could indicate a gun's serial number, which is
already recorded when someone buys it. Casings left behind at a
crime scene would thus contain a signature of the gun from which
they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ballistics experts can match casings with their guns
only if the weapon has been recovered. A serial number, in
contrast, would provide an instant ID.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte is getting feedback from law-enforcement personnel and
</P>
<P>
   from a committee at the United Nations, which is looking for
ways to track arms from peacekeeping missions that find their way
onto the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmakers, however, are reluctant to embrace an idea that makes
gun ownership less private.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company wants to be the first,'' Lizotte says. ``I plan to
approach politicians about introducing tax breaks to manufacturers
who implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: CLAWBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bridge inspectors will be able to abandon their precarious ropes
and scaffolding when they work with ROMA.
</P>
<P>
   This climbing robot, built by Carlos Balaguer, Mohamed
Abderrahim and their fellow engineers at the Carlos III University
of Madrid, nimbly navigates steel I-beams on bridges and sends back
video to a human sitting safely on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA has two arms with pincerlike grippers. The robot can turn
</P>
<P>
   corners by pivoting its whole body on its wrist, or flip one arm
up sideways to grab a column and clamber upward.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in map of the structure, along with laser and camera
sensors, makes sure every step is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of ROMA will be able to automatically find and
report cracks or corrosion, and stay on the bridge for long periods
of time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CHAMPION OF CHIMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between chimps and humans is looking blurry these days.
First we thought that only humans use tools. Then we learned that
chimps do too.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, primatologists found that chimps, like humans,
have distinctive cultural habits that vary from group to group.
</P>
<P>
   Frans de Waal has spent years studying the complexities of chimp
behavior as director of Yerkes' Living Links Center at Emory
</P>
<P>
   University in Atlanta.

<P>
   Not many ships venture into the Drake Passage, 500 miles of
water between the fjords of southern Chile and the tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing but icy-cold ocean. Here, a ship can expect to
run into waves that are sometimes five stories high. Sailing crews
consider these the most treacherous seas on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, near-hurricane force winds slam growing swells
into the research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer. Scientists below deck
scurry to lash down computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Off the starboard side, hulking waves line up to take a swing at
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of science justifies the risk of men and women swept
overboard and a $50 million ship lost at sea?
</P>
<P>
   In short, the future of our planet.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of this trip: to gather clues about global
warming. The more immediate goal concerns a regional warming trend
in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly what this trend means for the rest of the
world, but the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula is warming
up faster than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of climate records from just a half-century ago show
that temperatures here have risen, on average, 2.5 to 3 degrees
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it to happen this fast,'' says glaciologist
Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Although most scientists agree that global warming is upon us,
no one yet knows how much of it _ if any _ could be due to a
recurring natural temperature cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the ancient past. To find it, one must look
at what was happening with temperatures thousands of years ago. One
way to do that is to study long-buried, centuries-old marine
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   And so a team of marine sediment experts has set up shop on the
Nathaniel B. Palmer, which is sponsored by the National Science
Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. They hope to sink great
hollow cores deep into the ocean off Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   We have arrived at the mouth of the Muller Ice Shelf, near
Lallemand Fjord.
</P>
<P>
   For those who picture Antarctica as a monotony of whites and
grays, Lallemand Fjord is an awakening. The icebergs crowding the
ship this morning are infused with a paint store panoply of blues _
the bright, blaring blues of mouthwashes and toilet-bowl cleaners.
Everyone is out on deck, looking at the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them are thinking nice thoughts about it. One of the
detractors is Gene Domack, a sedimentologist from Hamilton College
in Clinton, N.Y. He and graduate student Asa Chong left a series of
ocean sediment traps moored in the water here last year, to be
recovered this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to study the advance and retreat of ice
shelves over the millennia, you need to be able to recognize the
unique sediment profile of an ice edge. A more detailed familiarity
with one year's worth of sediment (generally about 7 to 12 inches)
also helps scientists interpret the timetable of the longer cores.
</P>
<P>
   Domack withdraws the sample from trap Number 4. ``Look at those
varves!'' marvels a graduate student, admiring the seasonal layers.
Together, these bands are the fingerprint of a calendar year at the
ice's edge.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later the Natbaniel B. Palmer reaches Paradise
Harbor. Out on deck lie the remains of last night's jumbo Piston
Core: a 10-foot length of pipe, bowed like an elephant's tusk. When
it went over the side of the ship, it was straight. Apparently it
hit a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   While the crew heads to shore for a brief excursion, Domack
alone remains on board, poring over a sonar map of our next
destination. The map helps him decide precisely where to sink the
core.
</P>
<P>
   Domack points to a light-blue area the size of an almond on one
of last week's maps: ``What we're looking for is small pockets like
this one.'' Such sites lie deeper than most of the area's sea
shelf, putting them out of reach of the dragging bellies of
icebergs, where they remain undisturbed for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   What Domack wants is a clean sample, and to get that, he needs
to pull up sediment that reflects only what's dropped down from the
water column directly overhead. Augmenting the SeaBearn map is a
readout that gives a cross section of the sediment layers below the
seafloor. Domack points to a half-inch band of pronounced striping
on the readout: our target.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, we've reached Gerlache Strait and closed in on
the spot. Tonight is the last chance for Domack and Amy Leventer, a
Colgate University marine geologist, to attempt an 80-foot core
sample. Tomorrow we head back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With the pipe segments coupled at last, it's time to slide in
the plastic liner segments. If all goes as planned, these will
emerge crammed with grade-A Antarctic mud.
</P>
<P>
   The first two go in easily. By the eighth section, the combined
weights of the seven liners already in place have three of the men
heaving en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the far end of the deck, the crew hauls in a
12-foot kasten core. Since the impact of a jumbo Piston Core blasts
apart the top few feet of mud, a smaller core is sent down to bring
up an undisturbed first few feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kasten core is also a dress rehearsal: If it comes up full
of mud, it's all systems go.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the kasten core emerges from the sea with water
streaming from a pair of small holes in its sides: a bad sign. The
group gathers round as the core is opened; a pathetic green lump of
mud drops to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leventer looks on, more exhausted than upset. She's been up for
19 of the past 24 hours. ``We don't have time to do another kasten
core,'' she says. ``The weather's getting really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She signals the deck crew to go ahead with the Jumbo Piston
Core. ``If we lose it, we lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crane lifts the pipe from the railing, and the crew pushes it
out far enough to clear the ship. With one pull of a quick release,
the pipe swings down into the sea. Then it's lowered by winch and
cable more than 2,000 feet. About 10 feet from the seafloor, a
trigger core hits bottom and releases the main core, which drops
the remainder of the way by gravity and buries itself in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   For the pullout, the action moves to the Aft Control Winch Room,
a window-lined office above the deck. A video monitor displays the
stress being put on the winch cable _ 13,000 pounds and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, the head of the core pops up over the side of
the deck. It's coated in green slime. Smiles appear. The core, says
Domack, is the longest ever recovered from the Antarctic
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll be able to understand how rapidly these climate
transitions took place,'' says Domack, ``and what processes were
involved in making that environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Domack is gone, back inside to his data logs which may one
day save this big Earth.

the plastic liner segments. If all goes as planned, these will
emerge crammed with grade-A Antarctic mud.
</P>
<P>
   The first two go in easily. By the eighth section, the combined
weights of the seven liners already in place have three of the men
heaving en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the far end of the deck, the crew hauls in a
12-foot kasten core. Since the impact of a jumbo Piston Core blasts
apart the top few feet of mud, a smaller core is sent down to bring
up an undisturbed first few feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kasten core is also a dress rehearsal: If it comes up full
of mud, it's all systems go.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the kasten core emerges from the sea with water
streaming from a pair of small holes in its sides: a bad sign. The
group gathers round as the core is opened; a pathetic green lump of
mud drops to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leventer looks on, more exhausted than upset. She's been up for
19 of the past 24 hours. ``We don't have time to do another kasten
core,'' she says. ``The weather's getting really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She signals the deck crew to go ahead with the Jumbo Piston
Core. ``If we lose it, we lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crane lifts the pipe from the railing, and the crew pushes it
out far enough to clear the ship. With one pull of a quick release,
the pipe swings down into the sea. Then it's lowered by winch and
cable more than 2,000 feet. About 10 feet from the seafloor, a
trigger core hits bottom and releases the main core, which drops
the remainder of the way by gravity and buries itself in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   For the pullout, the action moves to the Aft Control Winch Room,
a window-lined office above the deck. A video monitor displays the
stress being put on the winch cable _ 13,000 pounds and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, the head of the core pops up over the side of
the deck. It's coated in green slime. Smiles appear. The core, says
Domack, is the longest ever recovered from the Antarctic
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll be able to understand how rapidly these climate
transitions took place,'' says Domack, ``and what processes were
involved in making that environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Domack is gone, back inside to his data logs which may one
day save this big Earth.

   &UR; BULLET WITH A NAME ON IT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many robberies and homicides go unsolved because there is no way
to trace a bullet found at the crime scene back to a specific gun
and, ultimately, to the person who fired it. So Todd Lizotte, head
of development at NanoVia, has devised a technology to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte, a handgun enthusiast, spent years working with lasers
to shape machine parts. Then he realized that the same process
could enable a gun to emboss bullet casings with a unique symbol.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, he laser-etched a half-millimeter-wide pattern into
the tip of a gun's firing pin. When the gun is fired, the pin slams
into the casing of a bullet, leaving a tiny stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mark could indicate a gun's serial number, which is
already recorded when someone buys it. Casings left behind at a
crime scene would thus contain a signature of the gun from which
they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ballistics experts can match casings with their guns
only if the weapon has been recovered. A serial number, in
contrast, would provide an instant ID.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte is getting feedback from law-enforcement personnel and
</P>
<P>
   from a committee at the United Nations, which is looking for
ways to track arms from peacekeeping missions that find their way
onto the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmakers, however, are reluctant to embrace an idea that makes
gun ownership less private.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company wants to be the first,'' Lizotte says. ``I plan to
approach politicians about introducing tax breaks to manufacturers
who implement it.''
</P>

   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: CLAWBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bridge inspectors will be able to abandon their precarious ropes
and scaffolding when they work with ROMA.
</P>
<P>
   This climbing robot, built by Carlos Balaguer, Mohamed
Abderrahim and their fellow engineers at the Carlos III University
of Madrid, nimbly navigates steel I-beams on bridges and sends back
video to a human sitting safely on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA has two arms with pincerlike grippers. The robot can turn
</P>
<P>
   corners by pivoting its whole body on its wrist, or flip one arm
up sideways to grab a column and clamber upward.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in map of the structure, along with laser and camera
sensors, makes sure every step is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of ROMA will be able to automatically find and

<P>
   &UR; A CHAMPION OF CHIMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between chimps and humans is looking blurry these days.
First we thought that only humans use tools. Then we learned that
chimps do too.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, primatologists found that chimps, like humans,
have distinctive cultural habits that vary from group to group.
</P>
<P>
   Frans de Waal has spent years studying the complexities of chimp
behavior as director of Yerkes' Living Links Center at Emory
</P>
<P>
   University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the significance of the discovery of chimp culture?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There's a long tradition in Western thought that humans are
not shackled by biology, whereas animals are pure instinct
machines. The chimpanzee story is telling us that animals may be a
lot closer to us in this regard than we think.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  So what does separate us from chimps or other animals?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Chimps don't have language. Humans actively instruct others
about how things should be done. Chimpanzees probably pick up
cultural traditions by observation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Can chimpanzees create art?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are beautiful examples of art done by chimpanzees in
human care. Chimps also have a rain dance: They react to thunderous
noises of rainfall by swaying around rhythmically, their hair
standing on end. Some people have called this dance a superstition,
in that the animals may think that they can stop the rain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Are we doing enough to protect wild chimpanzees?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The conservation situation is the worst it's been in a long
time. In Borneo there have been big fires; in Uganda there are
rebels who threaten chimp researchers. In Africa the biggest threat
of all is the bush meat trade. People are shooting apes, snaring
them, hacking them to death and eating them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Would you want to live in a chimp society?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd prefer to live with humans. I think humans are marvels
of conflict resolution and cooperation. Look at New York City,
which has more than 7 million people living crowded together. I
don't think you could put 7 million chimpanzees in a city and have
anything decent going on.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TITAN'S SECRET SEAS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are astronomers looking for life in all the wrong places?
</P>
<P>
   Although Mars hogs a lot of headlines, scientists have been
building a case that Saturn's giant moon Titan is covered with
oceans of organic chemicals, evidence of complex chemistry similar
to what occurred on the young Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's atmosphere and dense smog have kept scientists guessing
about what is going on below. Astrophysicist Claire Max of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory recently used the giant Keck I
telescope in Hawaii to examine Titan in infrared light, which can
pierce the global haze.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues then took a series of high-speed
snapshots to freeze the blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence,
and combined them into a single, sharp image. The new picture shows
Titan seemingly divided into bright continents and dark oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's seas probably consist of methane or ethane mixed with
more complex organic molecules-liquid natural gas combined with
tar, basically.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini spacecraft, now bound for Saturn, will drop a probe
through Titan's clouds in 2004 for a firsthand look. Meanwhile, Max
plans to use the Keck telescope to make a crude map of Titan's
composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a probe, you get lots and lots of data about just one
place,'' Max says. ``We hope to survey the entire surface.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not many ships venture into the Drake Passage, 500 miles of
water between the fjords of southern Chile and the tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing but icy-cold ocean. Here, a ship can expect to
run into waves that are sometimes five stories high. Sailing crews
consider these the most treacherous seas on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, near-hurricane force winds slam growing swells
into the research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer. Scientists below deck
scurry to lash down computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Off the starboard side, hulking waves line up to take a swing at
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of science justifies the risk of men and women swept
overboard and a $50 million ship lost at sea?
</P>
<P>
   In short, the future of our planet.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of this trip: to gather clues about global
warming. The more immediate goal concerns a regional warming trend
in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly what this trend means for the rest of the
world, but the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula is warming
up faster than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of climate records from just a half-century ago show
that temperatures here have risen, on average, 2.5 to 3 degrees
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it to happen this fast,'' says glaciologist
Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Although most scientists agree that global warming is upon us,
no one yet knows how much of it _ if any _ could be due to a
recurring natural temperature cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the ancient past. To find it, one must look
at what was happening with temperatures thousands of years ago. One
way to do that is to study long-buried, centuries-old marine
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   And so a team of marine sediment experts has set up shop on the
Nathaniel B. Palmer, which is sponsored by the National Science
Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. They hope to sink great
hollow cores deep into the ocean off Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   We have arrived at the mouth of the Muller Ice Shelf, near
Lallemand Fjord.
</P>
<P>
   For those who picture Antarctica as a monotony of whites and
grays, Lallemand Fjord is an awakening. The icebergs crowding the
ship this morning are infused with a paint store panoply of blues _
the bright, blaring blues of mouthwashes and toilet-bowl cleaners.
Everyone is out on deck, looking at the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them are thinking nice thoughts about it. One of the
detractors is Gene Domack, a sedimentologist from Hamilton College
in Clinton, N.Y. He and graduate student Asa Chong left a series of
ocean sediment traps moored in the water here last year, to be
recovered this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to study the advance and retreat of ice
shelves over the millennia, you need to be able to recognize the
unique sediment profile of an ice edge. A more detailed familiarity
with one year's worth of sediment (generally about 7 to 12 inches)
also helps scientists interpret the timetable of the longer cores.
</P>
<P>
   Domack withdraws the sample from trap Number 4. ``Look at those
varves!'' marvels a graduate student, admiring the seasonal layers.
Together, these bands are the fingerprint of a calendar year at the
ice's edge.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later the Natbaniel B. Palmer reaches Paradise
Harbor. Out on deck lie the remains of last night's jumbo Piston
Core: a 10-foot length of pipe, bowed like an elephant's tusk. When
it went over the side of the ship, it was straight. Apparently it
hit a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   While the crew heads to shore for a brief excursion, Domack
alone remains on board, poring over a sonar map of our next
destination. The map helps him decide precisely where to sink the
core.
</P>
<P>
   Domack points to a light-blue area the size of an almond on one
of last week's maps: ``What we're looking for is small pockets like
this one.'' Such sites lie deeper than most of the area's sea
shelf, putting them out of reach of the dragging bellies of
icebergs, where they remain undisturbed for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   What Domack wants is a clean sample, and to get that, he needs
to pull up sediment that reflects only what's dropped down from the
water column directly overhead. Augmenting the SeaBearn map is a
readout that gives a cross section of the sediment layers below the
seafloor. Domack points to a half-inch band of pronounced striping
on the readout: our target.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, we've reached Gerlache Strait and closed in on
the spot. Tonight is the last chance for Domack and Amy Leventer, a
Colgate University marine geologist, to attempt an 80-foot core
sample. Tomorrow we head back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With the pipe segments coupled at last, it's time to slide in
the plastic liner segments. If all goes as planned, these will
emerge crammed with grade-A Antarctic mud.
</P>
<P>
   The first two go in easily. By the eighth section, the combined
weights of the seven liners already in place have three of the men
heaving en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the far end of the deck, the crew hauls in a
12-foot kasten core. Since the impact of a jumbo Piston Core blasts
apart the top few feet of mud, a smaller core is sent down to bring
up an undisturbed first few feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kasten core is also a dress rehearsal: If it comes up full
of mud, it's all systems go.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the kasten core emerges from the sea with water
streaming from a pair of small holes in its sides: a bad sign. The
group gathers round as the core is opened; a pathetic green lump of
mud drops to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leventer looks on, more exhausted than upset. She's been up for
19 of the past 24 hours. ``We don't have time to do another kasten
core,'' she says. ``The weather's getting really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She signals the deck crew to go ahead with the Jumbo Piston
Core. ``If we lose it, we lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crane lifts the pipe from the railing, and the crew pushes it
out far enough to clear the ship. With one pull of a quick release,
the pipe swings down into the sea. Then it's lowered by winch and
cable more than 2,000 feet. About 10 feet from the seafloor, a
trigger core hits bottom and releases the main core, which drops
the remainder of the way by gravity and buries itself in the mud.
</P>

a window-lined office above the deck. A video monitor displays the
stress being put on the winch cable _ 13,000 pounds and counting.

<P>
   A half hour later, the head of the core pops up over the side of
the deck. It's coated in green slime. Smiles appear. The core, says
Domack, is the longest ever recovered from the Antarctic
continental shelf.

<P>
   ``Now we'll be able to understand how rapidly these climate
transitions took place,'' says Domack, ``and what processes were
involved in making that environmental change.''

day save this big Earth.

<P>
   Not many ships venture into the Drake Passage, 500 miles of
water between the fjords of southern Chile and the tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing but icy-cold ocean. Here, a ship can expect to
run into waves that are sometimes five stories high. Sailing crews
consider these the most treacherous seas on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, near-hurricane force winds slam growing swells
into the research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer. Scientists below deck
scurry to lash down computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Off the starboard side, hulking waves line up to take a swing at
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of science justifies the risk of men and women swept
overboard and a $50 million ship lost at sea?
</P>
<P>
   In short, the future of our planet.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of this trip: to gather clues about global
warming. The more immediate goal concerns a regional warming trend
in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly what this trend means for the rest of the
world, but the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula is warming
up faster than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of climate records from just a half-century ago show
that temperatures here have risen, on average, 2.5 to 3 degrees
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it to happen this fast,'' says glaciologist
Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Although most scientists agree that global warming is upon us,
no one yet knows how much of it _ if any _ could be due to a
recurring natural temperature cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the ancient past. To find it, one must look
at what was happening with temperatures thousands of years ago. One
way to do that is to study long-buried, centuries-old marine
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   And so a team of marine sediment experts has set up shop on the
Nathaniel B. Palmer, which is sponsored by the National Science
Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. They hope to sink great
hollow cores deep into the ocean off Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   We have arrived at the mouth of the Muller Ice Shelf, near
Lallemand Fjord.
</P>
<P>
   For those who picture Antarctica as a monotony of whites and
grays, Lallemand Fjord is an awakening. The icebergs crowding the
ship this morning are infused with a paint store panoply of blues _
the bright, blaring blues of mouthwashes and toilet-bowl cleaners.
Everyone is out on deck, looking at the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them are thinking nice thoughts about it. One of the
detractors is Gene Domack, a sedimentologist from Hamilton College
in Clinton, N.Y. He and graduate student Asa Chong left a series of
ocean sediment traps moored in the water here last year, to be
recovered this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to study the advance and retreat of ice
shelves over the millennia, you need to be able to recognize the
unique sediment profile of an ice edge. A more detailed familiarity
with one year's worth of sediment (generally about 7 to 12 inches)
also helps scientists interpret the timetable of the longer cores.
</P>
<P>
   Domack withdraws the sample from trap Number 4. ``Look at those
varves!'' marvels a graduate student, admiring the seasonal layers.
Together, these bands are the fingerprint of a calendar year at the
ice's edge.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later the Natbaniel B. Palmer reaches Paradise
Harbor. Out on deck lie the remains of last night's jumbo Piston
Core: a 10-foot length of pipe, bowed like an elephant's tusk. When
it went over the side of the ship, it was straight. Apparently it
hit a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   While the crew heads to shore for a brief excursion, Domack
alone remains on board, poring over a sonar map of our next
destination. The map helps him decide precisely where to sink the
core.
</P>
<P>
   Domack points to a light-blue area the size of an almond on one
of last week's maps: ``What we're looking for is small pockets like
this one.'' Such sites lie deeper than most of the area's sea
shelf, putting them out of reach of the dragging bellies of
icebergs, where they remain undisturbed for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   What Domack wants is a clean sample, and to get that, he needs
to pull up sediment that reflects only what's dropped down from the
water column directly overhead. Augmenting the SeaBearn map is a
readout that gives a cross section of the sediment layers below the
seafloor. Domack points to a half-inch band of pronounced striping
on the readout: our target.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, we've reached Gerlache Strait and closed in on
the spot. Tonight is the last chance for Domack and Amy Leventer, a
Colgate University marine geologist, to attempt an 80-foot core
sample. Tomorrow we head back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With the pipe segments coupled at last, it's time to slide in
the plastic liner segments. If all goes as planned, these will
emerge crammed with grade-A Antarctic mud.
</P>
<P>
   The first two go in easily. By the eighth section, the combined
weights of the seven liners already in place have three of the men
heaving en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the far end of the deck, the crew hauls in a
12-foot kasten core. Since the impact of a jumbo Piston Core blasts
apart the top few feet of mud, a smaller core is sent down to bring
up an undisturbed first few feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kasten core is also a dress rehearsal: If it comes up full
of mud, it's all systems go.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the kasten core emerges from the sea with water
streaming from a pair of small holes in its sides: a bad sign. The
group gathers round as the core is opened; a pathetic green lump of
mud drops to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leventer looks on, more exhausted than upset. She's been up for
19 of the past 24 hours. ``We don't have time to do another kasten
core,'' she says. ``The weather's getting really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She signals the deck crew to go ahead with the Jumbo Piston
Core. ``If we lose it, we lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crane lifts the pipe from the railing, and the crew pushes it
out far enough to clear the ship. With one pull of a quick release,
the pipe swings down into the sea. Then it's lowered by winch and
cable more than 2,000 feet. About 10 feet from the seafloor, a
trigger core hits bottom and releases the main core, which drops
the remainder of the way by gravity and buries itself in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   For the pullout, the action moves to the Aft Control Winch Room,
a window-lined office above the deck. A video monitor displays the
stress being put on the winch cable _ 13,000 pounds and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, the head of the core pops up over the side of
the deck. It's coated in green slime. Smiles appear. The core, says
Domack, is the longest ever recovered from the Antarctic
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll be able to understand how rapidly these climate
transitions took place,'' says Domack, ``and what processes were
involved in making that environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Domack is gone, back inside to his data logs which may one
day save this big Earth.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Think of Jane Campion movies _ ``Portrait of a Lady,'' ``The
Piano,'' ``An Angel At My Table,'' ``Sweetie'' _ and you think of
dreamlike imagery, resonant symbols and explorations of female
repression and expression that cry out for explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest, ``Holy Smoke,'' has all the ingredients. A willful
young woman (Kate Winslet) travels to India and becomes the devotee
of a guru. Her family fakes a pretext to bring her home to Sydney,
and hires a deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel) to burst the bubble of her
newfound bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of three days in a shack in the Outback, he
breaks her spirit, unnerves her, then seduces her _ only to find
himself in turn broken, deprogrammed and humiliated by her. This
must be the first film in which Harvey Keitel has worn a matching
dress and lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   For a movie about religion, sex, power and obsession, the
surprising thing about ``Holy Smoke'' is that it is both
straightforward and, at least in part, comedic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to make films that are both funny and serious,'' says
Campion over coffee at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. ``That's who
I am as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   She prefers her work to be intuited, rather than explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' she muses. ```Holy Smoke' is meant to be powerful
without the audience understanding where it came from. I like my
films to be gotten in a nonverbal way. The minute you can describe
what you saw, what you felt, the whole thing's over. But I also
think my work is more traditional than people think. I don't really
work with symbols. `The Piano,' I suppose, was somewhat metaphoric.
`Holy Smoke' is what it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   The film began to materialize when Campion and her co-writer
sister, Anna, decided to explore the theme of older men and younger
women _ a Hollywood cliche whose dynamic is rarely explored, or
even questioned. They also wanted to pair a woman of innocence and
conviction with a jaded, alienated man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the story in motion to see how it would play out,''
says Campion, in her Down Under lilt that sounds a little like
Brooklyn-meets-London. (She was raised in New Zealand but has lived
most of her life in Australia.) ``We didn't know what would happen.
We just wanted it to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, quirky might be a better word to describe Winslet's family
of wackos in the film, which includes plenty of un-p.c. action:
rape, urination, drunk driving, spouses cheating and lying. The
nude scenes between Winslet and Keitel are also a far cry from the
highly aestheticized Hollywood equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   If Campion was taken aback by the decidedly mixed reaction that
greeted her offbeat interpretation of Henry James' ``Portrait of a
Lady'' three years ago, she's ready for anything now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if anyone likes the film or not, really,'' she
says. ``I've gotten to a place in my life where I care what I
think, and I really like the film. I know some people are going to
hate it. I want them to have room not to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact Campion, whose favorite filmmakers are Luis Bunuel,
Jean-Luc Godard, Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick, Neil LaBute and
Quentin Tarantino, professes to love ``flawed'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my favorite films have mistakes in them,'' she says.
``In attempting to stretch the boundaries, they often miss in other
ways. But they're poetic. Look at Bunuel: He's very naughty and
silly. But I find it lovely that a grownup could be so childish,
just for the surreal enjoyment of things. I mean, bugger it! Who
wants to grow up?''
</P>
<P>
   Not her, it seems. Campion has an innocent, girlish air about
her, reflected in her appearance: She has natural, curly blond hair
and wears simple, cozy clothing and no makeup.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with what appears to be her favorite narrative _
unlikely love that brings with it a surprising spiritual dimension
_ the 45-year-old director just laughs playfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my movies as romantic fairy tales,'' she says.
``They're about what can happen if you go in there deep enough, and
disaster doesn't strike.''
</P>
<P>
   True to her free-spirited style, she also prefers to work with
small budgets and a big imagination. Besides, she says, money and
competition are still foreign notions to most Australians (Rupert
Murdoch excepted).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very freeing when you figure out that money's not going
to do it for you,'' she says. ``Aussies are natural losers. As long
as you can joke down there, you're all right. If you get too
successful, they'll cut you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The way she sees it, Nicole Kidman thinks the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicole will take whatever project's close to her heart,''
Campion says. ``She thinks more like an independent filmmaker.
She's had a very unconventional career, when you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidman, who worked with the director on ``Portrait of a Lady,''
will also be the star of Campion's next project, an adaptation of
Susanna Moore's highly-sexed novel, ``In the Cut,'' which she will
shoot in New York next spring. It's another unlikely love story, in
which a writing professor gets involved with a detective who may be
a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm attracted to narrative _ and mystery,'' Campion says with
a smile. ``I like a good haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, she doesn't mean ``Scream 3,'' but stories and films
that reverberate emotionally and stay with the audience, simmering
in their consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want films to end in a tidy way. I love
mysteriousness. And you can't fake that.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, she says she's not mysterious at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very honest,'' she declares, sounding apologetic. ``I
don't pretend with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why she feels that despite her successes _
from motherhood (she has a 5-year-old daughter, Alice) to
conquering indie films (she's still living off the profits from
``The Piano'') to working with major stars (Malkovich, Kidman,
Keitel) _ she is burdened with one weakness: ``I still don't think
I understand how to love,'' she says, alluding to her recent split
from husband Colin Englert, who often worked as her second-unit
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are good at it. I'm in awe of them. They don't
overthink the area. They seem to understand how to just be with
people.''

   NEW YORK _ Wear-testing has become more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Once restricted to top athletes, wear-testing has now spread to
include a vast range of participants. Nike, Adidas, RLX Polo Sport
and Brooks Sports will still provide free apparel and sneakers for
their sponsored athletes to test-drive, but these days, they are
more interested in having everyday athletes assess products.
</P>
<P>
   Their initiatives include:
</P>
<P>
   A testing room at Nike's corporate offices that will replicate
rain and other harsh weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise by Adidas and FilaGuests is provided to guests at
Women's Quest, fitness retreats held in Colorado and Vermont six
times a year, in return for feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Retail advisory councils set up by RLX Polo Sport and Brooks
Sports so buyers may test out their activewear.
</P>
<P>
   Nike feels it is putting science into what can be a haphazard
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often wear-testing is an oversimplified subject even though it
is very complex,'' said Jamie Bainbridge, director of Nike's Alpha
apparel. ``A lot of companies give a lot of product to people and
say, `What do you think about it?' If you talk to anyone in
science, they will point out a million reasons why the test went a
certain way. Wear-testing under a controlled environment is a
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next year or two, Nike plans to build an
environmental chamber that duplicates various weather conditions at
its new sports research lab, which opened last month at the
company's headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. Nike will use the
12,200-square-foot facility, an area twice as large as the current
onsite location, for wear-testing.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' interest in more technical fabrics calls for more
etensive wear-testing and more specific feedback, Bainbridge said.
Given that, companies need to know more than whether a garment is
warm enough or comes in an appealing color, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is teaching its more knowledgeable wear-testers how to rate
a garment's breathability, moisture management and other special
features. Despite having a stable of professional athletes who
endorse its brand, Nike does not get its ``best information'' from
them, since they tend ``to block out extraneous information'' that
everyday athletes might notice, such as ``noisy'' fabrics, she
said. The company is relying more on college students and
recreational athletes for wear-testing.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2001, Nike aims to wear-test all of its
performance-oriented products instead of the current 60 percent,
Bainbridge said. To accomplish that, it will use more domestic
contractors to develop samples. About 55 percent of Nike apparel
sold in the United States is made overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas is sending its wear-testing to camp.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a sponsorship deal with Women's Quest, Adidas
provides products, asks participants to keep journals to highlight
recommendations and sends key executives to gather firsthand
information. People, they say, tend to be more forthcoming about
product right after using it for hiking, yoga or a trail run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to hang out with consumers in this type of
environment. For one, they are honest,'' said Kathy Mitchell,
category manager for running for Adidas, during a camp in October
in Winter Park, Colo. ``Our involvement is not just asking them
about the product. We ask them what brands mean to them and what
inspires them to buy something.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of phoning or e-mailing wear-testers, as is the case
with many activewear makers, Adidas executives often pick up
unsolicited feedback during actual activities such as hiking. They
elaborate on topics raised earlier or talk about advertising,
Mitchell said. The camps put Adidas in touch with women who might
not necessarily buy the brand or be familiar with it, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Cannon, a former world-class triathlete who operates
Women's Quest, and her 15-member staff, which includes several
elite athletes, also test products for Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, last month the Adidas design and development
team compiled the results of an 18-month research project about
running _ its first major study of a specific sport. Designed to
determine how Adidas merchandise stood up to runners' expectations
and performance needs, the $15,000 project involved 200 people,
said Gretchen Garside, a researcher at the company's human
performance lab. Less than 8 percent of the participants said
appearance mattered when selecting new products, she noted. They
were more concerned about a garment's fit and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Running is a top initiative for the company, partly because
148,000 women completed marathons last year _ a 55 percent increase
over 1997, Mitchell said. Adidas plans to do similar research
projects for other sports next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fila also participates in Women's Quest, providing 100 apparel
items for each of the camps. Wear-testers complete questionnaires
about their activewear preferences, said Sally Pfaeffle, business
unit manager for women's. Fila executives attend some camps to talk
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Fila still relies on a handful of female pro
athletes who endorse the brand to evaluate it after practice and
competition.
</P>
<P>
   RLX Polo Sport, a label that has been well received at retail
for its technical features, uses about 1,200 professional and
amateur athletes to wear-test its product. Earlier this year, it
signed a marketing partnership deal with the Aspen Ski School to
outfit its 1,100 instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say our athletes are designers, that is an accurate
statement. It takes the product to a whole different level,'' said
Jordan Wand, vice president of RLX Polo Sport. ``An item doesn't
make it in the line unless five athletes try the product for a
minimum of three weeks under varying conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are asked their impressions, even before trying on the
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you buy the item?'' and ``What would you be willing to
pay for it?'' are among the preliminary questions, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of wear-testing involves evaluating fit,
comfort level, style and special functional features, as well as
waterproofness, breathability and moisture management. Athletes
record the length of use and weather conditions, durability after
washing and additional apparel worn. Many RLX garments are modified
several times after the initial approval into the line, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can test fabrics countless times in a lab and put it on
fit models for hours on end. But until you get an athlete to use
it, you won't find out its features,'' Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   RLX recently set up a retail advisory board and will hold
quarterly meetings to discuss product development. Outdoor
adventure, cycling and snowboarding are a few of the subjects to be
discussed. Board members will also wear-test goods. The brand is
considering inviting them to resorts in Telluride, Colo., or Santa
Cruz, Calif., to do just that, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Sports, a Botthel, Wash., company that caters to runners,
now meets with at least one of its five key specialty stores for
wear-testing and evaluating new products on a monthly basis. Unlike
many buyers at major chains, specialty store owners tend to be
passionate about their particular sports and are right in tune with
fashion trends, said Mick Whitaker, vice president of apparel.
Those accounts have carried Brooks for at least 10 years and are
considered directional, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers have a vested interest in helping develop the
product. They are the best source of information and they reach
consumers,'' Whitaker said. ``Too many times, sponsored athletes
have other issues to deal with, like training and race
preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also counts on its own 70 employees for
wear-testing. Seventy percent of them are recreational runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't focus on world-class athletes because our customer
isn't that. They have different needs,'' Whitaker said. ``Our
customers are out for longer periods of time, and they're running
slower. They don't relate to setting American records.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most companies, Burton remains committed to having its
sponsored athletes get ``heavily'' involved with the brand's
wear-testing and product development, said Olympic snowboarder
Shannon Dunn, a Burton-sponsored athlete.
</P>
<P>
   After wear-testing Burton's 2001 apparel during a catalog shoot
in Chile in October, Dunn and other riders returned to the
company's headquarters in Burlington, Vt., to evaluate the
collection item by item. Burton identifies its rider development
team in the company's retail catalog, which includes photos of
junior riders, less-established young snowboarders who also
wear-test the product.
</P>
<P>
   After helping with the line, Dunn said she likes to check out
what stores purchase. She plans to do just that when making
appearances this winter at athletic specialty stores and sporting
goods stores. In October, while at Paragon Sporting Goods, a
mammoth specialty store here at 867 Broadway, Dunn pointed out her
favorite jacket, a hooded three-color down style from Burton.
</P>
<P>
   She slept in one of those jackets while staying in an unheated
room that looked like ``an old army barracks'' in New Zealand
during a photo shoot last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were staying in Erehwon, which is `nowhere' spelled
backwards. So you can imagine how cold it was,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Burton prefers to have its riders wearing the apparel
on mountains. After just a few runs, Dunn said she knows whether
the sample will hold up in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something doesn't feel good while we're moving, it doesn't
make it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most pro athletes, Dunn, who cofounded Prom and Tuesday,
two other snowboard lines, before signing with Burton, enjoys
offering her input.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does create more work, but it's fun. It gives you a sense
of ownership,'' she said. ``I take more pride in something knowing
that I worked on it.''

 &HT;    Best little Y2K party in Texas?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now, here's a party concept that takes a lot of
pluck. A couple of Texas A&AMP;M Aggies who live in Austin have found
the perfect Texas landmark for a Y2K bash _ the Chicken Ranch
property near La Grange.
</P>
<P>
   What better spot to toast the new millennium than the site of
Texas' most notorious defunct whorehouse?
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a long line of Aggies who have been reputed to
have visited the Chicken Ranch in its glory days,'' said Ray
Prewitt, 29, A&AMP;M '92, aircraft salesman and the man who thought up
Millennium Chicken. ``My father and all my uncles went to A&AMP;M, and
just being around them and their classmates, some story always pops
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Chicken starts at 8 Friday night and continues 'til
dawn. A few more than 100 people _ most of them Aggies _ plan to
attend at $100 apiece. ``We've got people coming in from as far
away as Seattle, Washington, to do this thing,'' Ray said. Don't
show up at the party unannounced, however, because it's sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Because the remains of the Chicken Ranch's buildings are in a
shambles, party-goers will revel in a ``heated wedding-style
tent,'' it says on the Millennium Chicken Web page
(www.dammitray.com). There will be an open bar, catered barbecue,
hot tubs, a D.J., souvenir mugs and a shuttle running to the old
Chicken Ranch grounds from the La Grange Executive Inn &AMP; Suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no hookers,'' said Colby Turner, 25, A&AMP;M '97 and Ray's
roommate. ``Maybe a couple of ... ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if we looked around long enough if one of the old
(hookers) would come out of one of the bedrooms with a boa on,''
Ray said. I'd be more worried about the geezers from downtown La
Grange hearing the music and showing up to see if the place has
reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Ray says none of the party-goers is old enough to have ever been
to the Chicken Ranch, which was closed by Gov. Dolph Briscoe in
1973. ``I don't think anybody was a product of the Chicken Ranch,
either,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Web page shows a chicken in a top hat, attire will
be semiformal. Or, as it says on the Web site, ``Heels Not
Recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the New Bohemia vintage clothing shop and got a
tuxedo jacket, and I'm going to glue as much glitter on it as
possible,'' said Colby, who repairs semiconductor manufacturing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   So why party like it's 1999 on the property of a brothel that
was closed 26 years ago? Colby and Ray live on Rainey Street in
downtown Austin, and Colby wanted to party away from Austin's
millennium traffic-jam-to-be, A2K: Austin on the Verge.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken Ranch grounds _ a few miles east of La Grange and
about 70 miles southeast of Austin _ fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just looking for some place that wouldn't shut down at
2, and we've got three generators out there,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had to clear some of the property to make room for
the tent. ``You would not believe the amount of condom wrappers
that are still out on that trash pile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray tracked down the owner of the property in Houston and
explained what they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty cool, and he let us rent the place (for $500),''
Colby said. ``He said, `I pretty much get the gist of it. A bunch
of you Aggies want to go out there and drink beer.'''
</P>
<P>
   No, Marvin Zindler, the Houston TV personality responsible for
shutting down the Chicken Ranch by reporting its existence, has not
been invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about it, though,'' Colby said. ``He would be kind
of fun to have out there to throw rocks at.''

 &HT;    Same-sex marriage, failing nuclear family may redefine
'traditional'
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Many Americans panic at the mention of the words
``homosexual marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court caused the latest panic. The justices
unanimously ruled that homosexual couples were entitled to marital
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's Supreme Court set off a similar nationwide panic
several years ago when it ruled that the denial of marriage
licenses to same-sex couples was unconstitutional sex
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in 30 states rushed to pass laws that ban the
recognition of gay marriages. Often referred to as Defense of
Marriage laws, the statutes actually are a defense against
marriages of the wrong sort.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's voters were none too happy to discover that their
constitution gave homosexuals the same protection under the law as
heterosexuals when it comes to marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Aloha State voters amended their constitution to make it clear
that the rights, privileges and benefits of marriage belong only to
heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   This shouldn't come as a big surprise. Homosexuals are no more
than 10 percent of the population, and polls show that more than 80
percent of Americans oppose homosexual marriages.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that more than 80 percent of Americans are
homophobes. It's just that there is scant support outside the
homosexual community for homosexual marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The rights of American citizens, however, are not granted by
popular vote. The U.S. Constitution specifically protects the
minority from the tyranny of the majority. A majority of Americans
cannot wake up one morning and simply vote away the constitutional
rights of an unpopular minority.
</P>
<P>
   But is homosexual marriage a constitutional right? Just because
30 states and Congress have passed Defense of Marriage laws, does
that make the statutes constitutional?
</P>
<P>
   Societies throughout history _ and no doubt in prehistoric times
_ have taken keen interest in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The institution has been viewed as essential to the well-being
and propagation of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage is important to religions and governments. Both have
adopted rules and customs governing marriages. But seldom, if ever,
has marriage been ignored or defined as anything other than an
intimate relationship between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The progeny of marriage is valued by religions and governments.
Couples that produce children are more likely care for their
offspring and bring them up to accept the traditions and laws of
their religion or government.
</P>
<P>
   Not all married couples have children, either by choice or
circumstance, but the historic interest societies have had in
heterosexual marriage pertains to procreation and the likelihood
that the children will be reared in a stable family structure.
</P>
<P>
   That structure is falling apart in the United States. A new
survey by the University of Chicago showed only 26 percent of
American households in 1998 were traditional two-parent families
with children. U.S. Census figures show 50 percent of all
households in 1970 were made up of traditional married families
with children younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trend is toward more divorces, fewer marriages, more
single-parent families and more married baby boomer
``empty-nesters.''
</P>
<P>
   While the traditional two-parent family is still considered the
ideal, Americans have become much more accepting of non-traditional
families, which is understandable considering the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are not now accepting of homosexual marriages. Perhaps
that will change.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court, by the way, did not rule in favor of
homosexual marriages, only that the state could not deny marital
benefits to homosexual couples after it had recognized the rights
of same-sex couples as parents. It's a distinction with a
difference.

 &HT;    Scholar of life; call now
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was a brief, unpretentious obituary, like one
of those postage-stamp tombstones dwarfed by loftier monuments. The
twice-widowed Bessie Margaret Brunner Smith Georgeff, 93, of Tipp
City, Ohio, boasted an impressive procession of names, it's true.
But where the long list of credentials and accomplishments should
have been, there was only this simple sentence: ``She was a scholar
of life and a teacher of her lessons of life to all who knew her.''
</P>
<P>
   And where the suggested memorial contributions should have been,
there was only this simple request: ``In lieu of flowers call your
parents or loved ones and tell them you love them.''
</P>
<P>
   A scholar of life. Makes a Ph.D. sound rather paltry in
comparison, don't you think? What kind of woman would inspire such
a description?
</P>
<P>
   Donna Enney, 54, used to consider her mother a sentimental
woman, to put it kindly. The youngest of Georgeff's three children,
Enney would wince when she overheard her mother talking on the
phone to her older brother, Clarence Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't send me flowers when I'm dead,'' she would say. ``Call
me. The sweetest bouquet is your voice. You don't have to say the
words _ just talking to you, I can hear the 'I love you.'''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Enney groaned and thought, ``What a sappy thing
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   And her mother was sappy, there was no getting around it.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, none other but a sappy woman would have the
patience, as a young mother, to care for dozens foster children
through a Catholic charity, and even to adopt one of them _ Donna.
Most of the children were infants with health problems, waiting for
permanent families. ``I always wanted a big family, and Mom gave
that to me,'' Enney recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned from her was the gift of loving all children,''
recalled daughter-in-law Rosalie Smith of Rotonda, Fla., Clarence's
wife. ``If a child walked in the room, she didn't care whose it
was, she would love the child and mother it.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgeff lived alone for a time after the death of her second
husband, Tom Georgeff, before moving to a nursing home in 1992. At
the HealthCenter at SpringMeade in Tipp City, she was a ``real
dear'' who participated in nearly every event, recalled activity
director Eileen Falldorf.
</P>
<P>
   Until Dec. 8, the day she died, Georgeff was surrounded by
children and grandchildren, and she was ``still teaching her
family,'' Enney said. ``Our family came together. She taught us to
appreciate the here and now that you're with your parents and your
loved ones, to put aside the differences. She taught us to be
women, mothers and grandmothers. And she taught us how to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgeff gave her family strict instructions: She didn't want a
funeral. She wanted her body to be donated to a medical college.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her children and grandchildren wanted to find some way to
pay tribute. Wanting something personal, something that reflected
Bessie Georgeff's life, they brainstormed the message: ``In lieu of
flowers, call your parents and loved ones and tell them you love
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Enney, by the way, no longer believes her mother was sappy. Or
maybe she no longer believes that's such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be just like her when I grow up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A scholar of life.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take 1 of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can you determine if a charitable organization is
legitimate?
</P>
<P>
   A: That can be a daunting prospect, with thousands of charitable
organizations to choose from. Any legitimate nonprofit agency
should be able to provide you with a copy of its Form 990 tax
return. If they refuse, you should be suspicious. Websites can be a
useful source of information. GuideStar (www.guidestar.org) serves
as an information clearinghouse on nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   There are three major charity watchdogs: National Charities
Information Bureau (www.give.org); the Philanthropic Advisory
Service of the Council of Better Business Bureaus
(www.bbb.org/reports/charity.html); and the American Institute of
Philanthropy (www.charitywatch.org). Bottom line: It's not
difficult to find a well-run, committed charity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot of talk about whether America is a Christian
nation at the same time that there seem to be more mosques,
synagogues and temples on the landscape. What's the real breakdown
of religion in North America?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the five major world religions, Christianity is by far the
largest in North America with more than 250 million adherents,
according to Encyclopaedia Britannica's 1999 Book of the Year.
There are roughly 2.5 million Buddhists, 1.3 million Hindus, 6
million Jews and 4.4 million Muslims. About 27.5 million people in
North America claim to be nonreligious and 1.6 million say they are
atheists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many Americans actually go to church?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer depends on whom you ask. Although 70 percent of
Americans claim to belong to a church or synagogue, weekly
attendance remains steady at about 40 percent, according to
telephone surveys for the Gallup Organization. Sociologists who
have studied head counts say only about 20 percent show up for
services.
</P>
<P>
   And a religion scholar at the University of North Carolina
splits the difference and estimates that about 30 percent of
Americans are in the pews any given week. ``My research shows that
when you adjust to correct for the people who aren't included in
head counts and use more accurate estimates of the Catholic and
Protestant population in each region, attendance figures come up
substantially,'' doctoral student Robert Woodberry said. ``At the
same time, most polls oversample regular church attenders and so
overrepresent their opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are Americans spiritual?
</P>
<P>
   A: The percentage of Americans who say they feel the need for
spiritual growth jumped from 58 percent in 1994 to 82 percent in
1998, according to the Gallup Organization. Those who say they have
thought a lot about ``the basic meaning and value of their lives''
grew from 58 percent in 1985 to 69 percent today. In a new book
called ``Surveying the Religious Landscape,'' authors George Gallup
Jr. and Michael Lindsay attribute the growth to ``a rejection of
materialism; a recoiling from the terrible examples of 'man's
inhumanity to man' seen in the wars of this century and in mindless
violence; a growing conviction that humans left to their own
devices will destroy themselves; and the belief that there must be
something better ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: As we enter Y2K, why do so many Christians believe the world
will end soon? Do other religions believe in an apocalypse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most Christian beliefs about end times are based on the last
book of the Bible, called Revelation. Within all the major
religions there are elements of apocalypticism.
</P>
<P>
   Some Buddhists believe that time eventually will end under Lord
Maitreya. Some Hindus believe cycles of time will bring increasing
social breakdown until the world order ends in catastrophe and the
cycles begin again.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews await a literal messiah from the House of David who
will establish God's kingdom on earth. And some Muslims believe
that in the last days, monstrous beings called Yajuj and Majuj will
wreak havoc until God destroys them and brings about the
resurrection of the dead and judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What issues are looming on the horizon for religious groups
in the new century?
</P>
<P>
   A: As society becomes more complex, so do the issues that
religions must address. In the last few years we've seen new
questions about cloning, human fertility and the end of life. Some
denominations won't accept women clergy or divorced clergy. And
abortion remains a difficult question for many people of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Several major American Protestant groups will have
denominational meetings in 2000. Most are expected to be dominated
by questions about blessing same-sex unions and ordaining sexually
active gays and lesbians to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Christian calendar is based on the birth of Christ. What
historical event is the basis for the Jewish calendar, whose year
is 5670?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hebrew calendar begins with an ancient estimated moment
of the world's creation. Hebrew tradition has placed this moment at
3,760 years and 3 months before the birth of Jesus. Therefore, you
would add 3,760 to the date in the Gregorian calendar to find a
year in the Hebrew calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The system doesn't work to the exact month, however, because the
Hebrew year can begin in September or October in the Gregorian
calendar. By November 2000, for instance, the Hebrew year will have
become 5761.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The news about Linda Tripp's wiretapping reminds me of the
incident involving a Florida couple who intercepted and taped a
conversation between Newt Gingrich and some Republicans. What was
the upshot of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: North Florida residents John and Alice Martin pleaded guilty
to tape-recording the conference call on Dec. 21, 1996, among
Republican House leaders and then-House Speaker Gingrich. The
Republicans were discussing how to handle the fallout of the ethics
sanctions against Gingrich. The conference call also included Rep.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), who participated in the conversation using a
cellular phone from his car parked in a restaurant lot near the
Martins'.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who said they picked up the conversation by chance,
recorded it and turned the tape over to Rep. Jim McDermott
(D-Wash.).
</P>
<P>
   Boehner then filed a civil lawsuit against McDermott, accusing
him of leaking the contents of the call to the media. The case
marked a rare instance of one member of Congress suing another in
his personal capacity. Boehner asked for $10,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan threw out the suit, but in late
September, a federal appeals court in Washington reinstated it in a
2-1 ruling. The appellate judges said McDermott ``took part in an
illegal transaction'' when he obtained the tape made by the
Martins. If McDermott himself didn't break the law, the judges
wrote, ``he was at least skirting the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott issued a statement saying, ``We're disappointed in the
result, and I'm discussing with my attorney what my options are,
and what I can do next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martins, who agreed to help investigators sort out the
story, were fined $500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other day I discovered some typical inside-the-house food
ants inside my microwave oven. I turned it on for 10 or 20 seconds,
and it didn't kill them. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably because the temperatures never reached high enough,
says Beverly Sparks, entomologist with the University of Georgia
Extension Service. She said an extreme change in temperatures often
will kill many insects. For example, if you have infested food
items, put them in a freezer for five to seven days, or heat them
to 135 degrees for one or two hours. The pests, although hardy,
aren't likely to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I want to attempt a record for listing in the Guinness
Book of Records, how do I pursue it?
</P>
<P>
   A: For most human endeavor categories, the book has specific
guidelines. For instance, every record claim must be thoroughly
documented, with two independent witness statements the minimum
requirement. As the book's editors say, witnesses should be
``people of some standing in the local community,'' such as a
doctor, lawyer, police officer of official of a professional or
athletic association. Certain records also may require the judgment
of an expert, such as a surveyor or public health official. You can
read the details under the heading ``Getting into the Book'' near
the back of the current volume.

Inc., 6 Landmark Square, Stamford, CT 06901, or by e-mail at

</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that french fries can be coated with something so
they absorb less grease and are healthier. How do I do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: As an alternative to deep-frying potatoes in fat,
nutritionist Chris Rosenbloom, a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association, recommends slicing potatoes in wedges or thin
strips, dipping them in egg white, and baking on a cookie sheet
that has been sprayed with Pam or similar product. Bake them at 400
degrees for about 30 minutes, turning them frequently to make them
crisp. A Cajun-type spice mixture can be sprinkled on them, or salt
and pepper, if you want to jazz up the taste.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Children in my Sunday school class asked about the history of
Christmas cards. Do you have any information I can pass along to
them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first card was created in 1843 by John Calcott Horsley,
an English illustrator. It resembled a postcard and featured a
drawing of a family enjoying a Christmas celebration. Smaller
drawings on the card showed people helping the needy. The message:
``Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You.'' About 1,000 of the
cards were sold. By 1860, the custom of exchanging Christmas cards
had spread throughout Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The first Christmas cards manufactured in the United States were
made in 1875 by Louis Prang, a German-born printer in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Al Gore's religion? What church does he and his
family attend in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gore is a Baptist. When he's in Washington, he goes to Mount
Vernon Baptist Church in nearby Arlington, Va., or the National
Cathedral (which is Episcopal). When he's back in Tennessee, he
attends New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was growing up, he and his family attended services
at the church of his father, former Sen. Albert Gore, a Southern
Baptist, and that of his mother, the Church of Christ. He also
attended daily chapel services while a student at the Episcopal-run
St. Albans School in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A year or so ago, I read that Volvo had developed a radiator
that would clean the air. Was that a hoax? I never heard anything
more about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a hoax, but the original timetable announced wasn't
met. Articles about the PremAir catalyst system published in June
1998 said the ``ozone-eating radiator'' would be a feature of
top-of-the-line Volvo S80s during the 1999 model year. That didn't
happen, but Denise Lindsay, spokeswoman for the manufacturer of the
system, Engelhard Corp. of Iselin, N.J., said S80s are now being
produced with the ozone-eating radiators. They will be in U.S.
showrooms in January. The full line of S80s will have them, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   As reported previously, the radiators developed by Engelhard are
coated so they convert at least 75 percent of the ozone flowing
through them into oxygen. The coating is expected to last about
100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Engelhard also is working with Nissan to outfit Sentras sold in
California with the system. No other automaker is known to be
interested in using it.

 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of two.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What does it mean when people say they're ``trimming'' a
Christmas tree? I've always said ``decorating'' a tree.
</P>
<P>
   A: They mean the same thing, obviously. One of the definitions
of the word ``trim'' in Webster's New World Dictionary is this:
``to decorate or embellish as by adding ornaments, contrasting
materials, etc. (to trim a Christmas tree).''
</P>
<P>
   Q: We've been hearing a lot lately about being equally concerned
with HDL and LDL cholesterol. How much HDL, LDL and triglycerides
are contained in an average-size egg yolk?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's some confusion in terminology here. HDL (``good''
cholesterol), LDL (``bad'' cholesterol) and triglycerides are
concerned with the amount of fat and cholesterol in the blood, said
Chris Rosenbloom, a professor in the department of nutrition at
Georgia State University and a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   HDL and LDL are protein carriers that take cholesterol into the
blood stream. Food itself doesn't contain HDL or LDL, Rosenbloom
said, but it does carry cholesterol and saturated fat, which can
affect your blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   One egg yolk contains 212 milligrams of cholesterol and 2 grams
of saturated fat. If you're concerned about cholesterol, Rosenbloom
suggests that you follow American Heart Association guidelines,
which call for no more than four egg yolks a week. Egg whites
contain no cholesterol and no saturated fat, so you can use one
yolk and two whites to increase the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that because an egg yolk is low in saturated
fat, it doesn't have as great a negative effect on blood
cholesterol as once was thought, Rosenbloom pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year, Q&AMP;A printed dates for space shuttle launches from
Cape Canaveral. Will you print them for 2000 so we can plan a trip?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven shuttle launches are planned next year. Schedules are
subject to change, so you'd be wise to call ahead for recorded
information _ 407-867-4636 _ before making travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   The first launch for 2000 will be Endeavour, with liftoff
planned during a 40-minute launch window beginning at 1:11 p.m.
Jan. 13. Landing is scheduled at 5:19 p.m. Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Atlantis, with liftoff tentatively scheduled for
March 16, a mission expected to last 11 days; Discovery, June 14,
10 days; Endeavour, July 20, 9 days; Atlantis, Aug. 19, 10 days;
Discovery, Oct. 19, 9 days; and Endeavour, Nov. 30, 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The number of days of the missions is important if you want to
see the shuttle return to the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are green and red the Christmas colors?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia explains that green represents the
continuance of life through the winter and the Christian belief in
eternal life through Christ. Red symbolizes the blood that Jesus
shed at his crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend told me that Oliver Stone, the filmmaker, was a
decorated soldier. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true. Stone enlisted in the Army in 1967 and
specifically requested combat duty in Vietnam. He told an
interviewer later that he joined because he was at loose ends and
seeking ``total anonymity.'' Before that, he taught English and
history at a Chinese school in Saigon, worked as a merchant seaman
on a tanker, and tried to write a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam, Stone was
shot in the neck just two weeks into his tour of duty. He later
sustained several shrapnel wounds. For ``extraordinary acts of
courage under fire'' _ he once wiped out a Viet Cong machine gun
nest with a hand grenade _ he was awarded a Bronze Star and a
Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's experience in the military wasn't a happy one. He told a
Time interviewer later that as soon as he joined his combat unit,
he realized he had made a terrible mistake. He was discharged in
1968. In a Washington Post interview years later, he said he _ like
many Vietnam combat veterans _ experienced feelings of anger, guilt
and alienation. He based his 1986 film ``Platoon'' on his wartime
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that President Truman, while living in the Blair
House when the White House was being renovated, was attacked by a
group of terrorists. Were they part of the same group whose jailed
members were pardoned several months ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: The goal of independence for Puerto Rico is the same, but the
names of the organizations involved are different.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who tried to invade Blair House on Nov. 1, 1950,
were members of Puerto Rico's Nationalist Party. One of the
attackers, Griselio Torresola, was killed by guards; the other,
Oscar Collazo, was shot but recovered. A letter and a memo found on
Torresola's body bore the signature of Pedro Albizu Campos, leader
of an abortive anti-U.S. Nationalist revolt in Puerto Rico two days
before the Blair House attack. In San Juan, Gov. Luis Munoz Marin,
himself a target of assassins during the Oct. 30 turmoil, said
Communists were using the Nationalists in assassination attempts on
him and on Truman.
</P>
<P>
   The people pardoned by President Clinton in August were members
of FALN (the Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of National
Liberation), also a separatist group. FALN was responsible for a
wave of bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s that left six
dead and dozens wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot of talk about whether America is a Christian
nation at the same time that there seem to be more mosques,
synagogues and temples on the landscape. What's the real breakdown
of religion in North America?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the five major world religions, Christianity is by far the
largest in North America with more than 250 million adherents,
according to Encyclopedia Brittanica's 1999 Book of the Year. There
are roughly 2.5 million Buddhists, 1.3 million Hindus, 6 million
Jews and 4.4 million Muslims. Some 27.5 million people in North
Amerca claim to be nonreligious and 1.6 million say they are
atheists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many Americans actually go to church?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer depends on whom you ask. Although 70 percent of
Americans claim to belong to a church or synagogue, weekly
attendance remains steady at about 40 percent, according to
telephone surveys for the Gallup organization. Sociologists who
have studied head-counts of churches say only about 20 percent show
up for services.
</P>
<P>
   And, a religion scholar at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill splits the difference and estimates that about 30
percent of Americans are in the pews on any given week. ``My
research shows that when you adjust to correct for the people who
aren't included in head counts and use more accurate estimates of
the Catholic and Protestant population in each region, attendance
figures come up substantially,'' said doctoral student Robert
Woodberry said. ``At the same time, most polls oversample regular
church attenders and so overrepresent their opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are Americans spiritual?
</P>
<P>
   A: The percentage of Americans who say they feel the need for
spiritual growth jumped from 58 percent in 1994 to 82 percent in
1998, according to the Gallup organization. Those who say they have
thought a lot about ``the basic meaning and value of their lives''
grew from 58 percent in 1985 to 69 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book called ``Surveying the Religious Landscape,''
authors George Gallup Jr. and Michael Lindsay attribute the growth
to ``a rejection of materialism; a recoiling from the terrible
examples of `man's inhumanity to man' seen in the wars of this
century and in mindless violence; a growing conviction that humans
left to their own devices will destroy themselves; and the belief
that there must be something better ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: As we approach Y2K, why do so many Christians believe the
world will end soon? Do other religions believe in an Apocalypse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most Christian beliefs about end-times are based on the last
book of the Bible, called Revelation. Within all the major
religions there are elements of apocalypticism.
</P>
<P>
   Some Buddhists believe that time eventually will end under Lord
Maitreya. Some Hindus believe cycles of time will bring increasing
social breakdown until the world order ends in catastrophe and the
cycles begin again.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews await a literal messiah from the House of David who
will establish God's kingdom on earth. And, some Muslims believe
that in the last days, monstrous beings called Yajuj and Majuj will
wreak havoc until God destroys them and brings about the
resurrection of the dead and judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What issues are looming on the horizon for religious groups
in the new century?
</P>
<P>
   A: As society becomes more complex, so do the issues that
religions must address. In the last few years we've seen new
questions about cloning, human fertility and the end of life. Some
denominations won't accept women clergy or divorced clergy. And
abortion remains a difficult question for many people of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Several major American Protestant groups will have
denominational meetings in 2000. Most meetings are expected to be
dominated by questions about blessing same-sex unions and ordaining
sexually active gays and lesbians to the ministry.

</P>
<P>
   Q: How can you determine if a charitable organization is
legitimate?
</P>
<P>
   A: That can be a daunting prospect, with thousands of charitable
organizations to choose from. Any legitimate nonprofit agency
should be able to provide you with a copy of its Form 990 tax
return. If they refuse, you should be suspicious. Websites can be a
useful source of information. GuideStar (www.guidestar.org) serves
as an information clearinghouse on nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   There are three major charity watchdogs: National Charities
Information Bureau (www.give.org); the Philanthropic Advisory
Service of the Council of Better Business Bureaus
(www.bbb.org/reports/charity.html); and the American Institute of
Philanthropy (www.charitywatch.org). Bottom line: It's not
difficult to find a well-run, committed charity.

</P>
<P>
   Q: The Christian calendar is based on the birth of Christ. What
historical event is the basis for the Jewish calendar, whose year
is 5670?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hebrew calendar begins with an ancient estimated moment
of the world's creation. Hebrew tradition has placed this moment at
3,760 years and 3 months before the birth of Jesus. Therefore, you
would add 3,760 to the date in the Gregorian calendar to find a
year in the Hebrew calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The system doesn't work to the exact month, however, because the
Hebrew year can begin in September or October in the Gregorian
calendar. By November 2000, for instance, the Hebrew year will have
become 5761.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The news about Linda Tripp's wiretapping reminds me of the
incident involving a Florida couple who intercepted and taped a
conversation between Newt Gingrich and some Republicans. What was
the upshot of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: North Florida residents John and Alice Martin pleaded guilty
to tape-recording the conference call on Dec. 21, 1996, among
Republican House leaders and then-House Speaker Gingrich. The
Republicans were discussing how to handle the fallout of the ethics
sanctions against Gingrich. The conference call also included Rep.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), who participated in the conversation using a
cellular phone from his car parked in a restaurant lot near the
Martins'.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who said they picked up the conversation by chance,
recorded it and turned the tape over to Rep. Jim McDermott
(D-Wash.).
</P>
<P>
   Boehner then filed a civil lawsuit against McDermott, accusing
him of leaking the contents of the call to the media. The case
marked a rare instance of one member of Congress suing another in
his personal capacity. Boehner asked for $10,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan threw out the suit, but in late
September, a federal appeals court in Washington reinstated it in a
2-1 ruling. The appellate judges said McDermott ``took part in an
illegal transaction'' when he obtained the tape made by the
Martins. If McDermott himself didn't break the law, the judges
wrote, ``he was at least skirting the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott issued a statement saying, ``We're disappointed in the
result, and I'm discussing with my attorney what my options are,
and what I can do next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martins, who agreed to help investigators sort out the
story, were fined $500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other day I discovered some typical inside-the-house food
ants inside my microwave oven. I turned it on for 10 or 20 seconds,
and it didn't kill them. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably because the temperatures never reached high enough,
says Beverly Sparks, entomologist with the University of Georgia
Extension Service. She said an extreme change in temperatures often
will kill many insects. For example, if you have infested food
items, put them in a freezer for five to seven days, or heat them
to 135 degrees for one or two hours. The pests, although hardy,
aren't likely to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I want to attempt a record for listing in the Guinness
Book of Records, how do I pursue it?
</P>
<P>
   A: For most human endeavor categories, the book has specific
guidelines. For instance, every record claim must be thoroughly
documented, with two independent witness statements the minimum
requirement. As the book's editors say, witnesses should be
``people of some standing in the local community,'' such as a
doctor, lawyer, police officer of official of a professional or
athletic association. Certain records also may require the judgment
of an expert, such as a surveyor or public health official. You can
read the details under the heading ``Getting into the Book'' near
the back of the current volume.

</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that french fries can be coated with something so
they absorb less grease and are healthier. How do I do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: As an alternative to deep-frying potatoes in fat,
nutritionist Chris Rosenbloom, a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association, recommends slicing potatoes in wedges or thin
strips, dipping them in egg white, and baking on a cookie sheet
that has been sprayed with Pam or similar product. Bake them at 400
degrees for about 30 minutes, turning them frequently to make them
crisp. A Cajun-type spice mixture can be sprinkled on them, or salt
and pepper, if you want to jazz up the taste.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Children in my Sunday school class asked about the history of
Christmas cards. Do you have any information I can pass along to
them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first card was created in 1843 by John Calcott Horsley,
an English illustrator. It resembled a postcard and featured a
drawing of a family enjoying a Christmas celebration. Smaller
drawings on the card showed people helping the needy. The message:
``Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You.'' About 1,000 of the
cards were sold. By 1860, the custom of exchanging Christmas cards
had spread throughout Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The first Christmas cards manufactured in the United States were
made in 1875 by Louis Prang, a German-born printer in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Al Gore's religion? What church does he and his
family attend in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gore is a Baptist. When he's in Washington, he goes to Mount
Vernon Baptist Church in nearby Arlington, Va., or the National
Cathedral (which is Episcopal). When he's back in Tennessee, he
attends New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was growing up, he and his family attended services
at the church of his father, former Sen. Albert Gore, a Southern
Baptist, and that of his mother, the Church of Christ. He also
attended daily chapel services while a student at the Episcopal-run
St. Albans School in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A year or so ago, I read that Volvo had developed a radiator
that would clean the air. Was that a hoax? I never heard anything
more about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a hoax, but the original timetable announced wasn't
met. Articles about the PremAir catalyst system published in June
1998 said the ``ozone-eating radiator'' would be a feature of
top-of-the-line Volvo S80s during the 1999 model year. That didn't
happen, but Denise Lindsay, spokeswoman for the manufacturer of the
system, Engelhard Corp. of Iselin, N.J., said S80s are now being
produced with the ozone-eating radiators. They will be in U.S.
showrooms in January. The full line of S80s will have them, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   As reported previously, the radiators developed by Engelhard are
coated so they convert at least 75 percent of the ozone flowing
through them into oxygen. The coating is expected to last about
100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Engelhard also is working with Nissan to outfit Sentras sold in
California with the system. No other automaker is known to be
interested in using it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What does it mean when people say they're ``trimming'' a
Christmas tree? I've always said ``decorating'' a tree.
</P>
<P>
   A: They mean the same thing, obviously. One of the definitions
of the word ``trim'' in Webster's New World Dictionary is this:
``to decorate or embellish as by adding ornaments, contrasting
materials, etc. (to trim a Christmas tree).''
</P>
<P>
   Q: We've been hearing a lot lately about being equally concerned
with HDL and LDL cholesterol. How much HDL, LDL and triglycerides
are contained in an average-size egg yolk?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's some confusion in terminology here. HDL (``good''
cholesterol), LDL (``bad'' cholesterol) and triglycerides are
concerned with the amount of fat and cholesterol in the blood, said
Chris Rosenbloom, a professor in the department of nutrition at
Georgia State University and a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   HDL and LDL are protein carriers that take cholesterol into the
blood stream. Food itself doesn't contain HDL or LDL, Rosenbloom
said, but it does carry cholesterol and saturated fat, which can
affect your blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   One egg yolk contains 212 milligrams of cholesterol and 2 grams
of saturated fat. If you're concerned about cholesterol, Rosenbloom
suggests that you follow American Heart Association guidelines,
which call for no more than four egg yolks a week. Egg whites
contain no cholesterol and no saturated fat, so you can use one
yolk and two whites to increase the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that because an egg yolk is low in saturated
fat, it doesn't have as great a negative effect on blood
cholesterol as once was thought, Rosenbloom pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year, Q&AMP;A printed dates for space shuttle launches from
Cape Canaveral. Will you print them for 2000 so we can plan a trip?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven shuttle launches are planned next year. Schedules are
subject to change, so you'd be wise to call ahead for recorded
information _ 407-867-4636 _ before making travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   The first launch for 2000 will be Endeavour, with liftoff
planned during a 40-minute launch window beginning at 1:11 p.m.
Jan. 13. Landing is scheduled at 5:19 p.m. Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Atlantis, with liftoff tentatively scheduled for
March 16, a mission expected to last 11 days; Discovery, June 14,
10 days; Endeavour, July 20, 9 days; Atlantis, Aug. 19, 10 days;
Discovery, Oct. 19, 9 days; and Endeavour, Nov. 30, 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The number of days of the missions is important if you want to
see the shuttle return to the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are green and red the Christmas colors?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia explains that green represents the
continuance of life through the winter and the Christian belief in
eternal life through Christ. Red symbolizes the blood that Jesus
shed at his crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend told me that Oliver Stone, the filmmaker, was a
decorated soldier. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true. Stone enlisted in the Army in 1967 and
specifically requested combat duty in Vietnam. He told an
interviewer later that he joined because he was at loose ends and
seeking ``total anonymity.'' Before that, he taught English and
history at a Chinese school in Saigon, worked as a merchant seaman
on a tanker, and tried to write a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam, Stone was
shot in the neck just two weeks into his tour of duty. He later
sustained several shrapnel wounds. For ``extraordinary acts of
courage under fire'' _ he once wiped out a Viet Cong machine gun
nest with a hand grenade _ he was awarded a Bronze Star and a
Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's experience in the military wasn't a happy one. He told a
Time interviewer later that as soon as he joined his combat unit,
he realized he had made a terrible mistake. He was discharged in
1968. In a Washington Post interview years later, he said he _ like
many Vietnam combat veterans _ experienced feelings of anger, guilt
and alienation. He based his 1986 film ``Platoon'' on his wartime
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that President Truman, while living in the Blair
House when the White House was being renovated, was attacked by a
group of terrorists. Were they part of the same group whose jailed
members were pardoned several months ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: The goal of independence for Puerto Rico is the same, but the
names of the organizations involved are different.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who tried to invade Blair House on Nov. 1, 1950,
were members of Puerto Rico's Nationalist Party. One of the
attackers, Griselio Torresola, was by guards; the other,
Oscar Collazo, was shot but recovered. A letter and a memo found on
Torresola's body bore the signature of Pedro Albizu Campos, leader
of an abortive anti-U.S. Nationalist revolt in Puerto Rico two days
before the Blair House attack. In San Juan, Gov. Luis Munoz Marin,
himself a target of assassins during the Oct. 30 turmoil, said
Communists were using the Nationalists in assassination attempts on
him and on Truman.
</P>
<P>
   The people pardoned by President Clinton in August were members
of FALN (the Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of National
Liberation), also a separatist group. FALN was responsible for a
wave of bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s that left six
dead and dozens wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot of talk about whether America is a Christian
nation at the same time that there seem to be more mosques,
synagogues and temples on the landscape. What's the real breakdown
of religion in North America?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the five major world religions, Christianity is by far the
largest in North America with more than 250 million adherents,
according to Encyclopedia Brittanica's 1999 Book of the Year. There
are roughly 2.5 million Buddhists, 1.3 million Hindus, 6 million
Jews and 4.4 million Muslims. Some 27.5 million people in North
Amerca claim to be nonreligious and 1.6 million say they are
atheists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many Americans actually go to church?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer depends on whom you ask. Although 70 percent of
Americans claim to belong to a church or synagogue, weekly
attendance remains steady at about 40 percent, according to
telephone surveys for the Gallup organization. Sociologists who
have studied head-counts of churches say only about 20 percent show
up for services.
</P>
<P>
   And, a religion scholar at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill splits the difference and estimates that about 30
percent of Americans are in the pews on any given week. ``My
research shows that when you adjust to correct for the people who
aren't included in head counts and use more accurate estimates of
the Catholic and Protestant population in each region, attendance
figures come up substantially,'' said doctoral student Robert
Woodberry said. ``At the same time, most polls oversample regular
church attenders and so overrepresent their opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are Americans spiritual?
</P>
<P>
   A: The percentage of Americans who say they feel the need for
spiritual growth jumped from 58 percent in 1994 to 82 percent in
1998, according to the Gallup organization. Those who say they have
thought a lot about ``the basic meaning and value of their lives''
grew from 58 percent in 1985 to 69 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book called ``Surveying the Religious Landscape,''
authors George Gallup Jr. and Michael Lindsay attribute the growth
to ``a rejection of materialism; a recoiling from the terrible
examples of `man's inhumanity to man' seen in the wars of this
century and in mindless violence; a growing conviction that humans
left to their own devices will destroy themselves; and the belief
that there must be something better ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: As we approach Y2K, why do so many Christians believe the
world will end soon? Do other religions believe in an Apocalypse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most Christian beliefs about end-times are based on the last
book of the Bible, called Revelation. Within all the major
religions there are elements of apocalypticism.
</P>
<P>
   Some Buddhists believe that time eventually will end under Lord
Maitreya. Some Hindus believe cycles of time will bring increasing
social breakdown until the world order ends in catastrophe and the
cycles begin again.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews await a literal messiah from the House of David who
will establish God's kingdom on earth. And, some Muslims believe
that in the last days, monstrous beings called Yajuj and Majuj will
wreak havoc until God destroys them and brings about the
resurrection of the dead and judgment.

<P>
   Q: What issues are looming on the horizon for religious groups
in the new century?
</P>
<P>
   A: As society becomes more complex, so do the issues that
religions must address. In the last few years we've seen new
questions about cloning, human fertility and the end of life. Some
denominations won't accept women clergy or divorced clergy. And
abortion remains a difficult question for many people of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Several major American Protestant groups will have
denominational meetings in 2000. Most meetings are expected to be
dominated by questions about blessing same-sex unions and ordaining
sexually active gays and lesbians to the ministry.

 &HT;    Why we we try the prediction game
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Because everything in her home is waterproof, the
housewife of 2000 can do her daily cleaning with a hose.'' _
Popular Mechanics,1950.
</P>
<P>
   If only that prediction of waterproof houses and waterproof
furniture had come true, then everyone would be able to read this,
work two jobs, handle carpool duties, see a movie and still find
the time to power wash the living room before bed.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, today turned out a tad differently than what people
prophesied 50 and 100 years ago. Of course, anyone could have
predicted that: We're always making predictions, and more often
than not they're way off. And still we can't get enough of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it's not our fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our genetic makeup,'' explained social
psychologist Robert Keefer, who teaches a popular course on
parapsychology at Mount St. Mary's College in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Human beings want to know what the future holds, especially
American human beings.
</P>
<P>
   `` Americans always believe they can move incrementally toward a
more perfect world,'' said J. Walker Smith, Atlanta-based president
of Yankelovich Partners, a leading market research organization.
``Our fascination with predictions comes from us trying to get a
sense of what that more perfect world is going to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially now. Everyone from average folk to experts in the
human mind confirm there's no time like the present for
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is more popular than ever,'' said Richard Wessler,
chairman of the psychology department at New York's Pace
University. ``With all the rapid technological change going on, we
feel like we can't get a handle on it. We want to know what comes
next and what we should pay attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   And naturally, as jingoistic Americans, many of us would like to
think it all started here, probably around the time that the Boston
Tea Party evoked the predictable British reaction. But in fact,
says anthropologist Douglas Raybeck, ``this has been going on since
neolithic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survival of the species is dependent on predictions,''
continued Raybeck, a professor at Hamilton College in upstate New
York and author of an upcoming book on futures studies. ``It can be
as simple as `Where is the (food) going to be?' or `What is the
weather going to be like?' We have to do it.'' The need is nothing
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably on a scroll somewhere, there's some prediction about
Cleopatra's mother,'' sighed Keefer of Mount St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   And the reasons we try to figure out what's going to happen to
us haven't changed much since Cleopatra's times.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, it's a control thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our brain is wired up so that we like answers,'' said Wessler,
who concedes we rarely know that the supposed ``answer'' is true at
the time we latch onto it. ``You can get a certain amount of
psychological security by embracing the prediction, by sort of
fooling yourself into thinking you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that can also be called informed decision-making, when
a person looks at past trendlines, calculates mathematical
probabilities and then makes the call.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more security for some in that approach, but if
it's the future, it's still a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to take a shortcut to life in a sense,'' said
psychologist Robert Butterworth of Los Angeles' International
Trauma Associates. ``It's much easier to have someone tell you
what's going to happen than to have to figure it out with your own
eyes and ears.'' And while some experts say we may have finally
outpredicted ourselves, most agree there's no fighting the nearly
irresistible lure of a simultaneous new century and millennium:
``We just like nice round numbers,'' said Keefer. ``Why else do we
care when our odometer flips over?'' All those zeroes in 2000 add
up to a lot of restless speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if humankind knows in the collective subconscious that
something somewhere is going to happen sometime that is of an
earth-shattering nature,'' Sharon Linzey, a sociology professor at
Oregon's George Fox University, said of this pre-millennial fever
to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Even the psychics are cranking it up a notch or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it all. They want to know what will happen in 2014
or will we have a major earthquake in May 2004,'' said psychic
Linda Salvin, who hosts a twice weekly live radio show on the Cable
Radio Network. ``When they talk about Y2K, some want to know what
will happen to the computers, some want to know if they should move
to Montana. I keep telling everyone we're going to find out
together.''
</P>
<P>
   By which point we'll already be on to our next set of
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, that's just a prediction.

 &HT;    The best recipes of 1999
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For once the best recipes of the year add up to a
full menu. Some years I get caught up in the flavors or ingredient
of the moment. The best recipes one year were long on balsamic
vinegar. Pasta made repeat showings another year.
</P>
<P>
   This year the selection is in nearly perfect balance. First, the
appetizer: Tomatoes Margarita, may be my favorite of the year. Then
there's a spicy black bean soup as well as chicken breasts, with a
recipe for the secret to keeping them juicy. There's a decadent
recipe for steak with blue cheese sauce and one for crisp rack of
lamb. There's also mashed potatoes, this time around freshened with
lemon and chives to bridge the transition from winter to spring.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup includes wonderfully easy biscuits. And, OK, I
cheated. The buttermilk pecan cake is a coffee cake for breakfast.
But it almost tastes like dessert.
</P>
<P>
   TOMATOES MARGARITA
</P>
<P>
   Makes 16-20 servings
</P>
<P>
   2 pints cherry tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cilantro, minced fine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coarse sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup tequila
</P>
<P>
   juice of one lime
</P>
<P>
   Pull the stems from the cherry tomatoes. Rinse and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the minced cilantro with the sea salt in a small bowl.
Combine 1/2 cup tequila and the juice of a lime in another bowl.
Instruct guests to dip the tomatoes in the tequila, then into the
seasoned salt.
</P>
<P>
   (Recipe is from Tomatoes by Patricia Mack (Record, $16.75.)

   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 28 calories, trace

</P>
<P>
   EILEEN'S SPICY BLACK BEAN SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (13 3/4 ounces each) beef broth
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (13 3/4 ounces each) chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried black beans, rinsed and picked over to remove any
grit
</P>
<P>
   1 meaty ham hock or bone
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons ground cumin (yes, amount is correct)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 pickled jalapenos, minced
</P>
<P>
   sour cream
</P>
<P>
   diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   chopped green onions
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add the onions and
garlic; cover and cook over moderately low heat, stirring
occasionally until tender, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add beef and chicken broth, beans, ham hock, spices, jalapenos
and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to moderately low
and simmer, partially covered, stirring and skimming occasionally
for about 2 1/2 hours until beans are tender.
</P>
<P>
   Remove and reserve the ham hock. In a food processor, puree half
of the mixture. Return the puree to the pan with whole beans.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the meat from the ham hock, shred and return to the soup.
Simmer for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve as is or ladle soupy beans over rice. Offer the sour
cream, tomato and green onions as condiments to sprinkle on top.
</P>
<P>
   The original recipe called for 5 pickled jalapenos. Two provide
a warm heat that will be tolerable for all.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The original recipe called for an optional split pig's
foot. My neighbor, who grew up on a farm, sometimes uses that as
well as the ham hock, but says its not necessary.

<P>
   STEAK WITH BLUE CHEESE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   Dash of paprika
</P>
<P>
   Dash of pepper
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   8 ribeye or strip steaks, 1 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   In the top of a double boiler, combine the cheese, wine, lemon
juice, parsley, garlic, paprika and pepper. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until smooth. (This can also be done in a heavy
saucepan over very low heat.) Keep sauce warm while preparing the
steak,
</P>
<P>
   Brush oil in a heavy skillet big enough to accommodate the
steaks (or use two skillets) and heat until a flick of water into
the pan sizzles. Cook the steaks 4 to 5 minutes per side and remove
to a warm platter. Add 1/4 cup water to the pan and stir, scraping
up any browned bits in the bottom of the pan. Add 2 tablespoons of
these juices to the cheese sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the steaks with a generous tablespoon of sauce on top.

<P>
   THE JUICIEST CHICKEN BREASTS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil (or half butter and half oil)
</P>
<P>
   Trim any fat from chicken with kitchen scissors. Mix salt and
sugar, and sprinkle evenly over both sides of the chicken. Rub the
mixture into the meat. Place in a plastic bag, seal and refrigerate
for 8 hours, though a minimum of 4 hours will provide some
enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, rinse the chicken breasts thoroughly to
remove the salt and sugar rub. Dry on paper towels, then sprinkle
each side with pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
chicken breasts and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides
and cooked through,
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 minutes per side, depending on the size of the breasts.
</P>
<P>
   (Use the technique in any favorite recipe for chicken breast or
serve as is, garnished with salsa or chutney.)

<P>
   CREAM BISCUITS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8-10 biscuits
</P>
<P>
   2 cups White Lily self-rising flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cream, whipping or half and half
</P>
<P>
   Place self-rising flour in a large bowl. Stir in cream, just
until dough is blended.
</P>
<P>
   Use two large serving spoons to drop dough onto a very lightly
greased cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   For rolled biscuits: Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface,
knead 4 or 5 times. Then roll or pat dough out to 1/2-inch
thickness. With a biscuit cutter, cut dough into biscuits.
(Old-time cooks may have used a jelly glass to cut out the
biscuits, but a cutter makes a prettier biscuit with a cleaner
edge.) Roll any scraps and cut more biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned in a 450-degree
oven.
</P>
<P>
   While White Lily flour is available in Dayton, that company's
self-rising flour is difficult to find in other cities. You may
substitute 2 cups all-purpose flour, combined with 1/2 teaspoon
salt , 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 3 teaspoons baking powder; or
use 1 cup of national brand self-rising flour and 1/2 cup instant
flour (such as Wondra) or cake flour, plus 1/2 teaspoon baking
powder.
</P>
<P>
   Note: For shortcake, add a tablespoon of sugar.

   MASHED POTATOES WITH LEMON AND CHIVES
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup snipped fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds Russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup buttermilk, warmed
</P>
<P>
   Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a small heavy skillet over
low heat. Add garlic and saute
</P>
<P>
   1 minute without browning, Mix in lemon zest and chives. Set
aside
</P>
<P>
   Cook potatoes in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Return potatoes to the pot and
mash. Add the chive mixture and 1/3 cup of the buttermilk and the
remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Mash together. Add remaining
buttermilk if necessary to achieve the proper texture. Season with
salt and pepper.

   SMOKIN' CHIPOTLE COLESLAW
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 to 10 servings
</P>
<P>
   Slaw:
</P>
<P>
   1 small head cabbage, shredded
</P>
<P>
   1/4 head red cabbage, shredded
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup thin-sliced green onions
</P>
<P>
   1 fresh poblano or Anaheim chile, grilled, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, grilled, peeled and cut into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   Chipotle Dressing:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons unsulphured molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 canned chipotle chiles, minced, plus 2 teaspoons adobo sauce
</P>
<P>
   Combine the slaw ingredients in a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the dressing, whisking the ingredients in a medium bowl.
Toss the dressing with the slaw (you won't need all the dressing,
so reserve some for another use). Refrigerate for at least 1 hour
for the flavors to develop. Several hours is even better.

   CRISP-ROASTED RACK OF LAMB
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   2 racks of lamb, each about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Strip most of the surface fat from
the lamb (your butcher may already have done this). Cut between the
ribs, almost down to the meaty eye. Divide each rack in half down
the middle, sprinkle with salt and pepper and place in a roasting
pan.
</P>
<P>
   Roast for 15 minutes, then insert a meat thermometer straight in
from one end into the meatiest part. If it reads 125 degrees or
more, remove the lamb immediately. If it reads 120 degrees or less,
put the lamb back for about 5 minutes. Remove and let sit for 5
minutes; this will give you medium to medium-rare lamb on the outer
ribs, medium-rare to rare in the center. Cook a little longer for
more doneness. Serve, separating the ribs by cutting down straight
through them.

   OVERNIGHT BUTTERMILK PECAN COFFEE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 to 15 servings
</P>
<P>
   Cake:
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Place the butter and sugars in the large bowl of an electric
mixer and beat until well combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs
and beat just until the eggs are incorporated. Combine the flour,
cinnamon, baking powder, soda and salt. Add to batter alternately
with the buttermilk. Beat a minute or two at medium low speed so
that the batter is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil and flour a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Shake out any
excess flour.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine the light brown sugar, pecans and
cinnamon. Scatter this topping evenly over the batter. Dribble the
topping with melted butter. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and
refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, place a rack in the center of the oven and
preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the pan from the
refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. If the pan is glass, let
it sit at room temperature until the chill is off before putting it
into the oven. Bake the coffee cake for 30 to 32 minutes, until the
cake springs back in the center when lightly pressed with your
finger and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Remove the pan to a wire rack to cool 15 minutes. Cut into squares
and serve warm.

 &HT;    Your goal: Don't hit anyone with the corkBy Dale Rice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The countdown has started. In mere hours,
shortly before midnight Friday (or earlier, if you plan to
celebrate all evening), you'll pull that expensive bottle of
champagne out of the fridge, pop it open and prepare to welcome
2000 with a millennial toast.
</P>
<P>
   Not to burst your bubbles, but are you doing everything
necessary to get the most out of that bottle of fine wine? Are you
going to chill it to the optimum temperature? Do you even know what
that is? And how about opening it? Do you know the key steps?
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost a ton; you might as well enjoy every last golden
drop,'' says Ross Outon, the beer and wine manager of Austin's
Central Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the expense involved in a fine bottle of champagne,
you're not doing yourself any favor by not chilling it down or
letting the wine gush and losing all your bubbles or spilling it
all over the room.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is an important moment, and you want to
celebrate it in style. So here's a little help to make sure that
bottle of fine wine is treated with the respect it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   First, chill it properly. The ideal temperature for champagne is
42 to 47 degrees. You can achieve that easily in one of two ways.
Place it in a bucket filled with ice and water 30 to 40 minutes
before you plan to serve it, or put it in the vegetable bin of your
refrigerator several hours before celebration time.
</P>
<P>
   Second, open it carefully. Don't stage some ``I Love Lucy''
episode with a rocketing cork and champagne geyser. (You've
invested a lot in that bottle; you don't want even a single sip to
land on the floor.) That means handling the bottle with care.
</P>
<P>
   Point the bottle away from loved ones and party guests while
opening it _ just in case that cork is propelled out of the bottle
with surprising force. Hold the cork firmly and twist the bottle
just until you feel the cork beginning to push out. Then let the
pressure inside the bottle gently eject the cork.
</P>
<P>
   Third, pour it properly. Pour a small amount into each glass,
allow the bubbles to subside and then fill it two-thirds full.
Saucer-shaped glasses, popularized in the movies, allow the
champagne to quickly lose its effervescence. Use tall flute or
tulip glasses instead.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're ready for the stroke of midnight, a magical moment
perfectly suited for a special toast.
</P>

obituary. The twice-widowed Bessie Margaret Brunner Smith Georgeff

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Homosexuals are no more than 10
percent of the population, and polls show that more than 80 percent

more than 80 percent of Americans are homophobes. It's just that
there is scant support outside the homosexual community for
homosexual marriages. The rights of American citizens, however, are
not granted by popular vote. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 &HT;    Wild-card Wayne to break the tie in J.J. vs. Dan?
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You might like to know that there are
four scenarios _ discounting the possibility of any game ending in
a tie and, please, let's not go there _ involving the Dolphins'
playoff hopes as they relate to the Sunday afternoon results of
Oakland vs. Kansas City and Seattle vs. New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   You might also like to know that in three of those four
scenarios, the Dolphins advance to AFC playoff competition.
</P>
<P>
   The only manner in which the Dolphins would be left home is if
Seattle and Kansas City both win. In that case, Seattle would earn
the AFC West title and Kansas City would get the AFC's sixth and
last seed over Miami based either on a better record (10-6 to 9-7
in the event of a Dolphins loss Sunday at Washington) or on a
better record within the conference (8-4 to 7-5 in the event of a
Dolphins victory Sunday against the Redskins).
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Dolphins will go trotting off to play at either
Seattle or Kansas City, depending on which of those teams wins the
AFC West championship and which is left out of the playoff party.
If both the Seahawks and Chiefs lose, the Dolphins go to Seattle.
If the Seahawks win and the Chiefs lose, the Dolphins go to
Seattle. If the Seahawks lose and the Chiefs win, the Dolphins go
to Kansas City
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, is anywhere near as interesting as four
other scenarios that will soon enough present themselves to the
Dolphins:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy and Dan both stay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy and Dan both go.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy stays and Dan goes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy goes and Dan stays.
</P>
<P>
   To review for those of you who haven't been following the Coach
Johnson-Quarterback Marino fussfest _ and, hey, have you heard
about this millennium thing? _ let's just say Bill Clinton and Ken
Starr got along better than J.J. and DannyBoy do.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the situation must resolve itself or _ wonder if
Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga is reading? _ be resolved for the
mismatched pair.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion stated in this space just two weeks ago still holds.
One or the other or both Johnson and Marino must go if the Dolphins
are to breathe again. And my heart still says Miami would be better
off without Johnson, but my head still says the team would be
better off without Marino if a choice between the two must be made.
</P>
<P>
   But the task now lies in examination of the possibilities
involving Johnson and Marino:
</P>
<P>
   _ THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO: Jimmy and Dan both stay. Never write
never, but the likelihood of this happening is almost nil. Why?
Because if Johnson does stay, he'll demand a seat of unchallenged
power when it comes to making personnel decisions. And he's not
about to carry Marino at a price that will crunch the team's salary
cap when he can get rid of him to the Dolphins' comparative
economic benefit. And it's worth understanding that Johnson would
be willing to use Damon Huard as his starting quarterback unless or
until he can find a better one. Chance Factor _ 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE ESCAPE SCENARIO: Jimmy and Dan both go. The element that
works against this proposition is that if one or the other of the
protagonists does blink and announce his leave, then the other guy
is going to want to stay on the scene to see how things work in a
quieter environment. The egos of the men involved are simply too
large to allow either of them to be the first to quit or, for that
matter, to follow the other's lead in doing so. Chance Factor _ 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE JOHNSON SCENARIO: Jimmy stays and Dan goes. The whole
thing might come down to how much Johnson wants to keep trying to
climb the Super Bowl mountain. He was gone last January, you'll
remember, until he either changed his mind or had it changed by
someone else. Johnson won't, as stated in Doomsday, endure another
season with Marino as his quarterback. If he does convince himself
that he wants to come back, Johnson's play could be a visit to
Huizenga's office to ask the owner to choose between coach and
quarterback. That would absolve Johnson of having to make the
decision, and provide him a way out or the absolute command he
wants and needs but doesn't have with this team as long as Marino
is in the locker room. Chance Factor _ 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE MARINO SCENARIO: Jimmy goes and Dan stays. Marino might
settle in and wait out Johnson's move. He might figure the coach
will quit again, and not return this time. Or he might figure his
17-year history in Miami is worth more than Johnson's four years
with the Dolphins, and gamble on that very thing if Huizenga is
brought in _ perhaps even by Marino _ to broker a him-or-me deal.
Marino, without a Super Bowl ring to Johnson's two earned as boss
in Dallas, might be more desperate for another chase. Chance Factor
_ 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of matter, Johnson is in control until he gives it
up or Huizenga takes it away.
</P>
<P>
   The coach-in-waiting, for now, is Miami assistant and Johnson
buddy Dave Wannstedt, who was brought in this season.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback-in-waiting, for now, is Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson-Marino? Wannstedt-Marino? Johnson-Huard?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions, lingering beyond whatever playoff horizon does
or doesn't exist, are the biggest questions facing the Dolphins.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Edwin Arldt had known Doris Kappler for only a
few months. But he had his eye on a 1946 Plymouth. The car lot
wanted $500 down, and that, Edwin did not have. It wasn't for lack
of working. He was a hard worker. After he came home from the
service, he used his GI benefits to go to an auto mechanic school
in Giddings, Texas. He would do that in the mornings, then work at
a John Deere dealership in the afternoon. When he left work at 6
p.m., he'd go out to the family farm and work there, sometimes
until 2 in the morning. After a few hours' sleep, he'd be back at
school. In 1949, he landed a mechanic job at an Austin car
dealership. The pay wasn't great, and all he had for the down
payment on the Plymouth was $200. He asked Doris if she had the
rest. Like him, she was from a German family in Lee County. She was
doing housework in Austin. They'd met at a dance. She gave him the
money. (Kelley, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

<P>
   PREDICTIONS _ ``Because everything in her home is waterproof,
the housewife of 2000 can do her daily cleaning with a hose,''
Popular Mechanics predicted in 1950, back when people still used
words like housewife. Alas, today turned out a tad differently than
what people prophesied 50 and 100 years ago. Of course, anyone
could have predicted that: We're always making predictions,
invariably they're way off, and still, we can't get enough of 'em.

 &HT;    Favorite foods dressed up for the millennium
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Food companies have made it possible for us to
party all day in a mega-millennium mood.
</P>
<P>
   To get into the spirit, you start your day with Millenios _ from
Cheerios, who else? _ and spoon your way through a bowl of Os, with
2s thrown in for appropriate measure.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch on SpaghettiOs. It's the same song, second verse _ that
gimmick of tossing 2s into the can of Os.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the afternoon snack: M&AMP;M's 2000. Look closely at
those confetti-colored candies in your hand. No 2s, but purple and
robin's-egg-blue coatings to jazz up the mix. Forget about brown
and orange candies for this celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Happy hour brings the millennial edition of Chex Mix. Look
closely at those pretzels. I'm no math genius, but it reads 2000 to
me.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's not enough, reach for the Goldfish 2000. Those
friendly Pepperidge Farm fish have bigger smiles than usual on
their cheesy faces. Are those party hats on their heads? You bet
your gills. Top hats, bow ties _ these guppies are ready to
p-a-r-t-y.
</P>
<P>
   And so are you.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Edwin Arldt had known Doris Kappler for only a
few months. But he had his eye on a 1946 Plymouth. The car lot
wanted $500 down, and that, Edwin did not have. It wasn't for lack
of working. He was a hard worker. After he came home from the
service, he used his GI benefits to go to an auto mechanic school
in Giddings, Texas. He would do that in the mornings, then work at
a John Deere dealership in the afternoon. When he left work at 6
p.m., he'd go out to the family farm and work there, sometimes
until 2 in the morning. After a few hours' sleep, he'd be back at
school. In 1949, he landed a mechanic job at an Austin car
dealership. The pay wasn't great, and all he had for the down
payment on the Plymouth was $200. He asked Doris if she had the
rest. Like him, she was from a German family in Lee County. She was
doing housework in Austin. They'd met at a dance. She gave him the
money. (Kelley, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

<P>
   PREDICTIONS _ ``Because everything in her home is waterproof,
the housewife of 2000 can do her daily cleaning with a hose,''
Popular Mechanics predicted in 1950, back when people still used
words like housewife. Alas, today turned out a tad differently than
what people prophesied 50 and 100 years ago. Of course, anyone
could have predicted that: We're always making predictions,
invariably they're way off, and still, we can't get enough of 'em.

 &HT;     ADOPTION: AN ANTHOLOGY OF VOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BERNADETTE FAY  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO_ There have been memoirs, remembrances and how-tos
on the
</P>
<P>
   subject of adoption. But ``A Ghost at Heart's Edge, Stories
</P>
<P>
   and Poems About Adoption,'' published by North Atlantic Books,
</P>
<P>
   is the first book to look at adoption through the lens of
</P>
<P>
   fiction. The anthology of 52 poems and stories navigates a
</P>
<P>
   landscape that stretches from searing loss to ecstasy, from
</P>
<P>
   naked pain to reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Co-editors Tina Cervin and Susan Ito have assembled a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable collection of voices from all sides of the adoption
</P>
<P>
   triad, from Charles Baxter, Alison Lurie and Louise Erdrich to
</P>
<P>
   lesser-known writers and poets. Nothing is taken for granted
</P>
<P>
   here. The collection bursts with a tumult of issues that shake
</P>
<P>
   us to our bones. Who are we? How do we find our way? What is
</P>
<P>
   family? Of course, searching for one's place in the world is
</P>
<P>
   nothing new to literature. And that's partly the point of the
</P>
<P>
   book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The themes of family, selfhood, loss, joy are universal
</P>
<P>
   themes,'' says Cervin.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to present as many perspectives as possible
</P>
<P>
   about adoption, which touches 30 million Americans ? ``To open
</P>
<P>
   the door,'' Cervin says.
</P>
<P>
   It took them seven years to pull it off. Two weeks after
</P>
<P>
   placing requests for submissions in ``Poets &AMP; Writers'' and
</P>
<P>
   ``Associated Writing Programs,'' and two weeks before Cervin's
</P>
<P>
   first son was born, they were swamped with manuscripts. Ito
</P>
<P>
   was herself a new mother, and the two spent the next several
</P>
<P>
   years schlepping shopping bags full of stories and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   There was one fact keeping them focused: Ito, who teaches
</P>
<P>
   writing and is adopted, recently had found her birth mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cervin remembers she kept telling Ito, ``You should do a book
</P>
<P>
   about adoption.'' Ito finally followed her friend's advice, on
one condition: that Cervin, a psychotherapist and poet, do the book
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ito's life story is itself the stuff of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Half-Japanese, she was placed as an infant with a Japanese
</P>
<P>
   couple who had spent 10 years waiting for a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were constantly, as a family, barraged by (race
</P>
<P>
   questions),'' Ito says. ``At one point, it was in the early
</P>
<P>
   '60s .,.,. they were traveling with me in the South, and
</P>
<P>
   someone actually accused them of kidnapping me.'' Ito tells
</P>
<P>
   the story without bitterness or anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of people who are adopted can `pass'
</P>
<P>
   as not being adopted,'' Ito says. ``But especially with
</P>
<P>
   transracial adoptions, it's there all the time. I think we
</P>
<P>
   just all swallowed it down and pretended it wasn't there. And
</P>
<P>
   I think that's one reason why, for me, it's such a relief to
</P>
<P>
   have voices that talk about difficult things.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all under the lumpy carpet _ it's all under the
</P>
<P>
   surface of our lives as a family, but nobody talks about it.
</P>
<P>
   So I feel that, in a way, this book is like, not redemption,''
</P>
<P>
   Ito says, searching for the right word, ``but acknowledgement
</P>
<P>
   of all the complexities of (adoption).''
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the anthology, Cervin says, is getting to
</P>
<P>
   the truth of a difficult subject. Part of that truth is pain.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stories and poems deal with the pain of adoption _
</P>
<P>
   on all sides. Many of the stories peek under the lumpy carpet
</P>
<P>
   to see, as in Isabel Allende's ``The Road North,'' trafficking
</P>
<P>
   in Latin American children; or, in poems by Jackie Kay and Mi
Song Bruining, the brittle realities of transracial adoption and
the burden of being ``chosen,'' which masks the burden of having
been given up.
</P>
<P>
   This prompts two questions: What does fiction offer that
</P>
<P>
   nonfiction doesn't? And, can someone who isn't adopted write
</P>
<P>
   truthfully about the experience?
</P>
<P>
   Ito believes fiction allows people to see more truthfully,
</P>
<P>
   to plumb ideas and emotions with a certain detachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a distance that allows people to go deeper,'' she
</P>
<P>
   says.
</P>
<P>
   Cervin nods, adding, ``It's a distance that brings you
</P>
<P>
   closer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the validity of writing from personal experience,
</P>
<P>
   Cervin says, ``There's always that argument within the writing
</P>
<P>
   community: Do you have to have personal experience to write
</P>
<P>
   about something? A writer or poet has to have a certain
</P>
<P>
   ability to tap into something if you want to write about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to write a poem about being adopted, and I'm
</P>
<P>
   not adopted. But I've known Susan for almost 20 years, and my
</P>
<P>
   mother went on a search for her father, and I've known many
</P>
<P>
   people who were adopted. I feel I tapped into the experience
</P>
<P>
   both of the people I know, but also just the human experience
</P>
<P>
   of identity and search for meaning, and how does this piece of
</P>
<P>
   information fit into my life?''
</P>
<P>
   Good writing, of course, makes every story autobiography,
</P>
<P>
   every word telling, every emotion true. But Ito and Cervin
</P>
<P>
   have been criticized because the author blurbs at the back of
</P>
<P>
   their anthology don't necessarily reveal who has had real
</P>
<P>
   experience with adoption and who hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a strength,'' Cervin says. ``Because our goal was
</P>
<P>
   a literary collection. And I think first and foremost people
</P>
<P>
   represented themselves as writers, not as adopted people who
</P>
<P>
   are writers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does show how familiar words _ family, mother,
</P>
<P>
   Identity _ can be weighted with new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the hardest part of collecting the 52 entries?
</P>
<P>
   After weeding out the sappy and the sentimental, after the
</P>
<P>
   hand-wringing over the voices that weren't heard from (the
</P>
<P>
   editors wished they had received more stories on transracial
</P>
<P>
   adoptions, and lesbian and gay adoptions), the two had to come
</P>
<P>
   up with a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both finally feel really good about the title,'' Ito
</P>
<P>
   says, laughing with something that sounds like relief. ``I
</P>
<P>
   feel it's so perfect because it really reflects every facet of
</P>
<P>
   the triad experience. There's that ghost if you're adopted _
</P>
<P>
   the family you don't know or the people you don't know who
</P>
<P>
   created you. And then if you're the birth parent, the kind of
</P>
<P>
   phantom child who isn't with you anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I also think for the adoptive parents there's the ghost of
the children they might have had or maybe wanted to have that
didn't materialize, because so many adoptive parents have
infertility as their way of getting into adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they found their title in a submission by Katharyn
Howd Machan:
</P>
<P>
   20 years now
</P>
<P>
   I have lived with others,
</P>
<P>
   your unknown name
</P>
<P>
   like a ghost at heart's edge
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, after seven years, they have their book _
</P>
<P>
   a remarkable chorus of pregnant teens and wary women; fathers
</P>
<P>
   relinquishing fatherhood or gaining relationships; mothers
</P>
<P>
   being sought and would-be mothers seeking; and, of course, the
</P>
<P>
   adopted _ babies, adolescents and adults negotiating the whole
</P>
<P>
   crazy DNA dance and searching for something that looks like
</P>
<P>
   home.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ So far it's been a week of few surprises and
many lists. The last week of the 20th century is nearly over, but
it's fair to say that, for sheer surprise value, the top story is
the discovery that Time magazine still exists.
</P>
<P>
   Time named Albert Einstein ``Person of the Century`` on Monday,
after worldwide publicity about the announcement on Sunday. Time is
relative, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Time, the magazine, is relativistic. The magazine seriously
considered Adolf Hitler for the honor of ``Person of the Century,``
but the ultimate argument against Hitler by Time's editor was that
``he lost.``
</P>
<P>
   This from the magazine that named Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com
``Person of the Year,`` even though his company has lost $800
million.
</P>
<P>
   Time's readers voted Jesus Christ ``Person of the Century,`` but
as the first person born in the first century, He was ruled
ineligible and, naturally, Elvis took over first place.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes at the end of what Time's founder, Henry Luce,
proclaimed would be ``the American century.``
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 story of the last week of the end of the century, and
the millennium, is the dire threat posed by reading about the Y2K
computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse reactions range from irrational purchases of caches of
arms to brain death caused by toxic levels of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century, which brought the human race industrialized
murder (see Hitler, above) and death by split atoms (see Einstein,
above), is ending with whimpers about ATMs going out of service
because of software glitches.
</P>
<P>
   This is a century that deserves to end.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 story of this millennial-final week is the threat of
international and domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   We have been told not to panic and to enjoy our New Year's
parties, yet we have been told to be aware of possible attacks on
large millennial celebrations. That ought to keep the last three
sane people at home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about these terrorists. Pardon me if I'm not terrified.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of members of the San Joaquin County Militia have been
charged with plotting to blow up two liquid propane storage tanks
near Elk Grove, Calif. Their plan supposedly was to create a panic
in which martial law would be declared, with the citizens rebelling
and turning to the militia for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds half-baked, the militiamen would have been fully
flame-broiled. They allegedly planned to detonate the tanks, which
would devastate thousands of acres, by hitting them with homemade
bombs fired from a homemade shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the international terrorism front, the FBI has
been searching for the partner of an alleged Algerian terrorist
caught crossing the border from Canada with a car laced with hidden
explosives. An airline ticket agent says the missing suspect bought
a ticket to Las Vegas, and she remembers him because he became
``argumentative.``
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to cool terrorists like Carlos the Jackal? And
why Las Vegas, a city where casino owners blow up their own
buildings?
</P>
<P>
   The No. 4 story this week is a perennial, not a millennial. In
case you started holing up early for Y2K, you might want to know
that holiday travel is worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco International Airport has been named the nation's
worst airport for delays, and now airport security has been stepped
up because of the warnings about possible terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, terrorists can board planes armed with guns and knives, at
least if there's a stopover in Nepal. Sure, suicidal pilots or bad
wiring bring down more planes than bombs. And Lord knows who's
handling the baggage.
</P>
<P>
   But in a democratic society we must pay the price of vigilance _
an eternal wait at a metal detector while low-wage security guards
wave beeping wands over orthopedic pins and navel rings.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 5 story of the last week of this century and millennium
is the transformation of the American media from news-gathering
services into wool-gathering services. The press is fully fluffed
with lists, predictions and end-of-era summaries.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN picked the top 100 athletes of the century, with Michael
Jordan finishing just ahead of Babe Ruth. Air barely beats out
beer. Babe Ruth an athlete. You have to love it.

WRITING STILL COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; `Bad writing is everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   So writes Peter Post, coauthor of ``The Etiquette Advantage in
Business,'' a primer for business executives and employees who want
to better understand how to write, behave, dress, or speak in an
era of lightning-fast communication and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that business writing is a craft under
siege,'' writes Post, the grandson of the queen of etiquette, Emily
Post. ``Bad writing is everywhere _ writing so poorly constructed
that it is nonsensical; so ungrammatical that it is illiterate; so
obfuscating that it is unintelligible. Yet in our so-called
Information Age, no skill is more important than the ability to
organize and convey information with clarity and coherence.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite our new reliance on electronic communication, the
business letter and the memo still require such coherence and
clarity. With that in mind, Post offers tips on letter writing,
memo writing, grammar, and what's right or wrong, hip or passe when
conveying a message via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail tends to be informal, but that informality is no excuse
for grammatical errors or misspellings,'' Post said in a recent
interview. ``Tone is important, too. Typing in all capital letters
is an indication that you are shouting your message. So, use them
sparingly.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail and faxes have revolutionized the office. By reducing our
reliance on paper memos, promoting the exchange of computerized
files, and permitting off-site workers to discuss projects with
co-workers or managers from afar, electronic communication has
slashed the amount of time spent on business travel and research,
Post said.
</P>
<P>
   But this easily accessible mode of communication is easily
abused. Indeed, Post warns that making mistakes or misusing e-mail
can have serious consequences:
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following examples:
</P>
<P>
   --A friend sends you a confidential e-mail from her home to your
office and requests that you respond immediately. What do you do?
``Unless laws are enacted, your employer has the right to monitor
and intercept your e-mail, to access e-mail you have received, and
to retrieve e-mail from your computer's hard drive that you may
have dumped or deleted,'' writes Post. He adds that sending
proprietary company data to a friend is no different than lifting
confidential files from the company vault. Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   --You receive a message from someone at the company, a joke,
perhaps, that seems inappropriate. How should you respond?
According to Post, the best response is no response on company
time. ``Plus, it may be dangerous to rely on (e-mail) for
confidential communications, because it could be duplicated,
altered, or forged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --You've heard that job hunting via the Internet is a cinch.
Should you try it during your free time or lunch break? According
to Post and coauthor Peggy Post, Internet job searches or research
should be avoided. ``Having your boss or anyone else in your
company come across a search means the cat's out of the bag and you
may have to suffer the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail etiquette is not the only topic covered by the Posts' new
book. The authors spend a significant amount of time reviewing
longstanding social traditions, such as the old-fashioned
handshake, standard introductions, and what to do if you are seated
when a guest enters a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether introducing yourself or being introduced by others,
smile and stay relaxed,'' the Posts advise. ``A warm smile, eye
contact, a firm handshake, and a sincere greeting are essential to
a successful first meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what should you do when meeting a newcomer in a business
setting? Here are some tips:
</P>
<P>
   --First, stand up. Today, say the authors, this rule applies to
men and women alike. ``If you are seated, failing to rise could
suggest that you think the other person unimportant. Even if you
are wedged behind a table at a restaurant, briefly lift yourself
out of your chair while extending your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   --State your greeting. ``How do you do'' and ``hello'' are still
regarded as standard greetings. Use them.
</P>
<P>
   --Shake hands. For years, the handshake has been in order, not
only when you are being introduced but also when you are leaving a
group of people you have just met or welcoming someone new into a
group.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an era of offhand greetings, the handshake continues to
be an important social greeting, one that not only conveys
sincerity if done correctly but also gives others a chance to size
you up. A limp handshake, for example, suggests hesitance or
mousiness; a bone-cruncher conveys dominance. And a medium
handshake, the authors say, suggests confidence and authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your grip speaks volumes,'' they say.

WRINGING OUT THE OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martha Stewart didn't write to me this year, alas. Happily,
others did.
</P>
<P>
   I've never received more column mail than I did this March,
after Joe DiMaggio's death. I had suggested that ``much of the
public mourning for Joe DiMaggio is really keening for the bygone
era of the white athlete.'' My phone lit up with phlegmy epithets,
and I gather I was pilloried on sports talk shows _ I was crouched
far too low in my bunker to know firsthand. The mail was generally
negative, with a few exceptions. A reader in Wisconsin wrote in:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some related questions for you on the subject of race
in sports: Has anyone pointed out the racial slant in two of
today's most popularized spectator sports, stock-car racing and the
Grand Guignol called pro wrestling? Is it only accidental that
those so-called sports show white males winning much more often
than not? Without overt racism, but certainly with subtle exclusion
or unsubtle play-acting, the winners overwhelmingly resemble the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days later (March 17), an article about Al Capp
tapped many recollections about the man whom reader Addison Parks
called ``The father of the politically incorrect.'' Capp's former
assistant, Larry May, went out and read the brief Capp biography by
Alex Theroux that prompted my column. ``Theroux never met Capp,''
May wrote. ``He may have spoken with family members, the first
people the tyro biographer should avoid. The families never tell
the truth because they have too much to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Capp's grandson, William Capp Peirce, also wrote
in: ``I found it a little ironic to read the article in your paper.
Obscurity is apparently what the Boston Globe editors of 25 years
ago wanted for him. They were one of the first papers to drop his
strip'' at the time of the cartoonist's much-publicized personal
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pity the Poor Pool Owner,'' (June 9) in which I whined about
owning a pool (!), garnered plenty of attention. Right-thinking
readers everywhere denounced me as a class enemy. My colleague
Diane White inquired why, if I was so desperately seeking censure,
I hadn't just beaten myself over the head with a stick. Good
question.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers derided my complaint that pool chemistry
required ``Nobel Prize''-level knowledge. Just keep dumping in
Clorox and baking soda, this line of advice ran; you'll be fine.
But one reader understood the maddening complexity of satiating the
pool gods: ``There were the green algae, the white algae, the brown
algae, and the dreaded red algae which slimed the walls for weeks
on end during one torrid summer. There was free chlorine, bound
chlorine, chlorites, and shock treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Yet the greatest irony of pool life is the family
ecology: You create an environment incapable of sustaining any
life, and then toss in your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, my love letter to the New Yorker of yesteryear,
``In Tina's wake a devastated New Yorker,'' touched a deep chord
with that magazine's many loyal readers. Charles Brenner of
Lexington fell in love with the New Yorker in 1962, and was once
offered a lifetime subscription. Instead, he ended up canceling
during the Tina Brown regime. ``The Brown years were the literary
equivalent of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers,'' he wrote. ``The
shell was the same, but the soul was gone. My subscription
cancellation was, I am sure, noted only by a computer, but in my
imagination Tina greeted it with pleasure: good riddance, you
stodgy uptight unbuzzable dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Software developer Daniel Caine, himself a tart and taut writer,
ably defended the new, ``New'' New Yorker regime: ``I can
understand why you feel that the New Yorker has suffered under Tina
Brown and her successor. You are probably a serious and thoughtful
reader.'' Fighting words, Mr. Caine!
</P>
<P>
   Caine likes the magazine's informed coverage of affairs
``political, media, medical, commercial.'' He continues: ``I
understand what you are saying about the old New Yorker. There was
a certain joy in the accretive accumulation of detail upon detail
upon detail, and the soothing comfort of sentences that rolled _ or
even glided in a unique, measured, purposeful way _ luxuriously
onward toward their delightful and ultimately satisfying
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who has time for that anymore? The old New Yorker was
enormously guilt-inducing, as I hardly ever read anything in it.
The new New Yorker, I do read _ usually between two-thirds and all
of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said. Best wishes for a happy new year!

FINDING A SMART ROUTE OUT OF A JAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ 'Twas five days before Christmas, and all
through their Kendall Square control center the crew at SmartRoutes
Systems Inc. was in high gear. All roads to Boston's suburban
shopping malls were filling fast, and, as darkness fell, icy
pavement had closed highways near Worcester and in New Hampshire,
while police and tow trucks cleared multiple-car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   And then, seated at a console in front of a 10-foot-high wall of
video screens pulsating with views of traffic throughout the
region, Pete Sutton took a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   It was shortly after 5 p.m., and the caller was one of the many
motorists who volunteer to report to SmartRoutes what they see.
Sutton, speaking louder so others could hear over the blare of
police radios, repeated what he was being told:
</P>
<P>
   ``Car rolled over on 128 northbound near 138 in Canton.''
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, word of this accident that was about to close an
exit ramp was being spread: on the automated SmarTraveler telephone
recordings that take an average of 14,000 calls a day; on Internet
Web pages that thousands of office workers check for last-minute
traffic news before heading home; and to thousands of drivers on
the road listening to radio broadcasts by Boston stations whose
on-air reporters work in this control room.
</P>
<P>
   Precision handoffs such as this are all in a day's work at
SmartRoutes _ not just in Boston but in five other big-city markets
where the company operates similar services that aim to keep
traffic moving smoothly by guiding motorists around the jams.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its popularity, though, SmartRoute Systems is in a jam
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when entrepreneur Stephen P. Crosby bought a
struggling technology company and rebuilt it as SmartRoutes, the
company has burned through $25 million in investor money. Crosby
said about $4 million was from him, his colleagues, and their
families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was from venture capital investors. Last summer, as
SmartRoutes was halfway through a year that management now says
will yield $9 million in revenues but a $5.5 million loss, Sandler
Capital Management, which had the largest stake in the company,
made its move.
</P>
<P>
   In August, after weeks of fruitless negotiations, Sandler
managing partner Douglas Schimmel fired Crosby, chief technology
officer John P. Liebesny, and operations officer David Stein. More
staff cuts followed. Management says 22 jobs were axed, leaving 186
employees. Crosby says there were 30 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But, more critically, a new chief executive was hired, Arnie
Sheiffer, 62. Sheiffer grew up in Boston, graduated from Boston
University, and has an MBA from New York University. He is also a
friend of Schimmel and had just finished taking Katz Media, a media
advertising sales company that Sandler had backed, into the black.
</P>
<P>
   Sheiffer was told to produce revenue and develop a new business
plan that could save SmartRoutes from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Sheiffer said in an interview, he hopes to
make SmartRoutes profitable by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, he said, he wants to make SmarTraveler a
recognized brand in what is becoming a competitive market in
traffic information, by expanding it beyond its current cities _
Boston; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Cincinnati; Detroit; and
Minneapolis-St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``SmartRoutes is headquartered in Boston, but it is becoming a
national business,'' the tanned, silver-haired Sheiffer said in his
office, decorated with mural-size photos of New York City's
bridges. ``One of the reasons I am here is to get it into the 20
largest markets in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Both goals _ profitability and expansion _ face considerable,
and fast-changing, obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle is competition and the rapid consolidation of the
radio industry.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the fast pace of technology, including what many
see as the next Internet phase: elimination of wires and cables as
transmission is moved to the airwaves and delivered to wireless
devices.
</P>
<P>
   But one advantage SmartRoutes has had that others have lacked is
the interest and ability to work with state transportation agencies
to glean and distribute timely traffic reports.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the SmartTraveler programs that SmartRoutes has
put in place began with public agency contracts. Most call for
direct payments by the agencies to SmartRoutes. In Detroit,
however, SmartRoutes has exclusive rights to distribute and resell
traffic data from public sources, with any profits to be split
evenly between the company and the state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   State contracts haven't been enough to make SmartRoutes
profitable, however. That's where Sheiffer and a marketing staff he
has put in place are getting ready to break ground as they enter a
highly competitive radio market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than two-thirds of Boston's radio market is
controlled by three closely-related companies: Westwood One Inc.,
Infinity Broadcasting Corp., and CBS Inc. This concentration is
unusual, says Scott Fybush, editor of an on-line newsletter that
follows the industry, but these groups also have clout in most
other US big-city markets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the three, Westwood has held a market niche in traffic
reporting in Boston and other East Coast cities through a New
York-based subsidiary, Shadow Traffic Services. In Boston, Shadow
has rented space in SmartRoutes' Cambridge control room from which
on-air reporters _ including Steve Skalish, Rob Hackela, and Kelly
Fitzgerald _ broadcast to a half-dozen stations, including WBZ
radio's 24-hour service.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Sheiffer was moving in at SmartRoutes last August,
Westwood One bought the nation's other leading traffic broadcast
group, Houston-based Metro Networks Inc., which has traffic or news
outlets in 80 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Metro, as it happens, is the larger traffic-news provider to
Boston, with a staff of about 30 at WRKO studios serving about 30
local stations with personalities including Joe Stapleton and Rich
Kirkland, according to a manager there.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Shadow and Metro operations isn't fully
implemented, but Sheiffer sees conflict in letting Shadow's
reporters continue to work at SmartRoutes. ``The relationship is
under review,'' he says, with a decision due in January.
</P>
<P>
   Metro, a publicly traded company that reported earnings until
the Westwood One takeover, was profitable. Shadow's earnings, never
broken out from overall financial statements by Westwood One,
aren't known.
</P>
<P>
   Sheiffer said his analysis of Shadow's Boston contracts
indicates that because of a barter system rampant in radio
broadcasting, SmartRoutes was getting little or nothing for the
information it delivered. Meanwhile, Shadow got free air time in
lieu of cash and made money by reselling that time to sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Sheiffer says that under Crosby SmartRoutes did not do much to
change that situation. ``The previous management did not believe
that radio was an `advanced' traffic information technology,''
Sheiffer said. ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby agreed. ``Radio and TV was always a secondary piece for
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby said his priority had been developing technology for the
nascent field of in-car navigation devices, which he and others see
as the future of the traffic information industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional traffic planners agree. ``I believe
SmartRoutes is right in the ball park,'' said Pete Briglia, who
oversees electronic technology at the Washington State Department
of Transportation in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But this technology also has developed slowly, partly because of
high costs. About 100,000 now are in use nationally, says Roger
King, a spokesman for trade group Intelligent Transportation
Systems America. Another 200,000 may be in use by 2001, but at
$2,000 to $3,000 each, the only demand for them is as a glitzy
option on high-priced cars. Ford Motor Co. offers them under the
name Ford Rescue; General Motors Co. as On-Star.
</P>
<P>
   SmartRoutes isn't alone. Since last year, Metro Networks has had
a partnership with Etak Inc., a Sony Corp. subsidiary, to develop
systems that can put maps into automobiles that show the locations
of traffic obstacles and detours.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic Station Inc. of Los Angeles is focusing on sending
customized traffic news to individual subscribers via Palm Pilots
and other hand-held personal digital assistants, cellular
telephones with digital read-out screens, and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   But SmartRoutes, also about to enter pager delivery, did not
ignore traditional media outlets under Crosby. It has a longtime
relationship with WCVB-TV in Boston and television stations in
Philadelphia and Cincinnati, as well as a variety of radio
distribution arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has begun a four-hour morning cable television
broadcast, currently available to 250,000 Cablevision subscribers
in Boston and Brookline. Early next year it will be added to
MediaOne cable, which has 1.1 million subscribers across
Massachusetts. SmartRoutes has a cable television program in
Washington and recently signed a contract in Philadelphia to feed
traffic news to the top-rated television station.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, SmartRoutes will introduce SmarTraveler to South
Florida and Denver and get a foothold in Indiana with a contract to
operate on-road variable message signboards and traffic-alert radio
systems in metropolitan Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Bower, director of strategic development, says adding 15
large cities could cost as much as $8 million and take years. ``But
I don't see it as an uphill fight,'' she said.

PATRIOT ROOKIE GEORGE WON'T BE HELD BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Tony George was saying how ``comfortable''
he felt on the field. The Patriots rookie safety also said,
``Sometimes I wish I could have been making those plays earlier in
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   A locker away, George had his own private cheerleader, running
back Chris Floyd. As George spoke of the frustrations of sitting on
the bench for much of the season, Floyd would pipe up, ``Right . .
. you're right.''
</P>
<P>
   All rookies want to play, and virtually all rookies feel they
can play well enough to start, but the rookie safety was vocal in
saying his wait might have been too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, talent is talent,'' said George, ``and if you've got
it, you should play it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few bright spots as this Patriots season winds down
with loss after loss, but Sunday against the Bills, three-fourths
of the defensive backfield was youngsters, and two of the three,
cornerback Kato Serwanga and George, showed more than flashes of
promise.
</P>
<P>
   As George spoke, his words might have come from the mouths of
Patriot fans who have wondered for much of the season why Chris
Carter was playing safety _ and doing so little _ while George was
on the bench and not given a chance to show what he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Talent is talent, said George, ``and you shouldn't worry about
whether, `Is he young?' or `Is he just new here?' or `Is he a
rookie?' To me, none of that really makes a difference because
(Washington's) Champ Bailey is a rookie and he's playing. Other
rookies are playing. I don't think it matters where you got
drafted; if you've got talent, you should be able to play this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   George got a chance to play only because Carter was forced out
of action with a hamstring injury. The two are friends, said
George, ``and I learned so much from Chris. Chris is a great player
and he's been like a brother to me. And I really do commend him for
trying to get back and for trying to help our team out.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie made a big play in overtime when Buffalo receiver
Eric Moulds escaped a jam by Patriots corner Tebucky Jones. George
hurried over and not only tackled Moulds but also caused a fumble
deep in New England territory. George said he ``tried to put my
helmet on the ball.'' The Patriots recovered the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   George's responsibility on the play, he said, was ``to push over
to the middle of the field and get to the seam.'' But George,
unlike Carter this season, reacted quickly when he saw Moulds
escape Jones and the rookie hurried over ``when I saw Moulds
running open'' and made the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have been making plays like that earlier in the
season,'' said George. ``Sometimes you've just got to wait for your
opportunity, and I felt that was my opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting on the bench for that opportunity was hard, George went
on, ``and I just hated hearing about I had no experience. Talent is
talent.''

RAVENS' APPEARANCE NEVER MORE UNTIMELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not the guests you want coming to town for New Year's,
especially if your offense is struggling. The Baltimore Ravens are
a very bad matchup for the fading New England Patriots at this
point in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, it would be great to come in there with a
chance at the playoffs,'' says Ravens first-year coach Brian
Billick, ``but since we are mathematically eliminated, we are going
to try to finish our season on a hot streak and have it carry over
through the offseason and into next year. We are playing well as a
team. The offense is coming around. It's still not where we would
like it to be, and our defense has been just great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens have won four in a row. Their defense is terrific. It
is ranked third overall in the NFL and has four players going to
the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to take some time to get going on
offense,'' says Billick, who was the offensive coordinator of the
prolific Minnesota Vikings before taking over the Ravens. ``We were
putting in a new system. A lot of the guys we had on offense were
guys, just guys. They could play in the NFL, but they weren't
great. We also had to get our quarterback situation sorted out.
Through all of that, our defense played great and kept us in
games.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this month, Billick decided that Tony Banks was
going to be his quarterback, and the Ravens are 4-0 in December.
They opened the season with ex-Lion Scott Mitchell, and when he
couldn't do it, they looked at Stoney Case and Banks, before
handing the job to the latter.
</P>
<P>
   In their first seven games, the Ravens totaled just 95 points,
or 13.6 points per game. In their last eight games, they have
scored 226, an average of 28.3, a pace up there with the
top-scoring dogs of the league like St. Louis, Jacksonville,
Indianapolis, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week will be another learning situation for our team,''
says Billick. ``We have to be up there two days early because of
the (Y2K) new millennium, and you usually don't stay in a city for
48 hours before the kickoff unless you go from coast to coast, and
some teams don't even do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to let the players go out and celebrate New Year's
just like they were at home. Some of the guys will have their
family join them. Then Saturday it will be back to our normal
routine. We'll practice in Foxborough, might take in a movie as a
team, and then get back to the hotel for our meeting Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In training camp, we emphasized growing as a team, and being
able to win in December. So far we are undefeated this month.
There's a progression a team must go through to get to championship
caliber. We're in transition right now. The first time Green Bay
started to turn it around, they were 9-7. And then it was into the
playoffs after that. Our players must maintain our focus. We're
8-7. We're going to work like hell to get to 9-7.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick looked at film of recent New England games, and this is
what he sees:
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, they are not in rhythm and haven't been for some
time. They are not playing with a lot of confidence, and they can't
seem to get it turned around. But we know they are dangerous. They
have big-play capability, and we have to be very concerned about
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, they are good. They are playing very hard as a
team. They are well coached. It will be a battle for us to try to
score some points on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick, who is highly regarded in the league as an offensive
expert because of what he did in Minnesota, sees the defense having
the upper hand in the NFL right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defenses are taking over third down,'' he says. ``Just
look at the stats. There are just three or four teams converting
third downs at more than 40 percent. All the rest are under it. In
past years, there would be seven or eight converting around 45
percent, and once in a while a team at 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason is also that the league is quarterback poor
now, in my opinion. The great run of Montana, Elway, Young, Marino
_ those type of Hall of Fame guys _ is coming to a close. Those
guys were great on third down when they were in their prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough pass in the league to throw consistently is the
intermediate (10- to 20-yard) range. Most teams can't do that.
We've been struggling, and just a few teams _ St. Louis, Minnesota,
those kind of teams _ can get it done on a consistent basis. Also,
I think in recent years there has been an influx of a lot of
quality defensive players through the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take all of these combined _ the quarterback situation,
tougher defenses, better defensive players _ and those are the
reasons the efficiency in the passing game has fallen off.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his team will miss the playoffs by the slightest of
margins, Billick intends to keep the heat turned up for the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another learning situation,'' he says. ``Winning on
the road. Winning in bad weather. Playing to the finish. We'll find
out more about certain players this week, and they'll probably find
out more about us as coaches.''
</P>

BURNING ANGER FUELS THIS `FIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN 
The True Story of the South Canyon Fire 
By John N. Maclean 
Morrow, 275 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a telling photograph of John N. Maclean on the back
cover of ``Fire on the Mountain,'' his searing indictment of the
government agencies that fight fires in the West. In it, the son of
one of the West's legendary writers, Norman Maclean, is looking
back over his shoulder, seemingly both compassionate and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Those emotions resonate through this poignant story of the 1994
fire on Colorado's Storm King Mountain that claimed the lives of 14
firefighters. To Maclean, the inept agencies were largely
responsible for their deaths, a horror the veteran Chicago Tribune
journalist looks back on with a heartfelt, unapologetic, eye.
</P>
<P>
   But Maclean's compassion and anger _ symbolized for him by a
charred pine tree on the mountain that at first looked like a
cross, but later, after its branches fell, like a spike _ are also
rooted in the bitter reality that his father's lesson from even
longer ago has gone unheeded. Among Norman Maclean's books is
``Young Men and Fire,'' the story of 13 firefighters who similarly
perished in a 1949 blaze in Montana's Mann Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is present on every page of this book, or at least
his spirit watched over my shoulder and, as was his custom in life,
readily offered a word or two of advice,'' Maclean writes. ``His
spirit, too, was present on Storm King Mountain on July 6, 1994,
when the South Canyon fire blew up, mirroring events in Mann Gulch
four and a half decades earlier. He would have been enraged over
the violation of the unspoken promise of `Young Men and Fire,' that
nothing like Mann Gulch should ever occur again.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it did. Basing his narrative on four years of investigative
reporting, the younger Maclean traces the events from July 1, when
the National Weather Service predicted to deaf ears that dry
conditions and lightning could spark a massive fire on Storm King,
to July 9, when the first of many heart-wrenching memorial services
was held for the firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean concedes that the young firefighters were steeped in a
dangerous ``can-do'' mindset. But his target is the US Bureau of
Land Management and other agencies and centers, which he casts as
petty and incompetent when it comes to fighting fires on the West's
vast public lands, imperiling the heroic ``smoke-jumpers'' and
``hot-shots.'' That message comes at a key time. For while
firefighting is a Western tradition, it has been in the spotlight
since the 1988 blaze in Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park, and
the recent sprawl of development that has overrun Western states,
putting people perilously close to fires.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean takes no prisoners. The fire's location was initially
misidentified, even though it was in clear view of Interstate 70
and nearby residents. Firefighters were sent in late, and never
told of an approaching cold front and high winds, which could whip
a small blaze into an inferno. The fire was thus underestimated for
too long. No one knew who was in charge. Hasty decisions were made.
Even federal regulations got in the way, when a helicopter was
prohibited from carrying water buckets over the highway.
</P>
<P>
   And so on July 6, 49 men and women from Colorado, Montana, and
Oregon faced a ``blowup,'' the sudden eruption of a smoldering
fire. ``Then, disaster took its unmistakable shape, and the
firefighters, almost as one, began a race for their lives,''
Maclean writes. Only 35 made it. Even the later investigation was
botched _ rushed, sketchy, and so biased toward the agencies that
one investigator refused to sign off on it. It took a subsequent
OSHA report to place the blame where Maclean feels it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean's strength _ his investigative skill _ is also his
book's weakness, as his narrative is so replete with details of
person and place that it can be difficult to follow, despite his
map, photographs, and glossary. His characterizations of the
firefighters and agency officials are also at first too virtuous
and contemptible, respectively; they become believable only much
later, when he allows them to be characterized through the moving
response of the firefighters' home towns and the damning evidence
against the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Maclean is not after art in this book. He wants his father's
message to be heard. And to his credit, it is. The fire, he writes,
``became a spectacle for some, a tragedy for others. It would give
rise to rage and blame, compassion and forgiveness; it would
destroy some careers, enhance others, and eventually work changes
in the way fire is fought. Like the Mann Gulch fire, it would burn
in the lives of those it touched long after the last ember died
out.''

Y2K COVERAGE A GLOBAL AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN AND MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the kind of story that only comes around once a millennium,
and accordingly, some media outlets are gearing up to cover it
wall-to-wall, or, more precisely, time zone to time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Whether viewers want to watch festive worldwide celebrations on
this momentous New Year's Eve or are in the mood for a weighty
discussion of What It All Means, chances are their wishes will be
just a channel away from fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Such networks as CNN, ABC and PBS plan marathon broadcasts that
will girdle the globe, from Times Square to Antarctica, from Sydney
to Shanghai, from Jerusalem to Rio de Janeiro. For most networks
and local stations, it's all hands on deck: When the clock strikes
midnight, many star anchors and correspondents will be hoisting
microphones rather than champagne glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, which will follow the dawning of the
millennium across the planet, plans on covering the event with
roughly 1,000 staffers stationed in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes of the saturation coverage that begins
Friday are logistical headaches, hard choices, and the possibility
of technical glitches or major millennial news that could undo the
best-laid plans.
</P>
<P>
   At Newsweek magazine, where the millenium cover story could
focus on anything from celebration to catastrophe, editor Mark
Whitaker says, `I've been telling my staff for months that (the
headline) could either be `Yikes!' or `Phew.`''
</P>
<P>
   Logistically, ``This is everything you can imagine multiplied by
10,'' said Tom Yellin, executive producer of ABC's 24 hours of
millennium coverage, which the network says will have resources
equal to an Olympic broadcast. ``This is the most massive
undertaking anyone has ever been foolish enough to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite: Even ABC's 24 hours is one short of the amount of
airtime that PBS plans to devote to millennium events, and both
pale next to the fully 100 hours of live coverage from around the
world that CNN kicks off on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millennium is a great moment in time to take stock of who
we are and what we've done,'' explained CNN president Richard
Kaplan. ``It's a real serious endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even nations where the year 2000 does not carry religious
significance seem eager to take part, according to Kaplan.
``Everyone is taking this as an opportunity to show off their
culture, what they've contributed to life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the most ambitious networks are trying to capture
that cultural diversity by being literally everywhere at once. In
addition to reports from correspondents, CNN's 100 hours will
convene experts from around the world for discussions of everything
from space travel to the genome project to global justice; for a
segment on childhood, CNN will hook up the youngsters in a day care
center in New York with those in a day care center in Africa. PBS
will range from a sun ritual on Machu Picchu to an ice ballet on
Tivoli Lake in Denmark to a New Orleans jazz parade to ``bury the
millennium.'' ABC will carry dozens of musical performances,
including Annie Lennox from the Millennium Dome in England,
Jean-Michel Jarre from the Great Pyramids in Giza, and Neil Diamond
from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have already faced an array of daunting challenges
involving the booking of time on satellites; lining up guests to
appear simultaneously from far-flung locations; arranging for local
voice-overs to translate for non-English-speaking viewers in
foreign countries; stationing camera crews, producers, and
correspondents in distant locales; and preparing backup
transmission facilities in case problems erupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logistics of this are overwhelming,'' said ABC's Yellin.
``How do you make sure, when you press the button to talk to the
producer in Australia, that you don't end up talking to the guy in
Las Vegas? What do you do when you think the satellite pictures
coming in are from Bombay when what you're really seeing is Rio?
And what do you do if the satellite goes down and you're caught
staring at snow?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is a moving target that's very hard to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   While ABC and other networks have checked and rechecked their
systems, they acknowledge there is no fail-safe mechanism to guard
against glitches. ``The internal mechanism is we have our fingers
crossed,'' joked Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   So does Zvi Dor-Ner, a producer with WGBH-TV (Channel 2), who
began working on the millennium project four years ago. He is
coordinating PBS coverage, which will be coproduced by WGBH, the
BBC, and a consortium of about 70 other broadcasting organizations
around the world, including ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the BBC Television Center in London, the base of
the consortium's operations, Dor-Ner said the coverage will be
comprehensive but fast-moving. ``You might go from midnight in
Sydney, Australia, to a sunrise in the Taj Mahal in India to early
morning in Rio de Janeiro,'' he said. ``If you don't like
something, all you have to do is wait a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   If for any reason the BBC center is unable to broadcast, Dor-Ner
said, the consortium will broadcast footage from a studio in
Holland. In Boston, such stations as WBZ-TV (Channel 4) are also
taking whatever precautions they can. News director Peter Brown
said the station will set up a miniature studio at Channel 4's
transmitter so it can broadcast directly from there, rather than
the station, if any problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   As for personnel, Brown spoke for many other stations and
networks when he said: ``Everybody's working.'' Kaplan, of CNN,
said the network will have up to 4,000 employees involved in
millennium coverage, adding that he knows of only two employees in
the entire news operation who have the night off.
</P>
<P>
   While covering performances and interviewing deep thinkers, the
networks also have to be prepared for any news that may break out.
CNN's Kaplan noted that many people believe a messiah will arrive
in the year 2000, so he has alerted the network's correspondents in
Jerusalem and Bethlehem to be prepared for any activity among the
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond mobilizing employees, the preparation stage has already
taxed the ingenuity of the networks. For instance, the consortium
supplying footage to PBS and ABC plans to broadcast New Year's Eve
festivities on the South Pole, but most satellites orbit the
equator, placing them beyond the range of a signal from Antarctica.
So the consortium arranged with NASA for time on a satellite that
orbits the poles.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Kaplan said the network had to carefully schedule a joint
appearance slated for Monday morning by former Soviet premier
Mikhail Gorbachev (from Paris) and former Israeli prime minister
Shimon Peres (from the Jordan River). The pair are scheduled to
discuss water scarcity, and Peres wants to be at the shallowest
point of the river to underscore the point. But CNN had to work
around Gorbachev's limited availability in order to broadcast their
appearance during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Few media outlets will be as taxed over the millennium weekend
as the Associated Press, where deputy managing editor Tom Kent
says, ``Rarely do we see a news story whose dimensions are as hard
to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   The international wire service plans on covering the midnight
celebration marking the new era at Millennium Island in the
Republic of Kiribati and panning the globe to chronicle the sunrise
scenes over the Pyramids and Great Wall of China. ``We'll have
every nerve twitching on this one,'' says Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend event presents both opportunities and obstacles for
many print outlets. The Wall Street Journal, which doesn't publish
on Saturday, will include a special millennium section (currently
slated for 58 pages) in its Friday paper. The project, focusing on
``What evolves? What endures?'' will examine the future of
everything from the economy to politics, says Thomas Petzinger Jr.,
the Journal staffer who's been working on the package for the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Another national paper that doesn't publish on Saturday, USA
Today, will release a millennium edition on Friday _ with a special
foldout in each of its five sections _ that will examine highlights
of the past 100 years. The press run for that paper will far exceed
the usual 2.6 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   With its weekend deadline, Newsweek magazine will give its
employees _ with the exception of reporters and photographers _
Friday off and then reconvene the entire staff the next day for a
frantic race to the midnight deadline. Should computer or other
problems force the shutdown of the magazine's New York
headquarters, Whitaker says the operation would move to a
contingency production ``war room'' in New Jersey. (Perhaps US News
&AMP; World Report has the smartest strategy. The newsweekly has
already published its last double issue of the year and is taking
millennium week off.)
</P>
<P>
   For all this preparation, the real test will come if big news _
in the form of terrorism, computer shutdowns, or something
unforeseen _ breaks over the weekend. ``We're confident we can
cover the story,'' says the AP's Kent. ``We're not confident of

SEEKING FUTURES; PROFIT ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest impression left by the newsstand this week is that
Brand 2000 is near the height of its marketing appeal. In a couple
of days, it will begin taking on the stench of decay, but right now
practically everyone is selling a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   Easily more than two dozen magazines have emblazoned the big
oh-oh on their covers. A handful have incorporated it into their
names, and a couple shout out ``Sex 2000,'' as if something
momentous is about to change. For a bunch of them, it's the
formulaic ``best (fill in blank) for (current year plus one)''; but
others take the big-picture approach to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wired goes all out with broad assessments of what's to come (see
last week's Literary Life), and Technology Review makes a couple of
stops in the same neighborhood, but of course, that's where it
lives.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a hot topic in the MIT-published review is
nanotechnology. Columnist G. Pascal Zachary decries what he sees as
hype around the notion that individual molecules can be harnessed
to act in concert, thereby replacing digital computing. To him,
it's a ``Big Lie.'' About 20 pages later, TR adds to the hype, in
its sober, MIT way, in an article about nanomedicine, in which
``minuscule `smart bombs' (may one day) find cancer cells, kill
them with the help of lasers, and report the kills.''
</P>
<P>
   The past, not the future, is the subject of M. Mitchell
Waldrop's ``Computing's Johnny Appleseed.'' It recalls J.C.R.
Licklider, the forgotten MIT mind who ``laid the foundations for
time-sharing, point-and-click interfaces, graphics and the Internet
_ virtually all of modern computing.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, back to the future, there's Shift (January-February),
a newcomer from Toronto with an attitude and some interesting
offerings, including a plant that grows plastic, and the
implications for sex of ``incredibly lifelike artificial flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Shift's big focus begins with the assumption that the future has
arrived, and the editors want to know what happened to it. ``Where
are the robotic maids (the most famous one, Rosie of ``The
Jetsons,'' is on the cover) and flying cars? Who stole the
future?'' the lead headline asks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reasonable time to ask the question, since many visions
were pointed toward now, but Richard Longley's response is more
rumination than answer. He reminds us that it is ``the journey, not
the arrival, that matters,'' and concludes: ``We will continue to
shape the future _ not necessarily the future we want or the future
we expect, but the future that will just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Shift is a brief profile of Dave Eggers, the Boston-born
Next Big Star of the Internet. (That he also garners mention in
Yahoo! Internet Life's ``100 Best Sites for 2000'' seems to bolster
the suggestion that his celebrity is on the boil.) Eggers is the
brain, and spirit, behind Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, an
``ingenious and quirky (if obscure) literary journal,'' and its
Internet counterpart, Timothy McSweeney's Internet Tendency
(http://www.mcsweeneys.net).
</P>
<P>
   Eggers edited at Esquire for a while, until he became stifled by
the mundanity of it all, and judging from Internet Tendency,
mundanity is to Eggers the most unpardonable sin. The site has no
links, no ads, no artifice. Its stories, says writer Laurie
Sandell, ``appear indiscriminately and change without notice,'' a
tendency that seems to delight the ``post everything'' crowd: It
registers 3,000 hits a day. Eggers's vision: ``It will never have a
point, it will never make a dime, and that's what makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the magazine mainstream, the quest for profit, and the
boundaries that quest seems to be trampling, are the targets of
``Self-Serving Synergy,'' Tim Dickinson's offering in Mother Jones
(January-February). He identifies five new magazines _ Momentum
(Mercedes-Benz), Joe (Starbucks), Unlimited (``presented by
Marlboro''), Space (Ikea), and Sony Style (guess) _ whose
publishers are not so much publishers as they are commercial
entities seeking to extend their brand imprint. Dickinson makes his
case with an amusing chart, and it's most telling when it points
out the questionable ethics evident in each magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If all such magazines came clearly marked as corporate shills _
at least Sony is up front about it _ that would deal with the most
obvious problem such magazines present, that they erode the
credibility of all publications. But of course they'd never do
that; they're trying to pass. And besides, there is no
black-and-white here; even brand-driven house organs often mix in
interesting, untainted articles.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Yahoo! Internet Life clearly is trading off
the success of the Internet portal, yet it is quick to proclaim its
editorial independence, saying that the cyber and print entities
are linked only through a ``licensing partnership.'' So suppose
that's so. What about the readers who miss that small-type
declaration? When they get to the Top 100 list and find three
different Yahoo! sites, what are they supposed to think?
</P>
<P>
   Even for those of us who did see the disclaimer, the stains of
cynicism and doubt are inescapable, and seem all but certain to
flourish as the future unfolds.

THE WAY WE EAT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the frenzy of winding up a century and a millennium, it's
hard to remember that 1999 wasn't all caviar and foie gras.
Wretched excess may be the trend of the end, but as we watch the
minutes trickle out, there are a few other culinary threads that
will pull the eating world into the cold light of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Latin foods, for instance. Most of the decade has been spent
tasting around the continent of Asia _ fusion begetting confusion.
Now, chefs are rediscovering the New World and spinning out
fantasies in yucca and plaintains, beef and shrimp and a smattering
of chilies. Tropical ingredients slide over from the Asian craze
with plenty of pineapple, papaya, and coconut, so, really, fusion
is still with us.
</P>
<P>
   Latin is so chic that chefs are matching up unlikely partners.
It's French-Brazilian at Bomboa, where steak frites meets feijoada
(Brazilian meats and bean stew), despite the scarcity of French
influence in Brazil's colonial past. Other places throw in as much
Cuban terminology as possible and pass those Peruvian purple
potatoes, a craze that refuses to die despite the unnatural hue
they give a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Color bloomed all over the culinary palette this year, perhaps
in reaction to the Boston diner's insistence on wearing black,
black, black, with a little gray thrown in for contrast. So menu
descriptions trumpet yellow beets, red endive, purple salad greens,
rainbow chard, yellow and orange and green-striped tomatoes, black
radishes, and, yes, those damnable purple potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   As the food got more colorful, restaurant decor became more
spare, with a metallic edge to everything. Restaurants like Pravda
116 emphasize almost cold white lights, some dramatic bursts of
color, and a hard-edged glamour. Others sweep away the mid-'90s
love of curlicued and mesh light fixtures to concentrate on copper
walls or a purple and red pseudo-'50s look.
</P>
<P>
   It's often stark enough to make the diners huddle against the
banquettes. Which, by the way, are everywhere, simply everywhere.
Tall-backed, low-slung, in booth shapes or in dramatic swoops, they
demand a whole new way of conceptualizing dining. At first, you
might think, ``Furniture is furniture; why would you have to adapt
to furniture?'' Well, believe me, you'll sink into some of them,
get swallowed up by the high backs of others, and slide off a few
more. Obviously many are designed for long-limbed models who can
gracefully cross their legs at the knees and look positively
languid on them. The rest of us cling pathetically, our calves
gripping the edges, hoping not to slide off in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we'd be sure to be noticed. For at least five years,
the cry of the diner has been ``Better service!'' With unemployment
practically nonexistent, restaurateurs can hardly find enough
bodies to turn on the lights. So main courses arrive while the
table is still covered with appetizer plates because no one has
cleared them; asking for more bread or silverware takes a bullhorn;
and just forget about finding someone to pay the check to at the
end of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you get the feeling that the sought-after wait staff
member doesn't consider the diner to be on the same lofty social
plane. In keeping with the customer's plebeian status, we're all
eating peasant food: beef cheeks and oxtails, tripe and long-cooked
stews. And old-fashioned vegetables, particularly roots but others
as well, are newly found by chefs, so we're tasting salsify and
parsley root, every variety of squash known to man, and very large
chunks of Chantenay carrots.
</P>
<P>
   They're roasted, of course. Because everything's roasted _ the
tomatoes for the pizza are roasted, the vegetables are roasted, the
fish and meat are roasted, even the spices are roasted. That's
before dessert, where the apples and the pears for the tarts are
roasted, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then they're topped with meringue, rediscovered after a few
years of ice cream ascendancy. The salamander business (and I don't
mean the amphibian or the restaurant, but the tool used to brown
the top of meringues over tarts and puddings) must be booming. All
kinds of soft concoctions are in vogue, from the ubiquitous (and
getting boring) creme brulee to zillions of soft-centered chocolate
cakes to meringue-topped banana cream and lemon tarts. Back to the
nursery we go.
</P>
<P>
   On our way, we'll have to have a mixed drink of a violent shade
of pink, blue, or purple, with a little paper umbrella perched in
the martini glass. Fancy mixed drinks with silly names and froufrou
decorations are flooding fine dining. All those years the dining
industry spent, earnestly trying to educate the public about fine
wines and how to pair them with food, and now restaurants are
pushing fruity, sweet, and very potent drinks based on vodka, rum,
and whiskey. These don't match any culinary creation, except maybe
olives or potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be hand-crafted or artisanal potato chips,
naturally. The word ``artisanal,'' denoting skilled craftsmanship,
is affixed to everything from bread to pasta to cheeses. With
almost no provocation, a waiter will now give the provenance of the
artisan cheeses _ not only what country a cheese is from but what
hillside, who made the cheese, how old he or she is, and how the
cheese is carried to market. By the time the lecture is finished,
the diner knows the cheese so well it seems almost cruel to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Tea has also reached a high level of artistry. No longer the
limp bag of Red Rose in the metal pot, tea service at many
restaurants involves perusing a menu advertising a dozen
selections, all with descriptions rivaling those of vintage wines,
and consultation with the wait staff. By the time the tea arrives
in a flurry of pomp and circumstance, the diner half expects the
Queen Mother to appear at the table.
</P>
<P>
   And, after all, in the upscaled, expensive, artisanal, and
highly styled world of today's restaurants, a little royalty would
be right at home.

COLOSSEUM A SYMBOL OF LIFE FOR DEATH PENALTY FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Colosseum in Rome, where Christians were thrown to the lions
and gladiators fought duels to the death, has been turned into a
symbol of life for opponents of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of Pope John Paul II, the world-famous
amphitheater, that was opened in 80 A.D., will be lit for 48 hours
every time a death sentence is halted or commuted or capital
punishment is abolished anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Called, ``The Colosseum Illuminates Life,'' the project began
earlier this month and will continue through next year.
</P>
<P>
   It was launched after the United States announced that the 96
inmates put to death this year represented the largest number of
executions since a Supreme Court ruling allowed states to resume
capital punishment 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Colosseum illumination, accomplished through the use
of 40 spotlights placed inside the amphitheater, marked Albania's
decision to end capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, a staunch opponent of the death penalty, hailed the
project.
</P>
<P>
   There are few if any cases, the pope noted, in which Roman
Catholic Church teachings permit executions. He said 2000, which
the church is celebrating as a Holy Year, marks an ideal occasion
to ``promote throughout the world more mature forms of respect for
life and the dignity of every person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I therefore renew my appeal to all leaders to reach an
international consensus on the abolition of the death penalty,''
the pope added.
</P>
<P>
   _A controversial Russian law requiring the re-registration of
religious communities by Dec. 31 will leave thousands of such
communities in legal limbo, according to some Russian legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In legal terms, they become no one,'' Moscow attorney
Yekaterina Smyslova, told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   According to the law, communities, including church parishes,
that fail to properly register with the government could have their
property seized.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of the Russian parliament had been expected to
extend the Dec. 31 deadline but failed to do so before adjourning.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, about 14,000 religious communities, many of them
Russian Orthodox, are left in a legal quandary.
</P>
<P>
   The official at the federal Ministry of Justice responsible for
registering religious groups said congregations that do not make
the Dec. 31 deadline have nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent out a letter of instruction to all our offices in the
region, telling them there is no need to touch anything, because
the new Duma will for sure extend the deadline for another year,''
said the official, Alexander Kudryavtsev.
</P>
<P>
   _With millions of pilgrims expected to flood Israel next year,
Israeli police said they will control the flow of visitors to the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher in order to prevent a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any emergency exit in the sprawling structure has
been a source of conflict between the Israeli government and the
Greek Orthodox, Latin (Catholic) and Armenian church officials.
</P>
<P>
   About 750,000 pilgrims can safely tour the sacred church in a
given year, but next year about 2.5 million people are expected to
visit.

EXECUTIVES' HUGE GAINS IN '99 ON PAPER, SO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you think you had a good year in the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   The executives who run some of Massachusetts' hottest public
companies enjoyed unprecedented personal stock appreciation in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Together, their holdings represent an amazing amount of wealth
concentrated in a relatively few hands. But there are a couple of
nagging questions: How real are those gains, and can they stand the
test of time?
</P>
<P>
   By our count, there are a minimum of 15 local executives who
will each end the year with at least $250 million more in public
stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, their 1999 public stock gains amount to a staggering
sum of more than $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And eight individuals on our list have more than a billion
reasons to look back fondly on this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most executives who hit it big in the stock
market of 1999 run companies connected to the Internet, to
telecommunications, or to some other favored technology field.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they own as much as 20 percent of the stock of a
high-flying company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital markets have been incredibly generous to two or
three industries this year,'' said Jim Weiss, chief investment
officer for equities at State Street Research and Management in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has often set management up for full participation in
that wealth creation,'' he said, ``is that stock options have taken
over for cash in the compensation mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Their personal stock portfolio gains are triumphs on paper,
``funny money'' as executives sometimes put it. None on our list,
with the possible exception of EMC Corp. cofounder Richard Egan,
could cash out his stock holdings at once and receive anything like
the current face value. Many own restricted stock that they cannot
legally sell at all, for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do find themselves with paper profits, in the truest
sense of the words, because they can't monetize or diversify that
holding,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   We measured two kinds of stocks to estimate personal wealth
creation: shares of companies that staged initial public offerings
this year and shares in other businesses that were already public
at the start of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For our purposes, the current value of IPO shares and their 1999
appreciation are the same thing. They are considered to have had no
public value entering the year, when the companies were still
private and in development stages.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation for established public companies is more
straightforward _ simply measuring their appreciation during the
course of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On the top of our list: Sycamore Networks Inc. executives
Gururaj ``Desh'' Deshpande and Dan Smith, who each own about 20
percent of the state's sixth most valuable public company.
Deshpande's holdings were worth about $5.2 billion this week, while
Smith's stock was valued at about $4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Three executives at Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, the
state's other white-hot IPO of 1999, were each worth more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among executives managing more established companies, CMGI Inc.
chief David Wetherell saw his stock and options appreciate by about
$4.3 billion, by our estimate. Wetherell owns about 15 percent of
the Andover-based Internet develoment comany, whose shares have
soared by 906 percent this year. CMGI recently passed FleetBoston
Financial Group as the state's third most valuable public company.
</P>
<P>
   No public company in Massachusetts has grown enough in value to
match EMC Corp., the Hopkinton maker of computer storage systems.
Chairman Richard Egan has sold EMC stock to diversify for years,
but his remaining 1 percent interest in the company still grew in
value by about $586 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Greenberg and J. Stuart Moore, cofounders of Sapient Inc.
in Cambridge, Mass., saw their portfolios of company stock
appreciate by about $1 billion apiece. Greenberg and Moore each own
about 20 percent of the company's stock, which has advanced 356
percent this year, to a total value of about $7.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While our list ends with executives who benefitted from stock
appreciation of at least $250 million, there are many others who
earned smaller but still staggering stock fortunes. It is beyond
our resources to count the scores of new Massachusetts stock
millionaires of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those paper fortunes are built on stocks that
command huge valuations set by a wildly optimistic market. How many
will find the new year so rewarding?

UNRAVELING BRUINS NEED TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UPPER MONCLAIR, N.J. _ Is it a funk? A trend that won't end? A
short-term nosedive or a long-term condition? What ails the Bruins?
</P>
<P>
   The club is 2-7-4 in its last 13 games and far too often has
looked shockingly inept _ as it did in the last two periods of a
3-0 loss against the Islanders Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They don't beat the teams they should, they lack any kind of
consistent offense, and they too often look disorganized and shaky
in their own end.
</P>
<P>
   Here are theories that could explain what's going on:
</P>
<P>
   Theory No. 1: Some players are balking at executing the game
plan. It's the explanation, or one of them, that coach Pat Burns
put forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't understand it,'' said Burns. ``Over the past two
years, this club has played a certain way. We've picked up 180-odd
points in two years, we've gone three rounds in the playoffs. All
of a sudden, it's not good enough anymore. Now, we have to pinch,
we have to take chances, be more offensive and try to copy other
teams and this is the result _ giving up two-on-ones. I watched New
Jersey-Buffalo and Buffalo gave up about 10 two-on-ones. If you're
going to play like that, you're not going to win too many hockey
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was especially pointed when discussing the play of
third-year forwards Joe Thornton and Sergei Samsonov. Neither has
shown much recently, and Burns has said in the past that perhaps
too much was being expected of them. Too often, the coach said, the
youngsters aren't doing what they're supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard somewhere that their development maybe isn't as up to
par as it should be,'' he said. ``That may be so, but if you're
getting between 20-22 minutes a game and nothing is happening . . .
maybe sometimes you have to change the way you were playing or
maybe we're putting too much on these guys, to say that these
21-year-olds are going to go out and do it for us on a regular
basis. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he asked one player how he wanted to play and the
player answered, ``Creatively.'' If that's the case, Burns said,
this slump will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get out of it when we decide to play a certain
way that's feasible to us,'' he said. ``It's certainly not the way
this team has played in the past and it's certainly not the way
this team is going to have success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We addressed the issue (Tuesday) morning and we addressed it
at practice. We're going to have to stop playing like this. The way
they're playing is not the way they're told to play or not the way
they're supposed to play. If you think Joe Thornton is playing good
hockey, I must be awfully stupid. If you think Joe Thornton is at
the top of his game or Sergei Samsonov is being electrifying, now
come on. Let's be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   What Burns wants from everyone is intestinal fortitude. If it
means taking a hit to make a play, take the hit. If it means
getting slashed or knocked down, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've asked of this team is 100 percent effort day in and
day out, I've asked good execution, and I've asked for pride and
commitment and I haven't seen that lately,'' he said. ``Why, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns is especially disappointed in Thornton because he knows
how well Thornton can play when he applies himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the frustrating part for everybody, that I know he can
do it,'' said Burns. ``I can't seem to understand why he wouldn't
want to do it on a consistent basis. Is he telling himself, `Well,
I'll do it later in my career'? Well, he'd better not wait too long
because it might pass you by.''
</P>
<P>
   Theory No. 2: Players have tuned out the coach, a possibility
presented in print by colleague Kevin Paul Dupont.
</P>
<P>
   The players have rallied 'round their coach, but Burns, though
he brushes off the idea that his job is in jeopardy, does worry
that the speculation will distract his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does have an effect on the team,'' he said. ``Any
time you have those rumors or those `experts' who decide this might
be the way out because another team did it, I have to just shrug it
off. I've seen it before and I've heard it before and I've seen it
many times before. There's not a whole lot you can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start trouble like that in an organization, it
becomes an excuse for the team. Some players are actually stupid
enough to believe that Harry just might do that. I haven't gotten
the feeling that's going to happen, I haven't got any issues with
management about that, nobody has approached me, and nobody has
talked to me about that. I'm sure they won't. If they do it, they
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as he's coaching, Burns said, he'll continue to do it
the way he always has and he'll do the best with the talent and
experience he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job here is to win hockey games,'' he said. ``You've got to
win, that's the main thing. If you don't win, these are the stories
that you hear.''

&HT;     PARTY OF THE MILLENNIUM MAY END IN A FIZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Millennium madness appears to be going bust.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of lobsters harvested for New Year's Eve celebrants in
New England may go unsold. The chance to attend the Rose Bowl has
drawn lukewarm interest. Las Vegas is trying to woo visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the big welcome-in-the-new-century shows have
not sold out and hotels are reducing prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's Eve is fizzling,`` said Anwar Elgonemy, a San
Francisco-based analyst with PKF Consulting, which tracks the
hospitality industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid (of the Y2K bug) and are turned off
to the high prices of the canned events, so they're going to hang
out with their friends and family and create their own
celebrations,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Time/CNN poll found that 75 percent of Americans intend
to stay home New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost looks like this might be the party that nobody comes
to,`` said John Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention
and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate celebrations are planned and big crowds anticipated in
Chicago, New York, Washington and other cities despite cautions
about potential terrorist attacks and possible problems relating to
the millennium computer glitch, also known as the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, however, has canceled its celebration at the Space
Needle because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco officials still are bracing for hundreds of
thousands revelers expected to ring in 2000 at various events.
``We're expecting significant crowds,'' said police Sgt. Daniel
Linehan.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, from the Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the
restraint in attending holiday events ``seems to be universal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pasadena, for instance, scalpers and ticket brokers are not
getting top price for Rose Bowl tickets. In Las Vegas, several
hotels are slashing prices and throwing in tickets to New Year's
Eve parties in an effort woo visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think people are saying, `It might be the millennium,
but it might be great watching it on TV.' Everyone assumed and
expected that there would be a lot more interest, but that hasn't
been the case,`` Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, hotel rooms in San Francisco are filling up,
though vacancies are still anticipated. Some hotels may be willing
to drop prices when a last-minute guest shows up unannounced
looking for a room.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Francisco Hilton Hotel and Towers _ the city's
largest hotel, with 1,895 rooms _ rooms and New Year's celebration
packages are still available. However, hotel spokeswoman Susan
Saltzer did not seem overly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now on pace with last year, maybe slightly ahead, and
expect to be nearly sold out,`` she said.

DON'T BLAME HIM FOR Y2K: HE JUST COINED THE TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So now that the end of the wired world is nearly upon us, has
anyone wondered who put the Y and the K in Y2K? The evidence points
to Needham software consultant David Eddy, a jovial former
programmer who still speaks fluent computerese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty,'' Eddy admits cheerfully when queried about Y2K.
``Just send blank checks, and I'll fill in the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't go blaming Eddy if your lights go out and your furnace
goes cold on Jan. 1. He didn't invent the Y2K bug: He just coined
the term.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, in 1995 Eddy was a salesman hawking an early
software product designed to identify potential computer problems
when the date switches over to 2000. Back then, most folks were
still oblivious to this new thing called the World Wide Web, and
the year 2000 seemed eons away. As such, Eddy was a preacher
without a congregation, but he found plenty of compatriots in an
on-line discussion group for computer geeks hosted by the Web site,
www.year2000.com. The first use of the term in the discussion group
was in this June 12, 1995, message posted by Eddy: ``Business . . .
won't stop while we take 4 years out to fix Y2K issues,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K just slipped off my fingers, and over time, the term took
on,'' recalls Eddy, 52. The term first appeared in the Globe in
1996, when it was mentioned in one article; it turned up in four
Globe articles in 1997, 63 articles in 1998 and, as of last last
week, in 369 articles in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   No one has challenged Eddy's claim to the name _ at least not
yet. Peter de Jager, a Toronto consultant who runs year2000.com,
confirms that, to the best of his knowledge, Eddy was the first to
use the term. ``We were the only year 2000 discussion group at the
time, and it's highly unlikely that the term was coined anywhere
else,'' de Jager says.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Eddy recalls, computer gurus were throwing around
terms like CDC (century date change) and FADL (faulty date logic) _
hardly abbreviations that flow off the tip of your tongue. ``The Y
is for year, the 2 is for two, and the K is . . .'' Eddy says,
pausing. ``The K is really, really complex. In binary mathematics,
which is the world of computers, two to the 10th power is 1,024,
which is commonly referred to as K. So it's not exactly 1,000. But
if you try to explain that to a noncomputer expert, you get tied up
in your shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   The K also derives from ``kilo,'' Greek for ``thousand.'' ``We
all abbreviate,'' Eddy continues, cutting off the math lesson to
point out that he's been coming up with verbal shortcuts since he
wrote his college thesis about Russian critic Nikolay Gavrilovich
Chernyshevsky. (Well, wouldn't you?) For the record, Eddy majored
in history at Union College but ended up working as a programmer
because nobody was looking to employ experts in obscure Russian
radicals like NGC.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another story, which Eddy will be happy to tell you
if you have a few hours. For now, he's more concerned with the Y2K
bug. He never got a copyright on the term, although someone else
trademarked it to sell coffee mugs and apocalyptic souvenirs. ``It
never occurred to me to try and market it,'' Eddy says. ``The
merchandising of it is demeaning. The problem is too serious and is
going to cause too much damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddy, who lives with his wife and 8-year-old son in Needham,
isn't one of those doomsday types who plans to hole up in a bunker
with fresh water, nonperishable food, and Russian novels. The big
problems won't explode on New Year's Day, he predicts. ``The
weekend is going to be a big yawn,'' Eddy says. Instead, he says,
the bug will show up in insidious ways in the next few months,
creating a tangle of bureaucratic nightmares. ``It's going to be
like death by 10,000 paper cuts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy has spent the last five years proselytizing about the Y2K
bug, but when the clock turns over to 2000, he's going to be
exploring an earlier century with his wife and son at Old
Sturbridge Village, the living history park devoted to New England
life in the 1830s. ``My son is bored out of his squash with his
dad's Y2K talk,'' admits Eddy. But his son shouldn't expect the
talk to stop any time soon. ``We are going to hit the iceberg,''
Eddy predicts, maybe not next weekend, but some day in Y2K.

   Imagine if old Ebenezer Scrooge were alive today. Come Christmas
Eve, he'd order some gruel from homeruns.com, stoke up the virtual
fire on his monitor (www.wpix.com), and settle in for a nap at his
workstation. Then _ Ping! _ a message would appear on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   To: Scrooge(at)humbug.com
</P>
<P>
   From: Marley(at)limbo.org
</P>
<P>
   ``Beware the chains you forge in life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bah,'' Scrooge would say. ``Humbug. Must be a hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbug, indeed. Even in this age of global communication, who
gets e-mail from the great beyond? Who dares deliver messages from
the grave?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is a guy in California _ where else? _ who is trying
to make it possible to send missives from the land of the dearly
departed. On finalthoughts.com, members can write messages to loved
ones that will be delivered as e-mail after the member passes away.
</P>
<P>
   This ghost of an idea is the brainchild of Todd Michael Krim, a
Los Angeles attorney who dreamed up the Web site while flying home
from London on a particularly bumpy ride. ``I thought, `My God,
this plane could go down,' and so many thoughts raced through my
head,'' he recalls. ``I realized that I hadn't made arrangements
for my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed safely, and Krim says his bad trip was ``a
wakeup call to live and embrace life'' _ and launch an Internet
startup. The site is part of a growing death industry on line,
which includes such sites as heavenlydoor.com, obitdetails.com, and
plan4ever.com (where folks can surf through memorials in ``virtual
gardens.'')
</P>
<P>
   Finalthoughts.com works like this. You store your messages on
the site and appoint a ``guardian angel'' who will mail the
missives after your untimely demise. Right now, the service is
free, but Krim may charge a fee next year.
</P>
<P>
   Krim is convinced that users will write lovely letters to
long-lost aunts and send cheerful regards to their pets. For some
reason, he doesn't expect anyone to fire off nasty things they have
been dying to say, so to speak. No notes from Mrs. Cratchit to Mr.
Scrooge, accusing him of being a ``squeezing, wrenching, grasping,
scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner.'' Krim thinks all the
mail will be angelic, as in ``God bless us, every one!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't create this to hurt anyone,'' he says. The site, he
adds, is a ``reaffirmation of life.'' So why not take a lead from
the reborn Scrooge and vow to live charitably and honor Christmas
in your heart every day? Who needs a Web site? ``Sometimes you have
to confront your own mortality to really start living,'' says Krim,
pointing out that he hopes to raise venture capital and build ``a
multimillion-dollar, profitable, socially conscious company.'' And
who says death doesn't pay?

AFTER NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT'S A STEEP CLIMB FOR BRADLEY, MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rationale put forth by Democrats advocating the nomination
of Bill Bradley as president rests on the premise that he is
insultated from Clinton fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in the eyes of many, is seen as Clinton
Lite, a sidekick to the wayward president, a sort of mumbly Sancho
Panza to Wild &AMP; Krazy Bill's Don Quixote. Whether you buy the
argument or not, there are some numbers to support the Bradley
forces' contention that their man is less vulnerable to the
so-called Clinton drag than the veep.
</P>
<P>
   In the Political Hotline's collection of state-by-state horse
race matchups, Texas Governor George W. Bush leads Gore by 27
states to five, but Bush leads Bradley by only 16 states to nine.
Both Gore and Bradley lead Bush in New Hampshire, interestingly
enough; Gore tops Bush by 44 percent to 40 there, while Bradley
tops Bush by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Gore is ahead of Bush only in Hawaii, New York, Rhode
Island, and Tennessee, while Bradley leads Bush in Connecticut,
Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode
Island, and Vermont. What's it mean? Not much yet.
</P>
<P>
   As the year closes, Bush is ahead in his own party's race
everywhere but New Hampshire, where he trails Senator John McCain
of Arizona by 9 points in a week-old American Research Group poll.
Gore is still ahead of Bradley nationally and in a solid majority
of states nationwide but trails in the Northeast and was 12 points
back of Bradley in the American Research Group's New Hampshire
survey.
</P>
<P>
   With four weeks to Iowa's caucuses and five weeks to New
Hampshire, it is conceivable that McCain and Bradley will both lose
in Iowa, remain favorites to win New Hampshire, and go on to lose
their respective nominations. New Hampshire voters are clearly
receptive to their twinned messages of campaign finance reform, new
broom, and time for a change from the warmed-over goods delivered
by the respective party establishments.
</P>
<P>
   But after New Hampshire, where do McCain and Bradley win?
Bradley has slightly the better of the terrain, given his strength
in the Northeast. But it appears to be a steep uphill climb for
both Bradley and McCain, though it's steeper for McCain. Nobody
knows whether a campaign message ignited by New Hampshire can catch
fire in either party once the caravan moves beyond the Granite
State.
</P>
<P>
   In a way New Hampshire remains the last boutique primary, the
lone remaining holdout of the old style of electioneering, where
retail campaigning, one-on-one, living room, coffee shop, high
school gym campaigning, survives. Because once you get past this
mom-and-pop operation, where candidates call folks by first names
and sometimes visit more than once, the nominating process turns
into a Wal-Mart operation, a national franchise scheme, where
television ads, big money, campaign spin artists, and national TV
news shows substitute for the meet-the-folks campaigning that
traditionally incubated national candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   People like George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Mike Dukakis, Ronald
Reagan, and Bill Clinton were not party establishment choices. But
they all either won in New Hampshire, or came second close enough
to survive, and eventually got nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strategy is to say nothing nasty about McCain, apparently
because Bush feels his superior firepower in terms of money,
endorsements, and hospitable terrain beyond New Hampshire mean that
McCain cannot deny him anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley may have more room to roam if he holds on to his lead in
New Hampshire. One reason is that despite his big lead in super
delegates and the muscular endorsement of the big labor unions,
Gore has yet to prove he's anywhere near as adept on the stump as
the man he's trying to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats appear to have little enthusiasm for Gore as
their next leader. Bradley is no barnburner in day-to-day
campaigning, but he plods along at a steady pace. Lugubrious in
manner and saddled with a baggy-eyed droopiness that belies his
athletic success as a young man, Bradley nevertheless piles up
debating points by reminding voters he is not part of the Clinton
legacy of immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is already running against Clinton _ not Gore, as it
happens. Bush's latest flood of pricey Boston-based TV spots going
into New Hampshire picture Nice Guy George with his wife and
handsome little kids, vowing to bring ``honor and integrity back to
the White House.'' In New Hampshire this month, one of Bush's brain
trust said to me, ``We just feel that America wants to take a
shower'' after the revelations of Clinton's womanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``America may want to take a shower,'' I agreed, ``but the
voters also don't want to take a bath.'' The Democrats have to come
up with a strategy that makes the prospect of Bush's future in
office more terrifying than Clinton's past. So far they haven't.
But it is easier for Bradley to promise a new day for the Dems than
it is for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   There are many voters, and many Democratic voters, disgusted
with the fertilizer generated by Clinton's conduct and spread by a
partisan Congress. Bradley keeps hanging around despite Gore's
obvious tactical advantages because the vice president has yet to
articulate a credible strategy for countering the Clinton fatigue
factor. With his new TV blitz trumpeting ``honor and dignity,''
Bush indirectly helps Bradley.

THE NFL IS GETTING TO BE MORE LIKE PRO WRESTLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO &UR;  &LR;  _ He's sweating, breathing hard, and hasn't
made a tackle since Labor Day. But as an opposing quarterback
stumbles into his embrace, the overweight warrior becomes a
300-pound Nureyev. He prances and pirouettes, hoping the television
camera is on him. It probably is.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League, which once mesmerized millions
with its dynastic glories, now features flavorless contests among
little-known squads. Almost by default, it rewards excessive
celebrations by second-rate players. When a fan runs onto the field
and acts crazily, television discreetly turns away. Why does it
focus so obsessively on silly shows by other faceless mediocrities?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be desperation. The NFL, an organization mightily
sure of itself, is plagued by boredom and its own micromanagement.
The schedule mandates mediocrity in search of artificial suspense.
In Decembers past, late-season Saturday and holiday games matched
contenders in dramatic showdowns. In this dry December, the plan
collapsed in a Christmas Eve contest between the New Orleans Saints
and the Dallas Cowboys, once called ``America's team,'' because 49
states rooted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints, who usually play like sorry sinners, defeated
Dallas, 31-24. For a once-proud franchise and for the NFL, the loss
evoked the scene in ``A Christmas Carol'' when Ebenezer Scrooge
passed a spooky structure: ``It was a large house, but one of
broken fortunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramshackle and Dickensian describes the NFL's system of
achieving parity among teams. Schedules and salary caps have
toppled dynasties without replacing them. Colts, Ravens, and Titans
tangle, but only fanatics can name the original home towns of the
franchises. The Green Bay Packers are floating at the fringes.
Ditto for last year's champion, the Denver Broncos and the team it
defeated, the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers, once lords of the league, face a salary
cap on aging stars. They will play in the final Monday night game
against Atlanta. ABC's game was once must-watch stuff, with debates
about how many broadcasters could fit into the booth, but this
season's signals could have been called by Ho and Hum or Hum and
Strum.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not Dandy Don Meredith or Curt Gowdy, could fool viewers
into thinking a typical NFL game is interesting or important. Too
many players are better at beating their girlfriends than they are
at beating the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   The point spread, the dirty secret that newspapers print in
agate type, reveals that gamblers are the hardcore audience of the
NFL. Monday night provides losers a chance to catch up on Sunday's
losses just as surely as the two-minute warning helps television
sell more ads.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL shuns gambling, of course, and also seeks to curb
excessive celebration. Coaches don't help because many want their
players to remain childish. The league bans some gestures, but has
yet to ask television to avoid choreographed outbursts in the end
zone. Television seeks ratings, which is why pro football
increasingly resembles pro wrestling: trash talk punctuated by
silly dances.
</P>
<P>
   Two organizations share a fondness for infallibility and Roman
numerals, the Vatican and the NFL. When Super Bowl XXXIV is played
next month, those hoping for an exciting game don't have a prayer.
Two of the best teams play indoors and one is quarterbacked by a
former player in the Arena Football League, a mix of Roller Derby
and pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL expects to charge $1.6 million per 30-second ad and sell
$100 million in Super Bowl merchandise. If these end-zone goals are
not met, the game might have to re-emphasize team play over
celebration. Game films could show how Red Grange or Jim Brown
celebrated, usually by handing the ball to the official. The clock
is ticking, slowly enough that gambling addicts may hear it.
There's always the ominous possibility that suckers can smarten up.

BC WINS THE GAP BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without his serious attention, Boston College football coach Tom
O'Brien guesses that up to a third of his football players might
not survive the classroom. With that belief, life for a freshman
football player is not just X's and O's, it is also academic
orientations, study halls, tutors, and academic advisers who know
the players' professors well enough to short-circuit any attempt by
a young player to seek a short cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player starts to say he has two papers due for a class,
our advisers know enough to stop him and say, `Uh-uh, you have
three,'' O'Brien said of his academic advisers Martha Hincks and
Amy Lacombe. ``The reality is that while these kids are good
football players, not everyone goes to college prepared with time
management and study skills. You have to identify very quickly
their strengths and weaknesses and get them help.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its dreadful gambling scandal a few years ago, BC
knows how to find strengths and weaknesses off the field as well as
on it. BC is ranked No. 25 in the Associated Press football poll
with an 8-3 record. It is No. 1 in my fourth annual Graduation Gap
Bowl for graduating 83 percent of its players.
</P>
<P>
   BC also has the highest level of parity between African-American
and white players, graduating 83 and 84 percent, respectively. The
graduation rates just miss the 86 percent for the student body.
Four years ago, the football graduation rate exceeded that of the
student body, 95 percent to 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are surrounded by kids who want to do well,''
O'Brien said. ``If you go to a school where a significant number of
students lie in bed watching soaps and playing Nintendo, you can
fall into that. A lot of people try to sell a football recruit on
the number of computer labs their school has. What we are able to
sell is the commitment to graduating. My obligation when I'm
sitting in the living room with the parents of a recuit is that I
will send your son back to you with a degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of football powers make the opposite choice. The
Graduation Gap Bowl is based on the annual NCAA Graduation Rates
Report. The 1999 report charts the freshman classes of 1989-90,
1990-91, 1991-92 or 1992-93 to determine how many scholarship
athletes graduate within six years.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1999 report is compared with the 1996 report, the
graduation rate has declined for 33 of the 47, or 70 percent of the
ranked or bowl-bound football teams.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly atrocious was eighth-ranked Michigan. Michigan is
playing in the Orange Bowl, a game worth up to $13 million per
team. In the 1996 report, Michigan's football players graduated at
a rate of 76 percent, compared to the campus average of 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the graduation rate of Michigan's football team fell to
52 percent, the worst drop of all 47 teams. Its African-American
graduation rate fell from 71 percent to 43 percent. The graduation
gap between Michigan's African-American players and the student
body has exploded from 14 percentage points to 40.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan had plenty of company in the gutter. Out of the 47
teams, 31 had double-digit gaps between the higher graduation rates
of white players and lower rates of African-American players. The
schools with at least a 20-point gap between black and white
players were Brigham Young, Fresno State, Georgia, Mississippi,
Minnesota, Colorado, Texas A&AMP;M, Kansas State, Washington, Purdue,
East Carolina, Illinois, Michigan State, Alabama, Tennessee, Wake
Forest, Syracuse, Arkansas, Southern California, Georgia Tech,
Oklahoma, and Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the schools that have been primary sources of disgust in
the Graduation Gap Bowl have made bits of progress. Kansas State,
which in 1996 opened a new academic center for athletes, has crept
up from its unbelievable graduation rate of 7 percent for
African-American players in 1996 to 26 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's African-American player graduation rate has risen from
31 percent to 44 percent. Wisconsin, Clemson, Stanford, Florida
State, and East Carolina all had rises in African-American
graduation rates of between 10 and 19 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But other Top 10 schools continue to profit shamelessly from
teams that rarely graduate players. At Tennessee, the African
American graduation rate slipped from 27 percent to 24 percent. At
Alabama, the rate dropped from 44 percent to 33 percent. At
Michigan State, it fell from 37 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other cesspools for graduating African-American players include
Brigham Young (which dropped from 67 percent to 10 percent), Boise
State (from 23 down to 13) Fresno State (frozen at 14 percent),
Arkansas (from 20 down to 16). Texas A&AMP;M, (from 30 down to 19), and
Georgia (from 39 down to 29).
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Graduation Gap Bowl, I will root for BC when it
plays Colorado in the bowl. Colorado graduates only 32 percent of
African-American players, a 32-point gap from the student body.
O'Brien would not talk about bad graduation rates on any one team.
He did say, ``That's their choice. Some schools don't tell recruits
their graduation rates until the day they sign. We tell recruits
the graduation rate the first day we meet them.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Imagine the unwashed folk who lounged around the fire with their
cups of foul ale in January 1000, wondering what the new millennium
might bring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they hoped for a better way to sharpen knives or soothe
a throbbing tooth.
</P>
<P>
   But computers and genetic engineering? Inconceivable. Equally
futile are most of our own speculations about third-millennium
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At least we can be reasonably certain about predicting what will
occur in the heavens over specific periods.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, events can sometimes take us by surprise. Some comets, for
example, have such incredibly slow orbits _ 5,000 to 100,000 years
_ that every visit close to the sun seems like the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Halley's, follow shorter, more predictable
periods. Its next appearance in 2061 should be a winner _ the
comet's bright, fuzzy head will ie favorably in the northern sky
and its tail may span half the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are plenty of sky wonders on the way that
won't require a 60-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   A midnight lunar eclipse, easily visible throughout North
America on Jan. 20, for example, kicks off the new century in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of my top 10 list of the events for the early
years of the 21st century, astronomical headliners that require
nothing more than the naked eye:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000: &LR;  Jupiter approaches Saturn in the autumn sky. The
eye-catching meeting of these two giant planets happens once every
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2001: &LR;  Those in the upper half of the United States should look
northward for vivid displays of the aurora borealis, a by-product
of a peak in solar storm activity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2003: &LR;  On Aug. 27, Mars will venture closer to Earth than at
any time in the past 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks the Red Planet will outshine everything else in
the night sky except for the moon and will be a delight through
backyard telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  In June, for the first time since 1882, Venus will cross
the face of the sun. With a proper sun-dimming filter, this rare
type of eclipse, known as a transit, can be seen without a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  The first spacecraft to orbit Saturn will arrive at the
ringed planet for a four-year reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is the last of a kind _ heavy, expensive and fully
loaded. Its arrival won't be visible, of course, but you can bet
that glitzy pictures from the billion-dollar mission will show up
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2006: &LR;  The moon's shadow will sweep over Egypt and run through
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2009: &LR;  The greatest, longest solar eclipse of the 21st century
will cross China and the Pacific Ocean, offering a rare 6.5 minutes
of daytime darkness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2012: &LR;  Venus will transit the sun again, the last such event of
the century. This time it will be visible from North America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2017: &LR;  Breaking a 38-year drought, a total eclipse of the sun
will slash the United States from coast to coast, briefly turning
day into night. It will be our first glimpse of totality in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if we can't all be as prescient as Jules Verne, at
least we can predict SOME of the future.

<P>
   Imagine the unwashed folk who lounged around the fire with their
cups of foul ale in January 1000, wondering what the new millennium
might bring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they hoped for a better way to sharpen knives or soothe
a throbbing tooth.
</P>
<P>
   But computers and genetic engineering? Inconceivable. Equally
futile are most of our own speculations about third-millennium
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At least we can be reasonably certain about predicting what will
occur in the heavens over specific periods.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, events can sometimes take us by surprise. Some comets, for
example, have such incredibly slow orbits _ 5,000 to 100,000 years
_ that every visit close to the sun seems like the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Halley's, follow shorter, more predictable
periods. Its next appearance in 2061 should be a winner _ the
comet's bright, fuzzy head will ie favorably in the northern sky
and its tail may span half the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are plenty of sky wonders on the way that
won't require a 60-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   A midnight lunar eclipse, easily visible throughout North
America on Jan. 20, for example, kicks off the new century in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of my top 10 list of the events for the early
years of the 21st century, astronomical headliners that require
nothing more than the naked eye:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000: &LR;  Jupiter approaches Saturn in the autumn sky. The
eye-catching meeting of these two giant planets happens once every
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2001: &LR;  Those in the upper half of the United States should look
northward for vivid displays of the aurora borealis, a by-product
of a peak in solar storm activity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2003: &LR;  On Aug. 27, Mars will venture closer to Earth than at
any time in the past 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks the Red Planet will outshine everything else in
the night sky except for the moon and will be a delight through
backyard telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  In June, for the first time since 1882, Venus will cross
the face of the sun. With a proper sun-dimming filter, this rare
type of eclipse, known as a transit, can be seen without a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  The first spacecraft to orbit Saturn will arrive at the
ringed planet for a four-year reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is the last of a kind _ heavy, expensive and fully
loaded. Its arrival won't be visible, of course, but you can bet
that glitzy pictures from the billion-dollar mission will show up
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2006: &LR;  The moon's shadow will sweep over Egypt and run through
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2009: &LR;  The greatest, longest solar eclipse of the 21st century
will cross China and the Pacific Ocean, offering a rare 6.5 minutes
of daytime darkness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2012: &LR;  Venus will transit the sun again, the last such event of
the century. This time it will be visible from North America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2017: &LR;  Breaking a 38-year drought, a total eclipse of the sun
will slash the United States from coast to coast, briefly turning
day into night. It will be our first glimpse of totality in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if we can't all be as prescient as Jules Verne, at
least we can predict SOME of the future.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ It is fascinating to study the
interplay between remarkable individuals who dominated and shaped
the last 100 years. For example, a 1939 letter from Albert Einstein
to Franklin Roosevelt set in motion a monumental project that six
years later ended World War II. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Come out of your bomb shelter and break out the
bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K computer bug has been zapped.
</P>
<P>
   So say two studies predicting a smattering of annoyances but no
major catastrophes with the arrival of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the work of tens of thousands of computer
professionals who have made billions of lines of code ready for the
year 2000, we're forecasting a relatively quiet weekend with
isolated problems,'' said Matthew Hotle, vice president of Year
2000 Research at GartnerGroup, a Stamford, Conn., company that
released its findings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most system failures will have little impact on general
consumers, the study said. The research company also predicted that
there would be few service interruptions at public utilities and
that less than 10 percent of all Y2K-related failures would occur
within two weeks of Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that government services would be at the
greatest risk of having problems related to the computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was a similar GartnerGroup study, released in
July 1997, that fueled much of the early hype about the computer
glitch. In that study, the company said it would cost industries
and governments an estimated $300 billion to $600 billion
worldwide. GartnerGroup defended that estimate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts say there is the potential that computers and
software originally programmed to recognize only the last two
digits of a year will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the
machines will assume it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   In a competing survey released Monday, International Data Corp.
of Framingham, Mass., predicted some computer downtime in the
nation, but not enough to have much a long-term effect on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   While annoying and embarrassing Y2K computer glitches are
possible, IDC's Project Magellan team found that major
infrastructure outages would not occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K scenario favored by IDC is one where problems
experienced by one company do impact others, but not
dramatically,'' the authors of the study concluded. ``One company's
lost dollar of revenue is another company's 70 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries expected to lose the most revenue due to computer
problems, according to IDC, are Russia, Korea, Taiwan, China and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the type of glitches expected, IDC cited
Assicurazioni Generali, the biggest insurance company in Italy,
which printed more than 600,000 documents dated 1900 instead of
2000.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-HIJACK (New Delhi) _ Developments: The hijackers drop
their demand for $200 million; Afghanistan's ruling Taliban says
that if Indian negotiators don't settle things soon, the plane will
be forced to leave. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SHRINE (Kiryat Arba) _ Tearing down what had become a
monument to a killer, the Israeli Army on Wednesday razed a shrine
built around the grave of Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who
gunned down 29 Muslims at prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in
neighboring Hebron nearly six years ago. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-KOHL (Frankfurt, Germany) _ German prosecutors announced
Wednesday they are pursuing an investigation against former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for accepting possibly illegal campaign
donations. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-WHISTLEBLOWER (Moscow) _ Alexander Nikitin, a former
naval officer charged by Russia with treason for exposing pollution

<P>
   SAFRICA-BOMBINGS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ Authorities

</P>
<P>
   WIS-WELFARE (Milwaukee) _ A Special Report: So, did it work?
Whatever else can be said about Wisconsin's crusade to end welfare
_ whether one judges it kind or cruel, whether one thinks it left
the safety net stronger or in shreds _ the effort has achieved two
things. It left far fewer people on welfare. It put more of them to
work. Yet here is the dawning surprise: it may end up making less
of a difference in the lives of the poor than politicians or the
public imagined. By Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   LA-PRISON-STANDOFF (Undated) _ Officers storm a room in
Louisiana's maximum security prison, killing a hostage-taker to end
a two-hour standoff during which inmates beat a guard to death. The
warden says the prisoners thought they could force their freedom by
mimicking the strategy of Cuban inmates who held several guards
hostage. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   DEL-ABANDONED-CHILD (Rockland, De.) _ Folo on the arrest Monday

</P>
<P>

<P>
   CAPITAL-SPENDING (Undated) _ Exodus Communications Inc., born of
the Internet, lost money this year. And last year. And the year
before. But it is spending hundreds of millions of dollars anyway
on new high-tech centers to house and operate the Web sites of
hundreds of clients. The Exodus story _ a young and profitless
company that expands like crazy, gambling on a golden future _
helps to explain why capital spending in America has been so
strong. But this is somewhat unexpected. Many experts had worried
that investment in new facilities and equipment would slow in the
fourth quarter as corporate America braced for the millennium. Or
that the slowdown would come early next year as spending to upgrade
computer software for Year 2000 tapered off. The former has not
happened and the latter is not likely to happen. Quite the
contrary, the capital spending boom appears to have enough steam to
continue well into the new year, sustaining the nation's robust
growth. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   SCHWAB-OUTLOOK (Undated) _ Charles Schwab says it expects
fourth-quarter earnings to rise as much as 67 percent, exceeding

December. Also looking at the outlook for other online brokerage
firms. By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily Marketplace column.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks were higher in early trading, with
the Nasdaq composite index at 4,023.29. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 0.49 percent, the S&AMP;P 500 up 0.50 percent and the
Nasdaq composite up 1.28 percent. The yield on the 30-year bond was
at 6.46 percent. European markets were slightly higher. London,
after two days off, was up 0.48 percent; Frankfurt up 0.03 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.14 percent, while Hong Kong's
Hang Seng index ended down 1.58 percent. By Robert D. Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-INDUSTRY (Frankfurt) _ Looking at the reaction within
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's party and elsewhere in Germany to the
the government's proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax on
sales of German industrial assets. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-GE (Seoul) _ General Electric and a unit of ABB Ltd. are

   Today's recipes are perfect if you've got guests this weekend.
They're all server- and diner-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnne Linscott, Hurst, Texas, saw our request for a coffeecake
using frozen rolls and pudding. Her family loves this bread, and
she loves its simplicity. I thank my friend Marlene in Virginia for
the recipe and call it Marlene's coffee cake.

the minestrone soup served at Olive Garden restaurants. I found
both of the following recipes on the Internet. The first is from
Gloria Pitzer, the ``recipe detective'' based in Michigan. The
second is from Susan Bewich and was found at soar.Berkeley.EDU.

   Requests:
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Day Johnson, Keller, Texas, writes, ``My grandmother told
me about a recipe for dressing that she had gotten from a co-worker
back in the 1950s. It called for raisins, hamburger, rice, and
onion, among other things. She cannot find it in any of her old
cookbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Moore would like a recipe for peanut butter balls covered
with chocolate. The peanut butter has the consistency of a Reese's
peanut butter cup and the chocolate is hardened.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader would like a recipe for the mini pecan pies that
was included with the Texas Electric bills sometime in the 1980s.
The tiny pies were the size of a half-dollor and were made in small
mini muffin pans.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Worth reader would like to find a starter recipe for
sourdough bread made with instant potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Moeller, Fort Worth, would like a recipe for a white
chocolate cheese cake that has no crust. Her husband is on a
gluten-free diet.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Grimes, Fort Worth, would like a recipe for pecan
brittle.
</P>
<P>
   Jolene White is looking for the recipe for Truman Capote's

   Health on the shelves
</P>
<P>
   Kraft rolled out a new line of salad dressings that are pumped
up with additional vitamin E. One serving (2 tablespoons) of Taste
of Life dressings offers 50 percent of the daily requirement of
this antioxidant nutrient. (A recent United States Department of
Agriculture study found that three out of four women and six of 10
men don't get the recommended daily amounts of vitamin E in their
diet.) The dressings are available in four flavors and cost about
$2.80 for a 14-ounce bottle.

<P>
   Dressing on duty
</P>
<P>
   Benecol, maker of the spread that can help lower LDL
cholesterol, is now making a splash on salads with a new line of
dressings. We found them pretty good, as bottled dressings go.
Choices are creamy Italian, Thousand Island, ranch and French.
</P>
<P>
   There is a problem, however, with the packaging. It looks so
medicinal it nearly shouts, ``Eat this dressing and be regular.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Help for harried parents
</P>
<P>
   Kraft introduces Pizza 'N Pepperoni, a resealable bag of cheese
and pepperoni slices. Even a first-grader can spread pizza sauce on
a bagel, top with the cheese and pepperoni from the bag and pop
into the oven. Dinner in a snap.
</P>

<P>
   Seal it up
</P>
<P>
   Trimmed and washed salad greens have been one of the blessings
of the 1990s. This year Fresh Express installed a zip closure on
the bag. Perfect for smaller families or singles, this takes
convenience one step further.

<P>
   Chicken with no trouble
</P>
<P>
   Louis Rich offers up ready-to-eat chicken breast strips in
grilled, teriyaki, Italian and Southwestern flavors. They're great
for stuffing baked potatoes, wrapping in tortillas or tossing into
a stir-fry.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Two pros on top of their form
</P>
<P>
   ``Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home'' by Julia Child and Jacques
Pepin (Knopf, $40) shows these two kitchen veterans at their most
friendly and informative. Paired as a companion to a PBS series by
the same name, this book gives her recipe for each dish _ and his
often conflicting recipe for the same dish. The recipes are mostly
classic French with some American favorites thrown in. This is a
great book for both the experienced and beginning cook.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ewwwww
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Berman introduces IncrEdibles. After heating the tubes
in a microwave oven, consumers insert a plastic stick to ``push and
eat'' offerings including macaroni and cheese, chili mac, and
scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon or sauce. Thank goodness
they're available only in New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Weird science
</P>
<P>
   Frank Meczkowski invents Hamburger Stackers for Vlasic by
continual cross-breeding of mammoth cucumbers. The
3.5-inch-diameter pickle slices give consumers a piece of pickle in
every bite of a hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen-challenged
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it was too difficult for consumers to add a can of
water or milk to a can of Campbell's tomato soup. So _ ta-daa _ the
nation's No. 1 soup company added it for us. Ready to Serve Tomato
Soup requires only ``three quick steps: Unscrew the lid, pour into
a mug and heat.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's all in a name
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Tra Vigne Cookbook'' by Michael Chiarello (Chronicle,
$35) includes a ``crispy onion salad.'' In Texas, we call them
onion rings.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Honey, get a job
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lake House Cookbook'' details the country life of Trudie
Styler and her husband, Sting. Trudie's interest in organic foods
``transformed Lake House into a 60-acre working organic farm.'' One
sentence in this book begins ``Our farmer ...'' And there's ``her
American chef.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hide the knives
</P>
<P>
   Cookie dough in a roll wasn't enough. Now the corporations are
keeping us from sharp objects. Nestle introduced pull-apart cookie
and brownie dough. Pillsbury went one step further and offered
brownies already in the pan.

   Y2K-WATCH _ WASHINGTON _ Rest your eyes Thursday. Tomorrow, you
may be wearing them out in front of the television. New Year's Eve
typically is a quiet news day, with reporters doing little but
reviewing the year's events and updating party stories. But this
Dec. 31 could prove to be extremely news-filled because of threats
posed worldwide by computer software flaws and terrorists. Here's a
guide for readers who want to monitor events around the globe.

   Y2K-DOOM _ This new millennium thing isn't the first time some
people thought the world was going to end. History is littered with
failed prophecies and false alarms. Here's a short list from the
past 1,000 years: 999: Christians aware of the calendar count that
began with the birth of Jesus believe the Second Coming will occur
at the end of the first millennium. (Palm Beach Post).

   Y2K-DELTA _ ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines talks about its

   Y2K-TV _ ATLANTA _ What are the news and entertainment networks
and local stations doing for New Year's Eve/Day? For one thing,
they're all hard at work. TV staff tells you what's on on Friday
and Saturday as we head into 2000. (Jubera/Kloer/Vejnoska, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 28.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-TELEVISION _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Not everybody wants to venture
out to wild parties on New Year's Eve, and TV has lots of options,
from the relatively serious 23-hour live coverage by ABC News to
the decidedly silly plans of TCM to run 15 hours of Elvis movies.
We'll take a look at the couch potato options for the
Y2K-challenged. (Holloway, Austin American-Statesman). 27.

<P>
   RELIGION-2000 _ ATLANTA _ It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience

century and send them into the next? We ask metro pastors and
priests. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   PUFFDADDY-GUN _ ATLANTA _ Ralph Cooper's gun went to New York
City sometime this year, without its owner. It ended up in Puff
Daddy's car. Cooper, a 53-year-old, church-going construction
worker, has since replaced it, and now wears a .40 caliber pistol
on his work belt. He doesn't like rap, by the way. He prefers
Frankie Avalon and Pat Boone. And he wants his gun back. (Schrade,

   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CENSUS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The seemingly arcane issue of
whether U.S. census takers should use a strict head count or
so-called ``statistical sampling'' could be troublesome for
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush. ``Sampling''
supporters say the strategy produces the most accurate
representation of the nation's population because census takers
inevitably miss many people, particularly minorities. In 1990, the
feds missed about 500,000 Texans, many of them Hispanics. The U.S.
Supreme Court has ruled that the head count must be used to draw
congressional lines, but that estimates can be used to dole out
federal aid and for state house redistricting . Most Republicans
oppose sampling because minorities tend to vote Democratic. That
puts Bush, who is trying hard to win over Hispanics, in a difficult
spot. Generally, Bush favors a head count, but he hasn't taken a
position on whether federal officials calculating aid or states
drawing legislative districts should have access to the estimates.
(Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman). 20.

   MILLENNIUM-HOME (Undated) _ A Thousand Years of House &AMP; Home:
Important Milestones, Obscure Turning Points and Assorted Wrong
Turns. Brights, in chronological order, by Stephen Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   NASA-ARCHITECTS (Houston) _ Frank Lloyd Wright once said, ``A
house is not going anywhere, if we can help it.'' On the cusp of
the year 2000, it is hard to imagine what would shock him more:
that houses are going into orbit, or that architects are helping
design them. Certainly, Wright would be wary of the required
synthetic materials and the enormous artistic restraint placed on
designers. But for the small and growing cadre of architects
bravely designing for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, such conditions present interesting, and entirely
new, challenges. ``No problem we are trying to solve has a
predetermined answer,'' said Garrett Finney, one of four architects
in NASA's new Habitability Design Center in Houston. By Florence
Williams.

   TRANSLUCENT-LOOK (Undated) _ ``You can almost taste the color,''
Ellen Sideri said, as she pondered the new generation of
fruit-colored translucent products. Ms. Sideri is the president of
Ellen Sideri Partnership, a trend forecasting company in New York.
``The movement into the 2000's is toward what I call sensual
aesthetics, where not just shape but sound and taste are
important,'' she pronounced in millennial tones. ``Even smell _
think of the whole aromatherapy thing _ is important.'' From
watches to telephones, beepers to computers, a wave of new products
have arrived that look good enough to eat. It's as if some
high-concept artist had set out to fabricate a whole line of common
objects out of hard candy. By Phil Patton.

   LONDON-APOCALYPSE (London) _ It's a bit like giving away the end
of the movie, but the British Museum has scheduled its new
exhibition on the Apocalypse to run through April 24, which
suggests that the venerable institution does not expect fire and
brimstone to strike this weekend. On the other hand, the show's
full title does leave things open: ``The Apocalypse and the Shape
of Things to Come.'' Perhaps it's just a matter of getting the date
right. By Alan Riding.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I went to buy a gift the other day for my husband, whose
birthday happens to be a few days after Christmas. As I stood in
line to buy a sweater that he had picked out, I watched as scores
of customers trundled up to the register with holiday returns. Gift
after gift was exchanged for either store credit, another item or,
for a ``lucky'' few, cash.
</P>
<P>
   As I waited, toying with the idea of buying something I liked
but that my husband had not seen and approved, I realized that the
joy and pleasure of gift giving is quickly being replaced by a
mutually agreed upon exchange of currency. Gifts are rarely
expected to be kept _ they are merely wrappable stand-ins ready to
be traded in for what the recipient really wants.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this happening?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that we are a society increasingly focused on
individualism. We are all desperately striving to be unique,
self-aware beings who know our selves better than anyone else
possibly could. While this can be a good thing in many ways, it
makes gift-giving a bit tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not a big fan of bad gifts. I've certainly received my
share _ like that two-decades-too-late-sweater from Aunt Gertie or
that highly flammable scarf from Uncle Herb. But those gifts, while
not perfect, were still enjoyable. It was fun to open the package
and see the present for the first time, to wonder where the giver
had found it, to try to sense what they knew about me that had
caused them to select it.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, people value only things that they have
chosen themselves. They don't trust anyone to select a desirable
piece of clothing, CD or objet d'art for them.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago my company, Youth Intelligence, did a study in
which we asked more than 200 teen-agers what they wanted for the
holidays. More than two-thirds said they wanted cash or gift
certificates. Few believed that even their closest friends could
select an appropriate gift. If cash or gift certificates were not
options, then most wanted to receive a gift from a store where he
or she could exchange it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, teens are getting what they want. Companies are
responding to this new need with innovative offerings. While
old-fashioned gift certificates still exist, many stores _ such as
Bloomingdale's, Gap and Barnes and Noble _ sell ``gift cards,''
which function like debit cards. The buyer designates the amount,
and the recipient charges against the card until the value is $0.
</P>
<P>
   There's something a bit sad about this because the gift is no
longer something to be remembered. Think about a teen who receives
an Old Navy gift card for Christmas. He may go to the store, select
some track pants and use his gift card to purchase them. He may
even mentally thank the giver for the money. But, most likely, he
will think of the track pants as something he bought, not a gift. A
year later, he probably won't even remember how he came to buy the
track pants in the first place. (Something I definitely couldn't
say about Aunt Gertie's sweater.)
</P>
<P>
   Some stores are taking this idea a step further by setting up
gift registries and wish lists. While this may help us get what we
want, it also creates a situation in which our only way of
evaluating a present is through how much the giver spent on it.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues in this direction, we may end up doing
away with the entire gift-giving custom. Instead, we'll just
exchange cash a few times a year. I'll give my husband $50 to go
buy himself something for his birthday, and several months later
he'll give me the same for mine.
</P>
<P>
   Individualism can be a good thing. It can lead to creativity and
self-exploration. But it's important to realize that you can't _
and probably shouldn't _ always get exactly what you want.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we learn about ourselves through the eyes of others.
When we look at what an individual chooses to give us, we get a
glimpse of how they see us.
</P>
<P>
   We can also discover new things with a little help from a
friend. A gift may turn us on to a musician we'd never heard of or
a hobby we hadn't thought to try.
</P>
<P>
   Individualism is important, but we shouldn't let a commercial
trend allow us to reject a side of ourselves we might not yet have
explored.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that the next time you rip open some wrapping paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the asphalt schoolyard of Lucy Stone Elementary
School, two young boys circle and spar: A quick shoulder jab to the
nose. Then, a headlock like the one the Undertaker did a few nights
before on a pro wrestling television show.
</P>
<P>
   It looks dangerous, and some school officials say it is.
Determined to stop violent behavior sparked by the pro wrestling
craze, educators across the state are trying to find a way to keep
the pile drivers and the flying body slams out of schools. At
Prescott Elementary School in Norwood, they forbid pupils from
copying the wrestling moves on school grounds. In Greenfield public
schools, teachers are trained to recognize pro wrestling hand
signals that double as curses. And in Salem, Federal Street
Elementary School suspends about 20 youngsters a year, most for
behavior inspired by pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major problem, a total obsession by kids,'' said Ricky
Sahady, principal of Fall River's Doran School. He has enlisted
Roland Martineau, formerly known as ``Mr. X From Parts Unknown,''
to visit with students to demystify the wrestling world and discuss
the carefully choreographed moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is going to get hurt. They see it on TV the night
before and then try the move in school. We try to explain that
these people they see are professionally trained acrobats,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Students argue that there is a world of difference between the
violence of blockbuster movies and the circus-like pantomime of
professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Few youngsters, they note, would try to power-slam someone from
a step ladder 10 feet off the ground. They and even some
specialists say it is simply kid culture; maybe more violent than
parents remember, but nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's faker than most of the movies with all the shootings and
guns,'' said Matt Randolph, 13, who spends his free time performing
headlocks and fake wrestling jabs with friends. Randolph and his
friends gather Monday nights to watch ``Raw'' wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say they worry because, unlike high-tech shoot-outs in
the movies, wrestling is so easy to copy. And play fighting, they
say, can easily turn into real fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a big impact on schools,'' said Josephine Sullivan,
principal of Federal Street School. ``The kids are grabbing each
other by the neck and flipping each other backward. I would ask
`Are you mad at Susie or Johnny?' and they would just shrug. But
they really like this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional wrestling certainly would not qualify as family
television. Once a carefully planned theater of crowd-pleasing fake
body slams, the sport has been injected with lewdness and
profanity. Gang fights that pit seven against one and props that
include bullwhips and steel chairs are now staples.
</P>
<P>
   In the World Wrestling Federation's shows ``Smackdown!'' and
``Raw,'' the plots include bikini-clad women partaking in
kidnapping, simulated sex, and pudding wrestling. An Indiana
University study of 50 programs recently found 1,658 instances
where wrestlers grabbed crotches, 128 simulated sex acts, and 434
used sexually explicit phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting,'' said Martineau, who is fielding more
requests every month to speak to students.
</P>
<P>
   Martineau _ whose gimmick was to wear a white mask and black
cape and to ``go after the little, old ladies who used to sit
ringside'' before he retired more than a decade ago _ said the
sport is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, these kids are jumping off tabletops because the
shows are getting over the top, too. In this last Pay-Per-View,
Miss Kitty actually took her halter top off,'' he said. ``No father
in his right brain would let his kids watch this stuff. My kids
were raised on wrestling and this isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than three decades of research attempting to link
media violence with more violent youths, ``it still is fairly
ambiguous there is some connection,'' said Julie Dobrow,
coordinator of the Family and Media Initiative at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   And a survey of some 50 schools in Massachusetts by the Globe
did not turn up any serious injuries from the mock wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the last time I checked, people who watched
wrestling became fine, upstanding members of society, and I suspect
the same will happen here,'' said Bruce Weinberg, professor of
marketing at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt that kids are mimicking the verbal expressions
and we would find that rude. . . . but for kids, it's fun. It's the
current game.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Fenway High School senior Phil Carey loved the ``game,''
but traded in Monday night ``Raw'' for homework because he says he
was becoming obsessed. Now 18, Carey, still cannot help but wonder
who Stone Cold Steve Austin is body slamming these days, but noted
his hiatus has been healthy: His grades have turned around, and he
sees the way his 15-year-old brother mimics the fake wrestling jabs
and realizes how ``ridiculous'' it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Carey remains unconvinced, however, that pro-wrestling increases
youth violence. He said the pro wrestling world is just a place for
some children to hover as they sort out the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantasy place, you can understand it. People grow out
if it,'' Carey said. ``It just wasn't good for me anymore.''

   NASA-ARCHITECTS (Houston) _ Frank Lloyd Wright once said, ``A
house is not going anywhere, if we can help it.'' On the cusp of
the year 2000, it is hard to imagine what would shock him more:
that houses are going into orbit, or that architects are helping
design them. Certainly, Wright would be wary of the required
synthetic materials and the enormous artistic restraint placed on
designers. But for the small and growing cadre of architects
bravely designing for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, such conditions present interesting, and entirely
new, challenges. ``No problem we are trying to solve has a

UNRAVELING BRUINS NEED TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UPPER MONCLAIR, N.J. _ Is it a funk? A trend that won't end? A
short-term nosedive or a long-term condition? What ails the Bruins?
</P>
<P>
   The club is 2-7-4 in its last 13 games and far too often has
looked shockingly inept _ as it did in the last two periods of a
3-0 loss against the Islanders Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They don't beat the teams they should, they lack any kind of
consistent offense, and they too often look disorganized and shaky
in their own end.
</P>
<P>
   Here are theories that could explain what's going on:
</P>
<P>
   Theory No. 1: Some players are balking at executing the game
plan. It's the explanation, or one of them, that coach Pat Burns
put forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't understand it,'' said Burns. ``Over the past two
years, this club has played a certain way. We've picked up 180-odd
points in two years, we've gone three rounds in the playoffs. All
of a sudden, it's not good enough anymore. Now, we have to pinch,
we have to take chances, be more offensive and try to copy other
teams and this is the result _ giving up two-on-ones. I watched New
Jersey-Buffalo and Buffalo gave up about 10 two-on-ones. If you're
going to play like that, you're not going to win too many hockey
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was especially pointed when discussing the play of
third-year forwards Joe Thornton and Sergei Samsonov. Neither has
shown much recently, and Burns has said in the past that perhaps
too much was being expected of them. Too often, the coach said, the
youngsters aren't doing what they're supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard somewhere that their development maybe isn't as up to
par as it should be,'' he said. ``That may be so, but if you're
getting between 20-22 minutes a game and nothing is happening . . .
maybe sometimes you have to change the way you were playing or
maybe we're putting too much on these guys, to say that these
21-year-olds are going to go out and do it for us on a regular
basis. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he asked one player how he wanted to play and the
player answered, ``Creatively.'' If that's the case, Burns said,
this slump will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get out of it when we decide to play a certain
way that's feasible to us,'' he said. ``It's certainly not the way
this team has played in the past and it's certainly not the way
this team is going to have success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We addressed the issue (Tuesday) morning and we addressed it
at practice. We're going to have to stop playing like this. The way
they're playing is not the way they're told to play or not the way
they're supposed to play. If you think Joe Thornton is playing good
hockey, I must be awfully stupid. If you think Joe Thornton is at
the top of his game or Sergei Samsonov is being electrifying, now
come on. Let's be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   What Burns wants from everyone is intestinal fortitude. If it
means taking a hit to make a play, take the hit. If it means
getting slashed or knocked down, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've asked of this team is 100 percent effort day in and
day out, I've asked good execution, and I've asked for pride and
commitment and I haven't seen that lately,'' he said. ``Why, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns is especially disappointed in Thornton because he knows
how well Thornton can play when he applies himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the frustrating part for everybody, that I know he can
do it,'' said Burns. ``I can't seem to understand why he wouldn't
want to do it on a consistent basis. Is he telling himself, `Well,
I'll do it later in my career'? Well, he'd better not wait too long
because it might pass you by.''
</P>
<P>
   Theory No. 2: Players have tuned out the coach, a possibility
presented in print by colleague Kevin Paul Dupont.
</P>
<P>
   The players have rallied 'round their coach, but Burns, though
he brushes off the idea that his job is in jeopardy, does worry
that the speculation will distract his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does have an effect on the team,'' he said. ``Any
time you have those rumors or those `experts' who decide this might
be the way out because another team did it, I have to just shrug it
off. I've seen it before and I've heard it before and I've seen it
many times before. There's not a whole lot you can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start trouble like that in an organization, it
becomes an excuse for the team. Some players are actually stupid
enough to believe that Harry just might do that. I haven't gotten
the feeling that's going to happen, I haven't got any issues with
management about that, nobody has approached me, and nobody has
talked to me about that. I'm sure they won't. If they do it, they
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as he's coaching, Burns said, he'll continue to do it
the way he always has and he'll do the best with the talent and
experience he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job here is to win hockey games,'' he said. ``You've got to
win, that's the main thing. If you don't win, these are the stories
that you hear.''

&HT;     RICE, YOUNG DESERVE ANOTHER YEAR WITH THE NINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all they have meant to the franchise through
the years, the San Francisco 49ers should give quarterback Steve
Young and receiver Jerry Rice an opportunity to play one more
season, together again.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a sentimental journey, call it bowing to the wills of
two great players, call it taking the easy way out, call it what
you will.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Rice have earned the chance to do the voodoo that they
do so well one more time, for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For Young, it is simple. If his physicians clear him to play and
Young still wants to play, which he does, let him _ with one
overriding caveat: Suffer another concussion in the employ of the
49ers and it's over, right then and there, no matter if it's the
first game of the season or the last. That way, the club will have
granted him the privilege to try to play again.
</P>
<P>
   If a concussion results, it is all on Young for being so foolish
as to think he can continue to play a violent game when he is
getting older and the guys hitting him with the force of a dropped
floor safe are getting younger and faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what's the risk of another concussion, being
he's had several,'' coach Steve Mariucci said of Young, idled for
the last three months by a concussion resulting from a
freight-train hit by Arizona's Aeneas Williams. ``Even if he was
cleared, you still worry about him having another concussion. ...
We'll have to see how that plays out. Part of me envisions him
playing next year, playing well, and part of me doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said it took Young, 39, about a month to shake off the
effects of the concussion suffered Sept. 27 against the Arizona
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Young's eyes are clear, he is relaxed and he looks to be
in great shape from all the jogging, stair-running and treadmill
miles he has done to drive away the keen frustration of not
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 38, is another matter. He is not the player he was four or
five years ago, yet he is better than he was four or five months
ago because his right knee is healthy at last. Against Cincinnati
he had nine catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns and in the
second Carolina game he had a 48-yard touchdown pass, a fair
approximation of the player he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there's still some petrol left in Rice's tank. Why not
let him burn it up, pedal to the metal, in a 49ers uniform?
</P>
<P>
   Economics, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL's version of death by decimals, Rice and Young are
both down for big salary-cap numbers in 2000. The 49ers will be
about $24 million over the cap when the season ends Monday night in
Atlanta. The club has until March 1 to become cap-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Tim McDonald, who knows a thing or two about
economics, NFL style, said that is missing the point. In a nearly
sub-audible tone following the overtime loss to the Washington
Redskins, he said, ``You've got it all wrong. It's not a question
of salaries. It's not a question of age. ... You guys keep writing
about the older players and the salary cap. We'll find a way to
deal with it. How long as the cap been an issue, 1993? We'll find a
way to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely they will. The method might be draconian or it might be
sentimental. Logically, the 49ers are not going to rebuild from
this mess they are in with Young and Rice. Yet both players might
have more to offer than others on the roster at their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we are going to address when the season is
over, trying to decide what's best for the team, deciding how we
can fit these players on our team with the salary cap,'' Mariucci
said. ``We need to sit down ... as an organization and try to
decide what's best. We have to be above-board, honest and
truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   For all they have given to the team, Young and Rice deserve a
chance to come back in 2000. Young, to see if he can play
concussion-free football. Rice, to see if he can still play a young
man's game on an old man's legs.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers owe them that much.

 &HT;    VATICAN BREAKS WITH CHURCH CALENDAR: Pilgrims have 12 extra days
to celebrate Holy Year
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   ROME _ Traditionally the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the
year-long Grand Jubilee from Christmas to Christmas. But this year
Roman Catholic pilgrims will have 12 days extra to observe the
Church's Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration, which kicked off on Christmas Eve, when Pope
John Paul II opened the brass Holy Door situated under the portico
of St. Peter's Basilica, will terminate on Jan. 6, 2001, the day of
the Epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   When the pontiff during the Christmas Eve Mass said: ``At the
threshold of the new millennium, the Church salutes you, Son of
God,'' he was perhaps breaking with strict traditionalists who
believe that the New Millennium begins a year later.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the globe is chilling bottles of champagne in
anticipation for New Year's bashes to bring in the Third Millennium
with a kick, the Roman Catholic calendar fails to recognize ``year
zero.'' The Church's new millennium thus officially begins January
1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The first Grand Jubilee was celebrated in 1300 and was presided
over by Pope Boniface VIII. The celebration supposedly replenished
temporal and religious spirits in a city which had been ravaged by
plague. Legend has it that more than a million pilgrims attended
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was the poet Dante whose description can be found in
his ``Inferno.'' The Jubilee was initially held every half-century,
and then was changed to every 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   By kicking off the Jubilee celebrations on Dec. 24, 1999 and
closing them on Jan. 6, 2001, the Roman Catholic Church avoided
controversy by embracing both camps: Those who believe the new
millennium begins in 2000, and those who assert that it starts a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it's correct to celebrate Jubilee 2000 as the
Holy Year of the new millennium, is yet to be known.
</P>
<P>
   No other Pope has had to face this dilemma and the Christian
faithful will just have to wait to see if the next pope follows
John Paul II precedent when faced with the same predicament: In a
thousand years!

ON-LINE TRADING CLICKS WITH MAINSTREAM INVESTORS

 By LYNNLEY BROWNING   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is the new icon of America's obsession with investing? Is it
``Stuart,'' the frenetic 20-something with spiky orange hair who
hypes an Internet brokerage to his boss? Or is it Shelly Glazier, a
64-year-old medical office administrator who spends an hour each
night poring over her portfolio, trading stocks on line just
several times a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart,'' the wild-maned star of a television advertising
blitz by Ameritrade, a Web brokerage, might cast the country as a
nation of gamblers. But it is real people like Glazier who are
fueling a revolution in how Americans manage their money in the
digital era.
</P>
<P>
   In a pivotal shift, experts expect older citizens with sizable
income and middle-class folk with careful savings habits to
constitute the bulk of Web investors in the new millennium.
Aggressive traders like ``Stuart'' _ the original acolytes of
Internet stockpicking _ are peaking in number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainstream investors will form the majority of future on-line
investors,'' said Kenneth Clemmer, an analyst at Forrester
Research, a Cambridge, Mass. consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   When Internet brokers exploded onto the scene four years ago
with fast, low-cost trading, they targeted risk-lovers hoping to
get rich quick. Do-it-yourself stock-picking was a novelty.
Old-fashioned money managers like Merrill Lynch ignored the
upstarts. Even innovators like Charles Schwab, the pioneering
discount brokerage, were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the defensive, established players are reinventing
themselves on line and transforming Web investing into a
mass-market phenomenon. The changes are prompting cyber-competitors
like E(asterisk)Trade and Datek to revamp themselves to appeal to
ordinary investors. ``Traditional is moving on line, and on-line is
becoming more traditional,'' said Dan Latimore, a consultant at
Mainspring, an e-commerce research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the two worlds _ one rooted in branches,
stockbrokers, and advice, the other a click-and-trade planet _ has
ignited a war for the next generation of investors. Billboards are
plastered with pitches from on-line brokers old and new. TV is
glutted with dot.com investing spots.
</P>
<P>
   Withars, trips, even million-dollar prizes, the come-ons
reflect a giant shift by Web-only brokers toward attracting
investors with stable assets, rather than restless traders. And the
ads underscore the old guard's belated acceptance of Internet
investing as a business here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic stockpicking's original growth came from Web-only
brokers, where low costs attracted active investors _ mostly
``Stuart'' types, who trade scores of times a year; affluent,
aggressive investors; and ``day traders,'' who scoot in and out of
stocks dozens of times a day.
</P>
<P>
   But with most active traders already on line, brokers of all
stripes must find ways to lure ordinary investors, who want not
just cheap trading but extensive research, analysis, news, money
management, retirement planning, even advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain maturing of the market,'' said Richard
Sylla, a financial historian at New York University's Stern School
of Business. ``Instead of the glitz of trading, the talk is now
about how you can attract more stable customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Glazier, by many indications one of on-line investing's
new, core customers. ``I would call myself an investor, not a
trader,'' said Glazier, who buys and sells stocks once every couple
of months through Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the nation's biggest Web
investing company. ``Generally, I try to buy good companies to
begin with and stay with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Glazier, who manages appointments at Children's Medical Care
North in Chelsea, Mass., recently bought another 100 shares of Sun
Microsystems and dumped Boston Market, the ailing restaurant chain
acquired by McDonald's Corp. Unlike the first generation of Web
traders, Glazier keeps an account at a full-service brokerage,
Tucker Cleary. And she is still devoted to mutual funds _ only now
she buys them on line.
</P>
<P>
   Glazier's son, Kenneth, also trades on line, keeping accounts at
two discount brokers. ``They make it so easy _ you might trade
stocks that you might never buy if you had to pay more to a broker
to do it,'' said the orthopedic surgeon, 46. ``It's good to have
advice, even if it's on line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the Internet turned brokers' $200 commissions
into do-it-yourself trades costing as little as $5, 7 million
households have opened on-line accounts. A recent survey found that
18 percent of investors now buy stocks via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest thing that ever came down the pike,'' said
Marcia Legg, 59, a retired nurse who recently put $128,000 of
savings into an on-line trading account at Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans still prefer mutual funds and broker-assisted
trades. But with half of all US households already invested in
stocks, and one in three equity trades made by individual investors
now placed through the Web, that is about to change: By 2003, 41
percent of stock-owning households are expected to trade on line.
</P>
<P>
   As ordinary investors flock to the Internet, they are rapidly
remaking the rules of Web investing, both for cyber-outposts and
traditional, pinstriped brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   With no branches and no human beings dispensing advice, dot.com
brokers make their money on how often clients trade stocks and on
interest from loans to customers, who then invest the borrowed
money.
</P>
<P>
   The business has flourished in a golden stock market. But with
profits tied to trading volumes, Web-only brokerages are vulnerable
to an economic downturn; Forrester predicts 3 in 4 eventually will
go bankrupt or be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Now the goal is to attract stable customers with long-term
assets who are prepared to pay a little more for investment
management services.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the nation's 160 Web-only brokers handle as many
trades a day as the on-line operations of traditional brokers. But
with more assets and customers than the dot.coms, as well as the
branches their cybercousins lack, the old guard has an advantage.
Schwab and Fidelity handle 71 percent of all money invested on
line, or $465 billion, while the top Web-only broker, ETrade, has
one-tenth that amount. Merrill Lynch has branches across the
country and 5 million customers with $1.5 trillion in assets, while
Datek, the second-largest Web-only brokerage, has 290,000 customer
accounts, with $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going after middle America, and we're seeing the
start of this, you'll need a physical presence,'' said Russell
Keene, an industry analyst at Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP;
Thornton, a securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   A few traditional brokerages cautiously introduced limited Web
trading this year. But the arrival on line of older Americans with
retirement income and middle-class investors has forced the old
guard to embrace the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, the world's largest broker, just introduced a
service allowing customers to trade stocks and bonds on line for
$29.95 a trade and tap into research, initial public offerings, and
on-line auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, once synomymous with discount brokerages, now wants to
be known as a full-service mass-market player _ on line. The
company, which now has 3 million customers on line, is holding 800
seminars a month through 2000 to educate ordinary mortals on
Internet investing. ``The idea is to make this thing that's a
mystery as easy as ordering a book from Amazon.com,'' said Charles
Schwab, the company's founder and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the world's biggest fund firm and a
leading discount broker, recently redesigned its Web trading site,
PowerStreet, to account for the fact that 80 percent of its
individual stock trades are now made on line. For funds, the figure
is 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even American Express has leaped on the bandwagon, offering free
trades to clients with accounts of at least $100,000. The service
is designed to appeal to stable, long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts by old-line players to debunk on-line
stock-picking's image as an extreme sport has caused Web-only
brokers to soften their images and court a broader audience.
ETrade, for example, now mimics Fidelity and Schwab by selling
mutual funds, still America's favorite investment. Datek, a hot
spot with rapid-fire investors, is considering opening
old-fashioned branches and forging alliances with investment
advisers. ``We don't consider ourselves a day-trading outfit,''
said a spokesman, Michael Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ameritrade is spending $200 million to promote
``Stuart,'' it has also mailed out brochures featuring a fireman
and a florist _ Main Street investors. ``As on-line investing
becomes more of a way of life, a lot of these companies want to
shed their day-trading image,'' said Keene.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Legg, the retired nurse, would trade stocks only with
someone at her side. Now she feels comfortable enough to execute
her own transactions, generally every couple of months. ``For $25 a
trade,'' she asked, ``how can you lose?''

 -EDGE30-COX &HT;    Your guide to buying a clock
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hickory, dickory, dock. Any mouse running up a clock today is
almost out of time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Get a head start on the new year by purchasing a clock and
always being on time. A clock not only tells the hours, minutes and
seconds but it also serves as a piece of furniture or a colorful
accessory for the home. It can chime melodiously, tick merrily,
insistently alarm us or rule our day in silent electronic
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the style is humorous or grand, clocks of all types
synchronize our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a clock takes a bit of time on your part. First, you must
decide what kind of clock you want. ``A clock is such a personal
item,'' says Coletta Vorise, the manager of the It's About Time
store in Gwinnett Place. ``Buy what you like; but remember, it
doesn't have to match the furniture in your house.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, consider the power source: battery quartz or mechanical,
which would be spring or weight-driven. For example, don't buy a
key-wound clock if you travel for weeks on end, since it requires
weekly or daily attention.
</P>
<P>
   How much do you want to pay? Clocks run from $10 to $10,000 and
up. Various factors, including materials and details, will
determine the price.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make certain you buy from a reputable shop, whose owner
and sales associates know their products. By doing this, you
ultimately will save time.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfather clocks
</P>
<P>
   What to look for
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cabinet: Size does not determine cost, although the cabinet of
the grandfather clock (also called a tall clock or hall clock) is
usually the most expensive part of the clock. American
manufacturers make the best cases, with a few made in Canada, Italy
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chimes: Standard rod chimes (the most familiar) come on the
majority of clocks. Tubular bell chime (like bells in a church)
will increase the price of clock by $1,000. All the movements in
today's clocks are German made.
</P>
<P>
   Details
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wood: If the cabinet is solid cherry, oak or mahogany, it will
be more expensive. A hardwood with a cherry or oak finish is less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finishes: Find out if the wood has been hand rubbed (more
expensive) or if the finish has been sprayed on. Also, determine if
the back of the clock has been finished. Those with finished backs
are more expensive. If the clock will be in a corner or against a
wall, some people feel, why waste money on something you don't see?
They opt for a nonfinished back.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Glass: Is the glass held in by wood (more expensive) or
rubber? Also the amount of beveled glass _ and its thickness _ ups
the price.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clock face: The quality of dials can vary the price of a clock
from $3 to $400. Engraved _ not painted or stamped _ numbers add to
a clock's price tag.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Price range: $699-$100,000. Popular range is $2,000-$3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Cuckoo clocks
</P>
<P>
   What to look for
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cabinet: What type of wood? How well is it finished? Most
cuckoo clocks are made in the Black Forest in Germany. A few are
made in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Music. Does it sound like a windup toy or is the music clear
and pleasing?
</P>
<P>
   Details
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Animation: If the figures are beautifully carved, with care
given to detail, the clock will be more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Movement: There are one-day and eight-day clocks. Those you
wind every 30 hours are less expensive than those wound once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Price range: $79-$35,000. Popular range is $79-$1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Mantel and wall clocks
</P>
<P>
   What to look for
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Basically look for same details as in a grandfather clock.
Mantel clocks have one of two movements _ the Westminster chime
only or the triple chime with three melodies, which adds about $100
to the cost of a clock. Some mantel clocks have battery-operated
movements, which are great if you don't want to wind a clock.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Price range: For mantel clocks, $150-$3,000; popular price:
$600. For wall clocks, $50-$6,000. Popular range: $150-$600.
</P>
<P>
   Animated clocks
</P>
<P>
   What to look for
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Animated or decorative clocks run the gamut from gold-tone
finishes to brightly painted woods to plastics. On some, doors open
and figures ``fly'' out. Dials and numbers can be humorous or
sleek-looking. These clocks can hang on a wall or sit on a shelf,
table or mantel. Usually these clocks are sophisticated or make you
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Details
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If an animated clock just plays on the hour it will be less
expensive than one with multiple functions, such as doors opening
and figures moving. A rule of thumb: The more a clock does, the
more it costs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for digital-quality sound in clocks. This will also raise
the price.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Price range: $10-$1,000. Popular range: $50-$500.

CHANGE OF NUMERICAL ADDRESS CAUSES THE INABILITY TO ACCESS SOME WEB
SITES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I've had several Web sites that I just can't
access. It's not like they're obscure sites that went away _ I
can't get to AOL's Web site, or Hotmail! When I type these into my
browser, or click on a link, the Internet Explorer icon just spins
and spins until it times out. I also have Netscape Communicator,
and the same thing happens in that browser. What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: To fix the problem, launch Notepad and do a File, then Open
command. Navigate in the dialog box to the windows folder, then
change the ``Files of type'' drop-down box so it reads ``All
files.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, search through the windows folder for a file called Hosts
and open it. There, you'll find the names of various Internet
sites, followed by a series of numbers. Look for the names of the
sites that are giving you problems and delete both the name and the
number. Then, save the file.
</P>
<P>
   You should now be able to get to the sites. Why does this simple
action fix such a frustrating problem?
</P>
<P>
   The names commonly used for Web sites are actually aliases for
numeric addresses on the Internet, called IP addresses. The IP
address for my Web site is 130.80.29.206, and you could either type
that or www.dwightsilverman.com into your browser to get there.
</P>
<P>
   When you enter a Web address by name in your browser, your
software checks a computer at your Internet provider for the
numeric equivalent _ like looking up a phone number in the phone
book. It then connects to the site using the IP address.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have a Hosts file in your windows folder, Windows
will check there before it checks the computer at your provider. If
it finds an IP address for the site you entered or clicked on, it
will not bother checking with your provider.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in your case was that some program a while back
inserted those lines into the Host file, with the idea that it
would speed up your access to the site. If you installed America
Online on your machine, the installation process likely added that
particular line. If you upgraded to a new version of Internet
Explorer, then that's probably how you got the Hotmail entry.
(Microsoft owns Hotmail.)
</P>
<P>
   But AOL and Hotmail later changed the IP addresses for their
servers. When they did that, the old address became invalid.
</P>
<P>
   When you tried to go to those sites, your browser found the
now-incorrect entry in the Hosts file and wound up accessing a
non-existent server.
</P>
<P>
   Although the problem was a bedeviling one, it has revealed
something useful. If you know the IP addresses for sites you visit
regularly, you can enter them into the Hosts file yourself with
Notepad.
</P>
<P>
   Just follow the layout in the file to add them in the right
structure. When you go to those sites, your browser will check that
file first and get to the site quicker.
</P>
<P>
   You can determine the IP addresses for your favorite sites by
opening up an MS-DOS box and typing ping followed by the site's
name, e.g. ping www.chron.com. You'll then see the IP address of
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been interested in setting up my own home page with my
own name as a domain. I've been looking at various companies that
will do this for me, but they want an awful lot of money. Can I
register this myself?
</P>
<P>
   A: You sure can, and it will save you some bucks. But you do
need to have an Internet provider who's willing to host your site.
And even if you don't intend to put it up right away, you'll need
to get certain technical information from your Internet provider in
order to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Go to www.networksolutions.com and enter your desired domain
name in the Register a Web Address form. The cost is $70 for the
first two years, $35 for each year thereafter. The process is
simple and painless, and you can put it on a credit card.

TO TRANSFER DATA FROM OLD TO NEW, YOU'LL NEED CONNECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just bought a new PC and need to transfer all
the stuff from my old hard drive to the new one. My old PC has
Windows 95 and the new one has Windows 98. When I got the old one,
I used a DOS program called InterLink to transfer files, using a
cable between the two computers. I don't remember how to do it and
can't find anyone who knows what I am talking about.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving day
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DAY: Don't let that bother you. I can never find anyone who
knows what I'm talking about either. In fact, sometimes even I
don't know what I'm saying. Here's one thing I do know, though: It
doesn't matter if Microsoft has a simple way of doing things,
because it'll shove it under the rug as soon one of its Poindexters
comes up with a way to do the same stunt in Windows, even if it's
three times as complicated.
</P>
<P>
   InterLink was a wonderful little DOS 6 utility allowing two
computers to share files. Then along came Win95's Direct Cable
Connection, and things really got gummed up. Now you had to make
sure all your networking properties were set just right and that
file sharing was turned on and take care of about a dozen other
nuisances. If you did manage to get it to work, the remote
computer's drives were only visible in the DCC window, not in
Explorer or other applications.
</P>
<P>
   If you've still got InterLink stashed somewhere, you'll probably
have better luck with it. First, connect the computers' parallel
ports with a cable you can get at almost any computer store, or
glom one from anybody who's bought a copy of pcAnywhere or LapLink.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure one of the computers (the client) has Interlnk.exe on
it; the other (the server) should have Intersvr.exe. On the client,
edit the Config.sys file to include the line
``Device\KInterlnk.exe,'' including a path if necessary. Reboot it.
Start the other machine in DOS, and type in ``Intersvr.'' That
should connect the two, and the server's drives should be visible
on the client.
</P>
<P>
   Once they're connected, you'll be able to copy all your data
files to the new machine by dragging and dropping in Explorer.
Don't try it with applications, though. Do fresh installations
instead. When you install a Windows program, support files get
slapped all over your hard drive. Simply copying a program's folder
to a new machine isn't going to copy them, and it's definitely not
going to update your system's Registry with all the info it needs
to make the program work the way it was intended.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will help in configuring a new PC or make fixing
the old one easier is a CD burner. If you use a lot of shareware,
save your registered installation packages on a CD-ROM along with
the latest hardware drivers, newest virus signatures and anything
else you want to find in a hurry _ besides a baseball bat _ when
you suddenly have to rebuild your PC.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I seriously need help breaking e-mail
passwords. I know what they write about me, and I want it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heightened Awareness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR AWARENESS: And what makes you think I'm not one of
``them''? Why don't you first try direct confrontation instead of
illegal subterfuge? Or better yet, why don't you e-mail all their
dirty little secrets to the world? But I'm not telling you how to
break into anybody's e-mail. Then you'd be able to see our secret
plans for world domination.
</P>

 &HT;    Shopping destination: North Georgia Premium Outlets
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAWSONVILLE, Ga. _ Now that the holiday frenzy is finally over,
serious shopping is about to begin for those who consider
themselves ultimate dealseekers.
</P>
<P>
   At North Georgia Premium Outlets, where savings of 5 percent to
50 percent are a given throughout the year, many retailers offer
clearance sales that begin the day after Christmas and continue at
least through January. Some sales will even go into February in
hopes that room will be made for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Springmaid Wamsutta will hold its white sale
through February, offering discounts of 20 percent to 25 percent
off all items. During the sale, the store will offer a special
promotion on down comforters. All sizes will sell for $69.99.
</P>
<P>
   Look for WestPoint Stevens, which also specializes in bed, bath
and linens, to offer its customers additional savings with a
traditional January white sale of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have never shopped at an outlet mall may not
understand what all the fuss is about. However, for Miranda Adams,
who lives in Vermont and is visiting family in Dawsonville, outlet
shopping is a passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, this is a really pretty outlet mall,'' she says. ``It's
a pleasure to walk around out here, because it's not so closed up
like an indoor mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to shopping at outlets, I like to dig around for
merchandise that's on sale above and beyond the regular low prices.
I also like the fact that I can find more selections of my favorite
brands in an outlet store than I can in a regular department store.
I guess a department store can't carry all of a specific brand, but
it almost seems as if the outlet comes close.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Rothstein, vice president of marketing for Chelsea, GCA
Realty, which owns 20 Premium Outlets across the country, says that
outlet malls need to work hard to please shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein points out that today's outlet stores carry a little
bit of everything, from seasonal merchandise and test items to
samples and some pieces made specifically for the outlets. But she
insists all the merchants in the mall provide high quality and
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``When customers make the effort to drive out here,'' she says,
``they expect a deal and high-quality merchandise. And they know
better than anybody if they're getting a good bargain or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein says surveys show that nine out of 10 shoppers say
that value and variety make outlet shopping worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants a deal,'' she adds. ``It's the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take Ga. 400 north and turn left at Dawson
Forest Road, then make a right turn into the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays; noon-6 p.m. Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Plenty of free parking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Located in the Food Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: All shops are accessible. Wheelchairs and
strollers available to rent at the information booth in the Food
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 706-216-3609.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dining: The Food Pavilion offers a spacious area that doesn't
have much in common with most traditional food courts. With its
high ceilings, faux clouds on the walls and well-spaced tables, it
looks more like a casual restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   You can select from burgers and grilled chicken sandwiches at
Buckhead Grill ($3.25-$4.95) or wander down to Main Street Deli for
wraps, Cajun chicken salad plates or a bowl of soup or chili
($2.99-$5.49). At Chung's you'll find several combo plates
($4.79-$5.29); and baked ziti and pizza awaits you at Sbarro
($1.99-$4.29).

 &HT;    Hard to find items, found
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But due to the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box
4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com (please
include your name, the city you live in and daytime phone number);
or call 404-582-7642.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My mother makes a congealed blueberry salad for our family
that calls for blackberry gelatin. Royal makes it, but we have been
unable to find it for the past few months. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Nancy Budd, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   And another gelatin query: I am trying to find blackberry
gelatin. A relative in Oklahoma makes a delicious blackberry wine
cake, and I would like to make it for my family. I've checked
several groceries but can't find it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jana Crews, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Wish that we could taste some of these delicious-sounding
salads and desserts made from Royal Gelatin Dessert! It is
difficult to find, but we tracked down a 2.75-ounce box of
blackberry (34 cents) at Cub Foods, 2201 Lawrenceville Highway,
Decatur (404-679-0700).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I are looking for the little plastic discs
that hold socks together so they don't get separated in the
washer/dryer. We never thought it would be so difficult to find
such a simple yet useful item!
</P>
<P>
   _ Carolyn Compton, Canton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Another sock question: Years ago, I purchased Sock Locks _ small
round plastic O-rings. To use, you slip your dirty socks into the
lock, which keep the socks together. But I can't find them. Please
help. I don't want to wear one black and one brown sock!
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Bruner, Douglasville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another query: I am trying to locate a product that holds
pairs of socks together, thus eliminating the need to match each
sock after washing and drying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Carbone, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You can now end one of the world's greatest laundry mysteries
_ missing socks _ with Sock Clips, which we tracked down in the
Home Trends catalog. Although these are not Sock Locks, they serve
the same purpose. Simply clip each pair together before putting in
the washer. Clips are color, bleach and dryer safe, too. A set of
32 clips in four different colors is $14.95. To order:
1-800-810-2340. Or visit the Web site at www.hometrendscatalog.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to buy Love's Rain, Jasmine and Lemon Scents. I
also think there's a Love's Baby Soft. But I can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robin Thomas, Clarkston, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another Love inquiry: Would you please find Frenzy by Love
Fragrances? I have had difficulty locating the company, Dana
Perfumes, which appears on the back of the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathy Sim, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Love conquers all. These delicate fragrances in pastel colors
were introduced in the '70s and remain quite popular. Although
difficult to find _ the company has been sold _ the scents are
available via mail through Classic Edition Fragrances in Lansing,
Ill. (1-888-254-5060). The 1.5-ounce body mist is $11; the
2.3-ounce body mist is $14. Other items available include
moisturizing gel and shower gel ($6 each).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I recently moved to the Lake Oconee area from
Maryland and would like to find Martin's Kettle Cook'd Potato
Chips. They are the absolute best chips ever made _ and I'm a
serious potato chip lover. Thanks for any help in satisfying a new
Southerner!
</P>
<P>
   _ Anne Ceccato, Greensboro, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This Pennsylania-based company's slogan is ``Munch with
Martin's.'' President Clinton is a fan, and they are the only chips
currently served aboard Air Force One. The chips are literally
sliced into the soy oil in a huge kettle, one batch at a time.
Kenneth Potter, president of Martin's, says his chips are not yet
sold in Atlanta, but he welcomes phone orders. Call 1-800-272-4477.
Three 1-pound bags are $6.89.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have searched all over Atlanta _ and even in South Dakota _to find a bottle of Cankaid Oral Antiseptic, which comes in a
little white bottle with red lettering. It's the best stuff I've
found for canker sores, but I'm nearing the end of my bottle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Karen Goeke, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We found your bottle, just as you described it, at Miller's
Rexall Drugs, 87 Broad St. (1-800-863-5654). The 3/4-ounce size is
$7.29. Mertz Pharmaceuticals says its product gives temporary
relief from minor mouth irritations such as canker sores, injured
or sore gums, and inflammation caused by dentures, braces or dental
procedures.

<P>
   An effete British auctioneer experiences culture clash when he
finds himself married to the mob, in this
sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant plays Michael, a courteous chap who's surprised when
his girlfriend, Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn), calls off their
relationship after he pops the question. The reason: Her family are
all members of the mob, and she's afraid Michael will get drawn
into their web.
</P>
<P>
   Gina's father, Frank (James Caan), warmly welcomes his
prospective son-in-law. But, sure enough, Michael soon finds
himself doing little ``favors'' for colleagues of the family. It's
around this point that the movie slips its moorings, accumulating a
body count and also a tone that wobbles between farce and thriller.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Analyze This'' took mafia cliches and gave them a '90s
update, the makers of ``Mickey'' don't seem to realize that their
jokes are tread-worn. So is Grant's one-trick performance as an
elegant bumbler. He's terrific at it, yes, but it's time to show
more range. He's been stuck too long playing the professional,
shrinking male virgin of the late '90s. (Tape priced for rental;
DVD $24.98.)

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dudley DoRight'' (PG) _ Just plain wrong-headed. It's based
on one of the weaker elements of Jay Ward's immensely creative TV
'toon series ``The Bullwinkle Show.'' This live-action takeoff of
the witless Canadian Mountie character has so much less to offer.
Brendan Fraser (``George of the Jungle'') plays Dudley, and it's
clear he'd rather not be here. There's not one joke, one slapstick
moment, one innuendo that's funny. (Tape priced for rental; DVD
$24.98.) Grade: F +
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Better Than Chocolate (unrated) _ A sunny but badly
scattered gay romantic comedy. The Canadian import follows the love
lives of a group of lesbians connected to a bookstore called Ten
Percent. Full of subplots, it's hard to actively dislike. But, like
a puppy, it's sloppy and hyper and badly in need of discipline.
Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Desert Blue'' (R) _ It's one of those movies in which the
lack of anything interesting happening is presented as a badge of
Gen-Y integrity and coolness. Written and directed by Morgan J.
Freeman (``Hurricane Streets''), the movie introduces us to Baxter,
Calif., a little hunk of nowhere driven primarily by teenage angst.
Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Universal Soldier: The Return'' (R) _ It's loud, it's brutal
and, unfortunately, not packed with enough fun. This is a return to
Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1992 ``Universal Soldier,'' in which dead
military guys are turned into chiseled, nearly unstoppable,
cyborglike warriors. This time he's got to battle wrestling's Bill
Goldberg and a monstrously buffed Michael Jai White. (Tape priced
for rental; DVD $24.95.) Grade: C

   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   This month, hip-hop has heard two sorely missed voices from the
grave. The late Notorious B.I.G.'s came by coupling old rhymes over
new tracks on an album full of featured guests. Meanwhile, the
latest release from the prolific Tupac Shakur and his capable
companions, the Outlawz, is a melodious offering with similar but
barely noticeable studio updates. The best thing about ``Still I
Rise,'' however, is probably the saddest: Much of what Shakur says
about the state of the inner city and the black community's
inability to acknowledge _ much less combat _ AIDS rings true
today. How strange it is that a rapper who didn't even see 1997
come in could offer an eerily appropriate summary of these times.

</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years after the astonishing family-like band was
shattered by the death of frontman Jerry Garcia, a certified panel
of experts, including the group's late archivist, Dick Latvala, has
fittingly chronicled the long and strange trip of the Grateful
Dead. The tracks _ tough to count because of the numerous jams and
segues _ include studio sessions, rehearsals and even sound checks.
From the 'Frisco folk start of ``Can't Come Down'' to the closing
``So Many Roads,'' this is a splendid history of a creative band
that provoked special feelings with its music. Equally well done is
the 60-page hardcover booklet. In addition to color photos, it
contains commentaries on the Dead by heavyweight cultural
observers, including Time magazine political correspondent Eric
Pooley. Box sets don't get any better than this.

   Three albums into what is still a relatively new rap career,
listeners could easily have DMX figured out by now. He barks, he
yells and he has a rumbling run and stop-real-fast delivery that
often disturbs. And if DMX's sound doesn't leave you cowering in
the nearest corner, what he often talks about _ robbing (``One More
Road to Cross''), killing (``The Professional'') and an inability
to refrain from the previous two _ surely should. Still, what keeps
DMX interesting is how he invigorates the same old stories with his
verve and varying vantage points on his beloved streets. Coming
from him, hip-hop's most troubled soul of late, even a simple
question like the single ``What's My Name?'' becomes a crowd mover.

 &HT;    R&AMP;B legend Pickett finds groove again
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilson Pickett? The 1960s hit maker (``Mustang Sally,'' ``In the
Midnight Hour'') hasn't been heard from in years. He was lost and
presumed irrelevant. Somewhere out on the oldies circuit, his
gritty testimonies echoed in a vacuum: soul-shouting in limbo.
Well, maybe. It's hard to imagine another scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Astoundingly, if you're a fan of the hit-it-and-get-it hard R&AMP;B
that Pickett epitomizes, the singer has rematerialized in robust,
old-school form. The title ``It's Harder Now'' might imply
struggle. More often than not, amid punchy Muscle Shoals-inspired
arrangements and chitlins circuit chooglin', Pickett's urgent
vocals sound remarkably vital.
</P>
<P>
   The mode makes no difference. Whether predatory (``Taxi Love,''
``Stomp,'' ``Bad People'') or plaintive (``It's Harder Now,'' ``It
Ain't Easy''), His Wickedness is in full throttle. Though an
occasional tune fails to register as more than novelty, the greasy
good-time vibe sustained by producer Jon Tiven more than
compensates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Harder Now''

 &HT;    `Sopranos' is hot as soundtrack, too
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as it cannily translates the vibrant, semicrazed
Italian-American milieu of Martin Scorsese's films to the
situational dynamic of the small screen, HBO's eventful gangster
series ``The Sopranos'' is also smart about its use of music.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which begins its second season Jan. 16, is exceedingly
pop wise. As in the best moments of Scorsese's dramas, songs
resonate like a Greek chorus, echoing and underscoring character
motivations and dislocations. And, as much of ``The Sopranos''
unfolds as internecine tragicomedy _ Hamlet goes ``ba-da-bing!'' _
there's an abundance of perfect jukebox moments.
</P>
<P>
   The show's inevitable soundtrack CD delivers as well. There's
stuff you can expect: New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen (the
mournful ``State Trooper'') and Steve Van Zandt (who also has a
role in the series) and the techno-ish theme instrumental by A3.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, a little Frank Sinatra, which no mob-related
entertainment could respectably do without. But the selection also
reveals a lot of thought. Bob Dylan's gospel-inspired ``Gotta Serve
Somebody'' acquires an extra layer of meaning in this context while
bluesman R.L. Burnside's devilish ``It's Bad, You Know'' simply
acknowledges what's nervously evident.
</P>
<P>
   The CD's mix of classic rock (Cream, Them) and hip pop wiseguys
(Nick Lowe, Elvis Costello, Los Lobos) tells a story of its own,
one that can be appreciated whether you've got cable or not.

THE APPLE OF HIS EYE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a dubious Christmas tradition _ the holiday letter, sent in
lieu of a Christmas card. Six laser-printed pages, telling you far
more than you ever wanted to know about the spouse, the kids, the
dog, the goldfish.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could be worse. It could be the holiday video, a
montage of soccer games and backyard barbecues, all sent to you on
a CD-ROM. If it comes to this, Apple Computer Inc. will bear much
of the blame. Its new iMac DV computers and iMovie video editing
software could do for home video what the original Macintosh did
for desktop publishing.
</P>
<P>
   All Apple wanted was to build on the success of the iMac line,
and to judge by the $1,499 iMac DV Special Edition, they've done a
splendid job of it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's gorgeous. Apple designers put away their
crayons and wrapped their elite iMac in gleaming gray plastic. Like
all the iMacs, it catches the eye, but this time the impression is
one of restrained, mature elegance, like a Porsche in a room full
of pony cars.
</P>
<P>
   And like a Porsche, there's real horsepower inside. You get a
400-megahertz PowerPC processor; better yet, Apple is finally
selling an iMac with more than enough memory _ 128 megabytes under
the hood.
</P>
<P>
   If you want still more memory, you needn't perform major surgery
to upgrade, as with the original iMac. The new design features a
plastic door in the bottom of the machine that you can unlock with
a coin. There you can install up to 512 megs of memory or add an
AirPort wireless networking card so you can transmit data to other
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has dispensed with the door that once concealed the iMac's
various data ports. Maybe the designers wanted to show off the new
goodies, like a badly needed reset button, so you can do emergency
reboots without unplugging the power cord. And there are two
FireWire ports, each allowing data transfers of up to 400 million
bits per second. Need a bigger hard drive? Buy an external FireWire
drive, and simply plug it in.
</P>
<P>
   The early iMac featured awful speakers, no doubt cadged from a
hidden stockpile of 1960s transistor radios. This time out, Apple
hired Harmon-Kardon to design speakers tailored especially for the
iMac. The result, while still not an audiophile's dream, is
surprisingly good. And it gets even better with an optional
Harmon-Kardon subwoofer that's so prettily done up in transparent
plastic that you'd hate to put it under the table, where a
subwoofer belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's gotten rid of the rather flimsy tray-loaded CD-ROM drive
of the first iMac, replacing it with a DVD drive that you load by
sliding the disk directly into a slot. To show off the DVD, the
iMac comes with a copy of A Bug's Life, the film produced by Apple
CEO Steve Jobs's other company, Pixar.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more fun to create your own movies, with a digital
video camera and Apple's iMovie editing software. With a Sony
digital camcorder, I headed off to church and to a local shopping
mall and began getting in touch with my inner Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rough-hewn epic, cleverly titled You Better Go
To Church! It's got toe-tapping music from a gospel choir, comic
relief by a band of giggling children, even a dose of lust as the
camera scans a lascivious display of chocolates at a local candy
store.
</P>
<P>
   I shot about 16 minutes of tape, then plugged the camera into
the iMac's FireWire port and dumped the images onto the hard drive.
This small amount of video ate up nearly four gigabytes of
hard-drive space; a serious filmmaker would need to buy external
storage to supplement the 13-gigabyte iMac drive.
</P>
<P>
   Then I put iMovie to work. This software lets you drag and drop
video segments as if they were paragraphs in a document. It creates
animated titles, as well as fancy video effects like the big boys
use _ fade-ins, dissolves, and the like. The software is
deliciously simple. I had to consult the onscreen help file only
once, and figured out the rest without glancing at a manual.
</P>
<P>
   Computer video editing isn't new, but the iMac DV with iMovie
sets a new standard of low cost and ease of use. Even the threat of
video Christmas cards can't sour me on this new iMac. It's Apple's
best product in years.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Edwin Arldt had known Doris Kappler for only a
few months. But he had his eye on a 1946 Plymouth. The car lot
wanted $500 down, and that, Edwin did not have.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for lack of working. He was a hard worker. After he
came home from the service, he used his GI benefits to go to an
auto mechanic school in Giddings, Texas. He would do that in the
mornings, then work at a John Deere dealership in the afternoon.
When he left work at 6 p.m., he'd go out to the family farm and
work there, sometimes until 2 in the morning. After a few hours'
sleep, he'd be back at school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, he landed a mechanic job at an Austin car dealership.
The pay wasn't great, and all he had for the down payment on the
Plymouth was $200. He asked Doris if she had the rest. Like him,
she was from a German family in Lee County. She was doing housework
in Austin. They'd met at a dance. She gave him the money.
</P>
<P>
   They were married Nov. 13, 1949. He was 22; she was 19. An usher
drove them to the wedding. Another sat in the front. Edwin and
Doris were in the back of that shining, black 1946 Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Special De Luxe with a flathead-6 engine producing all
of 95 horsepower. The dashboard and interior trim were two-tone
brown, the upholstery dark green with a diamonds-inside-circles
pattern. Three-speed gearshift on the column, oval pedals for the
brakes and clutch. A radio, a clock. He added an exterior sun
visor, giving it a rakish look. It cost $1,280 and the trade-in of
his '38 Ford. All in all, it was one spiffy ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both liked to drive it,'' Doris says. ``It was always kept
in good shape, and people said it was a nice-looking Plymouth.''
</P>
<P>
   No reason to get rid of a nice-looking Plymouth in good shape.
So they hung onto it.
</P>
<P>
   He got a job at another dealership and rose to be shop foreman.
In 1965, he went into business for himself, running an auto-repair
shop on Burnet Road, a block north of Anderson Lane. She worked in
the office.
</P>
<P>
   There were other cars along the way _ a '58 Plymouth, a '65
Karman Ghia, a '70 Cadillac, a '74 Ford and others. But they'd
still drive the 1946 Special De Luxe at least a couple of times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   As the years went on, people would say, ``You wouldn't be
interested in selling that, would you?'' They weren't, even after a
dealer told Edwin not to let go of it for less than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Arldts sold the business in 1984. They live in a beautiful
home, but they've both kept working because that's how they were
raised. He manages a liquor store part time; she works in a high
school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   In their garage is the Plymouth. It's got about 420,000 miles on
it. It gleams with the new paint job he gave it ``maybe 30 years
ago.'' The grillwork sparkles. Original upholstery, not a frayed
thread. Radio works. Clock runs. Engine purrs. He's had it up to 85
mph, and ``I think it would have pulled 90,'' Doris says.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, at a hall in Elgin, they celebrated their 50th
wedding anniversary. There were family and friends, turkey and
dressing, a polka band and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   And the couple of honor drove a shiny black 1946 Plymouth
Special De Luxe.

   WASHINGTON _ The common wisdom holds that there are no
modern-day heroes in public life.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians do not become statesmen until they die and are out
of competition. The longer they have been gone, the more fondly we
think of them.
</P>
<P>
   But without heroes, policy debates can be pretty dull. So in the
eternal search to find something interesting about the presidential
contest, the media are experimenting with comparisons between the
current four leading candidates and past elected superstars.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give the candidates some glamour they don't
generate by themselves. It's tough going. It requires imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Orrin Hatch got a hearty laugh
at a press dinner recently by joking, ``When you are sitting on
those debate stools looking at your fellow candidates, the same
thought keeps running through your mind _ Washington, Adams,
Jefferson, Madison _ how the hell did we come to THIS?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there was as much truth as humor in the crack.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen
demolished his 1988 Republican rival Dan Quayle for inappropriately
equating himself with John F. Kennedy, the candidates themselves
have modestly shied away from drawing unseemly parallels.
</P>
<P>
   But the media have never been shy about filling in gaps in the
political dialogue, and news is skimpy these days. We have to make
our own excitement.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine compared former Sen. Bill Bradley with Adlai
Stevenson, for reasons that escape me. Something about intellect
and wit, although if the Bradley mumble has ever reached the
cleverness of Stevenson's wry throw-away lines, most of us have
missed it.
</P>
<P>
   Others have compared Bradley with Robert F. Kennedy. The major
similarity seems to be that they are both liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else proposed a Bradley likeness to 1988 Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis, on the mistaken theory that Bradley
resists pragmatic politics just as the clueless Dukakis did. Try
telling that to embattled Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, the everlasting symbol of youth and glamour,
used to be everybody's first choice for historic twinhood until
President Clinton overdid it by matching the Kennedy reputation for
womanizing. For years, voters gagged on the repetitious pictures of
candidates pretending to be JFK, with ruffled hair striding along a
beach, a gaggle of children nearby, jacket slung carelessly over a
shirt-sleeved shoulder. Richard Nixon even tried it, although it
looked a bit staged when he strode along a watery beach, feet
squishing in leather dress shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays JFK is an outdated image, although there has been a
suggestion that some of Kennedy's early party days remind us of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's frivolous youthful years before he
found Jesus. They both led privileged lives as the sons of rich,
politically connected fathers. Neither is renowned as a heavy
thinker. But there the similarities end. They are decades apart
philosophically, Kennedy a product of the Cold War and Bush a baby
boomer of the Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   JFK has been replaced in the Republican pantheon by Theodore
Roosevelt, who won a reputation as a tough guy by charging up a
hill during the Spanish-American War and got carved into Mount
Rushmore for conserving our great parks. For current candidates
he's a non-controversial twofer, both a military hero and a
compassionate environmentalist. What he isn't, however, is a symbol
of the current Republican refrain of lower taxes and a reduced
federal government. For that, they should try Calvin Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   When we get to Arizona Sen. John McCain, it is difficult to
think of a political ghost who is his match. He is such a strong
personality, with such an individual story, that he stands alone.
Only former Sen. John Glenn, the first man to orbit the earth, is
in his category for courage and self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn, while undoubtedly brave, was never tested by physical
pain on the scale that McCain endured. Besides, Glenn ran for
president himself and lost. Great guy, but bad example.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Gore, who doesn't remind us much of anybody else
either. He isn't nearly as wooden as his image. So Coolidge won't
do. But Gore is not so firmly established as a battler for the
average American that he can be compared with Franklin Roosevelt
either.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's own hero is his father, a Tennessee senator who flirted
with the presidency himself in the 1950s and who was credited with
passage of the first national highway system. Not a bad choice, but
not quite at the level of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is hard to figure because he is a work in progress, still
emerging unevenly from President Clinton's shadow. All vice
presidents have something of an identity crisis until they win or
lose a national election in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   The political hero of our time most frequently cited as a role
model is Ronald Reagan. Mostly, Democrats don't do it because they
spent decades opposing Reagan's mean-spirited, conservative,
anti-government views.
</P>
<P>
   Weirdly, however, Bradley recently suggested that he's just like
Reagan in his sunny optimism and concentration on a few issues. But
a presidential contest is not a competition for best mood. It's a
battle of ideas and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans publicly adore Reagan. They ignore the Iran-contra
scandal, which might have led to his impeachment, and go directly
to the fact that his cheerful personality and political mantra of
shrinking government remain popular with conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who else do they have without reaching all the way back
to Dwight Eisenhower? Richard Nixon? Jerry Ford? Oh, dear.

WEB SITES BLOOM IN CHINA, AND ARE WEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On a recent evening, Zhang Aijing sat at her terminal
at the Internet division of People's Daily, watching comments drop
from cyberspace into the Communist Party newspaper's chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang is an ``editor'' assigned to ``anchor'' discussions,
and her responsibilities include weeding out comments overly
critical of the party. With a click of her mouse, ugly thoughts
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   She had just posted a notice on the site about a Western
reporter's visit and was watching intently to see what came in.
After all, unpredictable things happen here, where party propaganda
meets cyberspace and, as if to underscore that point, a screen
saver flashes smiling images of Diana, Princess of Wales, her
wedding and Prince William nearby.
</P>
<P>
   `'The U.S. is a killer _ we can't forget May 8,'' comes the
first reply, referring to the day last spring when NATO forces
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Most Chinese reject NATO's
explanation that the attack was an accident. More angry comments
tumb
</P>
<P>
   But soon another message hits the screen: ``I want her to know
that we Chinese people don't like our government.'' And another:
``The Communist Party doesn't let Chinese people read newspapers
from overseas.'' The comments stand.
</P>
<P>
   `'We try to let the people speak,'' said Jiang Yaping, who heads
the Internet division, with a shrug. ``We are the main newspaper of
the party, so of course there are limits. But it would take
something much stronger than these to be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ambivalent blessing of the government, locally produced
Web sites and chat rooms have spread rapidly here in the last two
years, giving China's estimated 7 million Internet users a forum
for public debate and discussion _ even a degree of dissent _ that
previously was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   On the local Internet, Chinese are exposed to information and
opinions that could never appear in the tightly controlled Chinese
media, on topics like the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in
Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and the mistreatment of people
with AIDS. Local governments are even using Web sites to poll
residents about policy issues, like bus fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is changing China,'' said Minxin Pei, a
researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington. ``Now we have people voting in cyberspace who cannot
vote in political space. That will certainly have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate balancing act for China's leaders and for the
commercial Web sites. They must preserve the sense of freewheeling
openness that makes the Internet so popular while maintaining the
control over information and dissent that the Communist government
requires.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, the Internet has been, at times, a useful
tool: after the embassy bombing in Belgrade, for example, chat
rooms gave Chinese an outlet for their anger. But it is clearly a
double-edged sword. The banned Falun Gong spiritual group, whose
leader is now based in New York, has frequently used e-mail and the
Internet in its campaign for legal recognition and to help mobilize
its followers, although its Web sites are now blocked.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Information Minister Wu Jichuan announced that
government ministries would monitor Internet sites, but he did not
elaborate on what form that monitoring would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow the introduction of trash that is harmful to
the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To experts, it is no surprise. ``I expect that the government
will be very deeply involved in regulating the Internet, for two
reasons,'' said Kenneth DeWoskin, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers who spoke at a recent conference on the
Internet at Beijing University. ``The Chinese government has always
had a strong interest in managing information. And also, the
government has a strong commercial interest in the Net; it's a
major owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But control over a multi-headed, constantly morphing creature
like the Internet is difficult to achieve, as Chinese censors have
already learned. Although the government now restricts access to a
number of foreign Web sites, many technically savvy Beijingers know
how to get around the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   To get to The New York Times on the Web or to sites related to
Falun Gong, for example, Chinese who know the proper codes can dial
a device called a proxy server, which effectively masks the
identity of the site being visited. Some government officials use
proxy servers to read the Times Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But domestic Web sites face a great deal more direct pressure,
from readers hungry for the broadcast of more information and from
a government that wants less.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com is one of China's most popular Web sites, featuring a
creative blend of features, sports and entertainment. It runs
celebrity chat rooms, where Internet surfers can ``meet'' people
like the film director Zhang Yimou. This fall it made waves by
displaying China's first online birth: surfers could follow the
prenatal development and birth of a real baby called Dian Dian.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Sina.com's special strength is news, and that
requires especially deft handling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike China's newspapers and magazines _ which are owned and
controlled by the government _ Sina.com is the product of a private
Chinese company, the Stone Group, which has offices in Beijing,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not under the media control of the Chinese
government,'' said Paul Jin, the executive deputy general manager
of Sina.com in Beijing. ``Still, we have to be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure that every article is suitable to the
Chinese government,'' Jin added, noting that the Sina.com's
mainland China Web site contained different offerings from its
Chinese-language web sites overseas. ``We make our own judgments.
News here has great value, but it also has risks.''
</P>
<P>
   When it started up just over a year ago, Sina.com included
dispatches from foreign news agencies, including Agence
France-Presse and Reuters. But after the government reiterated that
its own newspapers were not permitted to use text directly from
foreign news organizations, Sina.com dropped the practice as well.
Today, it writes some of its own dispatches but mostly buys copy
from the Chinese press.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many private Web sites in China avoid news that has not been
sanctioned by the government, especially political news, even
though urban Chinese are inveterate news junkies and there is great
market demand.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dow Jones Co. is a major shareholder in Sohu.com,
popular Chinese general-interest Web site, the site offers only Dow
Jones' business and financial news, not its broader news service.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the chat rooms that the dicey stuff appears. ``We
don't worry too much about news items,'' Jin said. ``It's the chat
rooms that make us really nervous. Especially around sensitive
days, like June 4, we have to screen very carefully, since you
never know what will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Sina.com and People's Daily, the goal is to review all
comments within minutes after they drop and remove those deemed
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Daily chat room got government permission to go
online on May 8, the the embassy bombing in Belgrade,
provoking an outpouring of popular anger. The chat room had already
been months in planning.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``thought that people had a lot to say at that
time,'' said Jiang, explaining the timing, ``although some people
criticized us for allowing this kind of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, leaders have becoming increasingly
supportive of the enterprise, since the chat room, which gets more
than 2,000 visitors a day, gives citizens a chance to vent their
anger and also for China's officials to stay in touch with popular
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But the heated chat room debates that occurred on many Chinese
Web sites in the month after the bombing showed that the Internet
could buttress, but also occasionally undercut, government policy.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, for example, most of the entries were attacks on
the United States, NATO and President Clinton, reflecting the
widespread view that the Chinese Embassy had been deliberately
chosen as a target.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the month, the anniversary of the June 4,
1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square was fast approaching. Along
with thousands of patriotic entries, a few more controversial
thoughts occasionally made their way online _ if only for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On the chat room Netease, which was devoted to the embassy
bombing, one person ventured: ``June 4 is coming. What do you
think?'' The events of June 1989, when tanks moved into central
Beijing, killing hundreds of civilians, are among China's ultimate
political taboos.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in a People's Daily chat room on AIDS run by an
expert from the Health Ministry, viewers got official statistics
(via the expert) as well as a embarrassing account (courtesy of a
Net surfer) of how a Chinese deputy health minister had been
heckled as he left the stage at a recent International AIDS meeting
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chinese take advantage of the relative anonymity provided by the
Internet to say things they might not utter in other public forums.
Although it is theoretically possible for a chat room to tell what
phone number a comment is coming from, many Chinese gain access to
the Internet through Internet cafes and it would be difficult to
connect a particular comment with a particular individual, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that the quick growth of the Internet will push
the Chinese media to be more open _ and that it has done so
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is very international, and with the Net you
really cannot construct obstacles to prevent people from knowing
things,'' said Ji People's Daily. ``So often it's better
that we inform people about something rather than have them learn
about it elsewhere. But we stand on behalf of the Chinese
government, and in some areas it better for us to keep quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, the Chinese government will
certainly continue to try to exert control over the beast that has
been unleashed. But monitoring every entry in every chat room will
become increasingly cumbersome as the number of Internet users in
China grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a problem for us,'' Jiang said. ``Right now, we don't
know just what we will do.''

   BEIJING _ Charles Zhang is a young man in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, the 35-year-old founder of one of China's hottest
Internet companies, Sohu.com, swept into his office here the other
day amid a flurry of ringing mobile phones and scampering aides. He
was late for another meeting, he explained quickly to a visitor.
Could the interview be put off for an hour? Better yet, could he
chat by cell phone on the way to the appointment?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Zhang found time to sit down in a conference room,
as his co-workers paced outside the glass door. ``When I started
this company two years ago,'' he said, ``we were working in
complete obscurity. Now it is so much like Silicon Valley. It
happened so suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   China's Internet industry has tantalized outsiders ever since
the country's Communist leaders made it clear that they welcomed
the digital revolution. But in the last six months, the novelty has
mutated into a kind of obsession. With the number of online users
tripling in 1999, to nearly 7 million, the Internet in China looks
like a here-and-now opportunity. Foreign technology companies,
venture capitalists and investment banks are all angling for pieces
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zhang happens to work in the capital of nominally
communist China, not far from Tiananmen Square, he might as well be
in San Francisco, Seattle or any other place where starting a
dot-com company seems like a ticket to instant riches. His life has
become a whirl of salesmanship as he seals joint ventures, drums up
money from investors and prepares his company to go public.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Chinese online companies make any money; as in
Silicon Valley, they wear their losses like a badge of honor. Nor
is China anywhere close to being a mass market. Its entire online
advertising business generated about $12 million in revenue this
year. A recent Gallup survey found that just 14 percent of China's
1.2 billion people had even heard of the Internet _ let alone used
it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, foreign investors are betting that China will soon have
one of the world's biggest Internet markets, perhaps second only to
the United States. As they have in other Chinese industries,
foreigners with stars in their eyes are rushing to finance a
handful of home-grown companies that they believe will be this
country's eBays and Yahoos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at potential Internet usage in China, the numbers
are absolutely staggering,'' said Gordon Chang, a partner who
advises Internet companies in the Shanghai office of the law firm
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison. ``Of course, it leads
people to do silly things.''
</P>
<P>
   China.com, a Hong Kong company that operates a little-visited
Web site on the mainland, set off the current stampede in July when
it raised $84 million in a stock offering on NASDAQ that valued the
start-up at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com, a Beijing-based company that operates the most popular
Chinese site, raised $65 million in September and hopes to sell
shares on NASDAQ in January.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's Sohu.com, best known for its search engine and
electronic directory, has raised more than $10 million from
investors like Intel, Dow Jones and Hang Lung, a Hong Kong property
developer. It, too, hopes to issue shares on NASDAQ in the first
half of 2000. Farther down the road is Netease, a Beijing company
that runs Web sites and online auctions of goods ranging from
computers to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, China's entire Internet industry has become an auction
of sorts. Executives like Zhang, Daniel Mao, the chief operating
officer of Sina.com, and William Ding, the founder of Netease, have
all listened to bankers from the Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and other firms tell them what lavish multiples
their companies will trade at after they issue stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``VC'' _ which once suggested Viet Cong in East Asia _ now
stands for venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about VCs, strategic-round financing, stock
options, market cap, management teams,'' said Zhang, a Beijing
native who spent nine years in the United States and has a Ph.D. in
physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``It's all
this American management jargon.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Relentless news coverage, which lionizes young technology
executives as fearless pioneers, has added to the expectations.
People like Zhang and Edward Zeng, the founder of Sparkice.com, are
celebrities in China. And they behave that way, according to their
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some overseas Chinese came back here with swelled heads,''
said Wang Yan, 27, general manager of Sina.com. Wang, who studied
law in France and returned in 1996, is not lacking in confidence
himself.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a rich payday is so palpable in the offices of
China's young Internet companies that some experts worry that money
may corrupt the industry. While these analysts acknowledge that
high salaries and rich stock options will attract bright young
people, they say that the founders of the companies are spending
too much time hustling for cash, and too little creating real
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot look at Silicon Valley and not be influenced by
it,'' said Duncan Clark, a partner at BDA China, an Internet
consulting firm in Beijing. ``The question is whether all this
money is going to spoil the industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The culture of Wall Street has already caused management strains
at Sohu. Several senior employees left last year after complaining
that Zhang had refused to share ownership. Zhang said it was too
early to grant stock options in 1998 because Chinese employees did
not grasp the concept. He said he began handing out options this
summer, and they are now very popular.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Sohu's offices shows that the gap between northern
California and northern China is not easily bridged. With its
young, sweatsuit-clad programmers hunched over PCs and Apple
Macintoshes, the company looks like any other start-up. But sitting
in the middle of the office is a time clock that employees must
punch daily.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a hint of jest, Sohu chief financial officer
Victor Koo said, ``We view ourselves as a Silicon Valley company
with Chinese characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have dealt with the growing financial demands by
recruiting American-trained Chinese, like Koo, to handle
fund-raising and investor relations. Koo, 33, has degrees from the
University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University, where
he was a classmate of Mao of Sina.com.
</P>
<P>
   Netease is typical in its evolution. Started in 1997 by Ding, a
soft-spoken engineer from Ningbo, near Shanghai, it sold e-mail
servers to Internet access providers. Later, the company developed
its own Web sites, specializing in e-mail and chat rooms. When it
began drawing interest from foreign investors, Ding thought that
his English was not good enough to handle presentations. So he
recruited two American-trained Chinese executives, Helen He and
Oliver Kwan.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who worked for an asset management firm in New York, said
he was attracted to a career in finance by the movie character
Gordon Gekko, the flamboyant, if ethics-free trader in Oliver
Stone's film ``Wall Street.'' But he said he was also impressed by
Americans' unlimited access to computers. When Ding approached him
about returning to China to join Netease, he traded in his
pinstriped suits for rumpled chinos.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Netease is making the transformation from a software
provider to a large-market Internet company. The company has
completed two rounds of financing, raising nearly $20 million. And
it is mentioned, along with Sina.com and Sohu.com, among the most
promising candidates for an initial public offering. But Kwan said
he was putting the brakes on expectations of a quick sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a CEO; we need a good management team,'' he said. ``If
you do an IPO before you're ready and you miss your revenue
projections for one quarter, the market will cut your stock price
in half in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   While the influx of foreign-trained Chinese has given these
companies a veneer of financial sophistication, some people contend
that it has shifted the focus away from creating services that
appeal to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never ask you about your new products,'' Ding said.
``They only ask you, `When is your IPO?'''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Sina.com seems likely to be the first mainland
Chinese company to issue shares _ as early as January. The company,
formed by the merger of an American Internet company that catered
to overseas Chinese and a Beijing concern, operates a popular Web
site here, with an estimated 5 million page views a day. Sina.com
has more than a million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com had hoped to offer its stock this fall, but delayed it
because of sudden uncertainty in the Chinese Internet market. In
September, China's top communications official unexpectedly
reaffirmed the long ban on foreign investment in
telecommunications. The announcement unnerved the foreign partners
in all these companies, and temporarily chilled the market.
</P>
<P>
   The trade agreement between the United States and China in
November eased those fears. Assuming it is approved by Congress, it
will by 2002 open the door to foreign ownership of up to 50 percent
of Internet content companies, and by 2006. up to 49 percent of
Internet service providers. But the Chinese official, Wu Jichuan,
has made it clear that Beijing can tie up foreign investors in
cumbersome licensing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the question of how much freedom the Beijing
government really plans to give the Internet. Sina.com and Sohu.com
both offer news on their sites and have partnerships with Western
media companies like Dow Jones and Reuters. But both these Chinese
companies, in response to government pressure, have dropped
nonfinancial foreign news. Beijing has also warned them not to
provide links to the Web sites of foreign news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For Zhang, staying out of trouble is a simple matter of knowing
the boundaries. ``It works if you are cooperative and don't
underestimate the government's intelligence,'' he said. ``If you
become too confrontational, the government feels like it's being
insulted and it will shut you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang insisted that officials in Beijing could not halt the
growth of the Internet in China, even if they wanted to. And he
said he did not feel hemmed in by political constraints.
``Besides,'' he said with a wave of his hand, ``the Internet is not
just about political issues; 99 percent of it is about people's
lives.''

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minutes after The Seattle Times disclosed on Dec. 17 that a man
with the makings of a fertilizer bomb in his car trunk had been
arrested in Port Angeles, Wash., news sites across the World Wide
Web were sprinting to deliver details. But no other site gave the
Port Angeles arrest a showcase to match MSNBC.com, the news Web
site that for the last year has consistently commanded the largest
audience.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of the Seattle space needle dominated the home page,
overlaid with the headline ``Y2K Plot?'' In slightly smaller type
were the words ``NBC News: Officials fear suspect was part of plan
to bomb Seattle.'' A report by NBC correspondents popped up with
links to the Web site of NBC's Seattle affiliate, KING-TV. Another
link took the reader to a video report by an NBC correspondent.
Another led to a map showing where, according to law-enforcement
authorities, the suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been
active.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC.com report was an archetype of a new journalistic form
and of the emerging values of general news sites as run by major
news organizations. These include speedy, professional crafting of
original material, multimedia options, clean packaging and lots of
self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   As they move from a cyberchildhood of experimentation and
starry-eyed possibilities into a sometimes awkward adolescence on
the Web, the nation's largest news organizations are getting more
sure-footed. And as the news site with the largest audience,
MSNBC.com, a partnership of General Electric's NBC and Microsoft,
is emerging as an exemplar of the new medium's new self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   The site is also in sync with those who believe that the verb
``to brand'' is not a neologism but an imperative; MSNBC.com puts
the logo of one of its parents, NBC, on everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile its other parent, Microsoft, puts links on its Web
sites to let some of the biggest audiences anywhere on the Web know
that MSNBC.com is the place to go for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSNBC is heavily branded,'' said Tim McGuire, who, as the
senior vice president for new media at The Minneapolis
Star-Tribune, is a professional connoisseur of online news
packaging and a student of what does and does not work in news
delivery on the Web. ``When we come out the other side of this tube
we're in, the big brands will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the site does not ride just on NBC's name or Microsoft's
muscle. ``One of the keys to this whole thing,'' McGuire said, is
``using the information that plays to the medium's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done some interesting things and are creating a new
medium,'' he said. Of course, as he and other newspaper journalists
say, broadcasters are more used to supplying continuous news
updates.
</P>
<P>
   Among MSNBC.com's innovations, according to its editor, Merrill
Brown, are things like short news clips on breaking developments,
taped in the site's offices in Secaucus, N.J., and a navigation
scheme that creates direct paths among scores of pages on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Like CNN Interactive's sites, which MSNBC.com dethroned as the
Web's most-visited news organization earlier this year, it is also
quick to provide supplemental interactive graphic material. A
recent example was an elegant montage that showed how genetic
researchers deconstructed the DNA on chromosome 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal from the beginning has been to package the
experience, instead of giving people endless lists of things _
which for many other news sites is the norm,'' said Brown, who has
been editor in chief of the site since its start in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But MSNBC.com does not live by content alone. The site's ties to
the behemoth sites of Microsoft, which funnel news-hungry audiences
its way, are the envy of its rivals. According to MSNBC.com's
statistics, about one-third of the site's traffic comes from the
pages of MSN.com, the Web site of Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   In October, according to Media Metrix, the Web-audience
measurement firm, MSNBC.com had more than 7 million ``unique''
visitors _ a measure of how many different computer users visited
the site, regardless of how many times each may have returned. The
October figure topped a previous high for news sites that MSNBC.com
reached in July, the month that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s sudden death
drew a record news audience on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The October figure outstripped its rival CNN.com by about 1
million unique visitors _ although Scott Woelfel, the general
manager of CNN Interactive, says that CNN.com's visitors typically
look at more pages a visit than MSNBC.com's audience does.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC.com, with a staff of about 185, has achieved its No. 1
rank chiefly by making deals with an array of partners. The list
includes The Washington Post and Newsweek, the crime reporting site
APBnews.com, the technology news provider ZDNet and a site
specializing in cancer news called oncology.com.
</P>
<P>
   For partners like The Washington Post, MSNBC.com has an enviable
heft. Chris Ma, the senior vice president of
Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive, said, ``We felt that we very
much needed a partner who lived in this world to help shepherd our
brand and our product into a multimedia realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers with national reach, like The New York Times and
Gannett's USA Today _ which has the biggest audience of any
newspaper, both in its print and online forms _ find their sites
evolving with ambitions similar to those of the successful
broadcast organizations' sites, like MSNBC.com, cnn.com and
abcnews.com. They want to provide quality information and video
across subjects tlude financial news and science and sports,
and they are trying to decide how best to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, both The New York Times and The
Washington Post have moved into the 24-hour news cycle,
establishing links with newsroom editors who channel dispatches to
the sites during the day. The Times on the Web also has updated
financial reports filed by a small financial news staff, operated
by Thestreet.com, a Web operation in which New York Times Co. has a
6.3 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Coll, the managing editor of The Washington Post, said in
a recent interview, ``We see the Web as another edition of the
newspaper.'' But, he added, ``it is incumbent on us to make sure
that as we add editions, we maintain a commitment to the same
quality of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Meislin, the editor in chief of the Times' unit Times
Co. Digital, said: ``Our gut instinct is going to t people
come to The New York Times for news that is the quality of The New
York Times newspaper and they would like to have that throughout
the day.''

PATENTS: REVOKING RIGHTS FOR YEAR 2000 SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies that are dreading possible year 2000 computer problems
may have one less thing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the U.S. patents commissioner took a first step
toward revoking a controversial patent, which some fear would
entitle its inventor to millions, perhaps billions, of dollars in
royalties on a technology that underlies many Y2K computer fixes.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for a patents commissioner to order the
re-examination of a patent, but such an action usually results in
the patent being revoked.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the patents commissioner, Todd Dickinson, was widely
praised. ``Commissioner Dickinson has made a courageous decision
here,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The patent under re-examination covers ``windowing,'' a popular
quick-fix technique that can help software to make an educated
guess about whether a two-digit date is meant to indicate the 20th
century or the 21st century. The approach may enable a computer to
avert the so-called millennium bug, in which computers that have
not been fixed may read the year ``00'' as 1900 or not recognize it
at all, resulting in potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor, Bruce Dickens, of Irvine, Calif., bought the
rights to patent 5,806,063 for $10,000 in April from his employer
McDonnell Douglas, now owned by Boeing. The patent had been granted
in 1998, but the company had never made wide use of Dickens'
technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Dickens is a malicious individual trying to pull
a fast one _ he probably thinks this is an original idea,'' Miller
said. ``But every indication is that windowing has been around for
years and maybe decades. We find the idea of patenting it
laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickens' newly formed company, Dickens2000, has sent out
hundreds of letters to large companies seeking first-year royalty
payments of $25,000 for every $1 billion in a company's annual
revenue. For companies that did not sign up until after Jan. 1, the
rate would go up 100-fold _ to $2.5 million for every $1 billion in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   William Cray, Dickens' attorney, said that his client had signed
up some licensees, which he declined to name. Dickens ``welcomes
the opportunity to have the Patent Office reconsider the patent,''
Cray said. ``He believes it's distinguishable from other prior art
and feels this will enable him to clarify his patent.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Aharonian, who publishes a patent news service on the
Internet and is a frequent critic of the Patent Office, said the
Dickens patent was just one of many software patents that are
dubious because they do not cite ``prior art'' _ inventions that
are similar in nature to the one claimed in a patent application.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the PTO has done an atrocious job searching out
the prior art for the dozens of Y2K patents that have issued,''
Aharonian wrote in one of his Internet Patent News dispatches last
week. ``Frankly, if it is going to re-examine the Dickens patent,
it might as well re-examine all the Y2K patents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Merges, a professor of law at the University of
California in Berkeley, was encouraged by what has happened in the
case of Dickens' Y2K patent. In recent years, he said, there has
been much debate about whether software should be patentable at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that software is, beyond all doubt, patentable, we need to
start weeding out the good inventions from the bad ones,'' Merges
said.
</P>
<P>
   And an efficient way to do that is through the Internet, he
said. Dickens' patent generated a good deal of discussion on the
Web, with several sites (among them, Miller's association at
www.itaa.org) posting numerous examples of pertinent prior art.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The far-flung contributors to this discussion have a great
deal of collective power,'' Merges said. ``By pulling together what
might have been isolated references _ a trade journal story here, a
technical paper there, an old software program sold on the market
years ago, even unpublished university or corporate research _ they
can assemble formidable collections of prior art.''
</P>
<P>
   This prior art, in turn, can be used to invalidate bad software
patents, and thereby prevent holders of dubious patents from
shaking down companies for undeserved royalties, Merges said.
</P>
<P>
   But what if this type of prior-art policing does not work and
technological innovation starts sinking in a quicksand of patent
litigation?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that some kind of
prescriptive legislation might be in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one of the most vexing issues facing
Congress this year and in the next few years,'' Schumer said. ``As
a country we value intellectual property rights. But the recent
expansion of what is patentable could have a detrimental effect on
the technological expansion of our economy.''

RocketChips blasts speeds to megabits 
By Kirk Ladendorf  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You've got to like the name: RocketChips Inc. is
way cool.
</P>
<P>
   But the name isn't why Moises Robinson wanted to work for the
tiny chip startup based in Minneapolis. He liked the vision and the
high-growth markets the company was attacking, along with the
chance to get in with a promising company before a public stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   So Robinson, a 31-year-old native of Panama and an engineering
graduate of Texas A&AMP;M University, left a job with Oak Technology in
Austin in 1998 to start the Austin office of RocketChips.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year and a half later, the Austin design office has
15 employees and is nearing completion of its first chip _ a
communications chip based on a high-speed connection technology,
called FireWire, that joins computers and other products such as
digital camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   RocketChips brags that it designs the hard stuff _
communications chips that employ mixed-signal designs, with both
digital and analog circuits on the same chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing some of the difficult things'' in communications
chip design, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Added company Chief Executive Ray Johnson, ``The drug of choice
today is bandwidth, and we are one of the pushers.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip was designed for Faraday Technology Corp. of Taiwan,
which wants to break into the emerging FireWire connectivity
market, but RocketChips can sell the chip _ or part of it _ to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held RocketChips guards its financial information
closely. It has raised $15 million in venture capital and it has
received licensing revenues from other electronics companies. Its
first three designs are still several months away from going into
volume production.
</P>
<P>
   FireWire looks like a good market to play in. The high-speed
connectivity technology was invented by Apple Computer Inc. and
became a public standard in 1995. Research firm Cahners In-Stat
Group predicts the market is about to explode, from shipments of
about 10 million units in 1999 to nearly 200 million units
(including computers, video camcorders and printers) in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The current version of FireWire is very quick _ it can move data
at speeds ranging from 100 megabits per second to 400 megabits per
second. And there is an even faster version of the technology is in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a high-bandwidth application, particularly if you
have audio and video content, then FireWire is a very elegant
solution,'' said Mark Kirstein, vice president of research at
Cahners In-Stat.
</P>
<P>
   FireWire is fast and it is also ``peer-to-peer.'' That means
that a digital video camcorder with a FireWire connection can
communicate directly with a printer with the same connection
without going through a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of startup companies are working on FireWire-related
chips, Kirstein said, but RocketChips is the only one that has
taken on the analog part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's next challenge is to double the size of the Austin
design center in the next year so the company can turn out more
designs. RocketChips also has design centers in Minneapolis and in
Ames, Iowa, where it has a close relationship with Iowa State
University. The design teams are connected by high-speed telephone
lines so engineers can ship complex computer files back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed-signal design capabilities are going to be crucial for
high-speed communications chips, Robinson said, so his company
already is attracting the interest of other chip companies that
want to partner with it new chip designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people rooting for us in the industry,''
Robinson said. ``I think we have something big going on here.''

Yahoo's magazine rings in '00 by picking best of Web 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given the approaching end of the year and century,
it's time for ``best of'' lists. Yahoo Internet Life features in
its January issue a ``Top of the Net'' list of the 100 best Web
sites for 2000. There are also several stories that look back on
the year online and forward to the coming year, as well as
examining the most popular sites now and for the future. You'll
find few surprises in what's been popular among sites. Topping the
list of Internet sites this past year was, for example, the one
promoting the film ``Star Wars: Episode I.''
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season brings the release of computer CD games
ranging from classic to modern. In the classic category is the
latest version of mah-jongg, published by Activision as ``Shanghai:
Second Dynasty.'' This version includes a vast assortment of
mah-jongg games. You can play against the clock or against
opponents. ``Second Dynasty'' is available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with modern tastes, Activision has also released the
latest version of ``Quake,'' called ``Quake III.'' This is a very
violent game, so parents and those who find this genre offensive
beware. What's new is the number of warriors players can choose
from and the graphics. Everything now, of course, is 3-D. ``Quake
III'' is available only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Now for something completely different. If you're sick of all
the celebrity hype, check out a site called Quirked. The site
features pictures of celebrities distorted through Kai's Power Goo.
You'll find, for example, Al Gore twisted into the Joker. Another
favorite is Leonardo DiCaprio converted into a Spock look-alike. Or
how about John Travolta with a head like Jabba the Hut? You get the
idea. You'll find Quirked at www.quirked.com.

Take care: Shareware might not be Y2K-ready 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's true that most Macs are Y2K-compliant, but some
may still experience problems with the coming of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with the Mac per se but with the software that
runs on it. Specifically, all that shareware you've been
downloading through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Much of this stuff has been discontinued or not
upgraded for months, if not years. It's this type of unsupported
software that could trip up many a Mac user.
</P>
<P>
   A suggestion: Clean out any shareware program, be it a solitaire
game or battle tanks, that you're not absolutely sure has been
upgraded for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   You can always download another version after the new year when
programmers will be re-releasing rewritten software.
</P>
<P>
   A bit extreme? Perhaps. But in this case it's better to be safe
than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is using files originally formatted in
PC applications. These files can't take advantage of Macs' built-in
Y2K savvy. No one knows exactly what these files might do to your
Mac, but it sure won't be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just PC files that could mess with your Mac's brain.
There are plenty of shareware and custom scripts written for big
programs such as Word, Excel and FileMaker that very well might not
be designed to handle 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If you depend on any such scripts or shareware, be sure to
double-check them to make sure they're Y2K-compliant.
Unfortunately, that's no easy task _ especially if you receive this
stuff from a friend of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The message here is not to panic but to be alert. Seek out
patches online for your favorite shareware and scripts. If you can
afford to, dump the stuff you can't upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Mac itself can process dates after the
beginning of the New Year. How far ahead they can read future dates
varies, though, depending on what operating system your Mac is
running.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is the software that comes inside your Mac,
controlling everything from the way the screen looks to how
software runs. The original Mac systems can read dates through Feb.
6, 2040. The newer systems can read dates through 29940.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has been trumpeting the Y2K compliance of its machines
since the Super Bowl, when it ran ads pointing out this fact.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also assembled online a formidable database
about what machines and components it has tested to date. You'll
find this site at www.apple.com
</P>
<P>
   /about/year2000.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Taking the Internet out of `the dark ages' 
By Heather Cocks  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Above Alan Tannenbaum's desk, overlooking his
high-tech gadgets and powerful computers, hangs an eerily prescient
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The illustration depicts a woman wearing her World Wide Web
browser. A portable computer connected to a headset projects a tiny
computer screen in front of her eye, letting her see and surf
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   As Tannenbaum talks, the picture seems increasingly like a nod
to his vision of the Internet's evolution. He predicts the Internet
will ascend to a technological level totally free of the clunky
computers and tangle of wires that bound _ and still bind _ this
waning decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the dark ages, we really are,'' said
Tannenbaum, senior technical staff member for IBM Corp.'s corporate
Ease-of-Use group in Austin. ``Wireless will be the key. We're
going to see computing shrink and disappear into other devices,
letting us get at the Internet through things we can't even imagine
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   His words echo the pie-in-the-sky idealism of early 1990s
Internet users, who rang in the decade enamored of the then-private
computer network and the vast, mysterious promise it held. Even so,
few expected the Internet to explode like it has.
</P>
<P>
   Global business-to-consumer sales over the Internet surged 179
percent this year, becoming a $31.2 billion industry on pace to top
$380 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   And with 160 million global users and climbing, the Internet has
blossomed from a private playground into a diverse hybrid medium _
part information hotbed, part economic model _ that analysts say
will become increasingly pervasive 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   They might not don cyborg-chic headgear like the woman gracing
Tannenbaum's wall, but many of the 500 million people expected to
connect to the Internet in 2003 will do so on devices less
conventional than today's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers are already trading traditional, fully-loaded
beige boxes for stylish designs that encase very basic,
Internet-centric machines. Austin-based Netpliance Inc. and Pacific
Bell took it a step further this year, unveiling small portable
machines just for e-mailing and limited online shopping. Prototypes
have appeared for Internet-ready refrigerators and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum, who in 25 years at IBM has literally witnessed the
Internet's development, predicts the fashion industry will shrink
Web connections even further. In New York City this past October,
InfoCharm Inc. staged a fashion show where statuesque models
strutted the catwalk wearing Web connections and keyboards sewn
into shirts, pants and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion will be a critical part of the success of Internet
devices,'' Tannenbaum said. ``Once people start wearing these tools
built into our belts and watches and shoes, then no one will want
to walk around with just the standard watch or shoe any more. The
computer industry will take that into account.'' Some claim content
will again reign supreme, at the expense of traditional media.
Other pundits espouse Tannenbaum's belief that wireless Web access
will define the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   At work, where a wall of framed patents and awards herald his
IBM career, Tannenbaum is already part of the way there.
</P>
<P>
   A small antenna turns his laptop into a wireless device, which
he totes through the hallways without severing his Internet
connection. A second laptop sits idly on his desk, its sole
function to forward important e-mails to Tannenbaum's pager when he
is away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   One spiral notebook and a thin stack of papers sit nearby, tidy
relics of an age when paper memos provided the most important link
between corporate departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary correspondence is a thing of the past,'' Tannenbaum
said. ``When we had big documents to print, everyone would worry
about how it looked on paper, but today paper itself is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Internet turns the paperless office into a
worldwide reality, most analysts agree that it will continue to
spur a total shift in the way people view computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very exciting energy,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst
withresearch company International Data Corp. ``The Internet has
become an honest-to-God mainstream thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world even from last year, and we realize
it's just at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   A GLOBAL KISS
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to my page! I kiss you!!'' proclaims the large black
text on the Web site of Mahir, a Turkish man whose goofy,
self-promoting page has became an Internet phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Mahir's site is representative of a familiar Internet
occurrence: Surfers stumbled on his Web site and e-mailed their
friends. Like wildfire, word of the site swept the globe, spawning
at least 15 parodies and enticing millions _ for no particular
reason other than curiosity _ to e-mail Mahir or check out photos
of him posing by his car, sunbathing, or engrossed in ping-pong.
His site now accepts advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a modern miracle,'' Parr said. ``We've entered this age
where people become Internet celebrities not based on anything but
that they did something mildly amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, arguably the most essential societal turning
point was the invention of the Web, an easy-to-use graphic
interface that triggered the Internet's explosion in 1995 and
propelled it into popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Mahir's sudden stardom also exemplifies the Internet's
extraordinary use as a forum for meeting and communicating with new
people. Today roughly 10 percent of Internet users have their own
home page, and 25 percent have at least one close friend they've
met online, Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, PC prices have plummeted, and customers can get
three-figure rebates _ sometimes free PCs _ in exchange for signing
long-term contracts with various Internet service providers. Still,
increasingly cognizant of the Internet's undying consumer appeal,
this year a host of computer companies began making machines geared
toward simplifying network access.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Dell released its Webpc, a stripped-down
computer optimized for Internet use. That and the similar iPaq from
Compaq Computer Corp., Dell's Houston-based rival, are the latest
entries in a market evolution sparked in 1998 by Apple Computer
Corp.'s plug-and-play iMac.
</P>
<P>
   To Parr, that underscores the degree to which the Internet's
popularity will shape the computer industry. While shopping for the
right machine for his mother, Parr realized hardware is a headache
for most people _ they just want simple devices that access the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying computers because they want to get onto the
Net, not because they actually want computers,'' said the analyst.
``My mother doesn't want a 'technology solution,' she just wants to
e-mail and play bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   E-COMMERCE PLAYS BIG ROLE
</P>
<P>
   If you did any holiday shopping online this year, you helped
spur the fastest growing sector of the Internet economy:
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the number of e-commerce companies has doubled
and their revenues swelled 127 percent, according to a study by the
Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season alone, e-commerce companies are expected to
take in between $6 billion and $15 billion in revenues _ a
phenomenal amount of money for a sector that barely registered two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum of IBM readily admits to feeding into the frenzy. An
avid collector of antique books _ his passion is Lewis Carroll _ he
traded piles of catalogs and snail-mail missives for online
auctions, chat rooms, libraries and e-mail networks. Through
browsing and buying online, Tannenbaum quickly built his collection
to 2,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is a marketplace,'' Tannenbaum said. ``I even have a
Mastercard that's just for Internet shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said he hopes the new decade quiets the e-commerce buzz,
molding the network back into a true information medium and less of
a shopping tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we stop talking about it, because there's so much more
to the Internet than that,'' Parr said. ``It's like when the
telephone comes along and all anyone can talk about is
telemarketing. Content should be king.''
</P>
<P>
   If that transformation happens, it will hinge on wireless
technology, according to both Tannenbaum and UT professor Andrew
Whinston, who heads the school's e-commerce research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phones with built-in Internet browsers are already
becoming a bridge between the wired world and the wearable Web,
delivering information with a portable immediacy desktop computers
currently lack. As constant connectivity becomes ubiquitous,
Whinston said he expects to see more books, newspapers and
magazines published entirely online, redefining traditional
perceptions of news and information.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a new idea _ pundits envisioned the death of
traditional media earlier in the decade when the Web rose to
prominence. But wireless adds a critical dimension to the debate
that Whinston claims changes it from theory into inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view will be, what happened six hours ago is history,''
Whinston said. ``If you want to know what's happening right this
minute, you want information delivered to a wireless device. If
companies can't respond to that need, they'll lose ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, spending too much time predicting the Internet's future
can be futile.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the online innovations achieved in the past five
years were largely unforeseen _ and unprecedented _ when the decade
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years out is too far to predict,'' Tannenbaum said. ``Five
years is too far. Every year we get more advanced, but more
possibilities crop up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, we'll probably look back and laugh.''

As millennium ends, people mark past and future by technology 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the year 999, the world waited for the New
Millennium with excitement and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists of the day _ astrologers, monks, witches and prophets
_ watched the skies for portents of disaster. The most jaded of
them wondered whether all the great discoveries were in the past.
</P>
<P>
   If it could be done, they reasoned, it had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was easy enough to tick off the truly important
technological discoveries _ and all were far in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenicians had made communications easier, developing a
22-letter alphabet so many years before that the exact date was
already blurred with time; wheeled vehicles for transport were in
use even before that; the idea of the number ``0'' had come out of
India in 876 B.C., making true mathematics possible; and the
Chinese were using a new way to communicate and store data: writing
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Life was already technologically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The first portable digital computer had been invented and in use
for centuries by 999.
</P>
<P>
   It was the abacus, a remarkable calculating device, easy to
carry and with no battery-life problems. The abacus represented
such a sturdy and useful technology that it was still being used in
parts of China in 1982 to take the census.
</P>
<P>
   Along with such wonders of technology, there were dangers, too.
</P>
<P>
   The fearful of 999 worried that man was tampering with the
forces of nature, imposing his ego on powers too complex to be
understood, too dangerous to be harnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were those fears without justification. After all, the
Chinese _ somewhere around 868 A.D. _ invented gunpowder, opening
the door to a technology that took an ordinary substance and seemed
to give it magical powers for destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Take a bit of sulfur, some charcoal and potassium nitrate, mix
well, and you have a grayish black powder that looks as harmless as
a handful of dirt but holds within it the power to move mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The thinkers and philosophers of the day wondered and fidgeted
and questioned whether man was smart enough to be trusted with such
substances.
</P>
<P>
   There was much to fear in 999 and seemingly little left to
invent.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this in the waning days of 1999, not much has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The miracle technologies of space travel, computers, atomic
energy, the telephone system and the Internet are firmly in the
past. Looking ahead, it seems that all that remains for
technologists is the mundane task of perfecting what already
exists.
</P>
<P>
   There are other similarities with 999. There are those among us
waiting for disaster with the eagerness of auto racing fans
watching for a wreck. Most immediately it is the Y2K computer
glitch that raises these fears. Books have been written and movies
have been made, painting a frightening picture of the devastation
some believe it will bring.
</P>
<P>
   But Y2K aside, there are more fundamental fears. Some wonder _
with credibility _ that man, in the name of science and technology,
has bred the seeds of his own destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your poison, the fearful say.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be atomic energy and one grand blast that closes the
door on civilization?
</P>
<P>
   Or will we all go with a sneeze and a feverish quiver because of
human tampering with viruses and genes?
</P>
<P>
   Those watching the skies for signs in the year 999 would have
understood those fears.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the reason for our Mr. Magoo vision of
technology _ foggy and shortsighted _ is frailty and ego. Each
person's life span is short, yet history is long. We view the world
as a moon that orbits around our own lives. The things that fall
within our orbit become bright and important, and those outside the
orbit are as dim as distant stars.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if you ask someone today about the great
technological innovations of history, you'll likely hear about
computers, or the Internet or even something as historically
mundane as computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries of the Pythagorean theorem and multiplication
tables are quite literally ancient history, while the 600-megahertz
microprocessor is a modern miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, when you think beyond a single lifetime and consider
technology, it helps to find some common ground, to define and
agree on some boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Little or nothing is ``invented'' ... instead it is discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, technology comes from the world and
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity was scorching through the skies in the days when a
burning torch was the latest in innovation. Atomic energy was hard
at work before man had the ability to utter his first words.
</P>
<P>
   It was all there. It was just a matter of finding it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the physical structure of a microprocessor _ the chip that
provides the real calculating engine for the computer _ is no more
than silicon (melt down some sand that has existed since the dawn
of time and there you have it) that has been treated with some
elements (boron, phosphorus or arsenic) that are bountiful in
nature. Adding these elements to the silicon _ called ``doping''
the chip _ alters its electrical properties in a useful way. But
the properties were not created by man. Instead, we learned that
they exist.
</P>
<P>
   It has all been there _ the laws of physics, the rules that
govern how electricity flows, the raw materials _ waiting for man
to get smart enough to find them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what technology you name _ from atomic power to the
seeming miracle of a light that shines based on an invisible force
traveling miles through copper wire _ it's simply man using a force
that was already there.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor is nature. Man is the discoverer.
</P>
<P>
   But if man is little more than a scavenger, searching the world
for bits and pieces that he can use, he has been a resourceful and
ingenious one.
</P>
<P>
   Each new-found technological discovery leads to the next, like
the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle that slowly form a beautiful
picture as they are put together. Signal flags and smoke signals
created the working knowledge of communicating in code, which
opened the door for the telegraph, which taught the lessons of
communicating over a network, which made it possible to build the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The most frightening part of technology may not be its potential
for destruction, but its potential for change.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we get used to the idea of horse-drawn carriages, the
automobile comes along _ and everything you once knew is suddenly
wrong. Once man grasped the idea of sailing ships, the steam engine
made them too slow for useful work.
</P>
<P>
   There's a practical loss _ skills and careers built on one
technology become useless almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Each new technology seems to kill off an old one, even
technologies that appeared too powerful and important to die.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the first truly digital method of
communicating ... the telegraph and Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   It was a network that erased time and distance. Messages that
took days and even weeks or months to deliver by messenger, train
and boat moved almost at the speed of light over the telegraph
lines. One of the marvels of technology was the laying of great
undersea cables that let messages move by telegraph from Europe to
America. Surely it would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Or so people thought.
</P>
<P>
   But wireless communications and the wired telephone turned the
telegram into a relic, an antique that now seems quaint and
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies force out the old.
</P>
<P>
   And not all the losses are practical. Some of the losses _
perhaps the most important losses _ are deeper and more
fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring of all man's traits has beentelling. In the earliest days, stories, poems and songs were
passed down orally from generation to generation. But as the
printed word became more important, man's memory faded. Few people
memorize stories anymore; family histories are passed down on
videotape and computer disk, not in stories by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, music stores sold sheet music and many families
spent the evening gathered around the piano, singing together.
While singing and storytelling haven't died, they've more and more
become the work of professionals and less a part of ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there are books, movies, CDs and television. It would
be difficult to argue that the new technologies are bad. It would
be equally impossible to say that what we lost had no value. We
don't sing as a family as much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Before you judge all this and decide whether you think it's good
or bad, keep in mind that technology doesn't care what you think.
</P>
<P>
   Since technology has such power over our lives, our jobs and
even over the future of the human race, it is tempting to give it a
human face _ to label some technologies as evil, others as good.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which technology you discuss _ the Internet, atomic
energy, missiles and satellites, commercial television or cellular
phones _ you'll have no trouble finding opposing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Technology doesn't have a soul. Your television set is no more
good or evil than atomic energy. Each technology has the potential
to be anything man assigns to it because technology is no more or
less than a tool.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who has used a hammer can tell you that a tool can be
used to do good or to bring pain and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm rule _ when it comes to predicting the future of
technology _ is that the experts are usually wrong. Just a few
decades ago, there were predictions that you'd commute to work in a
car with fold-down wings, that there would be a colony on the moon,
that almost all electricity would come from atomic and wind power.
</P>
<P>
   All these things are technologically possible, but proved
impractical, socially unacceptable or just plain not wanted by the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to look at the future of technology is to
study the past.
</P>
<P>
   So today, as you look at what other readers have to say about
the most important technologies of the recent past, you may find
common threads that show what the real experts, people like you _
those who use technology every day _ think.

News of the century, presented day-by-day 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As we stand here in the dawn of the millennium _ yes,
yes, I know it doesn't start until 2001, but let's go with the
flow, shall we? _ let us pause to look back at where we've been.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because we've been there, and we know, more or less, what
happened while we were there. Heaven knows where we're going; I
certainly don't, and if you do, no one will believe you anyway
unless you can say it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's the sort of thing one does at milepoe this.
</P>
<P>
   And, all foolery aside, history is something that seems to be
escaping us.
</P>
<P>
   Few things recently have appalled me more than the remark of a
young woman to her child at the 8th Air Force Museum in Savannah
while my wife and I were visiting it. Her awareness of what they
were seeing was evidently only dimly illuminated by the signs that
mentioned World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, see, honey,'' she cooed to the child, ``this is all about
World War Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   We have a CD-ROM from DK Interactive Learning called 20th
Century Day by Day to make things a little clearer.
</P>
<P>
   The disc does live up to its name _ there's something, however
paltry, for every day of the century, so you can go back and find
out what the big news was on any milestone in your personal
history. The day I was born is an excellent example of the fact
that some problems never go away _ there was unrest in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The disc may suffer somewhat from overproduction; there are a
bewildering number of ways to get into it. The user is initially
presented with a cheesy ``newsroom'' that actually more closely
resembles a one-man bookie joint. It is littered with stuff that
will turn the cursor into a pointing hand and take you somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other ways to jump in, however, and just
about any way can lead to fascinating information. Continuing
stories are threaded together so you can leap ahead to discover the
next development.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you come across Nov. 26, 1922, you will find
the stunning news of the discovery of King Tutankhamen's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   You can jump to the following day, when some of the discovered
treasures were described, to a brief mention on Jan. 4, 1923, of
the discovery of the king's sarcophagus within the fifth shrine,
thence to a cryptic Jan. 25 note that says ``examination of the
clothes on a mummy shows that Egyptian fashions have not changed in
2,642 years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, there were ``gasps of wonderment'' as the gold
sarcophagus was uncovered. A final brief more than a year later
reveals that examination of the mummy itself indicates the king was
no more than 15 years old whied.
</P>
<P>
   A word search reveals significant flaws in the disc's threading,
which failed to include other entries up through 1925, including
those in March and April 1925 about the illness and subsequent
death of Lord Carnarvon, sponsor of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is nit-picking, and is just another example that
if you are searching for something specific, hunt for it in every
way possible. Never assume that one line of inquiry has provided
all the information available.
</P>
<P>
   The disc has innumerable photos, 90 archival film clips and 70
video clips. For the celebrity conscious, which seems to include
most of today's younger people, there are 100 biographies.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo, cursing and violence, oh my! Yes, Acclaim's Shadow Man
(Playstation $40, Nintendo64 $55 and Dreamcast $50, www.acclaim.
com) has it all. In this game, you play a character who uses voodoo
to travel between our bright and shiny world and a netherworld
world chock-full of moaning souls. In both worlds, the idea is to
kill as many people as possible in order to stop the erection of an
evil tower. This game is absolutely spooky and can almost be deemed
an interactive psychological thriller. While the story borders on
the ridiculous and the dialogue is somewhat smarmy, it's pretty
compelling for a video game and even gave me the creeps a couple of
times.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's Donkey Kong 64 ($65, www.nintendo.com) is finally out
and is the perfect accoutrement to your N64. While this game does
require the expansion pack, it's worth it. The big ape is back and
he's brought all his friends on his most graphically rich adventure
to date. In DK64, you battle the formidable K. Rool (and his
Kremlings), who has ape-napped all the Kongs and the banana hoard.
How cruel! You must use the abilities of all five of the Kongs to
defeat your nemesis and win back those yellow, potassium-filled
delights. The play is fast, fun and will provide you plenty of
reasons to love your local primate. Hint: When offered, be sure to
buy the coconut shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a trivia game for the Dreamcast. Acclaim's Chef's Luv
Shack ($50, for the Dreamcast, www.acclaim.com) is based on
everyone's favorite culinary hero from ``South Park,'' Chef. The
game is as short on graphics as the television show, but who cares?
The Chef is there, as are Kenny, Eric and the rest of the gang, and
that's all that matters. In the vein of ``You Don't Know Jack!,''
you get answer questions like: Hebron, Nebraska boasts the world's
biggest what? A) Porch swing B) Rocking chair C) Weight loss clinic
or D) toilet seat (answer: B). You also get to play some pretty
hilarious mini-games for points, including: Bees at a Picnic (a
Space Invaders game played with pesticide and bees) and Eat This (a
pie-eating game).
</P>
<P>
   Get a stew pot. Throw in Demolition Racer, Destruction Derby II,
Twisted Metal and add a dash of Interstate 76, and you get a
wonderful concoction called Activision's Vigilante 8: Second
Offense ($50, www.activision. com). For all of you who remember the
first Vigilante 8: This one's better. For all of you who don't:
This is an auto combat game to end all auto combat games. You
choose from one of 18 cars and eight totally destructible arenas to
fight in. The ultimate goal is to blow up as much stuff and cars as
possible. The more you blow up, the more points you earn. And the
more points you earn, the more you can upgrade your cars. In the
end, this enables you build a jet propulsion car that will take you
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to like about Unreal: Tournament. ($50 for PC and
Mac, www.
</P>
<P>
   unrealtournament.com) The beautiful, mesmerizing backgrounds and
environments, the heftier, beefy weapons upgraded since the first
game, great multiplayer options and smooth online gameplay,
gorgeously rendered characters, innovative level design, a
fantastic low-gravity cityscape level that will make you feel like
you're in ``The Matrix.'' So what's not to like about Unreal:
Tournament? If you like first-person shooters, get this game now.
Asheron's Call, Microsoft's new massive multiplayer role-playing
game (for PC, $50 plus $10 monthly after a trial period, www.
turbinegames.com/asherons-call/), trumps the standard set by the
home team, Austin's Origin Systems, whose Ultima Online pioneered
the genre. Asheron's big breakthrough is with the alliance system,
which creates a pyramidal social structureencouraging old hands to
actively assist newbies. Swear allegiance and your new patron will
invariably hand you some fabulous sword or coat of armor _ put it
on and model it immediately _ or just cold cash. What a contrast to
the Hobbesian dog-eat-dog world that makes Ultima so intimidating
to newcomers. Asheron's Call, played first- or third-person,
innovates in other ways, with its portal system, a
made-from-scratch menagerie of monsters and a monthly worldwide
event that pushes the story forward. It's not all good: Drawbacks
include a frustrating array of problems logging on, billing snafus,
the usual lag issues and a world that looks a tad cheesy. The
bottom line is that Asheron's addictive quality and innovative
social system make it a must-play for role-playing fans. Hint: Get
yourself a mule. (www.turbinegames.com/asherons-call/)

DON'T BLAME HIM FOR Y2K: HE JUST COINED THE TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So now that the end of the wired world is nearly upon us, has
anyone wondered who put the Y and the K in Y2K? The evidence points
to Needham software consultant David Eddy, a jovial former
programmer who still speaks fluent computerese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty,'' Eddy admits cheerfully when queried about Y2K.
``Just send blank checks, and I'll fill in the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't go blaming Eddy if your lights go out and your furnace
goes cold on Jan. 1. He didn't invent the Y2K bug: He just coined
the term.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, in 1995 Eddy was a salesman hawking an early
software product designed to identify potential computer problems
when the date switches over to 2000. Back then, most folks were
still oblivious to this new thing called the World Wide Web, and
the year 2000 seemed eons away. As such, Eddy was a preacher
without a congregation, but he found plenty of compatriots in an
on-line discussion group for computer geeks hosted by the Web site,
www.year2000.com. The first use of the term in the discussion group
was in this June 12, 1995, message posted by Eddy: ``Business . . .
won't stop while we take 4 years out to fix Y2K issues,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K just slipped off my fingers, and over time, the term took
on,'' recalls Eddy, 52. The term first appeared in the Globe in
1996, when it was mentioned in one article; it turned up in four
Globe articles in 1997, 63 articles in 1998 and, as of last last
week, in 369 articles in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   No one has challenged Eddy's claim to the name _ at least not
yet. Peter de Jager, a Toronto consultant who runs year2000.com,
confirms that, to the best of his knowledge, Eddy was the first to
use the term. ``We were the only year 2000 discussion group at the
time, and it's highly unlikely that the term was coined anywhere
else,'' de Jager says.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Eddy recalls, computer gurus were throwing around
terms like CDC (century date change) and FADL (faulty date logic) _
hardly abbreviations that flow off the tip of your tongue. ``The Y
is for year, the 2 is for two, and the K is . . .'' Eddy says,
pausing. ``The K is really, really complex. In binary mathematics,
which is the world of computers, two to the 10th power is 1,024,
which is commonly referred to as K. So it's not exactly 1,000. But
if you try to explain that to a noncomputer expert, you get tied up
in your shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   The K also derives from ``kilo,'' Greek for ``thousand.'' ``We
all abbreviate,'' Eddy continues, cutting off the math lesson to
point out that he's been coming up with verbal shortcuts since he
wrote his college thesis about Russian critic Nikolay Gavrilovich
Chernyshevsky. (Well, wouldn't you?) For the record, Eddy majored
in history at Union College but ended up working as a programmer
because nobody was looking to employ experts in obscure Russian
radicals like NGC.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another story, which Eddy will be happy to tell you
if you have a few hours. For now, he's more concerned with the Y2K
bug. He never got a copyright on the term, although someone else
trademarked it to sell coffee mugs and apocalyptic souvenirs. ``It
never occurred to me to try and market it,'' Eddy says. ``The
merchandising of it is demeaning. The problem is too serious and is
going to cause too much damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddy, who lives with his wife and 8-year-old son in Needham,
isn't one of those doomsday types who plans to hole up in a bunker
with fresh water, nonperishable food, and Russian novels. The big
problems won't explode on New Year's Day, he predicts. ``The
weekend is going to be a big yawn,'' Eddy says. Instead, he says,
the bug will show up in insidious ways in the next few months,
creating a tangle of bureaucratic nightmares. ``It's going to be
like death by 10,000 paper cuts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy has spent the last five years proselytizing about the Y2K
bug, but when the clock turns over to 2000, he's going to be
exploring an earlier century with his wife and son at Old
Sturbridge Village, the living history park devoted to New England
life in the 1830s. ``My son is bored out of his squash with his
dad's Y2K talk,'' admits Eddy. But his son shouldn't expect the
talk to stop any time soon. ``We are going to hit the iceberg,''
Eddy predicts, maybe not next weekend, but some day in Y2K.
</P>

----- &QC;  Imagine if old Ebenezer Scrooge were alive today. Come
Christmas Eve, he'd order some gruel from homeruns.com, stoke up
the virtual fire on his monitor (www.wpix.com), and settle in for a
nap at his workstation. Then _ Ping! _ a message would appear on
his computer.
</P>
<P>
   To: Scrooge(at)humbug.com
</P>
<P>
   From: Marley(at)limbo.org
</P>
<P>
   ``Beware the chains you forge in life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bah,'' Scrooge would say. ``Humbug. Must be a hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbug, indeed. Even in this age of global communication, who
gets e-mail from the great beyond? Who dares deliver messages from
the grave?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is a guy in California _ where else? _ who is trying
to make it possible to send missives from the land of the dearly
departed. On finalthoughts.com, members can write messages to loved
ones that will be delivered as e-mail after the member passes away.
</P>
<P>
   This ghost of an idea is the brainchild of Todd Michael Krim, a
Los Angeles attorney who dreamed up the Web site while flying home
from London on a particularly bumpy ride. ``I thought, `My God,
this plane could go down,' and so many thoughts raced through my
head,'' he recalls. ``I realized that I hadn't made arrangements
for my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed safely, and Krim says his bad trip was ``a
wakeup call to live and embrace life'' _ and launch an Internet
startup. The site is part of a growing death industry on line,
which includes such sites as heavenlydoor.com, obitdetails.com, and
plan4ever.com (where folks can surf through memorials in ``virtual
gardens.'')
</P>
<P>
   Finalthoughts.com works like this. You store your messages on
the site and appoint a ``guardian angel'' who will mail the
missives after your untimely demise. Right now, the service is
free, but Krim may charge a fee next year.
</P>
<P>
   Krim is convinced that users will write lovely letters to
long-lost aunts and send cheerful regards to their pets. For some
reason, he doesn't expect anyone to fire off nasty things they have
been dying to say, so to speak. No notes from Mrs. Cratchit to Mr.
Scrooge, accusing him of being a ``squeezing, wrenching, grasping,
scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner.'' Krim thinks all the
mail will be angelic, as in ``God bless us, every one!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't create this to hurt anyone,'' he says. The site, he
adds, is a ``reaffirmation of life.'' So why not take a lead from
the reborn Scrooge and vow to live charitably and honor Christmas
in your heart every day? Who needs a Web site? ``Sometimes you have
to confront your own mortality to really start living,'' says Krim,
pointing out that he hopes to raise venture capital and build ``a
multimillion-dollar, profitable, socially conscious company.'' And
who says death doesn't pay?

EXPERTS DOUBT CYBERCRIMINALS WILL DISRUPT COMPUTERS THIS WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Though still maintaining a nervous vigilance,
computer security experts in the government and private sectors
were breathing a little easier Tuesday, as almost no evidence had
yet materialized that hackers or terrorists were plotting
widespread disruption of computer networks over the New Year's
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Since midsummer, concern has been raised, sometimes with a tone
of alarm, that cybercriminals and political terrorists would mark
the rollover to the new millennium by planting various kinds of
malicious software in networks and computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Very little evidence of such activity, however, has surfaced in
recent weeks, and Tuesday the Government's National Infrastructure
Protection Center said it expected no ``large-scale U.S.
infrastructure disruptions'' from Year 2000, or Y2K, computer
failures during the next few weeks. Moreover, because of greatly
heightened surveillance that is planned for computer networks
around the globe on New Year's Eve and the following days, many
experts say that now would actually bethe worst time to attempt an
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the federal agency also said it was preparing for
a possible increase in criminal activity, in part because of
heightened media attention to Y2K threats.
</P>
<P>
   The agency identified four viruses that it said were of
particular concern. The first three, known as Microsoft Word macro
viruses, use a programming language inside the word processing
program to spread through networks. The fourth, identified as PC
CIH, is an older program that can seriously damage infected
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday an administration official said that despite the fact
that no widespread attacks were expected there is still concern
about the potential for damage from malicious programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal element has latched on to cyber-intrusion as a
good avenue,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition that
he not be identified. ``Obviously, this is an issue of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team
Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University, said: ``Right
now we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary. For Jan. 1, the
biggest thing we anticipate is computer viruses that have targeted
that date to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Government official in charge of protecting the
nation's electronic infrastructure said he knew of no documented
cases in which malicious software had been implanted during efforts
to fix Year 2000 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, various experts had voiced concerns that in
the frenzy to make repairs to software, a few rogue programmers
hired as temporary workers might secretly build in ``back doors''
that could later be exploited by criminals to invade networks
without triggering computer security systems.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Gartner Group, a computer consulting and market
research firm, predicted at least one theft of $1 billion next year
directly resulting from this year's repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The threat alone can be costly. Even if would-be intruders fail
to exploit such a back door, an organization that suspects that its
software has been compromised must assign its best engineers to
systematically examine massive amounts of code for tiny,
hard-to-find alterations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruce Schneier, president of Counterpane Internet
Security Inc. in San Jose, Calif., said such back-door attacks have
been extremely rare, and last week Richard Clarke, the president's
national coordinator for computer infrastructure security and
counter-terrorism, said the government had not documented a single
such security breach.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Gartner Group's computer security experts conceded a
lack of evidence for secret back doors. ``I've heard lots of
stories,'' said William Spernow, the research director for
Gartner's information security strategies group. ``But when I have
asked for the code, I've gotten nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   One computer security firm that has assessed the added risk from
Y2K-related viruses and security attacks estimated this week that
the odds of a major ``virus event'' for the period were about 1 in
14, or 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, ICSA.Net, also placed odds of a single attacker
breaching 100 or more computer sites over the weekend at 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several antivirus software companies Tuesday said that while
they would not rule out the possibility of a widespread destructive
event over the weekend, they had not seen evidence of such viruses
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happened over Christmas, which may be a pretty good
indication that nothing major will happen on Jan. 1,'' said Vincent
Gullotto, director of Network Associates' Advert response team.

ALICE COOPER CREATES Y2K TIME CAPSULE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - ``New millennium'' madness will be history later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The champagne will have been swilled, the confetti thrown, and
the Y2K computer consultants will be counting their money in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be marching toward the next millennium _ Y3K.
</P>
<P>
   Since things have changed so much in 1,000 years _ imagine,
there once were no ATM machines, cell phones or ``Jerry Springer''
shows _ we've decided to create a Y2K time capsule for Dick Clark
and the rest of the world to open Jan. 1, 3000.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to help than Alice Cooper, the rock
star-restaurateur-sports nut who has a scary amount of pop-culture
trivia stored behind his mascara-laden eyes.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Cooper last week in his home town of Phoenix
and picked his brain on Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the suggestions by Cooper:
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: You've done it all onstage as this century ends _
electric chairs, snakes, hangings and beating up Santa Claus. Which
stage prop will you donate to the time capsule?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: ``The guillotine. You could watch it from six feet away,
and it still looked real. Probably the best stage trick we've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In addition to ``Eighteen,'' ``School's Out'' and ``Ballad of
Dwight Fry,'' which pop-rock songs are required?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I Want to Hold Your Hand,'' the Beatles: ``If aliens indeed
have been walking among us, it's probably the Beatles, Salvador
Dali and Groucho Marx.''
</P>
<P>
   Other picks: ``I Get Around,'' Beach Boys; ``My Generation,''
the Who; and ``anything by Chuck Berry, America's best lyricist.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: With Internet downloading of music booming, the album concept
may be gone by 3000. Which pop-rock albums must be preserved?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Sgt. Pepper,'' Beatles: ``It was the first time anyone
considered album making as an art form.'' Other picks: ``Pet
Sounds,'' Beach Boys; the debut albums by the Rolling Stones and
the Doors; ``Highway 61 Revisted,'' Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other music, from classical to country to Alvin
and the Chipmunks to TV themes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Burt Bacharach's ``Reach Out'' album: ``That includes all of
his hits. And he wrote more hits than anybody. For TV themes, I
would say `I Spy,' `Twilight Zone,' `Bonanza,' `Dick Van Dyke
Show,' `Leave It to Beaver.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other picks: ``West Side Story'' sound track; ``Henry Mancini's
Greatest Hits''; Bernard Herrmann's work (``Psycho,'' ``Twilight
Zone'').
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're an admitted TV addict. What classic shows need to be
remembered?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Consistently, for the funniest acting and writing, it would
be a real toss-up between ``Dick Van Dyke'' and ``Seinfeld.'' You'd
also have to throw in the entire Watergate trial and the entire
O.J. Simpson trial as two of the greatest dramatic comedies of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other picks: ``The Avengers,'' ``The Untouchables,'' ``The
Twilight Zone,'' ``Fawlty Towers,'' ``77 Sunset Strip,'' ``Outer
Limits,'' ``The Simpsons,'' ``The X-Files,'' ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Earthlings may be dining on Soylent Green in 3000. Any
cuisine for the time capsule?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jack in the Box tacos: ``I basically grew up on them in high
school and college.'' Other picks: White Castle hamburgers (``They
were as addictive as anything illegal''); A&AMP;W root beer (``has to
be in the frosted mug'').
</P>
<P>
   Q: Golf could have some new twists. Which top golfers, in
addition to you and your trusty Big Bertha, should we include?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnny Miller. ``With the dominance of Jack Nicklaus and
Arnold Palmer, here comes this kid with long hair ... and he won
seven times!''
</P>
<P>
   Other picks: Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan, Tiger Woods, Fuzzy Zoeller,
John Daly, Lee Trevino and Gary McCord. (The last two for ``having
fun with the game.'')
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about non-golf athletes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Al Kaline. ``When I was growing up, Al Kaline was my Michael
Jordan.'' Other picks: Charles Barkley, Barry Sanders, Randy
Johnson, Joe Montana, Walter Payton, Muhammad Ali, middleweight
boxers from mid-70s to mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about classic cars?
</P>
<P>
   A: Studebaker Avanti. ``It was the best car I ever had.'' And
``any 1932 Ford chopped with a great big chrome engine and a
blower. Hot rods!''
</P>
<P>
   Other picks: Mustang fastbacks from 1965 to 1970, '57 Cadillac
El Dorado; Acura NSX, '60s Stingrays, the Viper.
</P>
<P>
   A: Any odds and ends that we've forgotten for the time capsule?
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``A 1938 gold Bubbleback Rolex watch, the .32 caliber Walther
PPK _ the original James Bond gun, the Louisville Slugger, the
Great Big Bertha, a pair of the original Spanish boots that the
Beatles wore ... and probably the most important thing would be a
well-worn Bible.'' &QL;

   For months, at work and in bed at night, Bob Carr agonized over
the exodus of his insurance customers to Web sites that offered the
same products at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Carr had sold pension plans and 401(k) programs to businesses
for the Equitable Life Assurance Society since 1980, often making
more than $100,000 a year in commissions. But by last year, his
income had shrunk to an annual rate of about $60,000, mostly
because of competition from insurance-related Web sites like
Quotesmith.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came to the point where I couldn't sleep and I couldn't
envision myself getting up each morning and finding new clients,''
said Carr, 53, who lives in Westfield, N.J. So in November 1998, he
quit in disgust, even though he had no job lined up. For six
months, he searched for a sales position that would be ``immune''
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in May, he landed one, with Parker Interior Plantscape,
a company in Scotch Plains, N.J., that designs floral landscapes
for office buildings and hotels. Now, instead of debating the
benefits of whole-life versus term policies with customers, Carr
consults with companies on whether palm trees or ficus will thrive
better in their atriums.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he has no green thumb, Carr says he
also has no fears that customers will abandon him for the Internet.
``Nothing can happen that can cause me to lose sleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is not just car dealers and retail clerks who fear
for their jobs as the World Wide Web encroaches on their territory.
Increasingly, people in traditional corporate sales jobs like
insurance, hotels and newspapers and magazines are debating what
will become of them as online selling takes off. Many of them,
seeing what they view as the writing on the wall, are bailing out
before they have to.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many will have to. Sales of business-to-business
products through Internet-based corporate networks are expected to
increase from at least $95 billion this year to $500 billion in
2002, according to the GIGA Information Group in Cambridge, Mass.
That would eliminate the need for many of the calls that corporate
sales representatives make to purchasing managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lone-ranger salesman is getting rarer and rarer in the
business-to-business world,'' said Neil Rackham, a consultant who
wrote ``Rethinking the Sales Force'' (McGraw-Hill, 1999).
``Face-to-face selling is very expensive, and because of that the
Willy Loman becomes an expensive way to tell your customers about
your product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet poses a long-term threat to the entire sales
profession, one of the biggest parts of the American economy.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America's 14 million
sales representatives make up 12 percent of the work force. Robert
Davenport, a vice president with Hay Management Consultants in
Jersey City, says that percentage has held steady for nearly 15
years, but he and others predict that it will fall into the single
digits within five years, meaning that several million jobs, mostly
in retail, will disappear as consumers switch to buying online.
</P>
<P>
   So far, corporate sales representatives have weathered the
storm. But once big corporations get their online selling systems
up to speed, or once the economy inevitably turns sour, John
DeVincentis, a consultant based in Solebury, Pa., said, ``then we
will see some bloodletting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael Pusateri, who spent 10 years in sales for Marriott
hotels, working as a vice president for sales and overseeing the
company's e-commerce business, is also among those who have chosen
not to wait and see how the new economy might affect careers. In
April, he left Marriott to join Proxicom, a Web development company
in Reston, Va., as head of sales and marketing. He says he was
lured to the new industry more by its income potential than by any
immediate fears of losing his hotel job. Still, as he debated
making the change, he remembers asking himself, ``Do I stay in the
marathon and get the silver ring, or do I jump now and try to get
the brass ring?''
</P>
<P>
   He jumped, and it looks as if he got the gold ring. Since he
joined Proxicom, where he has stock options, its stock has shot up
from $13 to more than $90. ``If I lived my whole life at Marriott,
I never would have made that much money,'' said Pusateri, who is
40.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Powell took the leap from hotel sales to an Internet
company, too, but for different reasons. He had spent 26 years
working at hotel chains like Loews and Sheraton. But as more
companies were swallowed up in mergers, his sense of loyalty to his
employer was replaced by a dread of losing his job, and when
Sheraton, a division of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, asked him to
relocate from Atlanta in October, he took a buyout instead.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, he became vice president for global sales at
PlanSoft, an Internet company that provides hotel information for
companies planning corporate meetings. Since then, Powell, 49, has
persuaded several other experienced hotel sales representatives to
join him, including Susie Lichenstein, who spent 13 years with
Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be on this side of the fence than working in sales
for a hotel company,'' said Ms. Lichenstein, who is based in
Raleigh, N.C. ``Once this type of product takes off _ and it could
be five years or 15 _ you probably won't need all that manpower on
the other side of the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of uncertainty weighs heavily on some career
decisions. Carr had misgivings about leaving Equitable, which he
says treated him well, but he knew that the Web's impact on his
income would intensify. ``I'm middle-aged,'' he said, ``so the
question becomes: Do I do something now and be comfortable and earn
a good living, or do I try to hang on and get to 55 or 57 and it's
too late to start something new?''
</P>
<P>
   He has not soured on the Web, though. He is using his new
knowledge of plants to help design Parker's first Web site, and he
has done some shopping online, though he admits to a twinge of
guilt. ``Some other salesman is suffering,'' he said, ``because I
can make my choice on the Internet.''

CLINTON TO SEEK CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET PHARMACIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials said Monday that
they would ask Congress to regulate the growing sale of
prescription drugs over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said President Clinton would ask for
legislation requiring online pharmacies to get approval from the
Food and Drug Administration. In addition, they said, he will ask
Congress to beef up the agency's investigative powers and increase
the penalties for online sales of prescription drugs to people
without prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are also intended to make it easier for the
government to stop online sales of unapproved drugs, counterfeit
drugs and products promoted with fraudulent claims.
</P>
<P>
   There is no federal certification program for online pharmacies
and, operating in cyberspace, many of them do not get the state
licenses that are required of traditional drug stores. Policing
these stores and their sales of prescription drugs has been
difficult, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said
Clinton's proposal would create civil penalties of up to $500,000
for selling a prescription drug to a person who did not have a
valid prescription or for operating without federal certification.
Federal officials say they now have difficulty prosecuting online
pharmacies and fines are usually limited to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his budget request next month, White House officials
said, Clinton will seek $10 million to hire 100 people and upgrade
computer technology to investigate Web sites suspected of illegally
dispensing prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday night, Dr. Henney said the proposal
called for screening out disreputable online pharmacies and made
getting inappropriate drugs more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of the whole proposal is to to make sure there's a
strong safety net for patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, a medical officer at the FDA, said the
agency was already investigating more than 200 Web sites suspected
of selling unapproved drugs or selling approved medications without
valid prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the FDA would be given power to issue
administrative subpoenas compelling online pharmacies to provide
records for federal investigators. The administration said it would
protect patients' privacy, but did not give details.
</P>
<P>
   William Hubbard, a senior associate commissioner at the agency,
said: ``Online pharmacies come and go daily. Some are fly-by-night
operations. Some are located overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a document describing its plan to regulate online pharmacies,
the White House says sites will have to demonstrate that are
licensed by a state before they can be certified. The new federal
rules would, in effect, piggyback on state regulations on the
practice of medicine and pharmacy and would not replace them, the
document added. The White House document says that Internet
pharmacies now often ``bypass traditional safeguards against the
use of unsafe or inappropriate drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, an online pharmacy based in Florida sold
prescription drugs to consumers in New York, the pharmacy would
have to comply with licensing requirements in both states, federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to announce his proposals this week. A
White House official said: ``Internet pharmacies are not all bad.
Sometimes you can get access to quality prescription drugs at lower
prices in a more convenient way over the Internet. The president's
proposals are intended to target the bad apples who purvey fraud on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To order drugs from an online pharmacy, a customer uses a
computer to visit the company's Web site. Many sites offer
information about drugs and diseases. Reputable companies insist on
getting a prescription from the patient or the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by doctors at the University of Pennsylvania said
that it was alarmingly easy for consumers to get prescription drugs
without seeing a physician or a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   States have traditionally regulated the prescribing and
dispensing of drugs, the study said. But several states have found
it difficult to locate and prosecute online violators because the
prescriber, seller and buyer may be in different states.
</P>
<P>
   Several state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Web
site owners, alleging violations of state laws _ for example,
providing drugs without a local pharmacy license or mailing drugs
to minors. In some cases, drugs are sent from online pharmacies
overseas, so it is difficult for federal and state authorities to
take action against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania study found 86 Web sites that sold Viagra
without requiring a doctor's visit or a prescription. Twenty-two of
the sites appeared to be based outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew E. Naythons, vice president of one of the best-known
online pharmacies, PlanetRx.com, based in South San Francisco,
questioned the need for more regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are licensed to dispense drugs in all 50 states,'' he said.
``There are sufficient rules and regulations at the state level to
govern the practice of online pharmacy. Legitimate pharmacies
conform to those state regulations. To layer on another level of
regulation, at the federal level, would seem to be unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting his company with some of its competitors, Naythons
said: ``At PlanetRx, we dispense medication. We don't prescribe it.
We are like your neighborhood pharmacy, but we have 35 million to
40 million branch offices through desktop computers. We want to
speak to your physician in every case, to verify your prescription,
unless we get it through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, other companies are not always so scrupulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some online pharmacies _ rogue sites _ prescribe and
dispense,'' Naythons said. ``You can log on, complete a brief
questionnaire online and get Viagra or other drugs without seeing a
doctor in person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration established a Web site last
week to give consumers information about buying drugs and medical
products online. The address is www.fda.gov.

MERCK MANUAL ONCE RECOMMENDED TOBACCO FOR ASTHMA, CHAMPAGNE FOR
SEASICKNESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by MERCK MANUAL-TECHNOLOGY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 20th century began, infectious disease was the most
common cause of death in this country, and life expectancy was 46
to 48 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox was still killing tens of thousands worldwide, and
pneumonia, tuberculosis, gangrene and influenza were killing
millions more.
</P>
<P>
   The Merck Manual of Medical Information, first published in
1899, recommended tobacco for the treatment of bronchitis and
asthma; leeches for laryngitis; and iced champagne, nitroglycerin
and strychnine for seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We included 100 treatments for bronchitis, and none of them
worked,'' says Dr. Robert Berkow, editor in chief of the manual
since 1974. ``It's amazing how little was known 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkow says Merck editors had just produced the 100th
anniversary edition of the manual, the most widely used general
medical textbook in the world, when he started looking through
earlier editions and thinking about all the changes that have come
about.
</P>
<P>
   It seems everything we know in medicine we've learned in the
past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 19th century, the physical exam involved a
few not-too-personal patient history questions and ``the laying on
of hands.'' Physicians could take a patient's pulse, but most
couldn't measure blood pressure. It was thought that scurvy was due
to improper and insufficient diet, but no one knew about vitamins
or their effects on scurvy, beriberi or rickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, people pop vitamins like lollipops with the hope of
living longer, but vitamins really are miracle drugs. At the turn
of the century, a lot of people were dying of vitamin
deficiencies,'' Berkow says.
</P>
<P>
   When we think of the great advancements in medicine, we tend to
think of dramatic things like heart and liver transplants and
test-tube babies, but vaccinations have saved millions of people.
In this century, a simple vaccine wiped out smallpox, the worst
killer of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant change in medicine in the 20th century is
that infectious disease no longer is the most common cause of
death, and overall life expectancy has increased,'' says Berkow. He
and his associate editors recently voted ``control of infectious
disease'' as the top medical advance of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are living longer in large part because of the
development of antibiotics, improved public-health measures, better
sanitary conditions and a greater understanding of the immune
system,'' Berkow said in a telephone visit this month. ``As a
consequence, infections such as pneumonia, ancient scourges such as
tuberculosis and gangrene, and viral infections such as the 1918
flu epidemic no longer kill tens of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Before penicillin was available, 30 percent of people with
pneumonia died from infection; after wide use of the antibiotic
began, deaths from pneumonia dropped to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the century, a dozen women were dying in
childbirth each day, primarily from eclampsia and infection, Berkow
points out. Even in the 1930s, a woman had a 1-in-250 chance of not
surviving the birth of a child. In industrialized countries today,
thechance that a woman will die giving birth is less than 1 in
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Merck editors voted ``mass immunization campaigns'' as the
second most important medical advance of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Mass immunizations have been instrumental in controlling and
even eradicating viral diseases, including smallpox, polio and
whooping cough.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in this century have brought us vaccines against
polio, measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and
chickenpox as well as against hepatitis A and B, typhoid fever,
Lyme disease and some strains of influenza.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, compulsory vaccination and
revaccination against smallpox meant that the highly contagious,
often deadly virus was no longer a problem in Europe and North
America. Still, smallpox continued to kill millions of people in
Asia, Africa, Latin America and South America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, the World Health Organization launched a concerted
effort to eradicate the virus completely, and in May 1980, the WHO
declared smallpox a thing of the past. The last naturally occurring
case was recorded in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immunizations are so distinctly different in their capacity to
save lives, they will probably remain the greatest advance in
medicine ever,'' Berkow says.
</P>
<P>
   The Merck Manual, published by Merck &AMP; Co. pharmaceuticals as a
nonprofit service to the scientific community, began producing a
home edition for consumers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the 20th century, health care was a one-way
street, where physicians dispensed medical information to their
patients, and patients followed their directions without
question,'' Berkow says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, individuals are likely to visit their physicians with a
list of questions and reams of medical information collected in the
library, from the news media, through health care associations or
patient advocacy groups or over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Merck Manual was outselling any text for doctors 8-to-1,
but overall, 20 percent of the books were being bought by the
public. People really want more sophisticated information,'' Berkow
says.

FROM X-RAYS TO PACEMAKERS, TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE BIG STRIDES

<P>
   Most of the lifesaving diagnostic tools and life-sustaining
inventions in medicine have been developed in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top advances of the past 100 years, as singled out by
the editors of the Merck Manual of Medical Information, are:
</P>
<P>
   _ X-rays, mammography, CAT scans, MRI and PET scans. These
technologies, all related by their ability to see inside the body,
are used to help diagnose everything from broken bones and
pneumonia to blocked arteries, fetal abnormalities, acute renal
failure and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kidney dialysis. Introduced in 1943, dialysis was first used
to purge wastes and toxins from the blood of people experiencing
short-term loss of kidney function. Dialysis for chronic renal
failure started in the 1960s. Its benefits were so profound that
Medicare coverage was expanded to ensure that everyone who needs
long-term dialysis will have access to it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cardiac pacemakers. Invented in 1958, the pacemaker is a means
of countering heart block, a condition in which the body's
electrical signals that should trigger the heart to beat are
delayed or completely blocked. Over the years, the implantable
pacemaker has been improved through the addition of long-life
batteries. The size and weight have been reduced also. Today,
pacemakers are the world's smallest programmable computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Respirators. In 1904, sts first conceived of ways to
maintain artificial ventilation during surgery. The Drinker
respirator, better known as the iron lung, was developed in 1927.
As large as a subcompact car, the old iron lung helped patients
breathe through a pushing motion on the chest and was widely used
during the polio epidemic in the '30s and '40s. Today, positive
pressure ventilators are standard therapy for respiratory failure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Intravenous feeding. As it became possible to sustain severely
ill patients on life-support equipment, the importance of
delivering adequate nutrition to such patients became apparent. In
the 1930s, when researchers began to experiment with intravenous
nutrition, they were still just beginning to learn which
nutritional substances are required and in what proportion. Today,
solutions of synthetic amino acids, lipid mixtures and various
vitamins and minerals are available in pre-mixed preparations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Artificial hearts. Surgeon Alexis Carrel, working with famed
aviator Charles Lindbergh, designed an artificial heart in 1936,
but the first permanent mechanical heart was not implanted until
1982, in Barney Clark. Clark lived 112 days with the cumbersome
mechanical device pumping blood for his failed heart. Today, a
promising option is the left ventricular assist device, which is
implanted inside an individual's chest or abdomen to help a
weakened heart pump sufficient blood throughout the body, primarily
while the patient is waiting for a heart transplant.

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of ``X-Files''
composer Mark Snow.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nestled behind a suspiciously charming house in Santa Monica,
Calif., Mulder and Scully's silent partner is hard at work.
 &HT;    And no, we're not talking about X, Deep Throat, Jeffrey Spender
or even the Cigarette-Smoking Man.
 &HT;    Walk across the front lawn, through a side gate and past the
pool, and you'll enter a hospitable little building, a.k.a. ``Snow
Tunes.'' And from a dark room, lit only by the shafts of light cast
off by a football game on television, emerges a bearded man in blue
jeans, a black T-shirt and an ``X-Files'' baseball cap.
 &HT;    His name is Mark Snow, and he's the man who scores and performs
all the music heard on ``The X-Files.'' His other credits include
the now-defunct ``Millennium'' and ``Harsh Realm,'' as well as such
films and television movies as ``Crazy in Alabama,'' ``Disturbing
Behavior,'' ``Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' and, of
course, ``The X-Files: Fight the Future.''
 &HT;    ``This is where it all happens,'' Snow says, settling into a
chair and waving to indicate his beloved Synclavier, the
synthesizer he uses to create all those eerie sounds. ``On average
there's about 30 minutes of music per episode _ though, as time has
gone on, we've done as much as 40 minutes for a 44-minute episode.
 &HT;    ``If I have to really deliver and jam on something, 10 minutes a
day is doable,'' he adds. ``That's kind of pushing it, though. Five
days is comfortable to do 30 to 33 minutes. Three days is a little
irritating, but it can be done.''
 &HT;    The process begins when Snow receives a script, which he reads
to get a feeling for what's to come. Upon receiving the unsweetened
final cut of an actual episode, he determines how best to color it
musically.
 &HT;    Then, after a music editor provides him with the show's
``spotting'' _ where the music should stop and start, and its
length _ Snow creates the music, generally a blend of moody strings
and synthesizer, as well as vocal sounds and sound effects.
 &HT;    ``I like to start with a real meaty cue that's possibly in Act
Four or toward the end, and they can run for five to 10 minutes,''
he says. ``That's pretty amazing. These `X-Files' music cues, for
whatever reason, have developed into long pieces.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``A friend of mine is a music editor on `Roswell,''' he says,
``and the composer said, `Well, I think we need a Mark Snow here.'
He said, `What do you mean by that?' And the composer said, `Oh,
you know, a 10-minute cue.'
 &HT;    ``It had nothing to do with musical style, but with length.''
 &HT;    Series creator Chris Carter, like most of the show's directors,
tends to give Snow free rein. Such license allows Snow to feel
``uninhibited,'' and likely has played a key role in his earning
four Emmy Award nominations for his ``X-Files'' efforts alone.
 &HT;    To date, the composer points to ``Post-Modern Prometheus'' and
``The Ghosts Who Stole Christmas'' as his personal favorite
``X-Files'' scores. He also enjoyed stepping out from behind his
home console to lead an 85-piece orchestra through the score of the
``X-Files'' feature during several sessions at a recording studio.
 &HT;    With ``The X-Files'' in its seventh and apparently final season,
Snow is hoping to be able to concentrate on film scores. Still,
he's grateful for everything that ``The X-Files'' has done for him
and, for that matter, for television and film composers in general.
 &HT;    ``I think that most of the time people take music for granted,''
Snow says. ``I've had an unusual experience with `The X-Files.'
 &HT;    ``The Internet was coming into its own when the show started,''
he explains. ``I've gotten a lot of fan mail over the Internet, and
I've also visited the chat rooms, and all of that has let me know
that what I'm doing is really appreciated.
 &HT;    ``There are also film-score magazines and film-score critics,''
he adds. ``Some of the magazines are pretentious and some of them
are terrific, and some guy will love something I do, while some
other guy will knock me.''
 &HT;    Snow tugs on his ``X-Files'' cap.
 &HT;    ``Really, that's OK,'' he says. ``It all just tells me that more
people are paying more attention to music than ever before. And
that's what's important.''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can almost taste the color,'' Ellen Sideri said, as she
pondered the new generation of fruit-colored translucent products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sideri is the president of Ellen Sideri Partnership, a trend
forecasting company in New York. ``The movement into the 2000s is
toward what I call sensual aesthetics, where not just shape but
sound and taste are important,'' she pronounced in millennial
tones. ``Even smell _ think of the whole aromatherapy thing _ is
important.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From watches to telephones, beepers to computers, waves of new
products have arrived that look good enough to eat. It's as if some
high-concept artist had set out to fabricate a whole line of common
objects out of hard candy.
</P>
<P>
   That the lollipop look has become the dominant aesthetic of new
technology may signal the arrival, as taste makers, of a generation
that is less interested in shapes than in sensations, in objects
than in experiences. It's no accident that the translucent look is
most in evidence in places like Target's teen-oriented display of
telephones, answering machines and CD players in translucent fruit
colors dubbed ``hip hues.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the R Zone electronics boutique at Toys ``R'' Us,
buyers find Sony boom boxes in translucent citrus and cranberry, as
well as Bell South's Jelly Bean line of phones and phone
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people are bored with black,'' Ms. Sideri declared.
``They are embracing these colors because it separates them from
older generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The look is less hip than it is pop soda pop. The colors are all
named for fruits, but their hues are less like fruit than
fruit-flavored drinks _ Nehi orange and NuGrape purple. The new
Palm IIIe, the lower-priced Palm Pilot for teen-agers, comes in a
case the green of a Coca-Cola bottle; Handspring's new PDA, the
Visor, is offered in muted tones like tropical Life Saver flavors _
or Snapple ones.
</P>
<P>
   The look is biggest in computer equipment, of course, from
E-machine's shameless copy of the iMac to a new Microsoft mouse,
the Intellimouse Explorer, whose clearish shell reveals a red-brown
tone not unlike Cognac _ or is it iced tea? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What was striking about the iMac was not that it invented a look
but that Apple's designers, led by Jonathan Ive, had the courage to
apply the lollipop look to a whole computer, a serious and
expensive device, and that they did it with such elegance. The iMac
and its new laptop version, the iBook, have set makers of printers,
scanners and disk drives scrambling to match its various and edible
palette. Hewlett-Packard provides candy-colored printer covers,
while Kodak's digital cameras come in five fruit colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yum yum!'' proclaims a catalog advertisement for a line of
add-on disk drives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first electronics to go translucent were pagers, which
Motorola turned into fashion items, like oversize bonbons, for
young people several years ago. Then, video game players like
Nintendo's Gameboy began to appear in purplish translucent cases,
then phones and answering machines from Swatch. Now, even Radio
Shack offers phones with candy cases through which one can dimly
view the soldered lumps on the device's circuit board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Translucence changes the whole personality of equipment from
serious and technical to playfully accessible. The iMac had origins
in Apple's longtime practice of producing a few of every new model
in clear cases for internal use. But translucent goes beyond
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, clear plastic cases were used by second-tier brands
of cameras or radios to show that they were just as complex inside
as the more expensive models _ and by implication performed just as
well. Now, said Yves Behar of Void, a design company in San
Francisco, ``technology is pretty much commoditized, and very
little is proprietary, so revealing what makes products work is not
a problem.'' He added, ``And products look more honest when one can
see what is behind the plastic covers.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Kanarick, the chief scientist at Razorfish, a Web design
firm, sees the translucent colors as an attempt to demystify
technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days of tubes and wires and mechanical insides, we
wanted to hide how things worked, to see them as magical,'' he
said. ``Now, we have the opposite: we are afraid of the magic and
want to get closer to what is going on. Even though we don't see
anything happening when we see a circuit board, it lets us know
that there is something going on behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The glimpse behind the scenes is part of the theater of
translucence. It provides a kind of expansion of the little window
in the CD player that gives you a teasing glimpse of the spinning
disk within. (Earlier products had their mundane works made
theatrical in similar ways, as in the window that the designer
Richard Teague famously added to the doors of 1950s clothes driers,
dramatizing a mundane appliance.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sony turned the little window into a wholly transparent Walkman
a full decade ago. Richard Gioscia, the director of Sony's design
center in Park Ridge, N.J., more recently devised Sony's
translucent line of Freq radios and tape and CD players. ``Part of
the idea,'' Gioscia said, ``is to show that the inside is as well
designed as the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like looking under the hood of a car,'' he said. But, he
added, translucence also adds implied value to plastic, implicitly
lending it some of the qualities of glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For older people, translucence can romanticize the inner
workings, even make a fetish of the technical complexity. But
younger buyers take that complexity for granted. ``We're willing to
look at the guts of the products,'' Behar said. ``Geek is chic
these days, and it's about time that we look at the innards of
products and say `cool.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karim Rashid, who is building on the translucent plastic
products he designed for Umbra with electronics for Sony due out
next year, is fascinated by translucence. In Japan recently, he
came across an inch-and-a half-thick magazine devoted entirely to
translucent products.
</P>
<P>
   Other inspirations may lie closer at hand. Airport security
scanners, for instance, supply bright but false colors to the
objects inside suitcases, mixing oranges and blues in ways that
look like plastics. X-ray-like images have become a staple, if not
a cliche, of advertising. Tinged with an air of voyeurism, these
range from ads for Tanner Krolle handbags to the current Gap spots
that show a backpack turned translucent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But already a more mature translucence is emerging, leaving
behind the kiddie colors. Apple's G-4 computers are translucent
``graphite'' with clear accents; a toaster prototype, on display at
Philips' recent Home of the Near Future show at Saks Fifth Avenue,
was transparent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So is the lollipop look that of the future or only of the
future-obsessed present? Won't translucent fruit hues be recorded
by the caricaturing eye of history as the colors of the 1990s, just
as Day-Glo and tie-dye are now inextricably tied in memory to the
'60s? But what could be more exemplary of our fin de siecle? It is,
after all, an era that looks at technology with happy, childish
optimism, that looks at high tech not only through rose-colored
glasses, but also through a choice of strawberry-, blueberry- or
tangerine-colored ones.

   HOUSTON _ Frank Lloyd Wright once said, ``A house is not going
anywhere, if we can help it.'' On the cusp of the year 2000, it is
hard to imagine what would shock him more: that houses are going
into orbit, or that architects are helping design them. Certainly,
Wright would be wary of the required synthetic materials and the
enormous artistic restraint placed on designers.
</P>
<P>
   But for the small and growing cadre of architects bravely
designing for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
such conditions present interesting, and new, challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem we are trying to solve has a predetermined
answer,'' said Garrett Finney, one of four architects at NASA's new
Habitability Design Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, Finney was building clapboard houses in
the Adirondacks. Today, he is one of a 20-member Tiger Team
designing a personal orbital pied-a-terre, a soft-walled closet the
size of a Sub-Zero refrigerator that will cost several million
dollars. It is, however, a very important closet: two years from
now, if the Node 2 Deployable Crew Quarters flies on the
International Space Station, it will be the first private home for
U.S. space crews in nearly three decades. Success here could mean
that space architects might be worth keeping around.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, on a recent morning, Finney and his colleagues
were desperately seeking feedback. In a test run, two astronauts
were being timed as they set up their prospective home in a NASA
warehouse full of dummy spaceships.
</P>
<P>
   The crew quarters are essentially a collapsible box made of
fire-resistant honeycombed fiberboard. Each individual unit
attaches to the inside wall of the space station. The cubby has to
be narrow, because interiors will be crowded with equipment,
supplies and experiments. It must be collapsible, which makes it
less expensive to launch. What's more, even the most petite
astronaut must be able to rip it down within a minute to fix a hole
if the hull is hit by a micrometeor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous,'' Finney said. ``I hope they like it.'' He
watched as the astronauts installed the small aluminum work desk
that he had designed. Next, they hung the sleeping restraint, a
limp cloth bag, from a D-ring.
</P>
<P>
   The completed phone booth-slash-dorm room did not resemble
anything out of ``Star Trek'' or ``2001.'' Unlike Jane Fonda's lair
in ``Barbarella,'' it wasn't lined in tawny fur. It contained no
French modernist chaises, no minibar and no Woody Allen-inspired
orgasmatron. Yet, the astronauts regarded it with longing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a palace compared to where we usually are,'' said
Dr. Kalpana Chawla, an astronaut who flew on the space shuttle for
two weeks in 1997. In addition to the desk there was a shelf, a
phone jack for private calls and e-mail, a streamlined solid-state
reading light and an adjustable ventilation unit. There were plenty
of bungees and patches of Velcro to store small items and
personalize the decor with family photos and flags. While the
spaces were tight, the astronauts knew they would seem larger once
they were in weightless orbit, when they could sleep against a wall
and attach books to the ``ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, Skylab offered NASA astronauts bunks but
little privacy. Since then, on the space shuttle they have either
slid into something resembling a morgue locker or hung their
sleeping bags like hammocks in the corridor. But facing the
prospect of longer missions and even interplanetary travel, NASA is
beginning to recognize the value of what it calls ``human
factors,'' like comfort and privacy. Astronauts will spend up to
six months on the space station that is expected to be completed
around 2006. A trip to Mars, which could occur in the next 20
years, might take two to three years. ``I'd go in a heartbeat,''
said Chawla, 37, an aerospace engineer from Karnal, India.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Jones spent 18 days in orbit in 1996 with four people in
a cabin the size of two minivans. ``An adequate amount of personal
space is going to be essential for having a happy, productive crew
on a long space mission,'' he said, after assembling the pod with
Chawla. ``Humans are very tolerant of discomfort for short periods.
But on longer trips, you need a refuge where you can hole up if
your moods change.''
</P>
<P>
   Human stress on Skylab and on Mir, the Russian space station,
contributed to problems between crew members and mission control.
On Skylab in 1973, the frazzled crew staged the first labor
showdown in space, refusing to work on a Sunday. To recover from
the noise and drone of their mechanistic pod during their 84-day
mission, they spent a restorative day off looking out the window.
</P>
<P>
   On Mir, design-related problems contributed to flaring tempers.
``There were a lot of brown colors and not enough lights,'' said
Dr. Andy Thomas, a NASA astronaut from Australia who lived there
with two Russians for almost five months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can really get to you after a while,'' he said. ``I spent
as much time as I could looking out the window at Earth and
listening to the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   The American experience on Mir has taught NASA to value better
design. ``We've learned that if you put bright, active people in a
socially and sensory tedious environment, they're going to get the
blahs or worse,'' said Dr. Al Holland, NASA's chief of psychology.
He noted that small stresses are cumulative and will eventually
affect productivity.
</P>
<P>
   So NASA is trying to improve the habitability of its spaceships
by hiring civilian architects like Finney and civilian astronauts
who are ``nice and easy-going,'' Holland said. ``It may not be as
much fun to live with a `Right Stuff' kind of fighter pilot as with
a normal person,'' he added, ``and we want people who are easy to
live with.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``normal'' people will want ``normal'' environments. They
will want fresh and frozen foods, not high-tech powders. Goodbye,
Tang; hello, merlot. Also hello, blow-dryers, microwave ovens and
weekends off.
</P>
<P>
   Should the new recruits want to have sex, they would have room
enough, since the crew quarters can fit two in a pinch. But NASA
will not acknowledge this possibility. (``We're not ready for that
yet,'' Holland said.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, happiness is now on mission control's
checklist. Dr. Jack Stuster, a NASA consultant and an expert on
human behavior in confined and remote environments, said, ``NASA is
considering human factors in a way that was unthinkable five years
ago _ a major sea change has occurred.''

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's not exactly a news flash that, here in the great state of
New York, Hillary Clinton is running for the Senate _ but I take
great pleasure in breaking the story that New York City's Mayor
Rudy Giuliani will not be her opponent.
 &HT;    At least I don't think he will, to judge by the letter I just
got from him.
 &HT;    Right after Thanksgiving, Rudy wrote to tell me that he was
seriously considering running for the Senate seat being vacated by
the retiring Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
 &HT;    ``The reason I have sent this letter to you is because I must
know immediately if I have your support,'' he wrote. ``Before I
make my decision, I wanted to contact you, to ask if you will stand
with me in my campaign for the Senate.''
 &HT;    He went on to tell me that it was critical for him to know in
the next 30 days if he had my support, so I rushed off my reply _
saying that I thought he should finish out his term as mayor.
 &HT;    I guess our letters crossed, because a week later I got another
letter from him, telling me that he was making a special effort to
raise $375,000 in the next 30 days, and he was counting on my help
to do it.
 &HT;    Again, not wanting to mislead the mayor, I wrote back and said,
``Sorry, I'm supporting Hillary.''
 &HT;    But to no avail: A week later I got an invitation to a reception
for the mayor, thanking me for the support I have provided him over
the years. His invitation was followed by a Christmas card from the
co-chairs of the Republican National Committee.
 &HT;    Now, if there's anyone who understands how tough it is to raise
money for a political campaign and how critical that money can be,
it's me. I was not very successful at it, which is one of the
reasons I'm writing this column instead of serving in the Senate.
 &HT;    And, though I'm not nuts about being on every fund-raising list
there is, I frequently make contributions to people and causes I
believe in.
 &HT;    I kind of resent it, though, when I get solicited by people who
don't have a prayer of prying a dime out of me. I give only to
politicians who support my views, and I give only as long as they
do so.
 &HT;    The fact that I'm hearing so often from Rudy Giuliani, who
definitely falls in the don't-have-a-prayer category, is a good
illustration of what's wrong with our whole system of campaign
financing.
 &HT;    In his recent debate with Bill Bradley, Al Gore got it
half-right: Corruption in campaign financing doesn't come from the
way money is spent, it comes from the way it's raised.
 &HT;    But the way it's raised is tied to the way it's spent _ and,
most particularly, to television advertising, the single most
expensive thing it's spent on.
 &HT;    The only way to limit the corruptive influence of special
interests, I believe, is to ban third-party political advertising
for a period of time directly preceding an election.
 &HT;    Already I can hear my longtime friends at the American Civil
Liberties Union and elsewhere shouting, ``You're trampling on the
First Amendment!''
 &HT;    Me? Never _ I'm one of its biggest supporters. But I've also
spent enough years in politics to know four undeniable facts about
campaigns:
 &HT;    + 1. They are very expensive.
 &HT;    + 2. There are only two ways to finance them _ spend your own
money, if you have it, or get it from others, if you don't.
 &HT;    + 3. It's impossible to get it from others without at least the
appearance of indebtedness to your big donors.
 &HT;    + 4. What makes it so expensive in the first place is the
astronomical cost of television advertising.
 &HT;    Now, the First Amendment won't let us prohibit candidates or
even third-party special interests from buying television time. But
that doesn't mean we can't prohibit the networks from selling it.
We already prohibit them from selling time to cigarette companies,
for example, for the public good.
 &HT;    For that matter, broadcasters _ who are licensed by the
government and get free access to public-owned airwaves for all
their programming _ should be required to give some of that airtime
back to the American public for candidates' presentations. But
that's a subject for another column.
 &HT;    To start with, though, a ban on third-party ad sales during the
final stages of a general campaign would go a long way toward
leveling the playing field. Essentially it would mean that, when it
came to crunch time, each candidate would be limited to the federal
spending ceilings, giving each the same amount of money to deliver
his or her message.
 &HT;    In turn, this would allow them to stop spending their days and
nights hustling money and let them use that time to put themselves
and their ideas before the public they hope to serve.
 &HT;    As a bonus, it would significantly reduce the political
pollution of the airwaves that precedes each election.
 &HT;    And, last but not least, it would spare me any more letters from
Rudy Giuliani!

HOUSTON : has occurred.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Space architects are happily riding that crest. ``Architects at
NASA are becoming bigger players,'' said Kriss Kennedy, an
architect who has worked for NASA for 12 years. ``We're the ones
who put the living back in living in space.''
</P>
<P>
   When he started, there were only a couple of architects working
for NASA in Houston, and much of his time was spent drawing
elaborate concepts of bases on Mars and the moon that may never get
built. Now he is one of more than a dozen architects here.
Recently, Kennedy led the Tiger Team working on the crew quarters.
``It is fun to do something real,'' he said. ``We're not just doing
pretty sketches anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For Finney, 35, the challenges of designing for space proved
irresistible. He was recruited when a former Yale classmate working
at the Habitability Design Center saw some of his concepts for
knockdown furniture. Finney joined the center, which opened in July
and aims to consolidate NASA design projects for crew hardware and
livable spaces. ``I certainly never thought I'd end up here,'' he
said. ``But it touches on a lot of things I'm interested in, such
as efficient, elemental design and the complex relationship between
people and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work on the crew quarters, Finney is also
helping design the space station's pull-out galley and the ward
room, a fold-up table where the six-member station crew will eat
together in the evenings. The table is likely to contain a suction
system for vacuuming up crumbs. ``You wouldn't want those floating
into lab experiments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other NASA spaceships, the American modules for the
International Space Station will be a monochromatic, dull white.
The one exception is a small area of color around some hatches. The
station's Unity node, already orbiting 250 miles above the earth,
contains a surprising patch of salmon pink around the hatch to
point the way to the emergency escape vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful choosing color, because we have to
compete with eight marking and warning colors for things like
radiation and oxygen,'' Finney said. For the quilted panels of the
crew quarters, the designers used white and blue, the only fabric
colors approved so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our palette of material is very narrow,'' said Janis Connelly,
the director of the Habitability Design Center. ``It's a challenge.
How many times can you make stainless steel look really good?''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's architects still must prove to a sea of engineers that
they can be useful. ``There's a cultural assumption at NASA that
everything should be designed by an engineer,'' said Kennedy.
``Architects are usually the ones telling the engineers what they
need. Here, it's kind of an inversion of roles.''
</P>
<P>
   In designing the crew quarters the architects had to conform to
the width of the standard 40-inch ``rack,'' the size of panels and
equipment in the station. ``Smaller than that allowed for solitary
confinement cells,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the engineers can be seen in unwieldy aerospace
hardware and in the profusion of labels on all the equipment.
``I've tried to figure out why stuff looks the way it does,'' said
Rod Jones, a NASA architect. ``I like to think function can be
aesthetic. Sometimes I have to bite my tongue. Some subcontractor
is going to end up designing a latch. I can't say, `Make it like
Mies would make it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finney, who won the Rome Prize in architecture in 1995, said:
``Beauty doesn't really enter the discussion. But it seems like
designers are becoming more relevant here. I hope that's true. It's
certainly not as sexy as science fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Finney sees possibilities. A Pennsylvania native, he
envisions hiring Amish women to quilt the fabric liners of the crew
quarters. ``It's my hope that you can always sneak a little beauty
in there after you meet all the other requirements,'' he said,
brightening after his long day of watching people test-drive the
basic design. ``You just have to justify it as lighter, safer,
cheaper and easier to maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   The financing whims of Congress and a couple of lost probes
notwithstanding, the age of manned missions to Mars may be
approaching. A round trip could take anywhere from two to three
years, depending oology and the alignment of the planets.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has
begun thinking beyond tiny crew quarters for the International
Space Station. But first it must cope with reality: anything that
goes into space must fit inside the space shuttle's 15-by-32-foot
cargo bay. ``The basic module of the space station is absolutely
the most stupendous engineering project every undertaken,'' said
Constance Adams, an architect who works at NASA's new Habitability
Design Center. ``But to live in, it's a shotgun shack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams and Kriss Kennedy, a NASA architect, turned to
inflatables, a concept introduced in the late 1960s when NASA was
doodling solutions for habitats on the Moon and on Mars. A
high-tech fabric structure can fit inside the shuttle for takeoff,
and then expand to three times its size once in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   One result, which now exists only as a scale model, is TransHab,
a bulletproof Kevlar and foam house shaped like a small propane
tank. ``Inflatables will absolutely revolutionize the way we think
about designing buildings in space,'' Kennedy said. ``No longer are
we limited in size or shape.''
</P>
<P>
   With three stories, a cathedral ceiling and 1,500 square feet of
living space, the $200 million, six-bedroom TransHab would allow
the crew ``for the first time not to feel like they're living
inside a machine,'' Ms. Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   TransHab would function like a traditional house, with carefully
divided private and communal spaces. A kitchen and dining area
could double as a conference room, but part of the third floor
would be devoted solely to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be conducting lab experiments next to
someone on a treadmill,'' Ms. Adams said. ``Remember, in
microgravity, sweat floats. It's gross.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Adams, who formerly designed skyscrapers in Japan, space
travel raises provocative questions about the nature of humanity.
Are human beings still different from simians if they can no longer
stand upright? What does it mean for self-image and the sense of
orientation if the head is no longer at the top of the body?
</P>
<P>
   More practically, how human can people be with limited privacy,
no natural 24-hour cycle and no smells of grass? ``My job is
forcing me to think more fundamentally than I ever have about what
it means to be a human being and how humans interact with their
environment,'' Ms. Adams said. ``What do we really need to live in
the Sahara of deep space?''
</P>
<P>
   TransHab is so admired by bureaucrats and astronauts alike that
it may end up attached to the space station in 2004. ``The only
variable is funding,'' Kennedy said.

ASTRONOMER'S COMPUTER COMPANION: WEB SURFER'S GUIDE TO THE
UNIVERSE

<P>
   The past decade has been something of a golden age for
astronomy, with new and more powerful telescopes, satellites and
interplanetary spacecraft providing what seems to be one remarkable
discovery after another.
</P>
<P>
   But if all the findings of extra-solar planets, water-bearing
meteorites and galaxies that push the known limits of the universe
entice you to want to know more about what is going on up there
(and if the recent failure of two Mars missions does not discourage
you), it may be difficult figuring out where to start.
</P>
<P>
   You could buy a telescope, set it up in the back yard and peer
through it, but the results are likely to be less than compelling.
After all, a star is just a pinpoint of light, no matter how great
the magnification.
</P>
<P>
   A better way to begin might be to buy the ``Astronomer's
Computer Companion.'' The book and accompanying CD-ROM are
published by No Starch Press, a small San Francisco company that
specializes in computer books (including some offbeat ones, like
``Internet for Cats'').
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Foust, the editor of SpaceViews, an electronic newsletter
about astronomy and space exploration, and Ron LaFon, a free-lance
writer and amateur astronomer, have created an annotated guide to
the universe on the Internet, serving as Virgil to your Dante as
you explore not hell but the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at home (studies of Earth from space) and branching out
through the rest of the solar system, the Milky Way, and the
galaxies, nebulas, neutron stars, black holes and other odd objects
beyond, the book describes source after source (that is, Web site
after Web site) where information about these topics can be found.
</P>
<P>
   A book that is basically a listing of Web sites might be thought
to be dull, and there are certainly parts of this book that make
for less than riveting reading. The sheer volume of sometimes
arcane sources described _ one site, for instance, details which of
several thousand asteroids are visible to astronomers on any given
night _ can be overwhelming to someone just dabbling in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But in the guise of being an Internet guide, the book does
another useful, and almost surreptitious, service _ it gives a
solid grounding in astronomy and planetary science. It describes
various phenomena in the universe in a way that is as good as that
found in many other astronomy books _ and is a lot more succinct
than most of them.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to use the book is to read the introductory
paragraphs about a particular subject and then skim the more
plodding descriptions of Web sites, or, better yet, to go on the
Web and check out one or two of the sites listed. The accompanying
CD contains an Adobe Acrobat version of the book that can aid in
this piecemeal approach, allowing you to search for a topic and
then click on a highlighted link to go directly to it via your Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the fast-changing worlds of both astronomy and the
Internet, published Web listings can become quickly outdated. A
random check of about a dozen links in the book, for example,
uncovered two (for the comet Hyakutake) that no longer worked. The
publisher promises updates at its own Web site (www.nostarch.com),
but two months after the book's publication, no updates were to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that drawback, the book contains a lot of information to
encourage a deeper interest in astronomy. Its final chapters and CD
offer ways to pursue that interest independently, directing readers
to newsgroups and other specialized Web resources.
</P>
<P>
   The CD has about 200 animations and space and astronomical
photos, including the famous ``Earthrise'' photo taken from Apollo
8 in 1968. It also contains numerous programs for both PCs and
Macs, including planetarium software to create custom sky charts on
screen and more technical programs to aid telescope viewing.
Unfortunately, many of the programs are restricted shareware or
demos, which can be frustrating to use.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the book features a chapter on the types of serious
telescope equipment required if after all this reading and Internet
exploring, you decide that you want to head out into the yard after
all.

YES, `VIRGINIAN': BILL PULLMAN RIDES THE COWBOY WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Bill Pullman in
a scene from ``The Virginian.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Somehow Bill Pullman comes across as a city slicker.
 &HT;    Maybe it's because his most memorable roles were as urban types
in ``The Last Seduction'' (l994), ``While You Were Sleeping''
(l995) and ``Independence Day'' (l996).
 &HT;    But appearances can be deceptive. When he's not on screen,
Pullman prefers to spend his days on horseback or building corrals
on the 1,000-acre-plus spread he and his brother own in Montana.
 &HT;    So it shouldn't be surprising _ though it is _ to see Pullman
riding tall in the saddle in one of Hollywood's ultimate cowboy
roles, the title character in a new version of ``The Virginian''
that will air on Turner Network Television on Jan. 9.
 &HT;    And he isn't just riding _ besides starring in the classic
Western, Pullman has also directed and produced the film, which
co-stars Diane Lane, Dennis Weaver and John Savage.
 &HT;    It's only the latest step onward and upward for the 45-year-old
Pullman, a onetime bit player who has gradually eased himself up to
featured roles and, finally, to leading-man status.
 &HT;    It was during the shooting of ``Independence Day'' that TNT
executives asked Pullman about ``The Virginian,'' dangling the
chance to direct as an added inducement.
 &HT;    ``I was flattered when they said, `We think you're the guy
living now who should play the part and direct,''' he recalls. ``So
I read the book and thought, `This could be good _ it could also be
scary.'''
 &HT;    ``The Virginian'' has a long Hollywood track record. Owen
Wister's l902 novel, ``The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains,''
was first filmed in l914, with Dustin Farnum starring under the
direction of Cecil B. DeMille. In l923 it was remade with Kenneth
Harlan, and six years later Gary Cooper climbed into the
Virginian's saddle. Joel McCrea played the role in l946, and from
l962 to 1971 it was a television staple with James Drury in the
lead.
 &HT;    Now it's Pullman's turn to play the man who has left his native
state to seek his fortune in the wild West. There he falls in love
with Molly Stark (Lane) _ and vigorously pursues her, unlike the
traditional cowboy who allegedly would rather kiss his horse.
 &HT;    ``I knew it had started all these conventions,'' Pullman says,
relaxing in a suite at the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills.
``But it didn't seem conventional at its core at all _ it seemed
darker than even what TNT remembered it was.
 &HT;    ``I had thought cowboy heroes are men of few words and shy with
the ladies,'' the actor says. ``The ladies make the advances,
traditionally, and they reluctantly go along with it. He was the
opposite _ he's direct and colorful, and takes on the quest of
pursuing the girl against her incredible ability to say, `I don't
think so.'''
 &HT;    Besides, the role gave him a chance to play cowboy, a longtime
passion.
 &HT;    ``When we were kids,'' he recalls, ``my dad's idea of a vacation
for us was to put all of us kids out on the farm, and from eighth
grade onwards that's the way I'd spend my summer vacations.''
 &HT;    From that early experience grew an abiding love of the legends
of the West.
 &HT;    ``Westerns are kind of like America's Shakespeare,'' Pullman
says. ``They are tales of people in conflict with the land, with
each other and with themselves.''
 &HT;    The affable actor grew up in Hornell, N.Y., the youngest of
seven children of a taciturn doctor, and was himself painfully shy.
 &HT;    ``I had no social skills,'' he recalls. ``I didn't date, and I
was a really gawky kid.
 &HT;    ``I grew up in an environment where my dad was in medicine and
all the family were caregivers,'' he adds. ``We were always
conflicted, never allowed to show emotion in public. We had a sense
of keeping things subdued. It was important to keep that
British-style stiff upper lip, maintain balance _ otherwise we
would get out of control.
 &HT;    ``It was all very restraining.''
 &HT;    Acting would be his way around those restraints, but even during
college, as he studied architectural engineering, he admits that he
still felt no sense of direction.
 &HT;    ``There was a period in my life where I didn't think I'd ever
find out what I was supposed to do with myself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Finally a gifted drama teacher sparked his interest in acting.
Pullman switched to a theater major, earned a bachelor's degree in
theater arts and then began teaching drama at Montana State
University in Bozeman.
 &HT;    From there he went to New York, where he found stage work, and
then to Los Angeles in quest of a film career. His first movie role
was as a stupid crook in ``Ruthless People'' (l986), followed a
year later by a bit part in Mel Brooks' ``Spaceballs.''
 &HT;    ``The Accidental Tourist'' (l988) gave him his first role as
``the nice guy who never gets the girl,'' with similar roles
following in ``Singles'' (l992), ``Sleepless in Seattle'' (l993)
and ``Sommersby'' (l993).
 &HT;    In l995, however, he actually landed leading lady Sandra Bullock
in ``While You Were Sleeping,'' and won Ellen DeGeneres' hand in
the disappointing ``Mr. Wrong'' (l996). Then came ``Independence
Day,'' with Pullman as the fighter-pilot/president who, with a
little help from Will Smith, saves the world.
 &HT;    Acting, he says, gave his life direction and, as a byproduct,
helped him overcome his shyness to the point that today he is in
real life exactly the sort of easygoing guy he so often plays
onscreen.
 &HT;    ``Acting got me out of myself,'' Pullman says. ``I could feel
rage as an actor, and express directness which in my family had
been weeded out and suppressed.''
 &HT;    Since finishing ``The Virginian,'' the actor has made two
independent movies, ``History is Made at Night'' and ``The
Guilty.''
 &HT;    The former, shot in Finland, is a quirky look at the world of
espionage.
 &HT;    ``I'm a James Bond/CIA type who is put out to pasture,'' the
actor explains. ``He's living in Helsinki, looking for work and
hoping that, in that remote corner of the world, nothing too
exciting is going to happen. He knows a low-level Russian operative
in the same area in this time of no Cold War, and then all of a
sudden things erupt.''
 &HT;    ``The Guilty,'' shot in Vancouver, casts Pullman as a lawyer
about to be named a judge when a story surfaces about an alleged
rape. Co-starring are English actresses Joanne Whalley _ formerly
Mrs. Val Kilmer, and known then as Joanne Whalley-Kilmer _ and
Gabrielle Anwar.
 &HT;    Offscreen, Pullman is married to dancer Tamara Hurwitz. The two
have three children _ Maesa, Jack and Louis, ages 6 to ll. He likes
to spend time on the vast family cattle ranch in Montana, not far
from another owned by actor Peter Fonda and an even bigger one
owned by Fonda's sister Jane and his brother-in-law, TNT honcho Ted
Turner.
 &HT;    ``There I get to be a cowboy and brush shoulders with the guys
who are making their principal living that way,'' the actor says,
chuckling. ``I risk becoming the laughing stock of the valley.
 &HT;    ``But getting away up there with my family and my brothers does
provide us a way to have our families together and be in contact
with the land and agriculture,'' he adds. ``We can put out the hay
and vaccinate the cows.
 &HT;    ``I was never one for taking vacations sitting on a beach and
reading,'' Pullman concludes. ``I'm happy doing something more
physical.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the clock strikes 12 this New Year's Eve,
hundreds of millions of eyeballs will be locked on the same thing:
the Times Square ball. That's a lot of pressure _ even for a
half-ton geodesic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the star of our show,'' said Jeff Strauss, president of
Countdown Entertainment, the company producing the event. For the
past year, artists and engineers around the world have been working
to ensure that the computerized star of Y2K will shine when it
drops, not crash.
</P>
<P>
   This ball, which measures 6 feet in diameter, is undoubtedly the
most high-tech one yet. An elaborate software and hardware system,
typically used for theatrical productions, has been customized to
choreograph the action. And there will be plenty of action from a
kaleidoscopic interplay of 600 halogen light bulbs, 96 lightning
strobes and 92 motorized pyramid mirrors. All that will shine
through an encasement of more than 500 triangles of Waterford
crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball has always changed with technology,'' Strauss said.
``For the new millennium, we wanted the newest technology, but
keeping the tradition intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradition began in 1907 when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher
of The New York Times, asked the paper's chief electrician, Walter
F. Painer, to create a new high-tech element for the fourth
celebration outside the paper's office in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Painer looked downtown for inspiration, taking a cue from an
iron ball that was dropped at noon every day outside the Western
Union building. Time balls date to 18th-century England, where they
were used for nautical purposes. Balls were dropped every day at
noon at local ports so passing ships could accurately adjust their
clocks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first Times Square ball drop, Painer fashioned a
700-pound iron and wood ball with 100 25-watt light bulbs. Six men
were needed to hoist the ball up its flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   Though the technology was low by today's standards, it was
ingenious back then. When the ball hit the ground, it completed an
electrical circuit that triggered fireworks and a display of the
New Year, 1908, in 5-foot numbers around the building.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the ball grew sleeker and more efficient. In 1920,
the iron was scaled down to 400 pounds, and in 1955 it became a
svelte 150-pound hunk of aluminum controlled with the push of a
button. By last year, the ball featured a thin aluminum skin
studded with 10,000 rhinestones; the lighting had become
computer-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this year's celebration called for considerably more
pizzazz, especially considering the city's ambition to throw the
planet's biggest party. The big ball would also need a bit more
stamina, since it would inaugurate New Year's celebrations around
the world for a 24-hour extravaganza. And cameras and Netcasts
would be carrying the event across the world.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that the ball looked as good during the typically
unflattering light of day, a team of specialists from various
places _ from Broadway theater to Con Edison _ was assembled. After
the crystal was handmade in Ireland, the ball was shipped to New
York and outfitted with enough lights and mirrors to pump it with
life around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to make the ball and another to contend with the
elements. ``In a theater you can control your environment,'' said
Scott J. Hershman, project manager from Fisher, Marantz, Stone, the
company that designed the ball. ``On Dec. 31, we're going to be
outside with no control over environmental conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball's technology has been tested under a variety of
conditions in the past year, during its development in Hudson
Scenic Studios in the Bronx. Aside from one test lighting in
November, the ball will not experience the Times Square environment
until show time.
</P>
<P>
   There are other things to contend with as well, most notably
concerns about the Y2K computer problem. Though the developers say
the ball's computer technology is Y2K compliant, they make no
prediction about how the rest of the city will fare. Strauss,
however, is not concerned. ``If the lights go out everywhere else
in the city when the ball drops,'' he said, ``we'll still be in
good spirits.''

   Although computers are the source of all Y2K panic and
preparation, and although the more obvious thing to do at the turn
of the millennium is to raise a toast and kiss a significant other,
there will no doubt be people who actually want to watch the date
roll over on their computers and use the Web as a way to keep tabs
on the world.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done. Assuming the power doesn't fail and the Web
keeps working, there will be plenty of ways to track the advent of
the new millennium on your computer. There are Webcams around the
world, Y2K information sites, news sites and many other relevant
places online.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to be alone with your computer, or communing
with like-minded friends in far places connected only by the flow
of data, there will be a lot to view and keep track of as you
figure out which emoticons to use to say ``Happy New Year'' and how
to clink glasses for a virtual toast.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities abound to watch the arrival of the new century on
the Web as it occurs across the earth's 24 time zones. The first
will be Forthenews.com's coverage of millennium events in the
Kingdom of Tonga, one of the first inhabited lands to ring in the
new century (www.forthenews.com, Friday at 5 a.m. Eastern time).
</P>
<P>
   Among the scheduled events people will be able to see and hear
is a Hallelujah chorus of 10,000 Tongans and taped interviews with
the King of Tonga. On Jan. 1, the site will show a series of
``firsts'' taking place on the island, like the first wedding of
the millennium and the first airplane takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including EarthCam (www.earthcam.com) and
Perceptual Robotics (www.Y2Kcams.com), offer sites that feature
images from Web cameras planted on millennium pulse points around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Although the images at both sights are somewhat grainy and take
several seconds to appear, the Web cameras do achieve a certain
genie-like charm in enabling the viewer to move from place to place
in a click, if not a blink.
</P>
<P>
   Those who visit the Earthcam site, for example, will see a map
of the earth, complete with time zones and dots where each of
EarthCam's 100 cameras are located. Click on Gisborne, New Zealand
(which claims to be the first city that will reach the new
millennium), and you will peer through a Web camera mounted on top
of the Farmer's Building, which houses the town clock.
</P>
<P>
   The camera takes snapshots at 30-second intervals, which means
that you will see images of people and cars moving down the street
as if you were looking at them in slow motion through a flip book.
At the same time, you can listen to audio streams from a local
radio station as it plays Top 40 songs or advertisements about
prices of deli meat at the supermarket. Just like being there, sort
of.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cooper, chief executive of Perceptual Robotics, said the
company's Y2KCam site would relay images from Web cameras at
locations like the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Bourbon Street in New
Orleans and the Las Vegas strip.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras will run on a time-share control function, he said,
allowing site visitors to position the camera remotely, take a
snapshot and have it relayed back to them. The snapshots can also
be downloaded and sent to friends via e-mail. Traffic at the site
and transmission speeds will determine how much of a delay will
occur between the time an image is snapped and when it is seen,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium spectacle taking place in New York City's Times
Square will be the focus of many Internet broadcasts, including one
sponsored by the Times Square Business Improvement District
(www.timessquarebid.org). The organization is covering the
27-hour-long event starting at 6:30 a.m. Eastern time Friday until
6 a.m. Pacific time on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen Web cameras will be situated on building rooftops,
behind electronic billboards and even inside the puppet costumes
worn by people representing different countries and marching in the
hourly processions. Amy Jane Finnerty, a spokeswoman for the
organization, said no problems or delays in the broadcast were
expected as a result of the Y2K transition.
</P>
<P>
   Timessquare2000.com will broadcast video streams on New Year's
Eve, as well as visitor's guides and message boards for posting and
viewing New Year's resolutions (timessquare2000.com). Site visitors
will also be able to send messages to computer terminals in Times
Square, to be read and responded to by passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   For the midnight oil burners valiantly toiling to keep things
running smoothly, the Bindview Corp. (www.bindview.com), a risk
management software company based in Houston that consults with
companies on Y2K-related issues, is giving a New Year's Eve party
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered that many of our clients' employees would be
online on New Year's Eve, so we thought, Why not have a party?''
said Marc Camm, Bindview's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Camm said that although he was sure they would rather be
somewhere else, the partygoers would find video and audio streams
from movies like ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' millennium-themed
chats and multiplayer grids of Half-Life, a popular computer game.
The fun starts at 11 p.m. Eastern time.
</P>

   And after the last ball has dropped, those who want to get a
jump on celebrating the new millennium on Jan. 1, 2001 (which is
when the Gregorian calendar says the next millennium actually
begins) should head to the U.S. Naval Observatory
(www.usno.navy.mil). The site includes a link between the clock on
your computer and Coordinated Universal Time as represented by the
observatory's master clock. Once connected, your computer screen
will display a running countdown to midnight Dec. 31 in days,
hours, minutes and seconds.

   &UR; WATCHING FOR BUGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CATHERINE GREENMAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Watching Webcams from around the world appeals to one sort of
surfer; keeping track of the effects of the Y2K bug is something
entirely different and more serious. A number of governmental and
other types of sites can keep you up to date on problems in the
United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   For an early look at how Y2K is affecting computers, the
International Y2K Cooperation Center, which was formed earlier this
year by the United Nations and the World Bank, will post reports on
its Web site (www.IY2KCC.org) from countries like New Zealand and
Australia that will be among the first to experience the changeover
to the new year and millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The East Coast of the United States is 5 hours behind
Coordinated Universal Time, which is 13 hours behind midnight on
Tonga in the Pacific. Those time differences mean that in New York
you can start celebrating the good news, or suffering with the bad,
on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can click on a country to view the status
of operations within several public sectors including energy,
transportation, water supply and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Pellegrin, a spokeswoman for the cooperation center, said
that a green dot will indicate normal operations, a yellow dot
reduced operations and a red dot significantly reduced operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although government Web sites of New Zealand, Australia and
countries in later time zones will post their own Y2K reports, Ms.
Pellegrin said the site of the cooperation center was designed to
be a liaison between command centers in each country and the rest
of the information-hungry world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier rollover countries didn't want to get bombarded
with information requests because that alone would cause
problems,'' she said. ``So we're encouraging people to come here
first.''
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium unfolds across the United States, the
President's Council on Year 2000 Web site (www.Y2K.gov) as well as
the Federal Emergency Management Agency's site (www.fema.gov) will
post information about problems at the federal and state levels
should they arise.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Gribben, a spokesman for the President's Council on
Year 2000, said that the timeliness of such reports could not be
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to gather as much data as we can,'' he said, ``but
we're not the news. There's obviously going to be a certain lag
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal transportation officials say travelers will be better
served by television or radio. Travelers would also be well advised
to get in direct contact with sources of information to check for
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Department spokesman Dave Smallen said, said,
``We'll be providing regular updates on our site that are
consistent with the information we get, but they'll be general.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many commercial airlines post flight change information
on their Web sites, Sophie Bethune, a spokeswoman for the Air
Transport Association, a trade organization based in Washington,
suggested calling the airlines directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally easier to get updates from airlines over the
phone rather than on an airline's Web sites,'' Ms. Bethune said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent computer consultants have set up sites, like
www.jrwhipple.com/needyourhelp.html and the Y2K Rollover Watch
(www.onelist.com), to collect and post on public message boards
activity related to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will want much more specific information than the
government can provide,'' said Steve Davis, a Y2K consultant in
Baltimore who operates an information site called
www.davislogic.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want as many different sources as they can get for
unvarnished opinions about what's happening.''

   &UR; Y2K PC TIPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By PETER H. LEWIS &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If you have not yet checked your computer for problems related
to Y2K, there really is no need to panic. Most personal computers
made in the last few years will make the transition from 99 to 00
without problems.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are ready to do some last-minute checkups, here is
what you need to know:
</P>
<P>
   _ Older computers may have a BIOS, or basic input output system,
that is unable to handle years after 1999. Most BIOS problems can
be fixed with a simple software patch, widely available on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ For home PCs, the biggest concerns are programs like
spreadsheets, databases, and personal finance and accounting
software that rely on date-based or time-based calculations. Other
programs, like Web browsers, may also be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what to do:
</P>
<P>
   _ Back up your important files before Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ The easiest and most complete, but not the cheapest, strategy
is to buy a Y2K diagnostic and repair utility program. There are
many on the market. Most cost less than $50. Top-rated programs for
Windows include Greenwich Mean Time's Check 2000 PC Deluxe ($34.95,
www.gmt-2000.com) and Symantec's Norton 2000 ($49.95,
www.symantec.com/sabu/n2000/). Both programs can be downloaded from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet abounds with free diagnostic and repair programs.
Generally they are not as thorough as the commercial programs, but
they test and, in many cases, repair the most obvious points of
failure. Good places to start are www.zdnet.com/zdhelp/filters/y2k/
and www.symantec.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the PC's BIOS fails the diagnostic test and no software
patch is available online, the next step is to contact the PC
manufacturer or the BIOS maker.
</P>
<P>
   _ In general, Apple Macintosh computers are unlikely to have
problems with the year 2000 transition. Some Macintosh third-party
application software, however, could have problems. Apple has a Y2K
information page at www.apple.com/about/year2000/.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are known Y2K glitches _ most of them minor _ in Windows
95, Windows 98 and Windows NT. Microsoft's Y2K information page is
at www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k/.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a list of the most important programs on your computer,
including the version numbers, and check with the software maker on
Y2K compliance. It may be necessary to update the programs. Most
software companies have the information on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ America Online users can check their AOL software by going to
keyword Y2K. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Benefit checks for more than four million veterans
and their survivors should arrive Thursday, the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That means those monthly payments wouldn't be affected by
possible Y2K computer failures over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I want to make this announcement is because I know
that veterans and dependents out there need to be assured that
they're going to receive their benefits and they will not be
affected by the Y2K problem,'' said Hershel Gober, Veterans Affairs
Department Deputy Secretary.
</P>
<P>
   He said 80 percent of veterans and survivors receive their VA
payments through electronic deposit and that those payments will be
made to individual banks on Thursday. Those receiving paper checks
should also receive them Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He Gober explained that benefit payments usually are made on the
last day of each month. But because Friday, Dec. 31, is a federal
holiday the payments are being made a day early, as is normally the
case when the last day of the month falls on a holiday. Gober said
the nation's 172 veteran's hospitals and more than 600 outpatient
clinics have upgraded their computers to correctly read the digits
``00'' as 2000 rather than 1900. Date-sensitive computers that
aren't fixed may malfunction, posing potential problems for such
sectors as electrical distribution systems, airlines and
telecommunications systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made certain that medical equipment works properly and
medical and drug supplies are efficient and safe,'' Gober said.
</P>
<P>
   He said each hospital and clinic has tested their computers and
emergency backup power systems to make sure they will function on
Jan. 1 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conclusion: The start of the new millenium should be a time
for celebration, not a time for concern for the nation's
veterans,'' Gober said.

   Federal officials say banks, electricity distributors and
transportation companies are ready for the New Year. But they offer
these tips just in case there are a few Y2K computer failures:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a three-day supply of food and water, just as you would
be urged to have in preparation for a winter storm. Begin stocking
up now _ don't wait until Friday because stores may temporarily run
out of items like bottled-water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refill prescription medicines when you still have a five- to
seven-day supply remaining.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a flashlight, batteries, a battery-powered radio, a
first-aid kit and extra blankets and clothes for warmth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep automobile gas tanks more than half full a normal
recommendation for motorists in cold winter climes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check with manufacturers to see if such electronic equipment
as programmable thermostats and personal computers are Y2K ready.
Appliances like ovens, stoves, refrigerators, television sets and
smoke detectors do not contain date-based computer chips and should
continue to operate normally in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep paper copies of bank statements, credit card receipts,
bills and prescription medicine information, beginning now and
continuing for a few months after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _Withdraw only as much cash as you normally would for any
holiday weekend. Withdrawing large amounts of cash may invite
the  _ Beware of Y2K scams such as someone trying to sell Y2K
insurance or a Y2K-safe investment.

INTERNET MUSIC: WHO'S MINDING THE STORE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was in a music store last week, trying to decide whether to
take the band Cake home with me. So I ran through the usual
checklist: the album cover showed a silhouette of a brown pig
(tasteful). A 30-second sample of a song sounded promising (loud
drumbeat). And a quick scan of the lyrics confirmed that they
really said what I thought they said, eliminating the possibility
of painful flashbacks to when I was a child and walked around for
weeks singing, ``Lucy in the sky with my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Was I ready to buy? In a typical music store, the answer would
be no, because at that point I would start to feel alienated by the
extremely loud, harsh music blaring over the store's sound system,
which would in turn remind me that I was about to pay at least $12
for a CD, only to get it home and discover that I like only one
song.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, I was in a different kind of online music store,
called Liquid Audio (www.liquidaudio.com), which knew what I
wanted. For $2.99, I could get immediate gratification by
downloading to my hard drive a permanent copy of the single I
sampled, ``You Turn the Screws.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I could use the Liquid Music Player, a free software
application, to play the song on my computer. Or I could copy the
music to my laptop and play it (softly, I promise) on the train. Or
if I ever buy a CD burner, I could copy it to a CD and play it in
the kitchen or the car or wherever.
</P>
<P>
   I was wildly excited because I believed at that moment that I
had stumbled across yet more evidence that the Internet was
empowering me as a shopper. The Liquid Audio player, which displays
album covers, liner notes and lyrics, was offering me the chance to
relive the cheap thrill of buying a 45.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were still drawbacks. Although mainstream music
has embraced the Liquid Audio format because it prevents illegal
copies, the site still has a limited inventory, with only 50,000
titles. And if you hit a snag with the point-and-click download
method, you will learn very quickly that the site offers very
little in the way of customer service.
</P>
<P>
   But I learned that later. For now, I was more focused on the
music that was just waiting for me to say, Yes, little three
minutes of recorded gold, compress yourself into digital bits and
travel across the Internet to me, then unfurl yourself back into a
song (with good sound quality).
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint was the price: $2.99 for digital bits that are
not even delivered on a CD. But when I called Andrea Fleming,
Liquid Audio's vice president for corporate marketing, with the
helpful suggestion that 99 cents sounded about right, she defended
the prices. ``We have major labels,'' she said, ``and one of the
issues the majors are coping with is how to make music available
online without undercutting their other partners.''
</P>
<P>
   After I put Cake into my shopping cart, I added two more
achingly beautiful songs, Larry Groce's ``Bird on the Wire'' and
Bill Monroe's ``Blue Moon of Kentucky,'' $1.99 each, from the
multivolume ``Best of Mountain Stage Live'' series (Blue Plate
Music). My total: $6.97.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I watched as the Downloading window on my computer
informed me that the bits were streaming quickly to my computer via
my new cable modem. With my old 56K dialup modem, downloading a
song could take up to 10 minutes. But instead, in seconds, I had 99
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then tragedy struck. The process stalled. Who knew why? I
returned to the site for help, armed with my transaction
identification number.
</P>
<P>
   That was when I realized that a shopper like me, who expects to
be treated courteously and respectfully when I am handing over
money, should not buy things at the Liquid Audio site, which has no
toll-free phone number and no way to check a transaction's status.
</P>
<P>
   My only option was a bare-bones Help file, which suggested only
that I send e-mail to the online support staff. That made me feel
insulted, since every shopper knows that you would get more help if
you printed out the e-mail note, burned it in the fireplace and
waited for Santa Claus to show up with a technical fix.
</P>
<P>
   But I sent the e-mail. While I waited for a response, I tried to
download again (two of the three songs arrived on my computer),
sent a follow-up e-mail (``Is anybody there?'') and finally became
so frustrated that I found myself muttering: ``It's only $6.97.
It's only $6.97.''
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, I received a reply assuring me that my credit
card would not be charged until the downloading was complete. But
it turned out that the site's software believed that I had already
completed the downloading. About that time, communications from
``support'' ceased. After I enlisted a Liquid Audio spokeswoman to
negotiate on my behalf, I finally got the Bill Monroe song.
</P>
<P>
   But customers should not have to recruit Henry Kissinger to get
satisfaction. I won't go back until customer service improves. When
I buy Cake, I want to be able to eat it, too.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fast jet stream flow from southwestern Canada to the
northeastern United States will continue to direct moisture-starved
low-pressure zones across the continent on Thursday. The wintry
chill that has dominated the Northeast for the past several days
will retreat to the north, but no protracted mild spells are
expected across the region. Meanwhile, moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico and Atlantic Ocean will remain suppressed far to the south
and east, keeping the Southern states dry and tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   Milder air will surge briefly into the Northeast and Middle
Atlantic states on gusty winds from the southwest. Sunshine will be
ample east of the Appalachians, but mostly cloudy skies will
prevail from the northern Ohio Valley to northern New England.
Scattered snow showers will accompany a weakening cold front from
the mountains of northern New England to the eastern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly morning, abundant sunshine will promote a
comfortably mild afternoon over most of the Southeast. The sunshine
will be dimmed by high, thin clouds over southern parts of Texas
and the Mississippi Valley. Farther north, mild weather will
persist over most of the Plains and Mississippi Valley, but the
record warmth of recent days will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread valley fog will be common in the Pacific Northwest
and Idaho as cool, moist air remains trapped by sinking air
currents associated with strong high pressure over the region. Weak
onshore breezes will produce clouds from the coast to the Cascades.
The Southwest will stay mild and dry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Inland Seas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very dry weather has covered most of the nation the past couple
of weeks as persistent offshore breezes have thwarted the inland
advance of moist air from the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico.
An exception has been observed near the Great Lakes, where frequent
snows have fallen. Collectively covering about 90,000 square miles,
the Great Lakes often act like an ``inland'' sea, supplying vast
amounts of water vapor to dry, arctic air masses which traverse
them. On Tuesday evening, ``lake-effect'' snow fell at the rate of
2 inches an hour near Buffalo, N.Y. while most of the country was
free of precipitation. &QL;

<P>
   The room in Baidoa, Somalia, was only a piece of canvas held up
by sticks over hard ground, built against a concrete wall. It could
not shelter the lone occupant from the smell of decay, but when she
hung a 3-by-4-foot rug on a hook from the wall, the lean-to became
a home.
</P>
<P>
   She swept this wall hanging with a tree branch, to keep it free
of the soil that covered everything in the fall of 1992. That she
had held onto this rug was astounding, as every available rug of
this size was being used to wrap the bodies of famine victims. They
were stacked high outside the refugee camp. The woman had come here
with her family. They were now somewhere in the stack.
</P>
<P>
   In Kukes, Albania, in 1999, a green tent with a single window
contained eight cots arranged in two very crowded rows. What made
this room a home was the carefully hung cotton braid scarf dyed a
pale yellow that ornamented the window. The woman of the house was
from the town of Prizren in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The scarf could have been put to better use around a chilly wet
neck, but she hung it to let visitors know that she was the kind of
woman who had a real home elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Here, she had a plastic basin for washing dishes, a stack of
plastic plates, a few glasses for water and a fluted vase with a
single plastic flower. The lovingly arranged objects signified that
this particular family with particular tastes and a particular
story was not just the black number painted on the door flap.
</P>
<P>
   A man nearby was the envy of his neighbors because he had fled
with a shoe box full of photographs. He had put them on a small
wooden table in the center of his family's tent, where other
refugees came by to look at them. They admired images of a real
house that, while possibly nothing more than rubble back home, had
acquired a degree of tangibility here where there were none.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of ubiquitous materialism, I am drawn back to the
tented cities and earthen floor settlements of this decade _
Kurdistan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Albania and many others that I
have not visited personally. If design is the act of defying forces
of conformity, then the elemental gestures of the world's refugees
to defy forces of international chaos in the most traumatized of
human living spaces are a fitting component of this decade's design
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   My most memorable room found me on the border of Iran and Iraq
in 1991. On a muddy roadside was a trailer full of possessions
parked in a five-mile line of vehicles trying to make it to refugee
camps in Iran. A man sat next to a large refrigerator, which he had
managed to haul out along with his family.
</P>
<P>
   It looked absurd there in the open air, until I noticed that he
was arranging colorful magnets on the refrigerator door. They were
plastic roman letters. When he found an ``S'' that had fallen off
onto the trailer, he placed it in the line and turned to me
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   It said, ``USA HELLO.'' He gave me the thumbs up, and all at
once we were no longer in the open air. We were in the family
kitchen.

<P>
   We are reading peacefully on the couch, my daughter, my husband
and I, soaking up the heat of the wood stove, when the dog begins
to whine. The three of us hunker into the pages before us as if
doing so will shut out the noise, like closing a window. But the
dog has soulful eyes, and they are trained on me in an inescapable,
it's-up-to-you kind of way, until I have no choice but to relent.
The dog smiles broadly while the others scowl. I've seen that look
before, on the Broadway local at rush hour, when the train door
opens and people push their way on, subdividing space as if
everyone were part of a living math problem: what's one-half
divided by half; what's zero divided by half?
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the No. 1 train. It's a mangy, 7-foot-plus
oatmeal-colored couch in the living room of a rambling,
hundred-year-old farmhouse. The house sits on the edge of the
wilderness in the middle of New York state's 6 million-acre
Adirondack Park. We moved here years ago when New York City started
to crowd. But certain habitats, like certain habits, die hard.
</P>
<P>
   This couch is our own private IRT.
</P>
<P>
   Everything happens here. Homework is done, ice cream is eaten,
splinters are pulled, tears are shed, dreams are had, presents are
opened, romance is pursued, birds are watched, temperatures are
taken. Like one of those petri dishes from high school biology
class, it grows life out of brown slime. The couch isn't slimy, but
it is a tattered mess from which the life of this house and its
occupants seem to emanate.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the walls, the ceiling and the kitchen sink, take away
the beds but leave the couch, and we may not notice. Take away the
couch, or even a piece of it, and watch out. I know this because I
once removed a side cushion that had had a run-in with the wood
stove. Part of it was black, and part of it had melted and
hardened. In its place I put a fluffy pillow, the kind that invites
you to lean back. ``You didn't throw the cushion away?'' my husband
demanded. ``Look under our bed,'' I reassured him.
</P>
<P>
   The couch cost $200. I bought it from a friend who had ordered
it over the phone and thought it was too big once it was in her
house. Our house had a wall that welcomed it. Above the wall is a
window that looks out at the mountain whose name we gave our
daughter when she was born.
</P>
<P>
   Now that daughter claims a piece of the couch, and the dog is
whining, demanding hers. So I stand up and let her on. The others
retract their legs, squeezing till space is made from no space. The
dog lets loose a contented sigh. We are all in our places.

<P>
   This may sound weird, but I detest large, bright, high-ceilinged
rooms. It is one of the many ways in which I'm out of sync with
contemporary fashion. I grew up brooding and high-strung in just
those kinds of spaces _ my mother's chic, shrill, all-white
interiors, filled with white plastic couches and glaring
glass-topped tables. Throughout my adolescence, estranged from the
chill barrenness of home, I dreamed of living in a warren of
soothing, dark-walled little rooms. Ah, for womb-warm Victorian
upholstery, the solace of hidden nooks and crannies!
</P>
<P>
   It took me until my early 20s, when I first walked into my
friend E.'s library in Paris, to find the space of my dreams. Her
library was a fairly small, cavelike chamber orchestrated in
tonalities of dark, soothing greens: walls hung in a velvety
forest-green fabric; couches and chairs upholstered in a paler,
more olive green; fading carpet the color of moss on a rainy summer
day; curtains of vert-de-gris hue softening the room's scant light.
Although most of my friend's books were kept on the second floor of
her house, this felt like a library because it was a deeply
contemplative site, a site of learning and of concentration.
</P>
<P>
   It reflected my friend's very private, nurturing, meditative
character, and within a few weeks I was spending many hours a month
there. ``Let's figure this out in the library,'' we'd say to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   So for some crucial years of my life, E.'s dark-green room
became a figuring-out place, a refuge from the anxieties of my jobs
and of my agitated Paris love life, and perhaps a healing antidote
to the brash whiteness of my childhood homes. It is in that
consoling lairlike space that she became my closest friend, a
combination of older sister and second mother who would shape my
life more deeply than any other woman I've known. It is there that
I received _ she was 18 years older than me _ the stern, loving
advice that would help me, eventually, to reach a happy adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of her healing counsel, I gathered the courage
to venture into marriage. Upon returning to the United States and
moving into my husband's New England house, my first task was to
create a bedroom in which I could recapture the verdant peace of
her figuring-out room. I chose an upstairs room that retained its
original ceiling of rough-hewn chestnut beams, painted its walls a
dark forest green and softened the light with curtains of pale
aquamarine gauze. Save for an occasional change in the color of my
bedspread, which has alternated from a deep ocean blue to a moss or
olive hue, not a detail of my room has changed over the 43 years of
my marriage, as my cherished friend's library never changed over
the decades I returned to Paris to visit. Certain spaces can be as
curative, as essential to our well-being, as a snail's carapace is
to its vulnerable tenant.
</P>
<P>
   My friend died a month ago, leaving an awesome void in my life,
and recently I've spent more time than usual in my own green lair,
feeling grateful, throughout my sorrow and mourning, for one more
treasure she offered me: an awareness of the subtle links between
our physical spaces and our psychic needs.

 Janet McTeer, who stars in the movie ``Tumbleweeds,'' won the Tony
Award for leading actress in 1997 for her role as Nora in ``A
Doll's House.''  
(DW) 
 By JANET McTEER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I did ``A Doll's House'' at the Belasco Theater in New York. The
dressing room was a nasty-colored cream. Some people might paint
it, but I couldn't be bothered. All that matters to me is that I
have a place to sleep and that the dressing room is quite bare.
When I have two shows, I have to have a place to sleep between
shows. Somewhere cozy, with a sofa bed, a cot, anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   Some people decorate their dressing rooms, but I don't. There's
a phone, but I don't use it. I don't like it when it's a proper
room. I prefer it to be bare, because then it's about the play, the
production. It has to be very much a private place, some sanctuary
where I can go from being Janet to Nora. It's not a sitting room,
where you relax, because you're not going to relax, you're going to
work. It has to be a place where you can shut the door and you're
on your own.
</P>
<P>
   All actors prepare in their own ways. I always touch base with
everyone else. Then I do a voice warm-up. Then I wander around
inside the room within my own imagination.
</P>
<P>
   With a movie, where you're moving around all the time, it's all
about having your own private space. With a play, your dressing
room has a history. Gifts and cards and letters pile up, and they
become the decoration. I've had some wonderful gifts from other
actors, and books and candles and flowers and wine. Eventually, of
course, it starts to look like a sitting room.
</P>
<P>
   I've been doing plays since I was 22, and now I'm 38, so there
have been hundreds of dressing rooms. I've had many, and I've loved
them all.

SEEING DOLLAR SIGNS IN SPORTS FANS' PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years and years, investing was likened to sports because
investing, like sports, generates statistics about winners and
losers and because America is a sports culture that will make
stadium analogies about anything. So Wall Street was a big
high-stakes sporting event, and traders (the vast majority of them
men, many former high school football captains) were gilded jocks.
</P>
<P>
   Then a funny thing happened. Geeks started making billions of
dollars, and Wall Street investment firms started bragging about
how many Ph.D.'s they had in their offices. Online investing became
a mass mania, and regular people started reading charts and
analysts' reports on their computers. As the stock market soared,
we became enraptured with high-tech-startup mythology. We became a
stock-trading culture. So now sports are likened to investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Sportsdaq (www.sportsdaq.com), the product of a tiny
startup called Sports Futures Inc. Sportsdaq is a fictional stock
exchange where sports teams are tradable securities. Unlike most
fantasy sports games, in which players put athletes into fictional
teams whose performances correspond to the athletes' statistics,
Sportsdaq is pure market psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The only real-world statistic in the system is the end result of
the sports season: which team wins the championship. When the
championship game is over, that team is worth 100. The rest are
worth zero. Until then, Sportsdaq traders can use their initial
budget of 100,000 Sportsdaq dollars to buy team stocks. Stock price
is a direct reflection of shareholder confidence in a team's future
performance. If the market thinks the Yankees team has a 10 percent
chance of winning the pennant, its stock trades at 10. If traders
decide a team is going to lose, they can place an order to sell it
short.
</P>
<P>
   The market can buy as much stock as it wants _ the supply of
securities is open-ended. But the combined team prices have to add
up to 100. So Sportsdaq acts as a market maker, ensuring that the
value of the index stays constant.
</P>
<P>
   The content is sports, but the experience is more akin to
ETrade. You make investments. You track them over time. But unlike
ETrade, where activities are extremely private, Sportsdaq is
semipublic. You can compare your performance against other people's
_ if you're a hotshot fictional day trader, you can be ranked
(imagine a high-score board on ETrade).
</P>
<P>
   Competition keeps people engaged _ it keeps their eyes open for
new market opportunities. It also allows Sportsdaq to market sports
that don't have a mainstream following in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you this scenario,'' said Sports Futures chief
executive Andrew Hoppin, 28. ``I am a big baseball fan. I've spent
all this time paying attention to baseball and investing in
baseball. But I can't crack the top tier of traders in the game
because they've found this great opportunity investing in cricket
securities. If I find other people are beating me out in the game
because they know about cricket and they're able to take advantage
of cricket, that will incentivize this American baseball fan to go
find out what cricket is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a European Sportsdaq could give American sports
leagues a chance to interest ardent cricketeers in the curious
backwater pastime called baseball. Sportsdaq is in discussions with
European new media companies and stateside leagues about a
transcontinental exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Sportsdaq's real customers are the people selling
sports, wherever they are: teams, broadcasters and merchandisers.
From their perspective, the Web site is a giant focus group
churning with useful information. Broadcasters have to decide which
games to air in which local markets. Retailers have to decide which
jerseys to stock in different parts of the country. The home team
and the reigning champs are no-brainers. But what else do you put
on the racks _ or the airwaves _ in Camden, Maine, and Oak Ridge,
Tenn.?
</P>
<P>
   Sportsdaq will feature advertising, collect e-commerce
commissions and sell premium services. But fundamentally, Sports
Futures is in the research business. ``Even if we direct no
revenues from the site itself, we think the information coming out
of the market is going to be a significant enough revenue stream to
drive the business,'' Hoppin said. ``The leagues have a lot of
interest in it because they want to understand the breakdown of the
audience. They want to know how to access different audiences that
they haven't accessed before, and we have an opportunity, because
it's a site where people keep coming back, to track that.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Sportsdaq and most e-commerce sites is
that it's not selling data that's invisible to the users. ``We'll
package data differently for third parties,'' Hoppin said. ``But
fundamentally, it's the same data you see on your screen: what do
people think about the outcome of a sporting event.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sportsdaq will offer different sets of detailed data
to its traders as a premium service. ``The software tools are going
to enable people to do very detailed statistical analysis,'' Hoppin
said. ``We're going to be working with a partner in New Mexico
who's developed models for casinos in Las Vegas that they use to
set their odds for sports. We're going to be translating that into
a form that we can use for our game, for people to be able to parse
data from statistics from the real sports world in a format that's
going to enable them to look at these issues in a quantitative
fashion and make investment decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it's appropriate that online trading research should be
supplied by Las Vegas oddsmakers. In Las Vegas, as on Wall Street,
some people hit the jackpot. Some people lose their shirts. But the
house always wins.

<P>
   QIRYAT ARBA, West Bank _ The Israeli Army on Wednesday razed a
shrine built around the grave of Baruch Goldstein, the
Brooklyn-born physician from this West Bank settlement who gunned
down 29 Muslims at prayer in neighboring Hebron nearly six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen admirers of Goldstein hurled abuse from behind
police barricades as workers ringed by soldiers and policemen
bulldozed a stone plaza around his tombstone that contained benches
and lights, a prayerbook case, a stand for memorial candles, a
collection box and faucets for ritual hand-washing.
</P>
<P>
   The tombstone _ with its epitaph describing Goldstein as a
``martyr'' with ``clean hands and a pure heart'' _ was left
untouched, and after the flagstones around it were carefully pried
away under the eye of a military chaplain, the ground was covered
with gravel.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, 1994, reportedly enraged by Palestinian-Israeli
peace efforts and a string of deadly Arab attacks on Jewish
settlers, Goldstein walked into a mosque at the Tomb of the
Patriarchs shrine and fired his automatic rifle at kneeling
worshippers, killing 29 before he was beaten to death by the crowd.
The shrine is believed to be the burial place of Abraham and other
biblical patriarchs and matriarchs, and is held sacred by both Jews
and Muslims _ who know it as the Ibrahimi Mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The grave site has been a magnet for supporters of Goldstein,
who was a follower of Meir Kahane, the virulently anti-Arab rabbi
who was assassinated in New York in 1990. Goldstein was buried in a
park named after Kahane at the entrance to this settlement because
the army, fearing Palestinian unrest and vandalism of the killer's
grave, refused to allow a burial in the old Jewish cemetery in the
heart of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   However the area around the tombstone mushroomed into a
pilgrimage site under the army's nose, drawing Jewish admirers of
Goldstein from Israel and abroad who would pray at the grave,
kneeling and kissing the tombstone. ``He gave his life for the
people of Israel, it's Torah and land,'' his epitaph says.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition was carried out in keeping with parliamentary
legislation passed last year that outlawed monuments to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a petition by
Goldstein's family against dismantling the site, but the court
allowed six months for further consideration of whether the
tombstone inscription should also be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important day in the struggle over the moral
image of Israeli society,'' said the Industry and Trade minister,
Ran Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great disgrace has been wiped from our face,'' said Cohen,
who is a member of the leftist Meretz party that sponsored the bill
that eventually led to the dismantling of the shrine around
Goldstein's grave. ``The other half of the stain will be removed
when the shameful inscription is erased. This monument symbolized
everything that is anti-Jewish, anti-Israeli and anti-human. It was
a site of incitement and education for murder.''
</P>
<P>
   When workers arrived Wednesday morning to dismantle the grave
plaza, Goldstein's father, Yisrael Goldstein, lay down on his son's
tombstone until he was asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a righteous man,'' he sobbed. ``He gave his life to
sanctify God's name. What are they doing here? What a shame. God,
please forgive us.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein repeated claims by many settlers here that his son had
acted to prevent a planned massacre of Jews by Arabs. ``How much
could he endure?'' Goldstein said. ``He was there that morning to
prevent the slaughter that would certainly have taken place. Now
look what we've come to.''
</P>
<P>
   As the demolition proceeded, Shmuel Ben-Yishai, a militant
settler, taunted the police and soldiers through a loudspeaker
giving them a Nazi salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers of Arafat!,'' he shouted. ``You don't have to speak
German to take apart Jewish graves. God will take his revenge on
you! God willing, you won't see it through the year, and we'll have
the privilege of dancing on your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Others militants shouted: ``Wreck Rabin's grave! Rabin's next!''
They were referring to the tomb of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
who was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to peace efforts
with the Palestinians. Border police were posted Wednesday at
Rabin's grave at Mt. Herzl Cemetery in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Tiran Pollack, a leader of Kach, the outlawed political party
formed by Kahane, said: ``To many people Dr. Goldstein is a Jewish
hero. This is a barbaric act. In no country in the world would
anyone dare touch a grave. This is what they do when they can't
fight a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Palestinian-ruled section of Hebron, Mayor Mustafa
Abdel Nabi Natshe welcomed the demolition, saying that it would
help heal the scars left by the massacre at the Tomb of the
Patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important for us and for the Israelis, together,
to remove the remains of the massacre, as well as for the peace
process,'' Natshe said. ``It's important for the Israelis to know
that someone who commits such actions against civilians and Muslims
at prayer must not be regarded as a hero or saint.''
</P>
<P>
   When the work at the grave site was done, some settlers knelt
and kissed the tombstone, vowing to rebuild the demolished plaza.
But beyond the commotion at the grave, Qiryat Arba was calm
Wednesday, and most residents went about their business as usual.
</P>

WEBTV GETS IT TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of years ago one word buzzed around practically any
gathering of the engineers and designers responsible for the latest
gee-whiz advances in personal computers, televisions,
video-cassette recorders and just about anything else that could be
plugged in or tuned in and turned up.
</P>
<P>
   That word was ``convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept was simple. As semiconductor chips got more
sophisticated and powerful, devices previously seen as different
and separate, like a television and a PC, would converge into a new
species of higher-tech products. These hybrid offspring, the
thinking went, would possess the best qualities of their parents,
and more.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter half of this year the chatter about convergence
seemed to have crested. But with less talk there has been more
action, a trickling forth of products that are actually beginning
to fulfill the promise of convergence. One of the most intriguing
examples is the latest television set-top box powered by WebTV
Networks, a subsidiary of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The box can seamlessly make a conventional television set
function like at least three different devices: an Internet-linked
computer, a satellite TV and an enhanced digital video recorder.
All of this enables viewers to watch up to 300 television channels
(the goal is to make 500 available), record as many as 12 hours of
programs, browse the Internet and send and receive e-mail like the
best Web denizen _ all without leaving the couch.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the new service, formally called EchoStar's
DISHPlayer 500 with Microsoft's Personal TV Service and WebTV Plus,
can easily merge these functions. The result is that viewers can
not only watch television programs, but interact with them in real
time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fans of the popular quiz show ``Jeopardy!'' can not
only watch it on television, but, with the new system and a monthly
subscription to WebTV Plus, can play along at home by clicking the
interactive television symbol that pops up at the bottom of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   When the show's host, Alex Trebek, asks contestants in the
studio a question, WebTV displays possible answers in a window on
the screen. Using the television's special remote control, home
players must pick an answer before time runs out. WebTV keeps the
score.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology could also be used to play on the television
games that were usually exclusive to personal computers. There's
digital Solitaire and the fast-paced quiz game ``You Don't Know
Jack,'' which offers updated questions each week. And the classic
alien shoot-'em-up Doom is stored on the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most eye-popping new feature the service offers is
Personal TV. Television signals picked up by the EchoStar satellite
dish can be recorded on a hard drive in the set-top box. Like a
conventional VCR, the device can be programmed to record a favorite
show, by calling up on-screen TV listings, selecting a program and
pushing ``record'' on the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   But like similar recorders from Replay Networks Inc. and TiVo
Inc., the WebTV box also gives viewers far greater control over
what they watch and when. The device automatically records whatever
the viewer is watching, keeping track of the last 30 minutes. What
that permits viewers to do is freeze the ``live'' program at any
time, rewind, play and then fast forward (very fast, up to 300
times the normal speed) to move back to the program in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Missed Jay Leno's punch line? Push pause, rewind and make him
perform it again. Frustrated because the network took a commercial
break rather than show an instant replay of an amazing pass
interception? Personal TV gives viewers the capacity to turn every
play into an instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, the new WebTV box doesn't look very different
from its first set-top box introduced in 1996. That one was
strictly aimed at people who wanted inexpensive Internet access
without having to buy a personal computer. It was simple to install
and use. Its designers also tweaked its output resolution so
consumers could, for example, read their e-mail on a television
screen likely to be located feet away rather than on a computer
monitor just inches away.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the same can be said for the new WebTV, Personal TV and
DISHPlayer combination. What has changed is the cost. While the
box, satellite dish and remote control package lists for $299 ($199
for a box that can record six hours of programs, half as much as
the more expensive one) and satellite installation starts at $99,
all the services require payment of a monthly fee: $19.99 for basic
service of 40 channels and $28.99 for 100 channels, or higher fees
for more channels. (The hard drive in the $299 set-top box holds
17.2 gigabytes, while the $199 box has a 8.6-gigabyte hard drive.)
There are several monthly fees: Internet access through WebTV is
$24.95, and Personal TV, provided by Web TV, a subsidiary of
Microsoft, charges $99 a month for its television recording
service.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you can save money by signing up for combinations of
services _and even though you get some instant news from the
service _ the monthly fee seems excessive, like paying the maker of
your stereo each time you play a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Now that satellite services can offer local channels, EchoStar
carries local channels in 18 cities, and it plans to expand to more
than 30 cities _ 60 percent to 70 percent of the country's viewers
_ in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Still fairly easy to use (although scrolling through hundreds of
choices, including audio-only music channels, can be daunting) all
the features are crammed into a box no larger than a typical VCR.
For Internet access, the box must be hooked into a phone line,
which ordinarily should not be much of a problem. But installing
the satellite dish and integrating it with the television system is
anything but simple, and is better left to professionals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At my apartment in Manhattan, an installer took several hours to
place the dish on the building's roof, string cable, align the dish
with the satellite high in geosynchronous orbit (an unobstructed
southwest exposure is required) and download the programs necessary
for its operation.
</P>
<P>
   But once the system was in place and running, its advantages
over conventional television _ even one plugged into cable _ were
apparent and many.
</P>
<P>
   First, connecting to the Internet through WebTV is almost as
natural and intuitive as using a remote control to surf channels.
For anyone comfortable with browsing the Web on a personal
computer, all of the Net conventions _ search engines, personalized
portals and e-mail _ are present and recognizable on WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing is breathtaking speed, a big drawback. Whether
using the modified WebTV remote control or the optional wireless
keyboard ($50), users often must wait five to 10 seconds for the
system to switch functions, like going from retrieving e-mail to
preparing for the user to write e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is something warm and cozy about curling
up on the sofa or the bed and doing something considerably
high-tech like composing and sending e-mail, not on a desk-bound
computer but on a television set. And why not? Televisions are
everywhere. Americans commonly take them for granted, expecting
television sets to be as much a given in a room as curtains on a
window. Of the 100 million households in the United States, 99
percent of them have at least one television, according to WebTV
Networks. And people spend almost as much time with the television
on as they do putting in a full day's work _ 7.5 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new WebTV-satellite rubric of ``enhanced TV,'' the
hours spent in front of the television are likely to go up. It
depends on whether people find that their experience in the glow of
the post-convergence tube is truly enhanced.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the White House scrambled to put the final
touches on its star-studded New Year's Eve show, law enforcement
agencies around Washington were racing against the clock Wednesday
to ensure that the only fireworks seen Friday night are part of the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every officer from every agency involved in this event knows
that the threat of an attack is out there, and we're doing
everything we can to make sure nothing happens,'' said Sgt. Rob
MacLean, spokesman for the U.S. Park Police.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI said it has received no specific threats against
targets in the country, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said
last week that recent events ``suggest that there is a heightened
risk that there may be individuals planning attacks abroad and
within the United States through mid-January.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder's comments came after the Dec. 14 arrest of an Algerian
man, Ahmed Ressam, who was charged with taking bomb-making
materials into Port Angeles, Wash., from Canada. His arrest has put
intelligence and law enforcement agencies on high alert for a
possible act of terror.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said Park Police officers already are on round-the-clock
patrols in the areas where President Clinton and his guests will
appear during the New Year's Eve celebration. He added that the
police will ``sweep'' the National Mall with explosive-sniffing
dogs repeatedly before the celebration, which is expected to draw
nearly 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said the streets immediately around the Mall will be
closed on Friday and that people attending the celebration, in an
area between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, will
have to pass through checkpoints. Officers also will be checking
coolers, backpacks and any other packages that could conceal a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be quite as bad as going to the airport, but it will
be close,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Washington police and the Park Police have
said they will have nearly every officer and agent on duty that
evening. The city's police force has more than 3,600 officers; the
Park Police has an estimated 500 officers in the Washington area.
The Secret Service also will be out in force guarding the
president, but that agency does not discuss security details.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will literally be officers, either in uniform or plain
clothes, all over the Mall and on the city streets surrounding the
Mall,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's arrest has caused wariness elsewhere. In Seattle, the
big bash to ring in 2000 under the Space Needle was canceled
because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns, Clinton has said that while Americans
should remain aware of the threats, they ``ought to go about their
holidays and enjoy themselves and make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well on New Year's Eve, a daylong celebration will
begin at 11 a.m. on Friday with performances on the Mall by youth
choirs, the U.S. Marine Corps Band and other performers. The
president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will unveil the
``National Millennium Time Capsule,'' containing artifacts
representing America at the end of the 20th century, at the 11 a.m.
event. At 7 p.m., the Clintons will host a dinner for 1,000 invited
guests at the White House. A select 320 will sit down with the
first couple in the White House. The rest will dine in a heated
tent in the Rose Garden with members of Congress and their guests.
After dinner, the Clintons and 500 guests will go to the Lincoln
Memorial for the splashy, 3-hour ``America's Millennium Gala,'' a
program that will be televised live on CBS with the actor and
rapper Will Smith as the host.
</P>
<P>
   The gala will include entertainment by Robert Duvall, Diane
Keaton, Kathy Mattea, Bobby McFerrin, Don McLean, Brian Stokes
Mitchell, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Trisha Yearwood, Sam
Waterston, BeBe Winans and Luke Cresswell, accompanied by the
25-member company of the Broadway production ``Stomp.''In the final
half-hour of 1999, large projection screens erected beside the
Lincoln Memorial will show an 18-minute millennial movie, ``The
Unfinished Journey'' by Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the movie, the president will speak briefly and
then the evening's pyrotechnic extravaganza will begin.
</P>
<P>
   With just 20 seconds left before midnight, Clinton will light a
fuse that will burn its way along the length of the reflecting
pool, ending at the base of the Washington Monument, now surrounded
by an elaborate scaffold because of refurbishing work.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 11:59:50 p.m., 10 successive bursts of brilliant white
stars will rain down the sides of the monument, each 55 feet above
the one before it. Finally, beginning at midnight, the entire
monument will be covered with ``a stunningly beautiful waterfall''
of white pyrotechnics, said Philip Butler, who is producing the
show for Fireworks by Grucci, a Long Island, N.Y., company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monument is a national icon which is held in great
reverence,'' Butler said last week, ``and we could never use it as
a fireworks stage, except for the scaffolding being there.''

<P>
   Anyone who walked by Professor Lawrence Landweber's computer
science class at the University of Wisconsin this fall might have
heard the typical sounds of a professor lecturing from the podium,
referring to presentation slides, attempting a few jokes and taking
occasional questions from his students.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, things were not always as they seemed. Sometimes the
lecturer was not Landweber at all, but a professor in Japan named
Jun Murai who was projected, larger than life, on a video screen at
the front of the room. At other times, the students answering
questions about technical aspects of computer networking and the
Internet were not the ones sitting in the classroom in Madison.
They were students living halfway around the world, speaking from
their seats at two universities in Japan while watching their
American peers on video screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could communicate as if we were in the same room,'' said
Landweber, who often started his classes with a greeting of ``good
morning'' in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Such interaction from a distance has been widely cited by
politicians and university administrators as the next significant
enhancement to online education. But sending constant streams of
video and audio over the Internet has always been more of a future
vision than a reality. The technological barriers, like bandwidth
requirements, have been too high. Instead, the majority of
synchronous distance-education courses have been broadcast through
cable or satellite television _ a medium that, unlike the Internet,
cannot be easily configured to enable people at multiple sites to
talk to one another.
</P>
<P>
   The course for Japanese and Wisconsin students, which ended for
Landweber's students in December, was an experiment in taking that
next step. The course was taught using high-speed Internet lines
that are part of Internet 2, a multi-university project to build a
faster Internet dedicated to research and education. By using
Internet 2 lines, video and audio streams could move between Japan
and Wisconsin at 40 megabits per second, eliminating the jerkiness
and muffled sounds that would almost certainly show up over the
regular Internet, especially across continents.
</P>
<P>
   The course also took advantage of a new Internet protocol called
IPv6, a series of technical standards designed to quicken the
transmission of video and audio to multiple locations at the same
time. Murai is a leading expert on IPv6, which Landweber expects to
be adopted soon by telecommunications networks. The current
version, IPv4, has been in use for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be able to stick a camera on your computer and from
your home be part of a multicast group,'' Landweber said.
</P>
<P>
   Until high-speed access is available to every household,
however, such experiences are largely taking place at universities.
The Japanese-Wisconsin course included graduate and undergraduate
students at the University of Wisconsin; Keio University, which is
just outside Tokyo; and the Nara Institute of Science and
Technology, near Osaka. Murai was the lead professor for the
Japanese students but lectured on six occasions to the students in
the United States. Landweber gave eight lectures to the students in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the two professors had planned to share lecture
duties as often as possible, but coordinating class times became a
real hurdle. Landweber's class met three days a week at 8:30 a.m.,
which was 11:30 p.m. in Tokyo. Murai's classes (both universities
are in the same time zone) met at 10:30 a.m., which was 7:30 p.m.
the day before in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only three of the classes required students from all
three sites to attend en masse. Instead, when Landweber lectured
the students in Japan, he invited his Wisconsin students to join
him if they wished, and he offered pizza as an incentive. When
Murai lectured the students in Wisconsin, he also encouraged his
students to stay late and participate, promising them sushi.
</P>
<P>
   Some cultural differences turned up. The American students did
not hesitate to ask questions during lectures, Landweber said,
``but the Japanese students saved their questions to the end or
asked them in private.'' He also discovered that the Japanese
students would suddenly look confused when he used colloquial
American phrases, like ``having no clue,'' so he said he had tried
to avoid them as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, seeing the classrooms over digital video showed how
similar university life could be, even among schools 6,400 miles
apart. For the first class, which has been archived with others at
www.sfc.wide.ad.jp/soi-e/contents.html, Landweber and Murai both
wore khakis. Many of the students wore T-shirts and jeans as they
sat in rows in the lecture hall, jotting notes on paper or typing
into laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Pacia Harper, one of the graduate students in Wisconsin, said
she thought that the multicampus class had gone ``surprisingly
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually realized by the third class,'' Ms. Harper said,
``that I wasn't thinking about the technology at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest technical glitch, students said, was the presence of
an echo. When a person in Wisconsin, for example, took the
microphone to say something, those words would travel to Japan and
then be broadcast back to Wisconsin. People in Wisconsin would
first hear the words as the person spoke them and then, a split
second later, in the audio that was broadcast from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very distracting to talk and hear yourself at just a
little of a delay,'' said Brandon Schwartz, a Wisconsin student. As
a temporary fix, technical assistants turned off the speakers
momentarily in the classrooms where students asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the course has ended, Landweber said, he is envisioning
broader uses for the technology. He would like to see student
members of the Association for Computing Machinery _ which has
members in many countries, including Japan _ chatting with each
other during meetings. And he would like to help biology professors
at Wisconsin collaborate on human genome projects with their
counterparts at Keio University.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the Internet is not just about going and getting files
from Web servers,'' Landweber said. ``I want to get scientists
talking to each other.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I use dowels and glue in my home workshop for building wood
cabinets and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Someone told me that there are special fluted dowels available
that will hold better for this kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   Is this true, and if so, where can I get them in small
quantities?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is true that fluted dowels will hold better than plain
ones in glued joints.
</P>
<P>
   Many hardware stores and lumber yards or home centers stock
these and sell them in short lengths, but in many cases they only
sell them in large packages.
</P>
<P>
   However, you can easily make your own out of plain dowels, and
with a lot less expense.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is use a pair of regular pliers with serrated
jaws to crimp each piece of dowel in several places along its
length (as shown in the illustration).
</P>
<P>
   Be careful when squeezing the jaws not to apply so much pressure
that you force the dowel out of round _ squeeze just hard enough to
leave a series of shallow grooves on the surface of the dowel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to replace the caulking around the top of my bathtub
where it meets the ceramic wall tile.
</P>
<P>
   However, the old caulking seems to be very hard and almost
impossible to scrape out.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any type of solvent I can use to soften or even remove
this old sealant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most caulking materials or sealant that are used along the
top of a bathtub dry to a semi-flexible material that is not that
hard to remove _ even after many years.
</P>
<P>
   However, yours could be one of the masonry-type grouts that were
sometimes used years ago. These dry hard and brittle and are not
easy to remove _ you have to chip or scrape them out with the
corner of a chisel or similar tool.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The varnished finish on my hardwood table and chairs has
developed a sticky or greasy feel that I can't seem to wash off.
</P>
<P>
   I tried various cleaners and polishes that are recommended for
use on wood furniture, but the furniture still feels sticky and
looks dirty or greasy.
</P>
<P>
   What can I use to clean this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like there are many coats of furniture polish or wax
that have built up over the years.
</P>
<P>
   You can usually clean this off and get rid of the sticky surface
by wiping down with mineral spirits (paint thinner).
</P>
<P>
   Wipe off one section at a time with a saturated rag, then
immediately wipe that section again with a clean rag. Change rags
as soon as they get dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Since these solvents are flammable make sure you observe all
proper precautions and discard the rags safely by placing them in
an outdoor metal container.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We would like to install a ceiling light over our dinette
table but there is no electric box in the ceiling at that location.
</P>
<P>
   What is the easiest and neatest way I can run wires to that
fixture without trying to fish them through the walls or ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   A. The simplest and quickest method would be to put up a swag
type lighting fixture that hangs down on a chain.
</P>
<P>
   The chain is fastened to a hook mounted in the ceiling with a
hollow wall type anchor, after which it hangs down at the desired
height.
</P>
<P>
   The electric wire coming from the fixture is then run down on
the surface of the wall and plugged into the nearest electrical
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   To hide the exposed wire you can use one of the plastic surface
wiring systems that are sold in most home centers and hardware
stores.

STORM DEATH TOLL RISES AS FRANCE CLEANS UP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As skies cleared Wednesday, the pace of the cleanup from
the past days' devastating storms quickened.
</P>
<P>
   The French government deployed 9,000 soldiers to clear trees and
deliver drinking water while crews from Germany, Belgium, Italy and
Spain arrived to help the French national electricity company
restore power to the millions of people cut off by the two
back-to-back storms that began last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the death toll from the storms, which battered the country
with gale winds of up to 125 mph, continued to rise. Officials said
that 74 people had died in France, which was hardest hit, and 49
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The state electricity company, Electricite de France, said
Wednesday that it had managed to send 40 helicopters, 5,000
vehicles and some 52,000 workers into the field.
</P>
<P>
   But the company said about one quarter of its grid had been
damaged. By Wednesday night, 1.9 million households _ nearly 5
million people _ remained without power.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-hit area in France was the southwest, which bore the
brunt of the second storm. In many towns, residents faced another
night without electricity, which in some cases also meant no heat
and no water, because the water systems depend on electric pumps.
And without electricity for power tools, many homeowners were
unable to begin dealing with broken branches and damaged roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in the 50 years of E.d.F.'s history have we seen
anything this bad,'' said Patrick Kries, a spokesman for the
electrical company.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone service was also widely affected and could get worse,
officials said. About 400,000 homes had no service and another
350,000 stood to lose their service, as back-up batteries that had
been powering exchanges ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's airports were back in working order
Wednesday, but train service remained at about 80 percent. The head
of the national railroad, Louis Gallois, said he expected service
to be virtually back to normal by the weekend. The bill for
damages, he said, would probably come to about $83.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, the winds tore up roof shingles, knocked
down chimneys and devastated forests. But in some areas the real
danger was flooding. In Calvados, 100 people had to be rescued from
flooded areas and 12 houses were completely submerged. In the
north, particularly in the Savoy region, snow clogged the roads and
avalanches were a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said that the
government was making about $16 million available to the worst hit
areas and that 60 areas would be declared disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Brittany coast, the oil spill from the tanker Erika,
which sank on Dec. 12, continued to wash up along a 250-mile
stretch of beach. The first oil had hit land late last week, and
the storms hampered clean-up efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of TotalFina, the oil company that had chartered
the decrepit tanker, publicly apologized Wednesday, pledging to
help clean up the mess, which could have devastating consequences
for the local fishing and tourist industries. He also promised to
donate a day of his salary to an environmental preservation group.
</P>
<P>
   The national weather service predicted that strong winds would
continue to sweep Corsica and the Mediterranean coast, while
freezing temperatures and snow was expected in the north.

FROM THE DRAWING BOARD TO NEW LIFE ON COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Kirk, an author and illustrator of children's
books, could hardly have seemed more content. Hunched over a desk
in his publisher's office in a refurbished 19th-century townhouse
in Greenwich Village, Kirk, 44, was carefully studying a heap of
disembodied robot limbs, heads and torsos.
</P>
<P>
   The robots belonged to a new line of toys he had created, and
Kirk, a lanky man with a boyish face, busily interchanged the shiny
plastic parts belonging to the miniature robot boy, robot dad and
robot pet dog, Sparky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like this one,'' he said as he held up a robot boy
bearing Sparky's head and the overlong arms that had better suited
the robot dad.
</P>
<P>
   Toy robots, he said, ``are a very big part of my creative
life.'' Since 1994, Kirk has published eight children's books. The
most recent, ``Nova's Ark'' (Scholastic Press/Callaway), about a
robot boy named Nova who dreams of blasting off into space, has
sold 400,000 copies since it appeared in March.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, a former toy store owner, now finds himself at the center
of an expanding universe of books, toys, games, collectibles and
soon a television series and possibly an animated, full-length
movie _ all based upon his books' characters. Nova became the
centerpiece of a holiday television advertising campaign for Target
Stores this year. ``Miss Spider's Tea Party'' (Scholastic
Press/Callaway), Kirk's most famous book, was made into a CD-ROM
game this year by Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Kirk's work apart from other visions of the future is
a combination of adult sophistication and childlike innocence. His
robots are sweet and almost cuddly, rendered in a bright, warm
palette and a design style that appears both antique and
futuristic. At the close of what might have been the last century
dominated by human brain power, Kirk's vision of a friendly,
fantastic future _ even if devoid of people _ is intriguing and
reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk's work has long been admired by computer-assisted artists
because his creations look remarkably like computer-generated
images. But they are, in fact, oil paintings done with sable
brushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call David a retro-futurist,'' said Callaway, president of
the Callaway &AMP; Kirk Co., which manages Kirk's work and publishes
his books with Scholastic.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk's fascination with robots began in the mid-1960s, while the
author was growing up in Columbus, Ohio. He met Neil Armstrong,
also from Ohio, when he visited the boy's Cub Scout den.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if they had any robots,'' Kirk recalled of the
conversation with the man who would five years later be the first
to land on the moon. ``He said that the space program had some
robotic elements. But I wanted to meet Robbie the Robot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after graduating from the Cleveland Institute of Art in
1977, Kirk lived in England on an art scholarship until, he says,
he ``sort of ran out of money and things to do.'' His older
brother, Daniel, also a children's book author and illustrator,
suggested that he join him in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There, Kirk began making wooden toys, specializing in finely
engineered figures not unlike the toy robots he had started
collecting as a boy. (Some of his wooden robots still resurface
from time to time on the Ebay online auction site.) In 1979 he
opened a toy store on Thompson Street in the SoHo section of the
city, founding two small toy companies, Ovicular and later Hoobert
Toys.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Nicholas Callaway, a children's book publisher
in New York, bought one of Kirk's Hoobert pull toys for his
daughter's first Christmas. It was a ``sneaking baby alligator,''
Callaway recalled. But what he really noticed was the elaborate
illustration on the packaging _ the little alligator underwater
with his friends. ``I thought how extraordinary of this company to
think of extending the child's fantasy from one medium into
another,'' Callaway said, ``putting the character and the toy into
a little story context.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway approached Kirk about doing a children's book. In fact,
Kirk had been casually working on the character of an appealing but
lonely arachnid called Miss Spider, inspired, he said, by his
daughter's interest in insects.
</P>
<P>
   A deal was struck, and ``Miss Spider's Tea Party'' was published
in 1994. So far, more than 3 million copies of the seven Miss
Spider books, including a new one this year, ``Little Miss
Spider,'' have been sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally didn't go out and drum things up,'' Kirk said.
``If somebody came along and says, `Hey, you look like you'd be
good at this,' I'd do it. That's how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of Kirk's creations means that his meticulously
handpainted illustrations are now reinterpreted by computer-aided
artists and technicians for the toys, games and other merchandise
based on his characters.
</P>
<P>
   His work still begins with hand-drawn sketches often done at his
home studio in King Ferry, N.Y., near Ithaca. But the pencil
sketches seldom progress beyond rough color paintings on paper that
help guide a team of computer-graphics artists to create the
backgrounds and characters using sophisticated computer-generated
imagery, known as CGI. It is a technique whose results are
increasingly turning up in magazines, on television programs and in
major films like ``Toy Story 2'' and ``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, who is not especially enamored of high technology (he
connects to the Internet at home through a 28.8-baud modem),
believes computers have made it possible to produce work closer to
his original vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always been anxious to get to that point, to give my
characters life through animation,'' Kirk said. ``I think that the
fact that it's been possible to do the imagery closer to my
original work recently made it finally possible for us to do a
CD-ROM.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the computer game, Miss Spider's Tea Party, which is
intended for children from ages 3 to 7, Kirk said he worked hard to
preserve the books' style and feeling. He also wrote all of the
game's dialogue in the same gentle, rhyming verse that
characterizes his Miss Spider books. Most of all, he wanted the
computer game to be crammed with fun things children could do,
something the printed medium could not do nearly as well as an
electronic one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It translated easily from one medium to another,'' he said of
Miss Spider's journey from the printed page to the computer screen.
``You want to make it fun to play with. That was the most important
thing. Let's give kids something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Ross, the producer for Miss Spider's Tea Party, said it
was wonderful watching Kirk work with animators. ``He would work
with people who would be actually creating his character for him on
the screen, changing things and rebuilding things,'' he said.
``David was really good at being a creative director and realizing
what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   By recasting Kirk's creations in digital imagery, Ross
explained, it is much easier to accurately place Nova, say, in a
computer-animated television commercial or on the big screen. He
calls the capacity ``extending the fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   CGI enables the making of a digital model file of the
characters. Once the model file is created, it can be used as the
template for making a character into a talking, walking figure in a
computer game or making a three-dimensional object like Kirk's new
Nova robot toys.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk and his publisher said they are now trying to use computers
to create animation that looks less like the product of a computer
for a television series they are developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, can we take this world created by David by
hand and take it into 3-D CGI and still keep the feeling of that
world?'' Callaway asked. He said the animation must have a ``warm
and wet'' look rather than CGI's typically shiny and hard-edged
look.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk said he still paints every day. He is the father of a
teen-age daughter, Violet, and said he tends to be too busy during
the early part of the day to get much work done. But when he gets
his daughter off to school and the telephone stops ringing and
people stop ``shuffling through'' his house, he begins to paint,
often not finishing until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything can spark your imagination,'' Kirk said with
a grin, ``if you are open to it.''

 `STRANGE BEAUTY:' A MONUMENT OF PHYSICS   AND RUDE PUT-DOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
 Kathleen Stein is a science writer who lives in New York.  
(DW) 
 By KATHLEEN STEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a talk at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1952,
Murray Gell-Mann made a stupid mistake. The young physicist glibly
stated that certain bizarre subatomic particles had an isospin of
1. But every theorist and his uncle knew that these particles had
an isospin, or number, of {. How could he say such a thing?
Gell-Mann concluded the presentation on autopilot, all the while
mulling over his error. Upon finishing, he added, ``By the way, a
few minutes ago I got what I think is the right answer.'' He went
on to explain that against all convention, the spin of these weird
particles might indeed be 1, not {. That could explain their
eccentric behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It was a virtuoso performance, delivered by a man who went on to
deliver many, and who is regarded as one of America's greatest
theoretical physicists. In ``Strange Beauty,'' a biography of
Gell-Mann, George Johnson recounts how ``Murray would later wonder
if the idea had been in his head all along, the result of
unconscious machinations that hadn't yet surfaced. Maybe the random
misfiring of a neuron had caused him to misspeak, jogging his brain
out of a rut and down this new avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Gell-Mann worked out the details of his mistake and
invented a quantum number to explain the oddball particles. He
would call it strangeness. Already this is vintage Gell-Mann.
Throughout the next two decades, he devised a revolutionary
ordering of subatomic particles. For this monumental ordering he
called The Eightfold Way (and other work) he received a Nobel Prize
in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Gell-Mann predicted the existence of the most basic subatomic
elements yet found and named them quarks. Characterizing the quarks
cleared the way for quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the field theory
describing the strong force binding particles together in the
atom's nucleus. QCD, in turn, helped lay the foundation for the
grand edifice of the Standard Model, the quantum field theory
combining the electroweak and strong forces. Others would arrive at
versions of each construct, but Gell-Mann bagged three of them. He
didn't do it alone but dominated in a brilliant era of physics when
theorists and experimentalists worked together and made each other
great.
</P>
<P>
   This first biography of Gell-Mann adds depth to the picture of
that era, now gone. Johnson, a contributing science writer for The
New York Times, does a masterly job of making the arcana of
particle physics available and shepherding the reader through
increasing layers of complexity. Also central to this narrative,
and what keeps the reader forging through the densest thickets, is
the drama of Gell-Mann's blazing brain. This book is a mind trip,
and one that includes its subject's skewed emotional baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Born on New York City's Lower East Side and raised under chaotic
circumstances, the boy was a walking encyclopedia, a mind stuffed
with information he had to blurt out in classrooms or anywhere
inspiration hit him. Not always an endearing trait. In high school
he solved problems in electrodynamics so fast that his knowledge
seemed inborn. A theme running through the book is that Gell-Mann's
grasp of physics was innate. Able to see to the heart of the most
tangled problem, he seems to tease out its answers without
conscious effort. A colleague described his mind as ``a searchlight
sweeping across a landscape, illuminating dark mathematical
spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   The glitch, though, is Gell-Mann's father, an eccentric
intellectual manque who changed his name, Isidore Gellmann, to
Arthur Gell-Mann not long after moving to the United States. Arthur
spouts rhetoric, fills thick notebooks with ruminations on
Einstein's theories of relativity and writes out powers of 2 all
the way to the 65th. By continually carping about his son's
writing, Arthur, it seems, may have engendered the genius' primary
weakness. Murray Gell-Mann would always suffer from terrible
writer's block. Did Arthur's overbearing personality create in his
son an inferiority complex and terror of being wrong? That too
might be inferred. Murray Gell-Mann develops into an enthusiastic,
funny, sometimes warm but often breathtakingly nasty man with
severe relationship problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, considering the intolerable clashing of egos and
Gell-Mann's routine and obnoxious put-downs, his collaborations
were enormously successful. Johnson excels in portraying theorists
working through the seemingly intractable problems of
symmetry-breaking, dispersion theory, Regge poles and so on, and
the excitement with which ideas were confirmed by experimenters
jockeying particles through accelerators at energies of up to 20
billion electron-volts. The biggest guns in physics make
appearances: Leon Lederman, Steven Weinberg, Fermi, T.D. Lee, Abdus
Salam.
</P>
<P>
   Gell-Mann spent much of his career at the California Institute
of Technology, and the most fascinating relationship portrayed here
is with Caltech's other resident genius, Richard Feynman (the Mick
Jagger of physics). Although for years the two played nonstop
dueling physics, ``twisting the tail of the cosmos,'' as they
called it, the relentless tournament of wills took its toll on the
friendship. Feynman aficionados, nonetheless, will be pleased to
add this account to their collection.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson writes in a seamless, sometimes inspired prose. But if
there is a flaw in ``Strange Beauty,'' it is the dearth of direct
word from Gell-Mann. He granted Johnson 12 hours of interviews, and
Johnson gathered many additional hours of primary oral material.
Yet one glimpses the subject obliquely, seldom experiencing a
unique Gell-Mann moment, with the physicist's showoff erudition,
comic neologisms and scathing wit. Perhaps Johnson was constrained
by Gell-Mann's legendary contempt for science writers. That this
book exists at all is a testament to the biographer's perseverance,
if not nerves of steel.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, we leave Gell-Mann, 70, now a member of the Santa Fe
Institute, a world center for the study of complex systems, seeking
answers to the cosmic mystery of how complexity arises out of
simplicity, and the designs implicit in all of nature. He is also
pondering superstring theories, which purport to unify the four
forces into a supradimensional order. Unfortunately
experimentalists cannot verify these superstrings without an
accelerator the size of a galaxy. But surely, if anyone could find
a way around this problem, it is Murray Gell-Mann.

things. It left far fewer people on welfare. It put more of them to
work. Yet here is the dawning surprise: It may end up making less
of a difference in the lives of the poor than politicians or the
public imagined. By Jason DeParle. 3,900 words.

   MCCAIN-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ ``I'm not afraid of losing,''
John McCain says, ``because I know that I'll act on principle if
I'm not afraid of losing.'' Such sentiments are hardly unfamiliar
for a senator known more on Capitol Hill for his passionate embrace
of lost causes than for signature accomplishments. But now these
Quixotic strains are at the very heart of McCain's insurgent
candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, marking him
as the anti-politician, the man of integrity for whom winning isn't
all. In the aftermath of President Clinton's lies about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent impeachment
trial, McCain and his advisers have calculated that voters are
longing for a new quality in their president. By Alison Mitchell.

Afghanistan dropped demands Thursday that India hand over $200
million and the body of a slain militant, Indian officials said.
But the five or six hijackers, thought to be Kashmiri separatists,
continued to insist that India release a jailed Muslim cleric and
35 other people that the Indian government considers terrorists.

   CUBA-BOY-HOMETOWN (Cardenas, Cuba) _ Elian Gonzalez is
everywhere and nowhere on the streets of his hometown. As if
summoning a phantom, his neighbors point to the narrow sidewalks
where he used to scamper about with his friends. They cling to his
memory almost as dearly as Elian himself held on to the inner tube
he was strapped to when a boat carrying him, his mother and several
other Cubans capsized as they tried to flee to Florida last month.
For more than a month, the 6-year-old boy has been at the center of
a tug of war and hearts that has roiled Cubans on both sides of the
Florida Straits. Since his mother died on the journey, Elian was
taken in by his father's relatives in Miami, who want him to stay
with them for a chance at a better life. But his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, and both sets of grandparents are very much alive
here in Cardenas and want the child returned, a demand that has
been echoed by thousands of Cubans in rallies throughout the island
organized by the government. By David Gonzalez.

   SOUND-ALIKE-CHARITY (Undated) _ Interested in granting the wish
of a child with a serious illness? You could give to the
Make-A-Wish Foundation or the Grant-A-Wish Foundation, which is not
the same as the Grant-A-Wish Network. Or perhaps the Children's
Wish Foundation International or Fulfill a Wish Foundation or
Wishing Well Foundation USA. Especially around the holidays, when
many people whip out checkbooks or credit cards at the last minute,
there is rampant confusion about exactly which charity has its hand
out. Some charities happily exploit the confusion, trading on the
names of better-known rivals. Others simply reap whatever comes
their way and ask few questions. And some may not be charities at
all. But as the number of registered charities tops 650,000, and
the Internet brings more and more within easy reach, the problem of
sound-alikes and look-alikes has intensified, forcing some
established charities to hire lawyers and engage in
uncharacteristic finger-pointing. By Reed Abelson.

   Y2K-WATCH _ WASHINGTON _ Rest your eyes Thursday. Tomorrow, you
may be wearing them out in front of the television. New Year's Eve
typically is a quiet news day, with reporters doing little but
reviewing the year's events and updating party stories. But this
Dec. 31 could prove to be extremely news-filled because of threats
posed worldwide by computer software flaws and terrorists. Here's a
guide for readers who want to monitor events around the globe.

   Y2K-CATAPULT _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta sculptor George Beasley hoped
he'd end the century in a blaze of glory. He would sear the night
skies of a tiny town on the north coast of Scotland with a
500-pound mass of molten iron hurled from a medieval, catapult-like
device called a ``trebuchet.'' The effect would be of a comet
brushing close to earth, symbolic of ``the end of the Iron Age, and
the beginning of a new era,'' said Beasley. But on Wednesday
morning, the sculptor's fling with fame unceremoniously came
crashing down. Three years of planning _ and 4 1/2 months of
preparation _ came to naught when the catapult was destroyed during
a final test. (Scott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Edwin Arldt had known Doris Kappler for only a
few months. But he had his eye on a 1946 Plymouth. The car lot
wanted $500 down, and that, Edwin did not have. It wasn't for lack
of working. He was a hard worker. After he came home from the
service, he used his GI benefits to go to an auto mechanic school
in Giddings, Texas. He would do that in the mornings, then work at
a John Deere dealership in the afternoon. When he left work at 6
p.m., he'd go out to the family farm and work there, sometimes
until 2 in the morning. After a few hours' sleep, he'd be back at
school. In 1949, he landed a mechanic job at an Austin car
dealership. The pay wasn't great, and all he had for the down
payment on the Plymouth was $200. He asked Doris if she had the
rest. Like him, she was from a German family in Lee County. She was
doing housework in Austin. They'd met at a dance. She gave him the
money. The car has been with them since. (Kelley, Austin

<P>
   Many do-it-yourselfers are unsure how to repair damaged corners
on wallboard. There are two types of wall corners: outside corners
that jut out into a doorway or hall and inside corners that are
recessed in the angle between two walls or a wall and the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Because they project outward, outside corners are prone to
damage from general traffic, moving or simply dragging the vacuum
cleaner about. Unfortunately, damage to a corner is usually more
than cosmetic, so you can't make the repair with a little spackle
and paint. The only solution is to cut away the old corner and
rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   You will need some basic tools for the project: a utility knife,
a metal straight edge, a ball-peen hammer, a cold chisel, a flat
prybar, aviation tin snips, a hacksaw, a Phillips head screwdriver,
both 6-inch and 8-inch taping knives, a sanding block and a few
sheets of 120-grit sandpaper. You ill also need some joint
compound, about a dozen nails or drywall screws and a metal corner
bead (this has an L-shaped cross section and is sold in 8-foot
lengths for about $2 each).
</P>
<P>
   Start by drawing two straight lines, one on each side, 2 inches
back from the corner. These lines are guides for cutting out the
damaged corner section, so they should extend a few inches past the
damage. Use the utility knife to score along these lines, then with
cold chisel and hammer chip away the old joint compound (be sure to
wear eye protection) to expose the metal corner bead underneath.
Use the hacksaw to cut the metal bead above and below the damaged
area. This cut-out section should be at least 6 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   If the bead is fastened to the corner with drywall screws, use
the Phillips screwdriver to remove them. If it is held in place
with nails, use the flat prybar and gently pry up the metal edges
to raise the nailheads. Use pliers to grip the heads and pull the
nails out.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a new piece of metal corner bead to the exact length of the
old one. It is important to measure exactly so the new section does
not overlap the existing corner bead. Use the aviation snips to cut
the new metal bead. Even with sharp snips it is difficult to cut
across the L-shaped bead. It's easier to cut in from each edge and
bend the bead back and forth until it breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Fit the new piece into place _ it must align perfectly with the
existing corner bead _ and secure it with either nails or drywall
screws. Nails have flat heads that are easier to spackle over, but
pounding them into the wall could crack some of the solid spackling
on adjacent areas. Drywall screws hold well and you can use the
screwdriver to drive them, but the screw heads may require more
joint compound to cover them.
</P>
<P>
   When the corner bead is securely in place, cover it with joint
compound. Use the 6-inch taping knife to apply the compound to both
sides of the corner. Smooth it out, then let it dry for at least 12
hours. The compound will shrink as it dries, and the surface may be
uneven. Sand it smooth with a sanding block. Apply a second coat of
joint compound with the 8-inch taping knife.
</P>
<P>
   The second layer of joint compound should be thinner, and it
should taper out to a feathered edge on the adjacent wall surfaces.
Let this coat dry thoroughly, then sand down any high spots. If
needed, you can apply a third, skim-coat of joint compound to fill
scratches or airholes. Let this coat dry, then prime and paint the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Inside corners on the other hand are relatively insulated from
bumps and bruises. Still they sometimes need repairs if the
adjacent surfaces, wall-to-wall or wall-to-ceiling, shift as the
house settles. Then gaps or cracks may open up.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need metal corner bead to make the repair. Instead,
you can use ordinary wallboard tape. Fold the tape along the center
crease to make an L- shaped piece. Apply a generous amount of
compound to both sides of the corner then gently press the tape in
place. Run the taping knife along the length of both sides to embed
the tape and smooth the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Let the compound dry, then apply more compound to one side of
the corner only. Let it dry, then apply compound to the opposite
side. Working on one side at a time will make it easier to get a
smooth surface without scratching the opposite side. Continue
applying coats of joint, feathering each coat so it blends into the
surrounding surface, on alternate sides until the tape is covered.
When the compound is thoroughly dry, sand then prime and paint it.

AMISH COMMUNITY NOT CONCERNED ABOUT Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (bl)  
 By TOM SMITH    Florence (Ala.) TimesDaily   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ETHERIDGE, Tenn. _ Daniel Gingerich has heard the doomsday
stories about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through small, wire-rimmed glasses, the 40-year-old man
shakes his head and chuckles when asked how computer failures
sparked by the so-called millennium bug could affect his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to affect us at all. Most of us don't even care
about all of that,'' he said while sitting on a wooden box near a
wood-burning stove, cracking and eating walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingerich's family is one of about 200 Amish families who live
in northern Lawrence County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't depend on electricity. We're pretty
self-sufficient,'' Gingerich said as he busied himself about his
shop where he makes furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The tools he and other Amish workers use are powered by
self-contained motors that run on fuel, said David Williams, the
owner of Amish Country Galleries and a local historian on the
Amish.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't use electricity whatsoever,'' Williams said.
``You may see electric lines running in front of an Amish home, but
you don't see any going into the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, when the ice storm hit us, we had some people
who were without electricity for 10 to 12 days. They couldn't make
it. But the Amish, they were not affected. They went about their
regular business just like any day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amish community, which was established in Etheridge in 1944,
stretches across 20 miles in the northern end of the county,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's common to see a horse-drawn buggy traveling on the
sides of U.S. 43 leading from the Amish community to Lawrenceburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go by here several times each day,'' Williams said,
looking out his store window at U.S. 43. ``They're like everyone
else, they go to town when they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingerich, who lives with his wife and five children on an
86-acre farm, said the Amish make or grow nearly everything they
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get our milk from our cows, we make butter, bread and
molasses. We grow crops and can our foods. We have to buy flour,
sugar, things like that, and we buy material, but we make our own
clothes,'' said Gingerich, who wore a handmade full-length worker's
apron over a pair of dark blue pants, a light blue shirt and a dark
vest.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Ontario, Canada, he has lived in Etheridge for 23
years. He grows vegetables and raises cattle in addition to
crafting furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amish believe a farm and the simple life is a great way
for children to grow up,'' Gingerich said.
</P>
<P>
   Their school building is a simple structure, resembling the one
Laura Ingalls and her sisters attended on the television show
``Little House on the Prairie.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls wear long, dark maroon dresses and bonnets, and boys wear
dark pants, dark vests, blue shirts and black wide-brimmed hats.
Children seem content while outside playing a simple game of tag.
</P>
<P>
   There is no fast-paced activity around the Gingerich household
or in the Amish community.
</P>
<P>
   While Gingerich is working inside his shop, one of his sons
picks up sticks in the front yard for kindling to start a fire in
the cook stove. The others are at the barn doing chores or playing
with cats.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the plain, two-story house, a kerosene lamp burns
brightly, illuminating the dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   Gingerich's wife is busy in the laundry room, which is in a
small wooden structure a few yards from the house. She washes
clothes with the help of a wringer washing machine and then hangs
them on a clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   The water she uses comes from a well.
</P>
<P>
   A windmill that pumps the water towers above the family's
white-sided house and huge red barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the windmill to get our water from the well,''
Gingerich said. ``We have a hand pump, and some have a gasoline
power pump in case there is no wind, but most of the time we rely
on the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amish community, nestled in the foothills with dirt roads
winding through pastures, resembles a scene from a Norman Rockwell
painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like it simple,'' Gingerich said. ``It's a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the picturesque setting is disturbed by an
automobile driving past the farm. More often, the only ones
traveling the roads are other Amish families in their horse-drawn
buggies.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish visit each other regularly, and hold church services
in different homes each Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good life, one we enjoy,'' Gingerich said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he and other Amish families say they are not worried
about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Y2K like this. If the people who made the computers
were smart enough to make them in the first place, they should be
smart enough to fix them now,'' he said. ``We get mail like
everyone else, and about June I started noticing we were getting a
lot of junk mail about the Y2K problem. We'd get letters asking if
we were Y2K-ready and, if not, send off for something or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it can't happen, but I think someone is
trying to scare people more than anything, and it appears to me
they're succeeding. I don't think anything will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingerich said the only Y2K-related computer failure that might
affect him would be his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might lose the $200 I have in the bank. If I do, I'll just
go back to work and earn more. It's no big deal. I'm not worried.
Why should I?
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Amish, all the money and luxuries in the world wouldn't
mean anything. The most important thing is living a good life, your
family and being a Christian. Nothing else really matters.''

WALTER J. LEVISON, 81; HELPED DESIGN `SPY SATELLITE' CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter J. Levison of Harvard, the leader of the team that
designed the first ``spy satellite'' camera for the United States,
died of complications following lung cancer surgery Monday in the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Levison was the leader of the design team at Itek Corp. that
developed the cameras for the Corona program, the United States's
first top secret ``spy satellite'' missions. The first Corona
missile was launched in 1960. The program lasted about 12 years
</P>
<P>
   The work of Mr. Levison and his colleagues remained classified
top secret until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corona marked the beginning of an explosion of intelligence
data,'' CIA Director John Deutch said at a ceremony saluting Mr.
Levison and his colleagues in 1995. Deutch said the Corona program
was ``probably instrumental in keeping us back from the nuclear
threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the Globe on June 26, 1995, Mr. Levison
said when the first Corona camera was launched, the CIA estimated
the Soviets had 3,000 ballistic missiles, but the cameras showed
``they actually had about six.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the belated recognition of his work, he said, ``I don't know
if you've ever kept secrets from your wife for 12 years. . . . I
thought I would go to my grave without ever seeing this public.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Levison was born in New York City. He earned a degree in
physics at City College of New York before serving as an aerial
photographer in the Army Air Corps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was called to active duty by the Air Force during the Korean
War, when he was an optical engineer at Boston University Physical
Research Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   After the Korean War, he became affiliated with Itek Corp.,
where he also worked on the Viking I camera that beamed back the
first pictures of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Itek in the mid-1970s, he was a founder of the
Aegis Venture Fund, a venture capital firm specializing in
high-tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Anne (Simons); two daughters, Libby of
Harvard, Mass. and Jenny of Portland, Ore.; and a brother, Ned of
Fort Lee, N.J.

 &HT;    Some fundamentalist Christians look to the book of Revelation,
and say Jesus is coming soon.
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida _ A few weeks ago, Steve Ballard heard
something that troubled him: A Palm Beach County company had bought
the patent to a dime-sized computer chip that can be implanted
under the skin. Now, people could be tracked by a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard didn't think of the Alzheimer's patients who would be
found if they are lost. Nor did he marvel at the potential to store
medical information and perhaps save lives.
</P>
<P>
   He understood it as the work of the devil. Another sign that the
Apocalypse is upon us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mark of the beast,'' said Ballard, a Port St. Lucie
software salesman. ``I mean, it can't get a whole lot more obvious
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who read the Bible literally, Ballard's observation
makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   In the book of Revelation, John wrote that in the end times the
devil will mark nonbelievers with his sign. Those who do not have
the mark will be unable to buy or sell goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   According to an end-times newsletter Ballard reads, the chip
will eventually be implanted in the back of people's hands and will
include financial information. Instead of paying for groceries with
a bank card, people will one day pass their hand over a scanner and
have the money debited from their account.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing to me isn't that it's happening,'' said
Ballard, who described himself as ``your Joe Average Christian.''
``It's that it's happening right here, in Palm Beach, in a
democratic country. What a wondrous time to be here and see the
Bible unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are tempted to dismiss Ballard as an alienated member of
the far-flung religious fringe, consider this: A 1997 Associated
Press poll concluded that one out of every four Christian adults _
more than 26 million Americans _ believe that Jesus Christ will
come back to earth during their lifetimes. Almost 40 percent
believe he will arrive before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The Apocalypse as preached in sermons is nothing new, but its
force has saturated a far wider audience. Dozens of movies and
songs that address the subject have found their way to mainstream
movie screens and radio stations. And the Left Behind series _ a
takeoff on the book of Revelation set during the Apocalypse when
believers rise to heaven and the world is left with a series of
disasters, plagues and dictatorships _ has sold 8 million copies
since 1995 and become the first explicitly Christian series to
crack The New York Times bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Wade of Bethel Temple in Lake Worth says he
believes society is finally waking up and that the signs of the
Apocalypse have become too obvious to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Bible passages as his source
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, Wade opens his Bible. Before the end there
will be false messiahs, wars and rumors of wars, plagues, famines,
earthquakes, the Children of Israel will return to their home and
the Gospel will be preached throughout all the world. According to
Wade, one need look no farther than the newspaper to see the
fulfillment of these prophecies: Jim Jones, the Cold War, AIDS and
Ebola, earthquakes in Turkey, the creation of the State of Israel
and the Internet and satellite television that is beaming the
Gospel into every country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not coincidence,'' Wade says. ``This is God's hand at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade does not profess to know when doomsday will arrive for the
unsaved _ no man knows that, he says _ but he is taking seriously
the turn of the millennium. And he is not the first _ or only _
one.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred and fifty years ago, an Irish archbishop named
James Usher took it upon himself to figure out when the world
began. Using the genealogy in the Bible, Usher traced back the
family of man to Adam and Eve. He concluded that the world began in
4004 B.C. (He actually narrowed it down to noon of October 23 of
that year).
</P>
<P>
   Such a specific date may seem a little kooky to a culture that
has been schooled in evolution and taught that the earth is four
billion years old. But that date has been accepted in the Western
church for centuries, and among the 100 million Americans who
believe the earth is less than 10,000 years old, Usher's arithmetic
is still respected.
</P>
<P>
   So what does this have to do with the year 2000? That depends on
whom you ask. There are hundreds of predictions for when and how
the world will end that incorporate dozens of prophesies in the
Bible, but one popular with ``millennialists'' today is supported
by the Epistle of Peter.
</P>
<P>
   In Peter it says: ``With the Lord, a day is as a thousand years
and a thousand years is as a day.'' Just as the earth was created
in six days, and the Lord rested on the seventh, there has now been
six thousand years since the world was created, these Bible
literalists argue. The seventh day will be a day of rest. So what
we can look forward to as we enter the earth's seventh millennium
is 1,000 years of rest.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bible also tells us that before that rest come the
prophecies of the book of Revelation: Christ and the Anti-Christ
will do battle on the field of Armageddon, the world will endure
terrible devastation and at the end of that time Jesus will judge
all the people on the earth. Then _ and only then _ will this
seventh day of peace arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there have been apocalyptic predictions at every
juncture in history at least since Christ does not deter would-be
prophets.
</P>
<P>
   William Miller's predictions
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers have made convincing arguments for centuries. Take
William Miller, an uneducated farmer from New York who threw
thousands of Americans into a panic in the mid-19th century.
Burdened by guilt after what he considered his unchristian behavior
during the War of 1812, Miller set about to find truth in the
Bible. For two years he studied the writings of the prophets. He
became particularly engrossed in the book of Daniel, where it
states that ``unto 2,300 days, then shall the sanctuary be
cleansed.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller made several assumptions: To him the sanctuary was the
earth and the cleansing was the Apocalypse. And in God's time _ as
it says in Revelation _ a day is a year.
</P>
<P>
   Miller further figured that the day the clock started to tick
was the beginning of the reconstruction of the earthly Jewish
sanctuary, the Temple in Jerusalem, which began in 457 B.C. Miller
then added 2,300 to minus 457 and came to the conclusion that the
end of the world was coming in 1843.
</P>
<P>
   At first Miller didn't tell anybody, but eventually he confided
in a few preachers and word spread. For 25 years he spoke about his
findings. As 1843 drew close, panic spread. Thousands of
``Millerites'' quit their jobs, gave away their possessions and
prepared for the end.
</P>
<P>
   By 1844 the entire episode had been dubbed by the popular press
as ``The Great Disappointment.'' It wasn't the last.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century later, Edgar Whisenant published ``88
Reasons Why the Rapture Will Be in 1988.'' The publication was
reprinted more than 2 million times right up until the day the
predicted apocalypse came and went.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket engineer with a difference
</P>
<P>
   Whisenant, a NASA rocket engineer, offered another
numerologically based rationale to predict the end, which he
believed would occur between September 11 and 13, 1988. That's when
Christ would remove his followers before a seven-year period of
disaster. The disaster would be ushered in when the Soviet Union
invaded Israel and began World War III.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenant's rationale went like this: In the book of Matthew the
end is predicted to come after the fig tree _ following a long
hibernation _ puts forth a new leaf. After this new leaf buds, a
generation will not pass before the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Biblically, the fig tree is often a metaphor for Israel.
Whisenant reasoned that since Israel was reestablished in 1948, and
a generation, by his reckoning was 40 years, the end would come in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenant listed 87 additional reasons. When 1988 came and went
he published The Final Shout Rapture Report: 1989, in which he
explained his slight miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Lindsey is perhaps the best known predictor of end times.
His book, The Late Great Planet Earth, sold 28 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey predicted that nuclear war would destroy the planet by
the late 1980s. First, an African-Arab army would invade Israel.
Then Russia would invade from the north to take over the oil
fields. And finally a European alliance would nuke the whole region
and Russia as well. This would lead to two superpowers, China and
the West. Both sides would converge on the Holy Land unleashing a
final Armageddon of nuclear war after which, when all seemed lost,
Christ would appear and set up his paradise on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s have come and gone, an updated version of
Lindsey's book has been published predicting Jesus will come in
2007.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist's counterargument
</P>
<P>
   These predictions are the desperate workings of weak minds, says
George Elder, a Jungian psychotherapist and editor of Archetype of
the Apocalypse, a Jungian Study of the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Elder understands the book of Revelation to be a metaphor for
the transition from a religion-based understanding of the universe
to a psychological-based understanding. The book of Revelation as
Elder reads it predicts that humankind will eventually reach an
epiphany that will lead to the shaking off of a primitive
perspective on the world and open their minds to a more enlightened
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But Elder warns that not everyone will be able to accept this
transition. The ``weakest'' members of society will try to hold
fast to the old ways of thinking and ``may try to act out
destructively rather than destroy their own world view,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wade calls that perspective bunk. ``Yes, there are
symbols within the Bible, but Revelation is going to happen,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   How is he so sure? ``I know the author personally.''

&HT;     RUSSIANS SAY NYET TO POSSIBLE Y2K NUCLEAR LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ The head of a Russian military team
joining a similar U.S. group here to prevent the ultimate Y2K
disaster _ an accidental nuclear missile launch triggered by
Moscow's aging early-warning radars _ said Wednesday he expects a
trouble-free New Year's transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our warning systems and strategic missiles systems are
ready to meet the Y2K problem,'' said Col. Sergey Kaplin, an air
force officer who is also a member of Russia's strategic rocket
forces. ``We have done much research and we are really sure,
believe us, that no problems will occur,'' he said through an
interpreter here at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplin is leading some 20 Russians who have come here to work
with a similar number of U.S. troops seeking to guard against a
nightmare scenario during the so-called New Year rollover. In the
worst case, Russian military computers might fail, mistakenly
indicating that the United States has launched missiles. That
perception could prove deadly because Russian policy calls for
launching a counter-strike if Moscow believes it is under nuclear
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplin's comments echoed the view of Col. Gen. Vladimir
Yakovlev, the head of Russia's strategic forces, who expressed
confidence Tuesday in Moscow that any computer problems will be
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 (Y2K) problem refers to the possibility that
computers programmed to read only the last two digits of a year
might interpret the year 2000 as 1900 and malfunction or crash.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early-warning
defense equipment, and officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a missile launch is extremely remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery public and further cut the risk of a
Y2K accident, the two nuclear powers have set up a joint command
center here at Peterson Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the post, dubbed the Center for Year 2000
Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against the
United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that U.S.
missiles aren't attacking Russia, if that's what the old Soviet-era
military computers are incorrectly indicating because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and U.S. military personnel at the center will be
watching data on computer screens collected from a network of
radars and satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain
Operations Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's
superpower standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the
headquarters of U.S. efforts to detect Soviet missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian officers, who have been training at the
center for the past week, will begin round-the-clock operations at
8 a.m. mountain time Thursday. Each crew will include two American
and two Russian operators, an interpreter and a senior officer for
each side. The crews will work eight-hour shifts into mid-January,
when military officials believe that the threat from any Y2K
glitches will have passed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplin said that training at the U.S. center has gone smoothly.
``We are assured that all our crews are ready to fulfill their
mission,'' he said, adding that Russian and U.S. officers ``are
getting along like peas in a pod.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy Capt. Michael Luginbuhl, the senior U.S. officer
assigned to the center, agreed that the two sides are working well
together. He said that at their final training session Wednesday,
they had set aside two hours to discuss any problems or
misunderstandings. ``The meeting lasted all of 10 or 15 minutes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem that was averted was the issue of trust
since Moscow and Washington have a long history of mutual
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had any problems with trust on either side,''
Luginbuhl said at the news conference. ``We've all come to the
agreement that it is absolutely in the mutual benefit of both of

   Some U.S. defense experts contend that even without Y2K
problems, Moscow's nuclear forces are unstable because of years of
economic neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic rocket forces have ``already passed the threshold
of becoming unsafe,'' according to Bruce Blair, a leading American
expert on Russian nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our secretary of defense applied our own standards of
safety in personnel reliability to the Russia force, he would
de-certify that force,'' said Blair, a scholar with the nonpartisan
Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.

THOMAS F. LAMBERT, 85; TORT EXPERT, LAWYERS' ASSOCIATION EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thomas F. Lambert Jr., an expert on tort law who was
editor-in-chief of the American Trial Lawyers Association for more
than 40 years, died Wednesday in his home on Beacon Hill. He was
85.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader described Mr. Lambert as the
``princely philosopher of torts,'' who ``had almost total recall''
and could cite case histories, name the litigators of landmark
cases and the judges who heard them.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said Mr. Lambert as a ``brilliant orator'' whose speeches
``were like listening to a symphony.'' He said he sprinkled his
lectures with ``nuggets of information'' and lively aphorisms like
the old chestnut, ``better to have a fence at the top of a cliff
than an ambulance at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   He said lawyers were ``practically required to attend his
lectures at conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lambert was born in Detroit and raised in California. He
graduated from UCLA and earned a degree in jurisprudence at Oxford
College, where he studied as a Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   After helping prepare cases against Nazi war criminals presented
in Nuremberg following World War II, he taught at Boston University
School of law for nine years and Suffolk University for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   At Nuremberg, Mr. Lambert prepared the US trial brief and trial
address against the leadership corps of the Nazi party and prepared
and presented the US trial address against Martin Bormann.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of 23 legal books.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Elizabeth (Branon); a sister, Margaret
Teagle, and a brother, Owen, both of California.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's a bit like giving away the end of the movie, but
the British Museum has scheduled its new exhibition on the
Apocalypse to run through April 24, which suggests that the
venerable institution does not expect fire and brimstone to strike
this weekend. On the other hand, the show's full title does leave
things open: ``The Apocalypse and the Shape of Things to Come.''
Perhaps it's just a matter of getting the date right.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly getting the date right has long been an obsession
among modern prophets of doom who search for clues in the final
book of the New Testament, the Revelation of St. John the Divine,
which is also known as the Apocalypse. And since St. John talks
about one thousand years here and one thousand years there, the
arrival of the year 2000 was deemed a good enough pretext for the
exhibition, even if its objective was not to make premonitions.
</P>
<P>
   Every generation has embraced some degree of apocalypticism.
Doomsday cults have a special affection for dates, like those
hidden in mystical texts or astrological calendars. But even when
dates are not significant, evidence of an impending cataclysm has
been found in everything from the Protestant Reformation, England's
civil war and the French Revolution to this century's world wars,
the atomic age and, most recently, the specter of environmental
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that St. John had any of this in mind when he was
writing the Book of Revelation on the Greek island of Patmos around
A.D. 90, not least because its original Greek title, Apokalipsis,
means ``unveiling'' and  &UR; not &LR;  the end of the world. Rather, he
seemed to be reassuring early Christians that their persecutors
would be punished. The beast destroyed in the Battle of Armageddon
is now thought to be Rome's self-proclaimed god-emperor, Domitian.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, until this century artists have invariably
interpreted the Book of Revelation literally, illustrating St.
John's complex metaphors as he described them, from the four
horsemen of the Apocalypse to the seven-headed and 10-horned beast.
Thus, just as artists created the images that to this day represent
many of the stories of the Old and New Testaments, they also played
a crucial role in giving the word Apokalipsis a new, more
terrifying meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The British Museum's exhibition, which is accompanied by a
weighty catalog analyzing the ebbs and flows of apocalypticism,
examines this pictorial tradition from the 11th century to the end
of World War II through illuminated manuscripts, books, prints,
drawings and movie stills. Somewhat bizarrely, in an adjoining room
the museum has added ``Atomic Apocalypse,'' a installation of
papier-mache skeletal figures made for the Day of the Dead in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of God's punishing the world with assorted disasters
predates Christianity, and it is presumed that early Christians
exposed to the Book of Revelation would also be familiar with the
apocalyptic references in, say, the Book of Daniel, written in 165
B.C. Furthermore, the construction of the New Jerusalem foreseen by
St. John echoes the prophecies of Isaiah, Ezekiel and others. Once
the Apocalypse acquired a visual element in early manuscripts,
however, it was clearly linked to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian art thus reinforced Christian dogma,'' writes
Jonathan Alexander of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York
University in a catalog essay. ``The familiarity of images was part
of their power, and their repetition in easily recognizable forms
was therefore essential. The pictorial content and to a notable
degree the formal aspects of Christian imagery were in this way
controlled and restricted.''
</P>
<P>
   Medieval illuminated manuscripts show the appeal of the image of
the horsemen, which suggests association with the crusading
knights, themselves engaged in trying to create a new, non-Islamic
Jerusalem. St. John was in turn precise in his description of the
person, presumed to be God, who instructed him to write to seven
Christian churches: he wore a long robe, his hair was white, his
eyes blazed, he held seven stars in his right hand ``and a sharp
two-edged sword came out of his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation's constant references to numbers _ the four corners
of the earth (Assyria, Persia, Macedonia and Rome), the seven seals
opened by the Lamb, the 24 elders sitting around the throne of God,
the infamous 666 marked on foreheads of followers of the beast _
also helped artists give an impression of accuracy, although the
meaning of these numbers was not explained. More immediately
recognizable are the devil's black angels, with horns and wings,
seen going down in defeat in a 13th-century manuscript known as the
Burckhardt-Wildt Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By then the Book of Revelation was playing a central role in the
Christian canon. Frances Carey, a curator at the British Museum who
organized the exhibition, writes: ``By the mid-13th century,
Apocalypse manuscripts had become a luxury item, associated with
courtly status of certain secular patrons, including women in the
Anglo-Norman society. It was probably a woman who commissioned the
volume of exceptional magnificence known as the Trinity Apocalypse,
after the Cambridge college where it has been since 1660.''
</P>
<P>
   The invention of printing in the 15th century would
revolutionize the written word, but it also widened the audience
for religious woodcuts. In 1498, when Albrecht Durer completed his
woodcut edition of ``Apocalypse,'' comprising 15 scenes from the
Book of Revelation, copies were soon circulated. And more than
anything before or since, Durer's powerful images came to define
how the Apocalypse would be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   The series, presented in the exhibition, starts with ``St.
John's Vision of the Seven Candlesticks'' and includes such famous
images as ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' and ``The Four
Angels of Death.'' It climaxes with ``The Angel With the Key of the
Bottomless Pit and the Vision of the New Jerusalem.'' Durer's
visual interpretation of Revelation was repeatedly borrowed by
16th- and 17th-century artists, among them Lucas Cranach the Elder.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also includes series dedicated to the Apocalypse
by other Northern European artists of the 16th century like Hans
Burgkmair the Elder, Georg Lemberger, Matthias Gerung, Gerhard van
Groeningen and the French engraver Jean Duvet. This fascination
with the Apocalypse reflected the battle between leaders of the
Reformation and Rome for control over the images illustrating the
Book of Revelation, with both the pope and Martin Luther portrayed
by their respective enemies as the Antichrist (the word Antichrist
does not appear in Revelation, but from the Middle Ages it was
presumed to be the true identity of the beast).
</P>
<P>
   In 17th-century Britain, Antichrist became an all-purpose
insult, notes David Bindman, an art historian at University College
in London, in the catalog. ``Rulers such as Oliver Cromwell,
especially in his later years when he failed to fulfill the hopes
of radicals, Roman Catholic monarchs, the pope, Anglican bishops,
merchants and judges, could be perceived as agents of, or indeed be
themselves, Antichrist,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   While the goal was to turn believers against these assorted
``Antichrists,'' the exhibition shows how images of the Apocalypse
were also useful to 17th-century British cartoonists, who could
count on the public's familiarity with, say, the multiheaded beast
and the horseman of death. ``In satire, the dragon, the beast, the
whore of Babylon and Antichrist could merge, separate, reveal
themselves coyly or be interchangeable,'' Bindman notes.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake, England's best known artist of the Apocalypse,
did not have satire in mind when he illustrated the Book of
Revelation in pen and watercolor in the early 1800s. His 1808
``Vision of the Last Judgment'' is evidently inspired by
Michelangelo, but today the swirling forms of his apocalyptic
images seem closer to Surrealist works than to those of Durer. As
Odilon Redon's lithographic albums in this exhibition confirm,
19th-century Romantics were generally more taken with dramatizing
the Apocalypse than with mocking it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with World War I, artists finally confronted the
unimaginable and the Apocalypse assumed a more immediate visual
form, often with no reference to Revelation. Ludwig Meidner, George
Grosz, Max Beckmann and, most fiercely, Otto Dix all conveyed the
deep pessimism awakened by the horrific trench warfare of the Somme
and Verdun.
</P>
<P>
   And with the arrival of World War, II the specter of the
Apocalypse returned. Frans Masereel called his wartime series of 25
drawings ``The Apocalypse of Our Time''; in 1943 Benton Spruance
made a lithograph called ``Riders of the Apocalypse''; in 1945
Edouard Goerg published 20 lithographs in a series named ``The
Apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Mexican ``Atomic Apocalypse'' work, the
exhibition does not dwell on the second half of the 20th century,
avoiding the millenarian speculation awakened by the impending 21st
century. Yet its overview does demonstrate how profoundly
apocalypticism has shaped the Christian notion of a permanent
battle between good and evil which, without divine intervention,
will inevitably be lost to evil. For true believers, the end may
not be nigh, but it cannot be discounted.

<P>
   Dear Readers:
</P>
<P>
   Each week for nine years, I have written to you in this space.
</P>
<P>
   But today is my final column.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen me through two pregnancies, several jobs and a move.
Through my children's colic and teething and temper tantrums and
first day of kindergarten. I was 27 when I began writing to you,
and I will be 37 in the new year. That's quite a panoramic view.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, you've sent hundreds of letters, most so kind
and heartfelt that I will keep them always. The best compliment I
ever received was from the reader who said, ``If my husband throws
the paper away before I read it, I will dig it out of the garbage
on only one day _ Wednesday _ to read your column.'' And then,
there were the letters that kept me modest.
</P>
<P>
   But what a delight, to have a weekly forum with people I have
never met. A grandmotherly woman once came up to me in a restaurant
and said, ``Mary, dear, I love your writing about your children,
but I just need to give you just a word of advice: Relax.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to reassure her that I wasn't nearly as neurotic as I
sounded in the echo chamber of my writings. I don't wear my
innermost fears about mothering around in my everyday world like
some elaborate, fragile sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, I do what every other parent does: try my best, worry a
little and just concentrate on getting through the day. With young
children, I've found, it's not easy to live the examined life.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, that's just what this column has given me: the chance
to reflect on what kind of parent I am, and what kind of parent I
would like to be.
</P>
<P>
   We write to experience life twice, wrote Anais Nin, in the
moment, and in retrospection.
</P>
<P>
   As long as I have been a parent, I have been a parenting
columnist. It was an unexpected gift. To me, my husband, my
parents, but most of all, to my children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a good story,'' Adam said the other night, as I
was telling him about something funny that he did when he was a
toddler. ``You should write that down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did write it down,'' I told him. ``I wrote a column about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't say I won't miss being a columnist: this built-in excuse
I have to read the latest literature on parenting and
child-raising, to interview national experts on family life, to
save personal anecdotes on scraps of paper and see every calamity
with my own two children as potential column fodder.
</P>
<P>
   But it's time. The new year is bringing a job change and a
chance to reinvent myself. I'm taking it.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a friend sent some of my columns to an
expatriate she knew in London. After he read them over a dark ale
in a neighborhood pub, he sent a note back: ``What a luxury, to be
able to write a letter to your readers each week.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Writing to you for nearly a decade has been a pleasure and a
rare privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the novel ``Mansfield Park'' Sir Thomas Bertram is a
dignified and stalwart aristocrat, a man very much of his time, the
early 19th century. For that reason, when casting a film version of
the Jane Austen classic, a director might not readily think of
Harold Pinter for the role. Although Pinter is an actor as well as
a playwright, he has specialized in playing contemporary characters
with an air of menace, most of them, he said in a recent interview,
``written by H. Pinter.''
</P>
<P>
   But there he is on the screen, larger than life, in costume, as
Bertram, the paterfamilias of Mansfield Park in Patricia Rozema's
new film. Sir Thomas is Pinter's longest film role, and one that he
assumes with assurance.
</P>
<P>
   In her freely interpretive adaptation, Ms. Rozema, who is both
the screenwriter and the director, has made the protagonist, Fanny
Price, a more assertive character, someone who closely resembles
the author. She has also turned Sir Thomas into a more complex and
contradictory figure than he is in the book, stressing, among other
things, his dubious business activities as a slave trader in the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if playing the character posed any moral question for him
as an advocate of civil and individual freedom, Pinter brushed off
such concerns as irrelevant. ``It doesn't mean I approve of slave
traders,'' he said. ``In the last film that I did, `Mojo,' I was an
absolute killer. Whatever else, I don't go around killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   On a windy London day Pinter had a cold and coincidentally was
having lunch at the Pharmacy, a trendy Notting Hill restaurant
partly owned by the artist Damien Hirst. Hirst had decorated the
restaurant's windowed entrance with a display of diverse drug
products (including cold remedies). The restaurant is a few streets
away from the playwright's home and he regards it as his local.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the pharmaceuticals, he opted for champagne followed by
white wine. Despite feeling under the weather he was in a salutary
mood, pleased with Ms. Rozema's film and his contribution to it and
with other aspects of his flourishing career. Pinter is, in fact,
on the verge of a highly productive 70th year. He has written a new
play, ``Celebration,'' which he plans to direct in March at the
Almeida Theater here. His unproduced 1972 screenplay of
``Remembrance of Things Past'' is to reach the stage next season at
the Royal National Theater in an adaptation by Pinter and the
director Di Trevis.
</P>
<P>
   In June there will be a convergence in London of members of the
Pinter Society and the Pinter Review for a conference honoring the
playwright. In celebration of Pinter's birthday in October, Michael
Gambon is to star in a West End revival of ``The Caretaker,''
directed by Patrick Marber.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment Pinter's mind was very much on the new movie.
Bertram is, he said, a man with a double life, ``a perfectly decent
man,'' except for his profession. He added quickly that the
profession is never discussed in the novel and would not have been
discussed in that society. On the other hand, he said that it was
justifiable for the film's director to move Bertram's background
into the foreground and to draw a parallel between slavery and the
repressive attitude toward women in Austen's time.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, he said, ``brings out what's under the table,''
which, in a very different context, is something that might also be
said about Pinter plays. ``If Jane Austen had been alive now,'' he
said, ``I'm sure she would have given Patricia Rozema the green
light. It's finally a question of emphasis. It's all there in the
book really, as it was in the life and the society of the time.
Patricia is not fantasizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his published lecture on ``Mansfield Park,'' Vladimir Nabokov
repeatedly refers to Bertram as ``heavy,'' in an emotional as well
as a physical sense. When that was mentioned to Pinter, he did not
shy from the description but said that as a male authority figure
the character was burdened with responsibilities. For Austen, he is
a man of ``principle as well as power,'' he said. Although he has a
natural reserve, Sir Thomas is deeply concerned about the future of
his four children and of his niece, Fanny, who comes to live with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Pinter said that he admired Ms. Rozema for ``refusing to accept
anything even minutely less then what she wanted.'' There was, he
said, one brief disagreement between them during the making of the
film. In a crucial scene, Sir Thomas chastises Fanny (Frances
O'Connor) for rejecting a proposal of marriage from a rich suitor.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie the camera swirls around the two people, turning
the sequence into a dramatic pas de deux. When the scene was
filmed, Pinter acted with his customary intensity, but afterward
Ms. Rozema told him that the acting was ``too much,'' and reshot
the encounter. Then the director looked at both takes and decided
that Pinter's version was the better one.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The conversation shifted to the subject of his new play. Last
May he wrote several scenes, then felt blocked. ``It wouldn't
move,'' he said. ``So I put it on the shelf.'' In August he and his
wife, Lady Antonia Fraser, were on vacation in the house they rent
in Dorset. He tried to take up the play again, with no success, and
was prepared to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   Then one evening, when Pinter's eldest stepson and his wife were
visiting, his wife suggested that he read the opening pages aloud.
With some reluctance, he complied. With the first lines his
audience began laughing and never stopped; the author was startled
by the response, and on a wave of enthusiasm returned to his study.
``It was like the waters broke,'' he said. ``I raced away,'' and
within several days he had finished the play.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has its serious subtext, ``Celebration'' is a case
of the author in an antic mood, a change from the darkness of his
last two plays, ``Moonlight'' and ``Ashes to Ashes.'' When the play
was finished, as always, he sent copies to a list of friends, one
of whom wrote that he had fully expected him to write a play called
``Retribution'' rather than one called ``Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   The play takes place in a restaurant where several couples
collide over dinner and a waiter intrudes with fanciful memories of
his grandfather who supposedly knew everyone from T.S. Eliot to
Elisha Cook Jr. The play began with the fact that Pinter frequently
eats in restaurants. He made clear that he never writes down what
he overhears, but when he dines out ``things hit you from all over
the place, including laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to trace the genesis of the play, he remembered that when
he was 21, as an unemployed actor he worked very briefly as a
busboy in a private club. One day he overheard two diners talking
about Kafka, and he interrupted the conversation to correct them
about the date of one of Kafka's books. ``When I got back in the
kitchen,'' he said, ``I was fired, straight away'' for disobeying
the edict that ``you don't talk to the customers.'' In
``Celebration'' no one corrects the waiter, who is allowed to amble
through history with his Zelig-like grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   In performance ``Celebration'' should run about 45 minutes.
Although he had been adamant that his last short play, ``Ashes to
Ashes,'' be staged individually, he felt that the new work could
have a theatrical partner. His wife suggested that he pair it with
``The Room,'' his first play, written in 1947 and seldom performed
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Room'' had been written at the suggestion of his friend
Henry Woolf, who was teaching at Bristol University when Pinter was
acting with a touring repertory company. The play, finished under a
self-imposed deadline, transformed the actor into a playwright.
Woolf had acted in the original Bristol production, and at the
author's invitation he will return to his role in the London
revival in a cast headed by Lindsay Duncan and Lia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In both plays food is served. ``In `The Room,' it's bacon and
eggs,'' Pinter said. ``In `Celebration,' it's osso buco and other
dishes. The other thing they have in common is violence. The
language itself is violent and in `The Room' there's actual
physical violence.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke it occurred to him that there was also a connection
between ``Celebration'' and ``Mansfield Park,'' in that both deal
with the subject of money, irrevocably linked with power: ``The
quite simple assumption on the part of the rich that they run the
world, it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   The lunch was almost at an end and the question of politics had
still not been on the table, unusual in a conversation with Pinter.
Then the millennium was mentioned, and the playwright said, ``When
I look forward to the next century, I see very very dark clouds
clustering on the horizon.'' He quickly offered his views on gun
control, capital punishment and the repressions of the Turkish
government.
</P>
<P>
   Then he switched to England, and with a smile said, ``I'm not
totally wild about Blair and Blair's not totally wild about me.''
He almost sang those words about the prime minister, reinforcing
the image of a more jovial Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how it felt to be dressed in period clothes for
``Mansfield Park,'' he said that as a young actor he was often in
costume, especially when playing Shakespeare. ``I know a hawk from
a handsaw,'' he said, ``and a costume from a pair of jeans. I like
my cloak.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There's a certain extra excitement at the Steppenwolf
Theater, where stage and film actor John Malkovich is directing the
first American production of Terry Johnson's ``Hysteria,'' the play
about Sigmund Freud that created such a furor in London at the
Royal Court in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich's production comes at perhaps the high point of his
26-year career. Last fall he entered the select circle of actors
who have had films named after them; ``Being John Malkovich'' has
been a critical and box office success. A few weeks later he turned
in a steely performance as the screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz in
HBO's ``RKO 281,'' the story behind Orson Welles' ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Malkovich has made a deeply personal commitment to
``Hysteria,'' a highly farcical yet feeling tribute to the founder
of psychoanalysis. Set in 1939 at 20 Maresfield Gardens, the house
in Hampstead where Freud lived in exile after Hitler's Anschluss,
the play depicts a disoriented man diminished by the cancer of the
jaw he battled for 16 years. He asks his daughter, Anna, ``What
happened to my patient?'' She replies: ``Papa, it is 5 in the
morning. You have no patients now.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a startlingly unfamiliar Freud, not the fiery-eyed
patriarch, but a flustered, unsettled and unsettling figure _ yet
at the same time, winsome and uproariously funny.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is relentless. A young woman pounds on the garden door.
``Leave me alone,'' Freud shouts. She puts a razor to her wrist.
She has come to set the record straight: Freud claimed to have
cured her mother, but Jessica says she knows the truth, that her
mother died in an insane asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of such accusations, Freud insists that she leave at once.
But in a coup de theatre, she strips naked and plants herself in
the center of the room. Freud, mortified, shoves her into the
nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich, sitting in a quiet corner of the Steppenwolf's
Mainstage theater, is an intense presence without being
self-dramatizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw `Hysteria' in London,'' Malkovich recalled. ``I liked it
very much. What struck me after reading it _ which didn't come
through at the Royal Court _ is that there are no characters here,
the characters are all parts of Freud himself, parts of the dream
he had on the final night of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freud's motive for letting Jessica in is to have one final
`go,' one final exploration, to read the hieroglyphics, to decipher
truth from fallacy, truth from fiction, truth from emotional
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich said that Jessica represented Freud's feminine side
and that a flamboyant, foppish Salvador Dali, another character in
the play, represented his narcissistic side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Yahuda, on the other hand, is the play's one censorious
character; let us say he is Freud's superego,'' he said. ``That's
why Freud is afraid of him.'' Yet in the end it is Dr. Yahuda who
relieves Freud of his agonizing pain: an injection of morphine
brings on an easy death.
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich said that his seven years of analysis also drew him to
``Hysteria,'' and made him more comfortable with himself and
fearless in his defense of Freud. He has dedicated this production
to his analyst, Dr. Kenneth House of Los Angeles. ``I've read
criticism of psychoanalysis that says it is unscientific, but what
really is science?'' Malkovich asked, adding that Freud had
invented not so much a new science as a new language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freud's monumental contribution with the farcical elements of
the play was treacherous, theatrically treacherous'' he said. ``I'm
a lot like Dali, the character I identify with most, particularly
when he says the world is a whore.''
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich reflected on what he contends is a lack of values in
the United States, on the exaltation of the dollar over lyricism
and sorrow. ``I try to live with it; often I like the things I
do,'' he said. He added that sometimes he took acting jobs just for
the money, since one's film work is often ``butchered.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Illinois State University in 1976,
Malkovich came to Chicago, where he met Gary Sinise, Terry Kinney
and Jeff Perry, the founders of Steppenwolf, in 1974. Twenty-four
seasons later, he said, the theater is still committed to the
principles of ``ensemble collaboration and artistic risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steppenwolf is a collective,'' Malkovich said. ``Our premise
is to feel what people really feel. It doesn't require Stanislavski
or the Lee Strasberg stuff, the replacing a memory of how you felt
when your dog got run over when you were eight. That's an insult to
one's intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to films, Malkovich continued: ``They say the camera
doesn't lie, and I say the camera is a lie. The funny thing is that
I'm right and they're wrong. But you can't lie in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had started directing early in his career. ``I
wouldn't say I have any one style,'' he said. ``I never try for a
style of acting either. When I played Mitch Leary, the psychopath,
in `In the Line of Fire,' I didn't do research. Usually, I'd rather
make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rehearsals for ``Hysteria,'' Malkovich was clearly
focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this to hit bottom emotionally, to make it much sadder
than it was in London,'' he said. ``Freud has to be very
sympathetic. Yet you cannot ignore the aspects of farce.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow actors praised his directing. One ensemble member said
that Malkovich was '`shockingly kind.'' Yasen Peyankov, who plays
Freud, said that ``John Malkovich is never intimidating; he lets us
find our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hysteria'' opened to critical acclaim and sold-out houses at
the Steppenwolf on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lavey, the artistic director at Steppenwolf, said that no
matter how much theater Malkovich did elsewhere, and no matter how
many movies he made, his roots remained with Steppenwolf. Although
he lives in France with Nicole Peyran and their two children, Ms.
Lavey said, ``all I have to do is call and he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich said that theatrical ``work in England is
intellectually superior to ours, especially their writing.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the great English actors perform far more
Shakespeare than Americans do. For Malkovich, ``Twelfth Night''
``is as stageworthy a play as any ever written,'' while parts of
``Hamlet'' ``are utterly unwatchable.'' He pointed to a range of
plays from other countries he considers on a par with Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   ```Our Town' compares easily with the best of Shakespeare,'' he
said. ```Waiting for Godot,' easily with the best of Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   And ```The Glass Menagerie,' also with the best of
Shakespeare.''

 &HT;    Diamond Dallas Page achieved wrestling dream at 35
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``SELF HI-FI!'' his own pre-recorded voice shouts
above the music, pyrotechnic explosions and the crowd's eruption.
It's his catch phrase, about self-promotion and pumping up. And he
looks pumped up as he struts onto the stage, prepared to give a
pre-recorded beating to another man.
</P>
<P>
   It's just like Page Falkinburg always imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in New Jersey, Falkinburg wanted to be a pro wrestler
since the age of 8. When he was 20, he gave it a brief shot with a
local wrestlng group. But it ended ``after basically getting beat
up for five months.'' It took another 15 years before the
opportunity came around again, and this time Falkinburg wasn't
quitting until they sent him home.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's in his early 40s, and the man known as Diamond Dallas
Page has reshaped World Championship Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rewrote how they do things at the Power Plant,'' Falkinburg
said of WCW's wresting school in Atlanta. ``I proved to a lot of
people with my work ethic that I was willing to do just about
anything to get in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Falkinburg is trying to do the same in the book publishing
world. On the heels of the best-selling autobiography by the World
Wrestling Federation's Mick Foley, Falkinburg is pre-selling his
autobiography, ``Positively Page,'' on a web site, www.ddpbook.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking for some inside-the-wrestling-world kind of
stuff, it's in there,'' Falkinburg said. ``But it's not all me
telling you things. The foreword is done by Hulk Hogan, and we've
got guys like Scott Hall, Dusty Rhodes, Foley, you name them we've
probably got them talking about how I did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of all the book is about not listening to the
negativity people tell you and finding the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Falkinburg speaks from experience in turning negatives into
positives.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 12, he was hit by a car, badly damaging his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until then, football and hockey were my games,'' he said.
``I played against the 13- and 14-year-olds. After the accident I
couldn't play those sports anymore. So I played the sports I was
the least good at, but could physically play, like basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Falkinburg immersed himself in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't good, but I was going to work hard to make sure I
didn't suck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was willing to crash through walls to play well on the
basketball court, his work ethic in the classroom was not the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the king of the cheat sheet,'' Falkinburg said. ``I was
never into the school thing because my reading was horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one knew Falkinburg had dyslexia. His wife,
Kimberly, helped diagnose the problem when Falkinburg was nearly
30. As a result of his new-found fame, Falkinburg and his wife were
able to start a charity foundation to help fight illiteracy and
promote reading, ``DDP's Bang It Out for Books.'' The foundation
donates reading and educational material to elementary schools
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have troubles learning, you learn how to get around
your problems,'' Falkinburg said. ``I tell the kids all the time
they are only cheating themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of attitude and a nagging feeling that he was
missing out on something that restarted Falkinburg's desire to get
in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Falkinburg was part-owner of a Florida nightclub. One
night after work, he got together with some friends and talked
about how he could get into the wrestling business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking and I said, 'I'll be a manager,' `` Falkinburg
said. ``I came up with the name Diamond Dallas Page and I liked the
initials, DDP, because it sounded like DDT. Then we would call the
wrestlers in the group the Diamond Exchange and of course we'd have
some lovely ladies and call them the Diamond Dolls with a different
girl each night.''
</P>
<P>
   Falkinburg put the idea into a video that he sent to different
wrestling groups. The American Wrestling Association (AWA) had been
on a decline for several years and wanted Falkinburg as a manager
and the wrestlers on his video immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'm ready, but the guys wrestling in the video had
a long ways to go before they were ready. But they were willing to
learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falkinburg joined the AWA as a manager, and his work caught the
eye of one of the key figures at Florida Championship Wrestling,
Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes took Falkinburg under his wing, and Falkinburg
went on to manage such future stars as Scott Hall and Raven, then
known as Scotty the Body.
</P>
<P>
   Falkinburg joined World Championship Wrestling as a manager, but
still carrying the dream of getting into the ring. He started out
wrestling, almost as a joke, at the Power Plant, and developed his
skills while waiting for his shot in a real show. When the chance
came, he made sure he was ready, not just inside the ring, but
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a shameless self-promoter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end Falkinburg became one of the first wrestlers with
his own web site. Today it is considered the premiere web site
among the hundreds of wrestler sites, with weekly updates and his
``State of the Union Cutters'' addresses, named for the Union
Cutters, his fan club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a chance to talk directly to the fans,''
Falkinburg said. ``We're constantly changing it. It really smartens
you up to the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also given Falkinburg a chance to get his opinions out to
the fans and dispel some of the rumors that appear about him on
other wrestling ``news'' web sites. For example, last month rumors
began that he was going to leave the WCW for the rival WWF.
Falkinburg wrote in his weekly address that ``I have not talked to
anyone in the WWF about jumping ship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they talk the better, though,'' he said about the
rumors. ``I mean, I could go to the WWF and be a Stone Cold heel
and make some big money for me and The Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is staying with WCW, hoping to be there as the
organization attempts to restake its claim as the top professional
wrestling organization in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Once that's accomplished, what could be next for the man who
didn't get in the ring until he was 35 _ politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I never thought about, but I've learned to
never say never,'' Falkinburg said. ``With what Jesse has done, and
Clinton's approval rating. ... Once I said I couldn't pass the
background check, but now ... you never know.''

   What had been rumored for months is official. ``Nitro'' is
cutting back from three hours to two starting Jan. 3. The show will
air from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. The hope is that the change will give
them a chance to make the ``Nitro'' and ``Thunder'' shows different
in terms of the wrestlers that appear. It will also mean the shows
compete against the WWF for an hour. That hour will probably be
used for dramatic finishes, which might take away some of WWF's
viewers who would normally be watching the beginning of the WWF
shows.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the NWO revealed their new logo (got to run out and
get that new merchandise) and new member. Scott Steiner joined
Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Bret Hart and Jeff Jarrett as the new bad
guys of the WCW. Various reports on the Internet have them adding a
female valet soon.
</P>
<P>
   WWF star Stone Cold Steve Austin has surgery scheduled for Jan.
11 to repair problems with his neck and back. Rehabilitation is
expected to take at least six to eight weeks, which would give him
an extra few weeks to get ready for ``Wrestlemania'' April 2.
Although it's highly unlikely he will be in the ring for
``Wrestlemania,'' he could find a role as a referee or announcer.
</P>
<P>
   After asking NASCAR legend Richard Petty to think about it,
reports have the North Carolina Republican Party approaching Ric
Flair about taking a run at becoming governor four years from now.
</P>
<P>
   On the WCW injury front, Goldberg will be out of action for two
weeks for minor knee surgery. Eddy Guerrero will be out three weeks
for surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow. Scott Hall is
scheduled for knee surgery Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Many reports on the Internet have changed the course of Taz's
rise in the WWF. Originally, the reports were that Taz, who is
jumping from the ECW, would debut with a victory at the ``Royal
Rumble'' pay-per-view. Now, reports have Taz working a slower route
to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Rhodes says he's feeling very positive about his release
from a management role at World Championship Wrestling. Rhodes, 50,
plans to start his own wrestling promotion _ Turnbuckle
Entertainment _ and will still appear for Extreme Championship
Wrestling. Rhodes, real name Virgil Runnels, recently debuted on
ECW by using his trademark bionic elbow on two opponents. The crowd
reaction showed Rhodes is still an important in-ring performer.

 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba _ Elian Gonzalez is everywhere and nowhere on the
streets of his hometown. As if summoning a phantom, his neighbors
point to the narrow sidewalks where he used to scamper about with
his friends or to the roof where they often saw him flying his
kite. They cling to his memory almost as dearly as Elian himself
held on to the inner tube he was strapped to when a boat carrying
him, his mother and several other Cubans capsized as they tried to
flee to Florida last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had children, I am too old,'' said Diria Rosa Ojeda,
60, a neighbor. ``But the child I never had, I see in him.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, the 6-year-old boy has been at the center
of an international tug of war and hearts that has roiled Cubans on
both sides of the Florida Straits as they await the decision of the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Since his mother and most of the other would-be refugees died on
the journey, Elian was taken in by his father's relatives in Miami,
who want him to stay with them for a chance at a better life. But
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and both sets of grandparents are
very much alive here in Cardenas and want the child returned, a
demand that has been echoed by thousands of Cubans in rallies
throughout the island organized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   As with other issues and people caught in the limbo of U.S. and
Cuban relations, the case has been enmeshed in exile intrigue and
international policy. Like the homages to Che Guevara and President
Fidel Castro, a snapshot of Elian _ his hand touching his chin in a
pensive moment _ has become an icon here, put on T-shirts,
billboards and posters. In Cardenas, where the houses are as worn
and weary as the people inside, his neighbors hold a vigil that is
more personal than political.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have no lives here,'' said Giralda Diaz, 70, a
neighbor who stood in a friend's doorway across the street from
Gonzalez's house. ``We do not work. We spend the day waiting for a
car to stop in front. People are sad. If you had a child, you would
feel it in your spirit. It is not humane.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's parents had divorced, but neighbors said the parting was
amicable.
</P>
<P>
   They described both parents as dedicated to the boy, who they
said lacked for nothing because they held tourism jobs, which gave
them access to dollars and, more important, life's elusive daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, they saw Elian at his father's house,
spending the night when his mother had to work late or awakened
early because of her maid's job at a hotel in the nearby resort
town of Varadero. The father would often take him to a restaurant
and resort complex where he worked, or treat him to outings and
toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obsessed with that child,'' said Isabel Alarcon. ``If
the boy wanted a movie, he rented it. Everything he wanted, he
got.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was all the more shocking when they learned that Elian's
mother had spirited him away when she left Cuba. The neighbors can
only believe that she had fallen under the sway of her new husband,
who organized the failed escape. Among themselves, they talk about
how the mother must have known that the boat was not seaworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know how that woman was crazy enough to follow that
man,'' said Elsa Diaz Vidal. ``She took the boy because of him. She
had no one over there to go to. Then she died in that horrible sea.
His real father would never let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest residents on the block, Hilario Sanchez Menendez,
88, and his wife, Ramona, 80, feel a special kinship with the
Gonzalez clan, remembering when they used to cradle Juan Miguel in
their arms. On days when they did not pass by for a chat or a cup
of coffee, Juan Miguel would pass by their home to make sure
everything was all right. Sanchez Menendez said that his mood
brightened recently when he was at the Gonzalez home when Elian
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you coming here?'' he asked Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ```I will be there in a few days when my vacation is over,''' he
said the boy replied. ``Then he started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears are shed inside Gonzalez's home, too. The neighbors said
they often see him looking depressed, sitting inside his living
room, where pictures of Elian outnumber those of Castro and Che. In
the last few days, they have not seen him in the neighborhood. The
man they described as a hard worker for his son has become barely
able to summon the strength to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved here, he was born,'' Ms. Ojeda said of Gonzalez.
``Now he is an old man because of this. He is in a lot of pain. He
is suffering. His co-workers come by and say, `Let's go to the
hotel.' He feels bad, because the hotel is by the sea. He sees that
and is traumatized again.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors say they cannot understand why Elian's relatives
in Miami are so intent on keeping the boy, and they dismiss any
suggestion that he could have a better life there. At home, they
said, despite the country's economic hardships, he had free
schooling and health care and the chance to be with the people he
has known all his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better opportunity does he have being raised among
strangers,'' Ms. Alarcon said. ``How many other children from other
countries have to go back? Why not Elian? Because he is Cuban? Be
we poor or rich, whatever we are, we have the right to have our
child next to us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do his grandparents on both sides, they argue. It was
not that long ago that the grandparents or the father would pick up
Elian at the Marcelo Salado Primary School, where his desk now sits
empty. . If he returns, Cuban officials have promised that his
homecoming will be without fanfare or public celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would only affect him even more,'' said Maribel Casas
Reyes, the school's director. ``We are struggling to have him in a
happy situation, not to bruise his emotions more. If we did that,
it would be worse than what he experienced in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The students, wearing T-shirts that proclaim ``We Will Save
Elian,'' sing songs and recite poems in his honor each day, while
others have drawn pictures that are on exhibit at the town's
museum, along with photographs of Elian in Miami under the heading
``The Child They Kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   In one classroom, a banner declaring ``Happy Birthday Elian''
still hangs, a reminder of the day this month when Castro himself
visited the school. To commemorate the occasion, he signed a guest
book with the inscription, ``For Elian's Liberty, Motherland or
Death.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan has been a familiar refrain at the many rallies held
in recent weeks. At one at the University of Havana, students
recited poetry and read essays about how Elian should return to the
island where he has his family, his flag and his comandante, and
how the only things he would learn about in the United States were
drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many praised Castro while denouncing American imperialism as
well as the gifts and attention bestowed on the boy by Miami's
exile community, a group they called a ``Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Events calling for Elian's return have begun to annoy some
Cubans, who agree that the boy needs to be with his father but have
nonetheless tired of turning on their radios or televisions only to
encounter yet another rally with revolutionary songs or demonic
caricatures of exile politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rallies have been smaller than the earlier ones that
brought the city _ and workplaces _ to a standstill. At a recent
university event, several hundred students politely waved flags
near the stage while many others milled about chatting and
laughing. The feeling in some quarters has been that the government
has seized on the public's sympathy with the custody issue to
bolster political enthusiasm at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up with this,'' said one Havana resident who
declined to give her name. ``I think there has to be something
deeper politically. There has to be something more significant than
we can see.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the strong words uttered by the youngest demonstrators have
led some critics to accuse the Cuban government of politicizing the
case just as much as the exile community has.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would happen if a child stood outside and shouted `Down
with Fidel'?'' said another Havana resident. ``They would detain
his family because someone taught him that. Here, they put 5- and
6-year-old children at rallies making political statements about
North American policy. They say that Miami is playing with the
child? Here they are playing with him too.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the talk of toys and politics remains a motherless child
with a father who wants him back. On his street in Cardenas, it is
a constant refrain. No plaything or great-uncle in Miami, they
said, could ever replace his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is a little humanity,'' said Maria Alian Scott, a
teen-age neighbor. ``To see how that father suffers for his son
while he is not returned to him. And that boy has had the trauma of
seeing his mother die in front of him. What better psychiatrist
than his father? What better hospital than his home?''

   If a Computer Is Losing Time, Suspect the Battery or Drive &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My PC's clock always seems to be losing time. Is it just
faulty timekeeping software, or should I be concerned about larger
issues?
</P>
<P>
   A. The inability of your computer's clock to keep time properly
could be a symptom of a larger problem. Many desktop computers,
particularly older ones, have a small battery on the motherboard.
That battery supplies power not only to the internal clock but also
to the computer's CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor)
memory chip. The CMOS chip contains important data like your
system's setup information. Without that data, your computer would
not be able to boot up normally.
</P>
<P>
   As the battery weakens, you may see start-up errors like ``CMOS
Read Error'' displayed on your PC's screen. Depending on the type
of battery your computer uses, battery life can range from two to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh computers are also susceptible to battery-related
problems on the motherboard. Macs have a small battery attached to
the motherboard that supplies power to the system's parameter RAM
(PRAM). The Mac's PRAM holds a variety of system settings, and a
dying PRAM battery can be just as big a problem.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to replace a PRAM or CMOS battery yourself if you
don't have qualms about going inside your computer. Your system's
manual should have the specifics on the type of battery you need to
get and how to replace it. Or you can pay a qualified computer
technician to do the job for you.
</P>
<P>
   A dead or dying battery is not the only thing that can make your
clock lose time. A forgetful clock is sometimes a symptom of an
impending hard-drive failure. If you are getting a lot of
miscellaneous error messages concerning your computer's memory
size, setup, CMOS settings or drive configuration, or long beeps
when you start up the machine, hard-drive problems may be afoot.
Grinding or clicking noises coming from your hard drive may also be
evidence of a problem ahead. If your computer shows any of those
symptoms, you should take every opportunity to back up important
data and call a technician.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a relatively expensive keyboard, and the Shift key has
become difficult to depress. Is there anything I can do short of
buying a new keyboard? All the other keys are fine.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is possible that dust, dirt or crumbs have become lodged
under the Shift key, making it hard to press. With the computer
turned off, unplug the keyboard from the computer, turn it over and
lightly shake loose any dust or cookie particles between the keys.
</P>
<P>
   A can of compressed air (available at most computer-supply
stores) can also be helpful. While still holding the keyboard
upside down, hold the air can several inches away from the keys and
direct the nozzle at an angle between the rows to blow out any more
bits of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Although it can be risky to the overall health of your keyboard,
you can gently pull off the keycap of the Shift key and clean
underneath it as well. But be careful not to snap off the plastic
grips that hold the key on the keyboard; pulling the keycap off
straight from the keyboard with a pair of needle-nose pliers
instead of prying it off with a screwdriver may yield better
results. Once you have cleaned around the space under the problem
key, carefully snap the keycap back into place.
</P>
<P>
   When you type, the key you hit activates a switch beneath it.
Activating this switch changes its flow of information to the
keyboard's microprocessor. That signal tells the microprocessor
which key was just pressed, and it sends the information on to the
rest of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt and crumbs in the keyboard can interfere with the switch
and prevent the signal or can cause the key to stick _ a string of
b's, for example, shows up across the screen when the connection
doesn't immediately stop after you strike the b key.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are the main input devices for most people,
keyboards tend to pick up a lot of surface dirt and grime from
users' skin as well. You can wipe off the tops and sides of the
keys with an alcohol pad or special computer cleaning solution. Do
not use abrasive cleansers in or on the keyboard, or liquids that
will drip into the keys and perhaps damage the underlying
circuitry.  &QL;

<P>
   Last January, Brian Johnson, a 31-year-old construction foreman
in Detroit, loaded his television, his computer and his cat into
his pickup truck and headed to California to fulfill a childhood
fantasy of making his living as a computer animator.
</P>
<P>
   Enticed by a local radio advertisement, Johnson enrolled at the
-Ex'pression Center for New Media, a brand new school in
Emeryville, Calif., across the bay from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The cat disappeared a few days after the move, but the rest of
Johnson's experience has been happy. ``I'm very glad I did this,''
he said. ``I feel much closer to achieving some of my childhood
dreams than I ever have in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who holds an associate of science degree from a
military college in Georgia, will graduate in March with an
associate of applied science degree in digital visual media. He has
already lined up a job in California with Silent Planet, an
animation company based in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression is one of a handful of new degree-granting schools
that offer no courses covering ``The Iliad,'' ``The Aeneid'' or
``Le Morte d'Arthur.'' Not that they shy away from battles or
heroes. In fact, those subjects are at the heart of their mission.
They offer a rigorous, narrowly focused curriculum in creating
fantasy worlds and action games. While educators with more
traditional programs are skeptical about such an approach, those
running the newer programs defend them as an efficient way to
produce new crops of computer animators and computer game
designers.
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression, which offers associate degrees in either digital
visual media or sound arts in a 14-month program, advertises itself
as a ``total-immersion boot camp.'' The courses, with titles like
3-D Modeling and Advanced Effects, train aspiring animators to
reflect light off Buzz Lightyear's helmet or give Sonic the
Hedgehog his quirky movements.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing even vaguely scholarly about the school. Its
atmosphere is less collegiate than a high-tech startup. It occupies
65,000 square feet in a cavernous renovated office building once
owned by Sybase, a software company.
</P>
<P>
   The walls, painted purple, red and yellow, look like something
Willy Wonka might have dreamed up. Classrooms have large interior
windows to make it easier to show visitors around, explained Gary
Platt, Ex'pression's ponytailed president, as he walked a visitor
through the building recently.
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression is financed entirely by Eckart J. Wintzen, a Dutch
computer entrepreneur who has poured $23 million into the school
and its state-of-the-art computer and sound equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Amsterdam, Wintzen said he had set
up -Ex'pression (the school's name is partly a play on Eck's, from
his first name) as a model for teaching computer-based skills like
computer animation. ``This is stuff you can't learn from a book or
from a teacher standing in front of a class with slides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the school's library is a sparsely endowed, lonely
looking room. Apart from multiple copies of ``The Global Village''
and other titles by and about Marshall McLuhan, whose ideas
fascinate Wintzen, the collection is limited to titles like
``Television Fundamentals'' and ``The Audio Engineer's Reference
Book.''
</P>
<P>
   The real learning, Wintzen said, takes place not from books but
in the many computer laboratories and sound studios where the
school's 162 students sharpen their skills. The school has its own
render farm, which is not a place where fat from animal carcasses
is collected for soap but a collection of powerful computers that
perform the time-consuming computations necessary to produce
complex animation sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Platt said a render farm like the school's was usually found
only at computer animation studios. He pointed out proudly that the
school taught animation using Maya, a sophisticated software
package for digital animators that is being adopted at Pixar
Animation Studios, of ``Toy Story'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic, the visual effects
division of Lucas Digital in San Rafael, Calif., are two brass
rings of prospective employment for the school's first graduating
class, which will receive diplomas in March.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar, in particular, seems to be something of a fixation at the
school. Original line drawings of characters from ``Toy Story''
hang on one wall. Various dolls from the film and its sequel are
displayed on office credenzas.
</P>
<P>
   Only 25 percent of Ex'pression's students come straight from
high school. The rest either have already been to different schools
or, like Johnson, have worked at less gratifying jobs. To help pay
the $30,700 tuition for the digital visual media program (the
school is not yet accredited to offer federal financial aid), said
Yee-Ju Lin, the school's admissions director, students have found
other sources of loans, borrowed from families and sold their cars.
To save money, one student lives in his van, which he has outfitted
with a bed and keeps in the school parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one out of every two applicants is admitted, she said,
and the only test scores required are those from the Wonderlic
test, a basic aptitude test.
</P>
<P>
   The equivalent of Ex'pression for budding video-game designers
is the Digipen Institute of Technology in Redmond, Wash., which has
been granting degrees since 1994. It trains its 250 students in
either a two- or four-year program that places more emphasis on
math and physics.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Comair, the school's founder and president, said that
even the science and math were taught within the context of video
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to do the rhumba in front of my students to get
their attention,'' he said. ``If the homework is to implement a
video game using those sciences, the students are more willing to
learn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Digipen is so closely affiliated with the Nintendo game maker
that Comair is also chairman of Nintendo Software Technology, the
company's game programming arm. And the school itself is on the
Nintendo grounds. Yet Digipen officials say the school also feeds a
number of the other leading game companies, including Sega and
Electronic Arts. Nintendo has no financial stake in the school, but
a company representative holds a seat on Digipen's advisory
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both Digipen and Ex'pression subscribe to the total immersion
theory of education. Students in the digital visual media program
at Ex'pression spend three hours each day in classes and another
six hours in the computer laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't party here,'' Platt said. ``There's no time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the school tour, Platt, who is 45 but cultivates a
younger, goofy demeanor, stopped occasionally to offer a spirited
greeting to random sleep-deprived students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, man, how ya doin'?'' he called out as he passed, putting
on a just-one-of-the-guys accent.
</P>
<P>
   Some students at Ex'pression use distance learning to satisfy
general education requirements in fields like English, history and
psychology, all of which Platt considers to be so much ``fat'' in a
higher-education curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in teaching that stuff,'' said Platt, who
received his own bachelor's degree in music and education from Ohio
University and has worked in the sound recording industry. Instead,
he said, he prefers to send students straight to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Ex'pression and Digipen also function as expensive outlets for
childhood fantasies. Not surprisingly, the student populations are
almost entirely male.
</P>
<P>
   At night, after long days of hard work, students at Ex'pression
often transform the computer laboratories into large arenas for
playing video games. Comair said the entire Digipen campus often
became one large networked game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it was seeing the film ``The Empire Strikes Back''
at age 12 that first sparked his desire to work in special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true for Sheldon Baines, 24, a recent Digipen
graduate who played Nintendo games while growing up in rural
Newfoundland. ``I used to think how cool it would be to make games
as a living,'' he said. ``But I cast it away as a silly dream.''
Now happily ensconced as a programmer at Nintendo, Baines is
finishing work on Ridge Racer 64, a new game for the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling three all-nighters in a row, Roy Miles, 28,
another Ex'pression student who will graduate soon, sat in a
computer laboratory recently and explained to a visitor that he
hoped to work for Pixar, which is planning to move into a large new
building in Emeryville, less than a mile from the school.
</P>
<P>
   Miles said he had worked hard to cultivate contacts there. To
help pay his tuition, Miles holds a full-time job as a night
custodian at nearby Sybase.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cost of 14 months at Ex'pression, Platt said, fully
25 percent of the students there do not plan to do the extra work
required for an associate's degree and will leave with a
certificate. ``They don't seem to care _ that's what I love about
it,'' he said. ``They're going to school for the right reasons _
not just to get a degree but to acquire the knowledge, the skills
and the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Degree or no degree, Platt said, ``we think our students will be
the prime candidates in the world when they leave.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But whether Platt will be proved correct when the school's first
class graduates in a few months is not certain. Total immersion in
a computer-based curriculum, especially for a mere 14 months, is
not necessarily the best way to produce top-notch animators, many
people already in the field say. Only classical training in drawing
and other forms of art will do that, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best animators that come here have some formal training in
the traditional skills,'' said Ken Maruyama, director of animation
and creature development at Industrial Light and Magic.
</P>
<P>
   What he looks for most in an applicant's demo reel (the
equivalent of an art student's portfolio), Maruyama said, is what
is known in the visual effects business as weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at whether the motion is believable, whether the
animator knows how to make this character move and act
believably,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sense of having that character look like they belong in
the environment in which they're placed.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Pixar recruiters say they look for employees who
are artists first and technical whizzes second.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the newer schools are focusing on teaching students
how to use the computer,'' said Rachel Hannah, the recruiting
manager at Pixar. ``We tend to recruit from schools that teach more
of the traditional methods.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Ms. Hannah said, Pixar tends to rely for its
talent on well-established schools like the California Institute of
the Arts near Santa Clarita, which was co-founded by Walt Disney
and whose alumni include John Lasseter, Pixar's premier director.
</P>
<P>
   So committed is Pixar to giving its employees _ animators,
lighting directors, accountants and programmers alike _ a solid
grounding in classic artistic techniques that it teaches drawing,
painting, sculpture, acting and live action filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ```What we're looking for is a Renaissance man or woman who
knows not only animation and art but animation history and art
history, social history and political science,'' said Randy Nelson,
dean of Pixar University, Pixar's in-house training unit. ``There
isn't a depth where you can say, `Oh don't bother going any deeper,
the audience will never see.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing about an animator's art is that you're a
worlds creator. To animate means to bring to life. You're creating
the entire environment. To create a world of great depth requires
individuals of great depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Day, director of the animation department at the Academy
of Art in San Francisco, whose four-year program covers all aspects
of animation, from storyboard creation to full computer animation,
said he doubted that a 14-month program could accomplish much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to fit it all into four years is very difficult as it
is,'' Day said. ``You have to first be an artist, which practically
consumes your first two years, before you can become a computer
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another approach to training the next generation of computer
animators and game designers is being tried at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh. In January, the school started a master's
degree program at its new Entertainment Technology Center. The
center's two directors, one a drama professor and the other a
computer science professor, operate under the assumption that it
should take more time, not less, to develop skills in digital
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The computer scientist, Randy Pausch, said, ``We're doing things
here that can't be done at trade schools.'' He said the program
drew from the university's multiple disciplines to bring together
students from art, architecture, drama, design and computer
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use Maya, too,'' Pausch said, referring to the animation
software used by students at Ex'pression. ``But if you came to a
tour of the center, it sure isn't the first thing we'd trumpet. In
the end, tools are just tools, and great animation is done by great
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt said he had heard such criticism before, and he brushed it
off. ``With all due respect, they're just ignorant, or illiterate,
about what it's about, and they're defending their own
self-interest,'' he said. ``But educators are finally coming around
to realizing that total immersion is the way to go, that students
learn exponentially faster because they're experiencing it, they're
discovering it. They're not just in a class three hours a week or
reading a book. They're in it 45 hours a week.''

PROSECUTORS TO INVESTIGATE GERMANY'S EX-CHANCELLOR KOHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ German prosecutors said Wednesday that they
would begin a criminal investigation into secret political funds
maintained by Helmut Kohl, Germany's chancellor from 1982 until
last year and Europe's most powerful leader for most of this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In a scandal that has abruptly exposed politicians in all major
parties to intense new scrutiny, Kohl has admitted that he accepted
about $1 million in secret political contributions and managed them
in secret bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who is 69 and remains a towering figure in the
center-right Christian Democratic Union, has admitted that the
secret accounts probably violated German laws requiring full
disclosure of political contributions. But he has said that he
never enriched himself personally, and has refused to name the
people who contributed the money.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Kohl said he ``regretted'' the
prosecutors' decision to start an investigation but would provide
as much support to it as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's activities are already the subject of a parliamentary
investigation. But he has been able to fend off demands for
information about the sources and uses of money because of his
immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament. But a decision
to lift the immunity is not necessary yet for the criminal
investigation to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said last week that he would not break his promises to the
contributors to keep their identities secret.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff has generated havoc among the Christian Democrats,
many of whom have pleaded without success that Kohl reveal his
contributors to help put the matter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The party is torn between those who remain loyal to Kohl and
those who want to push him into the pages of history. Party
secretary-general Angela Merkel has repeatedly urged Kohl to tell
everything he knows. But Wolfgang Schauble, who succeeded Kohl as
party chairman, has been noticeably silent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has done wonders for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and his governing Social Democratic Party. The party suffered a
string of defeats in regional elections this year, just months
after winning a triumphant victory at the national polls in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who has been harshly criticized for indecision and
vacillation between the left wing and more pro-business wings of
his party, has in recent weeks rode a new wave of support in the
public and within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Thierse, the Social Democratic president of parliament,
accused Kohl on Wednesday of ``intentional violations of political
contribution laws and the constitution over many years.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, prosecutors in Bonn, the former capital,
said they had grounds for an investigation into a ``breach of
trust'' and violations of campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is likely to take months and may not even be
finished by the end of next year. The parliamentary committee
investigating Kohl and related issues has said its work will take
about two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   But the scandal has already jolted Germany's placid attitude
toward political accountability. German newspapers have embarked on
a muckraking frenzy unlike anything the country has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   The issues have already spread well beyond those that pertain
directly to Kohl, which originated when a former arms dealer said
he gave 1 million German marks in cash in 1990 to the man who was
then treasurer of the Christian Democratic Union.

RUSSIAN EX-NAVAL OFFICER ACQUITTED IN NUCLEAR POLLUTION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a ruling hailed as a rare victory for the rule of
law in Russia, a St. Petersburg judge Wednesday acquitted a former
naval captain, Alexsander Nikitin, of charges that he had leaked
state secrets about nuclear pollution to a Norwegian environmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's arrest in 1996, followed by a heavy-handed
investigation by security services into his report on nuclear
contamination by the Russian Navy, had been seen as a chilling
example of the limits of political freedom in Russia's new
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, applause broke out in a municipal courtroom in St.
Petersburg as Nikitin's supporters greeted the unexpected acquittal
verdict. ``This is very good news for Russia,'' said Nikitin, who
spent nine months in jail after his arrest and was subsequently
barred from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with the defense's arguments, Judge Sergei Golets found
that the accusations brought against Nikitin were unconstitutional
because they were based on secret decrees from the Defense Ministry
that Nikitin could not have known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of these orders is a direct violation of the
Constitution of the Russia Federation,'' Golets said. He also said
the federal case ran counter to the European convention on human
rights, to which Russia is a signatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikitin case has been raised by international human rights
groups and Western governments as a test of Russia's commitment to
free speech and to a fair trial for those who ran afoul of the
Federal Security Service, the domestic intelligence service that is
heir to the Soviet-era KGB.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled that he was acquitted but distressed that it
took nearly four years for the Russian criminal justice system to
reach an obvious conclusion,'' said Rachel Denber, a deputy
director of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service had accused Nikitin of divulging
state secrets _ a charge tantamount to treason _ in his report on
nuclear submarine accidents for Bellona, a Norwegian environmental
group. During the investigation, security agents raided Bellona's
offices in the North Sea port of Murmansk, and confiscated 1,500
copies of the Bellona report that were labeled forbidden
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin, who had worked for 11 years as an engineer on Soviet
nuclear submarines and later as a nuclear inspector for the Defense
Ministry, has argued that all the material in his report was based
on unclassified information that had already been published in the
Russian press.
</P>
<P>
   The case highlighted Russian sensitivity to the environmental
threat posed by the Northern Fleet's careless handling of nuclear
material. Norway, which lies near Russia's northwestern borders,
has been particularly sensitive to reports of accidents on Russian
nuclear submarines, overburdened radioactive storage sites and
ocean dumping of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, a court in the far-eastern city of
Vladivostok last July dropped treason charges against Grigory
Pasko, a Russian military journalist, who had also written on
nuclear dumping by the Russian Navy. Pasko was convicted of a
lesser charge of violating rules for military journalists, but was
given amnesty by the Vladivostok court.
</P>
<P>
   Although both cases ended in a legal defeat for the Security
Service, their determination may have already had the intended
effect of discouraging whistle-blowers with access to information
that could seen as damaging to the government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nikitin's ordeal began when he was roused from sleep in his St.
Petersburg apartment by security agents who ordered him to come
with them for an interrogation. He was put in prison, his telephone
was cut off, and he had to appeal to Russia's Constitutional Court
for the right to his own lawyer after refusing one chosen for him
by the security service.
</P>
<P>
   After he was freed, Nikitin accused the security services of
harassment. His wife and child now live in Canada. In the meantime,
his case was kicked around the Russian court system. In a ruling
earlier this year, the Russian Supreme Court refused to drop the
treason charges against him, sending his case back for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said then that the Russian government seemed to be
dragging the case out in order to avoid embarrassment for the
powerful security services. Their case rested on two secret decrees
issued by the Defense Ministry, which had never been published and
were not made available to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes were set very high,'' said Denber, ``There was a
lot of foot-dragging, ordering up new investigations, appointing
new prosecutors as a way to give the FSB a face saving way out of a
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution can appeal the St. Petersburg verdict, but most
observers said they expected the Federal Security Service would
drop the case. ``A court decision is a court decision, which we
regard as taken on the basis of law,'' a security service official
told the Interfax news agency Wednesday.

   SYNCHRONIZE YOUR WATCH FOR THE NEXT 20 MILLION YEARS
</P>
<P>
   Another holiday, another gift watch. Wednesday, the Commerce
Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology gave a
more accurate timepiece to the world. A new atomic clock, the NIST
F-1, is now the primary frequency standard for the United States
and will contribute information to the atomic clocks around the
world that define the official world time. An explanation and video
footage of the clock is available at
www.nist.gov/publicaffairs/releases/n99-22.htm.
</P>
<P>
   The NIST F-1, which was developed by Steve Jeffers and Dawn
Meekhof of the Time and Frequency Division of the Physics
Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., is approximately three times as
accurate as the clock it replaced, officials said. The institute
estimates that the clock will not lose or gain a second for the
next 20 million years. So maybe next year, the institute can give
an atomic tie instead.

   A GLOBAL CELL PHONE THAT CAN ENTERTAIN YOU
</P>
<P>
   Lots of cellular telephones provide good coverage, but how many
can be converted into portable home-entertainment centers? The T28
World digital phone from Ericsson of Sweden is one of a small
number of handsets for globe-trotters that automatically adapt to
the world's most popular wireless calling systems. Unlike the
others, however, T28 World accepts a series of snap-on attachments
that can turn it into a tiny personal electronic companion.
</P>
<P>
   The T28 World will automatically work in Europe, North America,
South America, Asia and Australia by switching between two digital
standards, GSM 900 and GSM 1800.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the world, that means its users will not find
themselves without a signal. But that is not the case in the some
parts of the United States, where GSM coverage of any sort is still
not available. The Groupe Speciale Mobile wireless standard is the
world's most widely used cellular technology, but it is not
dominant in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Farrell, Ericsson's mobile phone marketing manager for
North America, said that several service providers would probably
offer coverage everywhere in the country over the next several
months. When there is coverage, however, the phone not only
automatically switches systems but will also change its display to
show the local time and date.
</P>
<P>
   Users without anyone to call will be able to play Tetris and
solitaire on the display screen. The entertainment capability can
be expanded with a clip-on, optional accessory that converts the
phone into an MP3 digital music player and hands-free set. Another
accessory, known as the Chat Pad, gives the phone the ability to
receive short e-mail messages and send replies using a miniature
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a small handset with a small keyboard is very
powerful for travelers,'' Farrell said. Finally, Ericsson will also
offer a cordless headset with a base station that will clip onto
the bottom of the T28 World.
</P>
<P>
   The phone itself will not be available in the United States
until spring, and Farrell anticipates that it will sell for about
$300. The accessories, some of which are now available overseas,
will not come to North America until at least the summer.

   FANTASY MEETS REALITY IN LARA CROFT `INTERVIEW'
</P>
<P>
   Many video game fans probably dream of meeting Lara Croft, the
popular Barbie-shaped heroine of the Tomb Raider series. Perhaps if
they paid a little more attention to her brains, they could.
</P>
<P>
   To promote Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Eidos Interactive
has released a specialty game level that shows the fictional Lara
Croft in conversation with Paul Stothard, a real-life editor at The
Times of London. She then uses the newspaper's archives before
embarking on an adventure in Egypt. A downloadable version is
available at www.the-times.co.uk/lara/exclu.html.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution of what we've done with the last two Tomb
Raiders,'' said Paul Baldwin, a vice president of Eidos
Interactive. ``In Tomb Raider 3, we brought her to London, and much
closer to people's everyday lives and interests. Contemporary
environments have now evolved into bringing real personalities into
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lara Croft character has previously been introduced to Elvis
Presley on screen, but Stothard is the first living person and
certainly the first newspaper editor to be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   If the download is popular, fans might look forward to further
journalistic adventures showing Lara Croft transcribing interview
tapes and filling out expense forms.

(www.alzado.net), an online artwork that made its debut on Sunday,
can momentarily command 18 searchlights installed on three sides of
a public square in the heart of the Mexican capital, then receive
live Webcam photos of their actions illuminating the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   From 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. daily until Jan. 6, visitors to the site
can create their own lighting design, using any or all of the
7,000-watt beams (which can be seen up to 10 miles away), through
an interactive 3-D rendering of Zocalo Square on the Internet. Once
the design is submitted, the robotically controlled searchlights
move into position for six seconds. Cameras in three places snap
pictures of the real-time display, which are loaded onto a
personalized Web page so its address can be e-mailed to its
creator.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, a Mexican media artist, was commissioned
by the Mexican government to devise the project. From within the
square, he said, the successive displays of Internet-submitted
designs look more natural than traditional lighting shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a constant transformation,'' he said. ``There's no
way the power of this light can be ignored.'' The site will not be
active on New Year's Eve, when Lozano-Hemmer will select previously
made designs and program a seven-minute light show.

DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN WINEMAKING AND TECHNOLOGY

   When you stare, glassy-eyed, across the river and into the next
millennium, do you hope to see happiness and light, or _ as Time
magazine asked a couple of years ago _ is there no balm in chiliad?
</P>
<P>
   (Good word, chiliad; it's a 50-cent synonym for millennium.)
</P>
<P>
   Or, to get more specific, thinking about wine in the coming
(pick one: year, decade, century, millennium), do you see red or
white, or are you squinting through rose-colored binoculars?
</P>
<P>
   So where does wine go from here?
</P>
<P>
   XXX
</P>
<P>
   Take technology _ please:
</P>
<P>
   Wine remains a natural agricultural product. Squeeze the juice
from grapes. Yeast in the air reacts with the sugar in the grape
juice. Result: carbon dioxide (that blows off) and ... fermented
grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   Wine has been made this way for thousands of years, but now it's
helped along by technology. And that can be a good thing. For
example, in the old days, wines could oxidize quickly. But later,
with the technological onset of cold fermentation, the wines became
fresher and cleaner. Score one for science.
</P>
<P>
   A constant problem remains: wines ruined by corks tainted by
chlorine in the bleaching process. But now plastic or composite
corks are slowly (very slowly) turning the tide against
natural-cork closures. And that's another upside of technology.
</P>
<P>
   I once talked with a very bright guy who claimed he had invented
a process by which he could ``fingerprint'' all the complex aspects
of any bottle of wine. Eventually, he said, he hoped to be able to
duplicate any wine. ``You like '61 Latour,'' he said, ``and I can
replicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's bad. That's not winemaking; that's industrial
duplication.
</P>

   Tropicana sells its Lakeland plant
</P>
<P>
   By Matthew Sauer
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana Products Inc. has sold its Lakeland juice processing
and packaging facility to an investor group that includes the man
who founded the Juice Bowl business that used the plant for years.
</P>
<P>
   The sales price was not disclosed, but the investors group that
includes Juice Bowl founder John P. ``Jack'' Grady secured $7
million of tax-free industrial revenue bonds to buy new equipment
for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work Tropicana has done at the plant was packing
beverages for other companies, so its departure from the Bradenton
juice company's overall operations is of little consequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing a lot of co-packing at that plant and other
activities that are not part of our strategic plan moving
forward,'' said Tropicana spokeswoman Kristine Nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The move is akin to Tropicana's sales a few years ago of its
box-making operation at its Bradenton plant. Companies in many
industries are divesting themselves of ancillary business to focus
on what they call their ``core competencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-acre plant in Lakeland employs about 125 workers.
Tropicana acquired it as part of its $276 million purchase of Dole
Food Co.'s worldwide juice business in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The sale leaves Tropicana with seven manufacturing sites around
the world: Bradenton; Fort Pierce; City of Industry, Calif.;
Borgloon, Belgium; Boxford, England; Hermes, France; and Huizhou,
China.
</P>
<P>
   Grady, 83, leads the investment group that includes his son,
Mike, a former Juice Bowl sales manager, and Terry Simmers, his
former plant manager.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants the 175,000-square-foot plant, which will
operate as a business under the name Juice Bowl Products Inc., to
increase production from its current level of about 5 million
three-gallon cases of bottled or canned beverages each year to at
least 10 million cases during the next five years. As Juice Bowl
Products Inc., the plant would continue to produce the Snapple
beverage line and Tropicana lines, which amount to about 4 million
cartons annually, while it revives the Juice Bowl brand of juices
and juice-flavored drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is one of the oldest in the state. Entrepreneur Sasson
King built it to provide grapefruit sections to the U.S. Army
during World War II. Later, businessman Harvey Greenspan bought the
plant and converted it to the Bib Baby Juice Co.
</P>
<P>
   Grady purchased the plant from Greenspan in 1967 and created
Juice Bowl. He sold the plant to Iranian businessman Abbas Bayate,
who merged it with his European citrus processing operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Bayate sold out to Dole Food Co., which then sold it to
Tropicana two years later. Tropicana put the plant up for sale in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana has helped its parent, PepsiCo Inc., to increase its
third-quarter profits by 7 percent. Tropicana's profits helped
offset lower results from carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo's main
business.

<TEXT>
<P>
   By the year 1000, homeowners throughout the world enjoyed a
remarkable range of creature comforts: coal stoves in China;
crystal tableware in Baghdad; libraries in Ghana. All and all, it
wasn't a bad time to be alive _ unless, of course, you lived in
Europe. Peasants there dwelt in filthy one-room hovels heated by an
open fire. The family, along with the goat, huddled on a single
vermin-infested straw mat. Not that kings and queens in gloomy
castles had it much better. Privacy was nonexistent, and the
nobility, one historian has written, ``didn't so much live in their
houses as camp in them.'' They spent most of their time on the
road, visiting far-flung estates. Tellingly, the French and Italian
words for furniture at this time _ mobilier and mobilia _ meant
``movables.'' It would be a while before Europeans settled down.
</P>
<P>
   1005: TWO-TINING Mothers-in-law everywhere quarrel with their
sons' wives. But imagine the consternation of the august Venetian
lady whose daughter-in-law, a snooty Byzantine princess, refused to
eat with her fingers like the rest of the family. She preferred a
``golden instrument with two prongs.'' Her highness died soon
thereafter _ divine retribution for using a fork.
</P>
<P>
   1066: SAFE, YES; SYBARITIC, HARDLY Home security, of sorts, was
introduced in England by invading Normans. Donjons, their heavily
fortified castle towers, offered protection but no comforts.
</P>
<P>
   C. 1110: TWO RMS, DESERT VIEW Pueblo Bonito, built by the
Anasazi of Chaco Canyon, is an apartment complex, which eventually
encompassed 800 rooms capable of housing 1,000 people. Its size as
a multi-tenant building was not surpassed until 1882.
</P>
<P>
   1165: PLUMBING FIRST, PLUMBERS LATER A monastery in Canterbury,
England, enjoys a labyrinth of indoor plumbing: pipes, aqueducts,
cisterns, reservoirs and a main water tower. But regular bathing
remains a curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   1180: LET THERE BE LIGHT English homeowners finally rediscover
the windowpane, although the Romans had used glass for windows as
far back as 14 B.C. Most homes, however, continue to rely on crude
wooden shutters and oiled parchment.
</P>
<P>
   1189: SMOKEY THE MAYOR In an early example of fire insurance,
the first Lord Mayor of London rules that all houses have to be
equipped with a ladder and, during tinder-dry summers, a barrel of
water by the front door.
</P>
<P>
   C. 1200: ENTER SANTA Residential chimneys become common in
Europe. Previously, homeowners had built fires in the middle of the
floor and cut a hole in the roof to let out smoke and cinders.
</P>
<P>
   1212: FIDDLING WITH THE ROOF Heavy duty, low-maintenance tiles
replace thatched and wooden roofs in London. Housing becomes more
permanent and durable, but repairs are a headache.
</P>
<P>
   C. 1240: BEDS OF STATE Henry III of England commissions the
first king-size bed, a four poster with a painted canopy, which
soon becomes an emblem of nobility throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   1255: EARLY WALL-TO-WALL CARPETING Eleanor of Castile marries
King Edward I of England and begins redecorating, unappreciated, in
the colorful, comfortable Moorish style. ``Even the floor was
covered with tapestry,'' an observer noted. ``This excessive pride
excited the laughter and derision of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   1259: CLEANLINESS, SORT OF Soap, a common household item in the
Islamic world, is finally manufactured in London. It takes
centuries to catch on, as frequent bathing is considered unhealthy
(which accounts for the popularity of asphyxiating perfumes). As
late as the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I would be considered
eccentric for her ``frequent'' _ that is, monthly _ baths.
</P>
<P>
   1300: VANITY Glass blowers in Venice craft the first mirrors.
Though they cast blurred and distorted images, mirrors gradually
became indispensable in the civilized home, culminating centuries
later in magazines like Self and US.
</P>
<P>
   1306: KEEPING THE HOME FIRES BURNING Marco Polo discovers that
the Chinese heat their homes with long-burning, heat-efficient
coal. It sure beats manure, fuel of choice in Europe, but it takes
a few centuries to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   1492: SWING LOW Columbus discovers the New World and, more
important, the hammock, a hanging bed used by Caribbean Indians.
Adopted aboard Spanish ships, it eventually found a home on the
American porch. In time, it begat that instrument of cordial
courtship, the porch swing.
</P>
<P>
   1509: ART BY THE YARD An artisan makes the first wallpaper _
literally, tacky tapestries _ for use at the master's lodging,
Christ College, Cambridge.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C. 1510: A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP A French upholsterer devises an
improvement to the mattresses of the first half of the millennium,
which consisted of little more than straw, leaves, pine needles and
a convention of bedbugs. His solution is inflatable: the ``wind
bed,'' an early air mattress.
</P>
<P>
   1519: GLITZ Cortes conquers the Aztecs and loots their palaces.
The conquistadors ship home tons of gold, kicking off a craze for
gilt furniture, walls and fixtures unsurpassed until Liberace.
</P>
<P>
   1576: SEE SPOT RUN The terrier-powered rotisserie was a fixture
of the domestic landscape. ``When any meat is to be roasted,'' a
connoisseur of canines wrote, the dogs ``go into a wheel; which
they turn round with the weight of their bodies . . . no drudge nor
scullion can do the feat more cunningly.'' Popular until era of the
ASPCA.
</P>
<P>
   1581: COORDINATING Queen Elizabeth orders one of the first
matching sets of furniture: 19 chairs, six high stools, 24 square
stools and 11 footstools, upholstered in the same material.
</P>
<P>
   1590S: EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE At last, decent storage: The
chest of drawers appears in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   1596: ROYAL FLUSH Sir John Harington, godson of Elizabeth,
installs ``a privy in perfection'' for the queen that features a
primitive flush toilet. He later falls out of favor after
publishing details of her water closet in the poem ``Metamorphosis
of Ajax'' (the title punning on ``a jakes''). It fails to replace
the chamber pot.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   1600s: COMFORT After centuries of making do with straight-back
wooden chairs, the English embrace chairs with wings, or lugs, to
block out drafts.
</P>
<P>
   1636: BAG, BATH &AMP; BEYOND Doctor Sanctorius, a physician
practicing in Padua, dies before convincing his contemporaries to
adopt the ``bag bath,'' a sack filled with water at the neck and
voided from a tube at the bather's feet.
</P>
<P>
   1638: A TASTE FOR TCHOTCHKES Rise of maitres ebenistes _
furniture makers who make cabinets of curiosities for the upper
classes to display newfound collections of manmade and natural
oddities, from two-headed cows and platypus bills to microscopic
engravings. Housemaids everywhere throw up their dust rags and
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   1660s: BAD POSTURE The invention of the back stool heralds a new
desire for comfort among the hoi polloi, who until now have sat on
benches and stools. It later will morph into the side chair.
</P>
<P>
   1687: ROOM WITH A VIEW Bernard Perrot of Orleans, France,
patents a means of rolling plate glass, spurring the production of
full-size windows. The relationship between the inside and the
outside of the home is forever changed. Alas, Windex will not be
invented until 1936.
</P>
<P>
   1721: FIRST DESIGN QUEEN Madame de Pompadour, the future
mistress and adviser of Louis XV, redecorates countless apartments
and halls in the neo-Classical style, introducing concepts of
privacy, intimacy and comfort that trickled down to the nobility
and, eventually, the middle class. It is not known whether she took
a straight commission or charged by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   C.1730: SHADE African slaves arriving in the Southern United
States build houses fitted with porches. Slaveowners and others
quickly adopt the sun-deflecting design to their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   1741: ROBBING THE CRADLE First mention of the quintessential
American rocking chair, inspired by cradles. Europeans never really
got it. When the travel writer Harriet Martineau visited the United
States in the 1830s, she could not help wondering ``how this lazy
and ungraceful indulgence ever became general.''
</P>
<P>
   1763: BREAK OUT THE DISHES Josiah Wedgwood patents his trademark
earthenware. It soon becomes the standard domestic pottery in
England and abroad. Mass produced and relatively inexpensive, it
democratized fine dining and undoubtedly led to the first wedding
registries.
</P>
<P>
   1775: THE FLUSH, REDUX Alexander Cummings, a watchmaker, patents
one of the first practical toilets. It features a cistern overhead,
a valve at the base and a ``stink-trap.'' Unfortunately, what goes
in must come out. (Sewers were rare.) A curiosity until the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   1777: HEAT GETS INTERACTIVE Bonnemain, a French architect,
installs one of the first central heating systems since Roman times
at Chateau de Pecq, with a primitive thermostat to control the flow
of air to the boiler.
</P>
<P>
   1792: READING AFTER DARK William Murdock in Cornwall, England,
lights his home using coal gas. The first gas utility is formed in
1817; by midcentury, most cities had abandoned oil lamps and
candles for the unnatural but vastly superior gaslight.
</P>
<P>
   1797: D.I.Y. Asher Benjamin pens ``The Country Builder's
Assistant,'' one of the first pattern books for homeowners in the
United States _ design manuals for do-it-yourselfers.
</P>
<P>
   1799: BEHIND THE EARS Elizabeth Drinker of Philadelphia writes
of the family's innovative ``shower bath,'' noting ``I bore it
better than expected, not having been wett all over att once, for
28 years past.'' Regular showers remained a novelty until the
mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   1804: COMMON CHARGES The French Civil Code grants a person the
right to own a building or part of a building on land that he or
she does not own: the legal foundation of condominium ownership.
</P>
<P>
   1820s: ALUMINUM CHIC A craze develops among nobles for aluminum
plates and cutlery. Until chemists discovered how to produce
aluminum cheaply and efficiently, it was the must-have metal,
selling for $600 a pound (more expensive than gold).
</P>
<P>
   1826: FIRST EJECTOR SEAT One of the first mentions of
spiral-spring furniture, ruining posture once and for all as
sitters lounge in what the French called the fauteuil comfortable.
Provided, of course, the sharp, metal springs didn't poke through
and impale the sitter (a common event).
</P>
<P>
   1830: NO WORK FOR SHEEP Edwin Beard Budding invents the
lawnmower. Americans, especially, become obsessed with lawns, and
by 1870, the detached home with a manicured yard is desirable,
thanks to the proselytizing of landscape architects. Nature becomes
something to contemplate, not fear. And children's allowances are
never the same again.
</P>
<P>
   1831: DOMESTIC DEBT The first building and loan associations are
formed in Philadelphia, letting people of modest means take out
what was, in effect, a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   1833: HOUSING LIGHTENS UP The first balloon-frame structure goes
up in Chicago, an advance over the heavy-timber frames used since
medieval times. Allows for cheaper yet more durable homes, made
with 2-by-4s and factory-produced nails.
</P>
<P>
   1844: COOL IT Thomas Masters patents the ice box, an insulated
chest to hold blocks of ice. Superseded in the next century by
electric refrigerators beginning with the Domelre (domestic
electric refrigerator) in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   1848: NOT FOR SQUARES Orson Fowler, a phrenologist and
spiritualist, publishes ``A Home for All,'' touting the octagon as
a source of health, efficiency and mystical powers. Thousands of
eight-sided homes are built in the United States before the fever
runs its course and homeowners lose their tempers over a lack of
square, functional rooms.
</P>
<P>
   1854: BUG-FREE ZONES A patent is taken out for a ``mosquito
curtain,'' netting for a sash window. No longer need people face
the grim choice of keeping the windows closed and sweating or
watching insects beat their last on flypaper. It will take 50 years
before wire mesh is mass-produced.
</P>
<P>
   1857: AN IDEA BEFORE ITS TIME Joseph Gayetty introduces
commercially packaged toilet paper, but it doesn't catch on. People
think old newspapers and catalogues do an equally fine job, at no
extra cost. Finally, in the 1880s, hygiene-conscious Victorians
adopt Edward and Clarence Scott's perforated toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   1858: THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE Ezra Warner of Connecticut
invents the can opener 50 years after the invention of the metal
can. It replaces the hammer-and-chisel technique.
</P>
<P>
   1863: FLOORING THE MASSES Frederick Walton invents a flooring of
linseed oil, fillers and cast-off cork shavings that's better than
wood, cheaper than tile. Called linoleum, it has a lifetime of
30-plus years and comes in colors. The combination of ingredients
happen to have antibiotic properties, too, which will make it
popular in nurseries, kitchens and bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   1866: MUSIC TO BATHE BY Victorians love folding furniture, but
the piano bed takes the prize. The piano unfolds to reveal a
writing table, chest of drawers, bed, two cupboards for bed linen
and a wash basin with jug and towel rail. Advertisements helpfully
note that ``It has been found by actual use that this addition to a
pianoforte does not in the least impair its qualities as a musical
instrument.'' Still, a convertible piano has never graced the stage
of Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   1869: CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS Catherine Beecher and
Harriet Beecher Stowe publish ``The American Woman's Home.'' This
volume and its imitators advise middle-class Christian readers how
to manage a clean, comfortable household.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   1870: STYLE BY THE GALLON Henry Alden Sherwin and Edward
Williams concoct the first ready-mixed paint. The subsequent rush
to brush submerges countless hardwood moldings and panels.
</P>
<P>
   1878: CLEAN AND FIT, ALL AT ONCE Scientific American describes a
shower in which the bather jogs up and down, fueling a treadmill to
keep water circulating. Almost as absurd as a bicycle shower, the
``Velo-douche.''
</P>
<P>
   1879: BREATHING ROOM New York City passes laws ensuring that
apartment dwellers have access to fresh air and windows. Reformers
like Jacob Riis continue to campaign for better conditions, and
regulations to be passed in 1901 will mandate minimum room sizes,
larger yards, running water and toilets.
</P>
<P>
   1882: ON THE GRID Thomas Edison contracts with wealthy
Manhattanites to provide electricity for their incandescent lamps.
Homes cease to be self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   1884: REVERSE SNOBBERY The Dakota on Central Park West is
completed. Well-heeled urbanites flock to multiple-unit buildings,
previously a working-class thing.
</P>
<P>
   1886: BEYOND THE PAIL Josephine Cochrane, a socialite living in
Illinois, loses patience with servants breaking her china and
invents the Cochrane Dishwasher, a precursor to the washers in most
homes today.
</P>
<P>
   1889: ORDERING IN George Barber begins shipping the world's
first mass-prefabricated homes by rail from his factory in
Knoxville, Tenn. In 1907, Sears, Roebuck will introduce mail-order
homes (with plans, paint, materials and nails) from $595 to a
$5,000 mansion).
</P>
<P>
   1893: FIRM BUTTOCKS IN A HALF-HOUR Exercising at home becomes
increasingly acceptable. In Germany, Friederich Mayer's climbing
machine, complete with a mask and mouthpiece, is the first home
stairmaster to simulate high-altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   1893: SCIENTIFIC HOME, HAPPY HOME National Home Economics
Association is founded to teach women how to run their homes more
efficiently. It pioneers the science of domestic engineering taught
in high schools across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   1901: THE GREAT SUCK-UP Die, dust bunny, die: H. Cecil Booth
patents the first vacuum cleaner, a steam-powered monstrosity that
sucks almost anything into its greedy nozzle. Upper-class women
throw tea parties to celebrate the arrival of the men from ``BVC.''
Booth was soon wiped out by the portable cleaners W.H. Hoover
introduced in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   1917: UNIVERSAL DESIGN Six American manufacturers settle on a
standard appliance plug and socket for electrical power, paving the
way for the electrification of the home.
</P>
<P>
   1918: CURE FOR THE CITY SQUEEZE Lawrence Murphy of San Francisco
develops his eponymous bed in response to the housing crunch. It
will superseded by the convertible sofa bed, the Japanese futon and
today's inflatable Aero mattress.
</P>
<P>
   1920: THE EARS HAVE IT Home radios displace the piano and
gramophone and become the new focus of family life.
</P>
<P>
   1927: MOBILE NATION On wheels, for the modern nomad, the
Dymaxion House by Buckminster Fuller is the precursor to the less
visionary but more affordable mobile homes, Airstreams and the
trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   1928: KICK BACK Edwin Shoemaker and Edward Knobloch build the
first La-Z-Boy in a Michigan garage. Shoemaker, 90, recently died
while asleep in his invention.
</P>
<P>
   1929: OPEN, SEZ ME Rudimentary smart-house design: Electric
garage door opener makes its debut, found on a post outside the
newly invented garage. The hand-held remote will come in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   1930s: HOMES ON THE RANGE Cliff May designs some of the first
ranch homes, the future house of choice for families moving to the
postwar burbs. Ranch homes were cheap and, as noted, ``even a poor
architect has a hard time making a spreading, one-story house
unattractive.''
</P>
<P>
   1932: CANNED AIR First room air-conditioners go on sale (though
most Americans can't afford them), putting the kebosh on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   1939: BAD LIGHTING Visitors to the World's Fair get their first
glimpse of fluorescent lighting, a more energy-efficient means of
illumination. Inexplicably, bathrooms across the nation are fitted
with the flickering, unflattering lights _ and correspondingly,
heavy makeup becomes popular.
</P>
<P>
   1945: THE NEW BABY SITTER Available since 1939, televisions
become popular after the war and soon command living rooms as men
discover the natural link between La-Z-Boy recliners and
Sunday-afternoon football.
</P>

NO. 2 FIGURE IN JAPANESE POISON-GAS CULT IS FREED FROM JAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Amid an explosion of camera flashes and a frenzy of
speculation over future threats from the sect, Japan Wednesday
released the charismatic spokesman of the religious cult
responsible for the deadly gas attack on Tokyo's subway system in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Fumihiro Joyu, 37, is the group's de facto No. 2
figure. He had been imprisoned since 1997 on perjury charges
unrelated to the attack with sarin gas, which killed 12 people and
injured more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   A white van carrying Joyu from a prison in Hiroshima for a
flight to Tokyo and another van that took him from Haneda Airport
were tracked by helicopter-borne cameras broadcasting live on
national television. On the ground, an army of other journalists
followed him in cars as he made his way from the airport toward the
Hilton Hotel in Shinjuku, one of the Tokyo's most crowded
districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Joyu's release, hand wringing was
rampant in Japan about the possible resurrection of his group, Aum
Shinrikyo, under the leadership of a man who was once _ even
shortly after the attack _ as popular as any rock star in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The doe-eyed Joyu's boyish good looks and reputation for cunning
made him a teen idol for both sexes and have long been considered
to be among his sect's greatest assets.
</P>
<P>
   Aum's paramount leader, the blind guru-like figure Shoko
Asahara, 44, is currently on trial on charges of ordering the
subway attack. Two of the group's other leaders have been convicted
and may face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Joyu was leading Aum's Russian chapter at the time and was not
charged in the attack. He was detained in a Hiroshima prison on
perjury charges relating to an illegal real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the deepening sense of public disapproval toward the
group, Joyu was denied a room at the hotel and spent the next
several hours wending his way around the city, reporters in tow, in
search of a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the group settled on housing him in the apartment of
another member in the nearby city of Yokohama, where television
crews and more than 100 reporters quickly set up their stakeout
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The circus that followed drew crowds of onlookers and protests
from right-wing groups circulating in sound trucks blasting slogans
like: ``Out with Aum! Out with Joyu!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have him in a neighboring building, but there
is nothing I can do about it'' said Yoko Kawabata, a grocery store
owner whose shop abuts the apartment building where Joyu is
apparently staying. ``I cannot forgive Aum as a group. They've
committed too many crimes. But I don't think Joyu in particular is
guilty, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyu planned to hold a news conference on his release from jail,
but a mob scene outside the prison seemed to have taken him aback,
causing him to change plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was originally planning to give a press conference here, but
for various reasons, I am sorry to say that I have decided to
cancel it,'' Joyu said in a written statement issued in his name by
Aum Shinrikyo.
</P>
<P>
   In the only indication of his plans, he said he was returning to
the sect, in Tokyo, but intended to ``rest quietly for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly in anticipation of his release, the government recently
won passage of a new law giving it broad powers to suppress any
organization that has committed ``indiscriminate mass murder during
the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   By February the country's Public Security Examination Commission
is widely expected to rule that the government may apply the new
law to Aum, thereby requiring the group to submit reports on its
members' activities and assets every three months.
</P>
<P>
   Aum Shinrikyo, for its part, has fought back with something of a
charm campaign recently, apologizing for the sarin attack for the
first time and making an unusual pledge to refrain from recruiting
new members.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been heated speculation in recent days,
experts are as divided about the group's future as they are about
Joyu's future role.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who have long followed Aum say the group faces a
difficult choice in deciding what public role Joyu should now
assume.
</P>
<P>
   Shoko Egawa, one authority on the group, described Joyu as
something of an organizational genius who has ``aggressively taken
part in the management of the cult,'' but who has come to be deeply
associated in the public mind with the gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after his release he may provide a kind of stimulus to
the group,'' Ms. Egawa said. ``But Aum understands that if they use
him as a front man they will be damaged, because if they have a man
who was involved in the sarin attack as a spokesman, it proves that
the group hasn't changed.''

 &HT;    Kelly starts, but Dorsey will play
 &HT;    By Jorge Milian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Florida _ The University of Miami's quarterback
riddle has been solved, but the intrigue continues.
</P>
<P>
   Following Tuesday's practice at a local high school, UM coach
Butch Davis announced that Kenny Kelly would start Saturday's Gator
Bowl against Georgia Tech. Ken Dorsey, the freshman who started the
Hurricanes' final three regular-season games, is the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't leave it in limbo,'' Davis said of UM's
quarterback situation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he told Kelly and Dorsey of his decision during a
meeting Monday night, but both quarterbacks said after Tuesday's
practice they had no knowledge of the coach's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' Kelly said. ``I didn't know anything. It's a shock
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey, standing next to Kelly, looked quizzically at reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody said anything to me,'' Dorsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he chose Kelly as the starter because the sophomore
had proven during the past few weeks that he was physically ready
to play again. Kelly sustained a slight tear of the medial
collateral ligament against Virginia Tech on Nov. 13 and had missed
the Hurricanes' past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kelly) has earned the opportunity,'' Davis said. ``He's
worked extraordinarily hard the last four weeks to get himself
healthy to come back and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis stressed that Dorsey also would play early.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey quarterbacked the Hurricanes to three straight victories
in Kelly's absence, leading UM to155 points while completing
64-of-91 passes for 718 yards, nine touchdowns and one
interception. Dorsey set a UM freshman record by throwing four
touchdown passes in the Hurricanes' 55-0 victory against Temple in
the regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, anyone wants to start, but there's no
disappointment,'' Dorsey said.
</P>
<P>
   How much Dorsey will play, Davis wasn't ready to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a 50-50 split or 60-40,'' Davis said. ``I'm not
really concerned about it. The quarterback that is playing well and
moving the ball will get the lion's share of the snaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from past experience, Dorsey's snaps may be limited.
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan Clement was UM's starting quarterback two seasons ago,
Davis often said backup Scott Covington would play. But Covington
rarely did and when he did get an opportunity, it was usually for
no more than one or two series.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly hasn't thrown a pass since the third quarter of UM's 43-10
loss to Virginia Tech. Before that, Kelly was both brilliant and
baffling this season. He threw 14 touchdown passes in nine games,
but also had 15 throws intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to simulate game speed in practice, but once
Kenny gets a few plays under his belt and throws a few passes, he
should be fine,'' UM center Ty Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   All UM players asked Tuesday said they weren't aware of Davis'
decision to go with Kelly and really didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been a big issue,'' guard Richard Mercier said.
``I'm surprised there's been so little conversation about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the uncertainty over who would start had not affected
his relationship with Dorsey. The two players are roommates on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a personality thing,'' Kelly said. ``We don't let
that get in our heads. The main thing for both of us is that we
want to win.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YARMOUTH, Nova Scotia _ For Ashton Spinney, who has fished the
Bay of Fundy since the early 1960s, the conflict this fall with
Mi'kmaq Indians over the lobster catch was ``the only time in my
lifetime we were at the brink of civil war in my community.'' At
stake is Atlantic Canada's most valuable fish harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Lobster War,'' the obscenity-laced confrontations on
the town wharf here had relatively mild consequences: only one
Indian boat sunk and several dozen lobster pots sabotaged.
</P>
<P>
   But up north, in Burnt Church, New Brunswick, Mi'kmaq losses
totaled 2,000 lobster pots vandalized, a prayer tower burned to the
ground, and three Indians hospitalized after whites rammed their
pickup truck. Whites vandalized three plants that were processing
lobster for native fishermen. Indians apparently retaliated by
burning white-owned property _ an empty house and two pickup
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   What set off the dispute was a Canadian Supreme Court ruling in
September that interpreted a 1760 British treaty to allow the
Mi'kmaq tribes of Atlantic Canada to fish for profit year round
without license or limit. The turmoil that ensued so startled the
court that in November it issued a rare clarification, reimposing
federal seasons and licenses on native fishing.
</P>
<P>
   But with Mi'kmaq fishermen vowing to fish out of season this
summer, people in this village of white-painted cottages fear that
they are only living through an uneasy truce.
</P>
<P>
   This fall's violence may be a harbinger for an increasingly
common clash. On one side, increasingly assertive Indian tribes are
winning more and more support from urban judges. On the other side,
rural non-Indian Canadians are watching familiar geography change
hands before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an explosion of Indian land claims, the federal
government is now reviewing about 280 new claims and is negotiating
210. By one government estimate, settlement of Indian land claims
could cost $140 billion over coming decades. When the process is
over, Indian control over land in Canada's 10 provinces may rise
from 0.3 percent today to as as much as 10 percent. By comparison,
Indians control about 2 percent of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in Saskatchewan recently awarded the Lac La Ronge tribe
a reserve of 1,216 square miles, the largest Indian land settlement
in the history of that prairie province. Under an 1876 treaty, the
federal government was to set aside 128 acres for each tribe
member, 484 people at the time. But, with the tribal population now
nearing 7,000, it could cost taxpayers as much as $200 million to
buy needed land from neighboring white farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   On Canada's Pacific Coast, in northern British Columbia, a
treaty was drawn up to give the 5,000-member Nisga'a tribe its
traditional homeland, 770 square miles, and committing the federal
and provincial governments to pay the Nisga'a $380 million,
transition costs that fiscally conservative critics call excessive.
(The province's House of Commons voted on Dec. 15 to approve the
treaty after a 42-hour filibuster, the longest in Canadian
history.)
</P>
<P>
   Noting that overlapping claims by British Columbia's 197 tribes
now exceed the size of the province, Diane Francis, a columnist for
the newspaper The National Post, attacked the treaty as ``a hideous
giveaway,'' adding that many tribes ``already get excessive and
unjustifiable special entitlements.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nova Scotia, Mi'kmaq claims have clouded the opening this
winter of the largest economic project in the province's history, a
$2.7 billion natural gas development that is to ship 460 million
cubic feet of gas a day to New England from offshore fields near
Sable Island.
</P>
<P>
   But, around Canada, the sharpest white-Indian clash this year
was the Lobster War.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the tip of Nova Scotia that faces Maine, the 963 holders
of lobster licenses pulled around $120 million worth of lobsters
from the ocean floor during last year's six-month season, which
started at the end of November. The catch has become so lucrative
that lobster licenses have jumped in value over the last 30 years
from 25 cents to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   With young men mortgaging their parents' houses to buy licenses,
lobstermen felt deeply threatened this fall when the Supreme Court
threw open the fishery to all registered Mi'kmaq, a tribe that
numbers about 12,000 in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt their whole livelihood was at stake,'' said Tim J.
Surette, the regional federal fisheries officer here. Recalling the
sight of 600 lobster boats massing in the harbor here, he added,
``It was a very dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the racial fence, Mi'kmaq Indian elders
remember that many white lobstermen got into the business in the
1970s when the provincial government gave them loans for boats. The
province did not extend these start-up loans to Indians, saying
that they were a federal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mi'kmaq grew up believing that all fishing
resources here are traditionally theirs. Frank Meuse, a chief here,
said, ``It is a resource that belongs to every Mi'kmaq man, woman
and child.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pictou, one of a handful of Mi'kmaq fishermen to be granted
a lobster license recently, agreed, saying: ``The resource belongs
to us. We shared it for all these years, but somewhere along the
line, `share' became `take.'''
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong fisherman who openly admits that he fished on the
``so-called black market'' for years, Pictou believes that tensions
will jump again this summer, when he intends to fish outside a
season he says does not apply to Mi'kmaq.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, his cousin, James Pictou, sailed up to Grand
Bank, Newfoundland, to fish crabs out of season. On the night of
Oct. 26, four white vigilantes invaded the house where he was
staying, took his clothes and belongings into the street and burned
them.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the story, Mike Pictou, concluded laconically, ``I
guess they didn't want him up there.''

THE PATCHWORK QUILT, AS MEMORIAL AND ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Colo., Va., Ore., Ill.)  (rk) 
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The patchwork quilt is a fitting metaphor for the collection of
individual and group home pages, museum sites and store listings
that make up the community of quilters on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Quilting Page (ttsw.com/MainQuiltingPage.html),
which bills itself as the world's oldest and largest quilting site,
is an excellent place to start. It has detailed ``how-to'' guides
for beginners, patterns, links to quilting guilds, a directory of
stores by region, and information on fabrics, book reviews and
software.
</P>
<P>
   There are also web rings for quilters, which offer enthusiastic
individuals a chance to show off their work and share patterns on
personal pages, as well as links to many stores selling fabric,
patterns, books and sewing notions. The Quilt A Round Webring home
page (members.tripod.com/TigerRose/joinring.html), for instance,
has links to 207 sites.
</P>
<P>
   A history of quilting at Womenfolk
(www.womenfolk.com/grandmothers/history.htm) covers, among other
things, Civil War, Amish and Depression-era quilts and those by
women of color and native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Quilting reached its height of popularity during the 19th and
early 20th centuries. Victorian crazy quilts, for example, featured
abstract patterns and images of animals or people sewn from oddly
shaped pieces and geometric shapes in luxurious fabrics like
velvets, silks and brocades. Elaborate stitching held the pieces
together, and patterns and ideas were exchanged in women's
magazines and pattern books.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, quilters have given their designs unusual names:
the ``drunkards path,'' for instance, is a pattern with blue and
white fabric, the colors representing the temperance movement, and
the ``log cabin'' pattern invokes a building with strips of fabric
representing the logs, which are sewn around a center square,
traditionally made of red material to signify the fire in a central
hearth.
</P>
<P>
   There are several museums dedicated to quilt collecting and
scholarship, including the New England Quilt Museum in Lowell,
Mass. (www.nequiltmuseum.org/default.htm); the Rocky Mountain Quilt
Museum in Golden, Colo. (www.rmqm.org/); the Virginia Quilt Museum
in Harrisonburg, Va. (www.folkart.com/latitude/museums/mvqm.htm)
and the Lattimer Quilt and Textile Center in Tillamook, Ore.
(www.oregoncoast.com/latimertextile/).
</P>
<P>
   Quilting can be a private passion, but it also can be a social
activity in ways that other hobbies like model ship building or
painting are not. The modern successor to the quilting bee, the
quilting guild, is part coffee klatsch, part sew-in, part art
appreciation class and part trading community. Guilds are listed by
region at McCall's Quilting
(www.quiltersnewsletter.com/mccalls/guilds.htm) and at
Quiltlinks.com (www.quiltlinks.com/quiltguild.htm), which also has
a list of quilt shows.
</P>
<P>
   Quilts have frequently figured in charitable work. As far back
as the Civil War, quilts were sewn and sold on both sides of the
Mason-Dixon line to support the war effort. Today, organizations as
diverse as the Gatlinsburg Garden Club
(www.gosmokies.com/insidethepark/news/fq022599.html) and the Lupus
Foundation of America (www.visi.com/cindy/LUPUS.HTM) benefit from
quilt sales and raffles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest quilt in America is The NAMES Project AIDS
Memorial Quilt (www.aidsquilt.org). Each of the more than 42,000
panels in the quilt, which measure 3 feet by 6 feet, bears the name
of someone who has died from AIDS. The project site can be searched
by name or by ``block,'' a section of several panels. Block 1958 _
one of more than 5,000 _ is a memorial to Charles ``Chuck'' Shouse,
Glenn Young, Jeffrey Versalle, Lloyd Norwood, Scott Eric Willroth,
Steven Narus and two men identified only as Billy and Joey.
</P>
<P>
   Quilters can buy everything they need online. Quilting Books
Unlimited (www.qbu.com) is a store in Batavia, Ill. which has 2,000
titles. Fabrics, from reproduction designs from the 1880s to those
inspired by the rain forests, are available at Pine Tree Quiltworks
(www.pinetree.quiltworks.com/). There is even a site for sewing
machine needles and threads: Schmetz Needles
(www.schmetzneedles.com).

U.N. TRIBUNAL PLAYS DOWN ITS SCRUTINY OF NATO ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Officials of the tribunal investigating
war crimes in the Balkans said Wednesday that a study of possible
Western crimes in the recent Kosovo war is a preliminary, internal
document that is highly unlikely to produce indictments or even be
published.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were quick to play down the importance of the
study, which was requested in August by the United Nations' chief
prosecutor at the time, Louise Arbour. The report, which was
completed last week by the tribunal's senior legal adviser, will be
studied over the holidays by the current chief prosecutor, Carla
Del Ponte, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the study was reported on Sunday by the British
newspaper The Observer in an interview with Mrs. Del Ponte. But
Mrs. Del Ponte emphasized that the tribunal had more pressing tasks
than prosecuting the Western leaders who have been most supportive
of the tribunal, including the extension of current indictments of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and four of his top
associates to possibly include charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my priority, because I have inquiries about genocide,
about bodies in mass graves,'' she told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's spokesman, Paul Risley, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday that the study was an appropriate response to
public concerns about NATO's tactics. ``It is very important for
this tribunal to assert its authority over any and all parties to
the armed conflict within the former Yugoslavia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has not been indicted for actions in Bosnia, however,
leading to criticism from Belgrade, Moscow, Beijing and elsewhere
that the tribunal has bent to pressure from the United States to
bring an indictment over Kosovo. But tribunal officials say that
Washington in particular has been reluctant to hand over relevant
intelligence about Bosnia that touched Milosevic or the late
Croatian president, Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal can charge only individuals with crimes, not
states, institutions or organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report is understood to be a legal analysis of
the basis for bringing charges of war crimes for NATO activities
like the bombing of civilian power stations and bridges, which NATO
said had military uses. The report also examines the wide use of
cluster munitions, which NATO said were being used only against
airfields and other military targets, although some fell into
populated areas, like the grounds of a hospital in the center of
Nis, in central Serbia. The study looks at the history of such
weapons and how they have been used in previous wars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As an internal document, it will not be released to the public,
Risley said. If Mrs. Del Ponte decides to take no further action,
the document will be filed for use by later historians. If she
decides to order work on preparing indictments of individuals, the
document would simply provide useful background information.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal currently relies on NATO troops in Bosnia to
capture and hand over those charged with war crimes who still live
there, and Mrs. Del Ponte has pushed NATO governments to do more to
capture notable figures like Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian
Serb leader, who is said by Western officials to move between
Montenegro and the Foca area of Bosnia, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the
former Bosnian Serb military commander, who is thought to live in
Serbia.

HOW TO GROW SWEET PEAS ON THE ROOF AND SAVE SEEDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible to grow old-fashioned sweet peas in
containers? I have a large, sunny planting area on my roof and have
been fairly successful with other annuals.
</P>
<P>
   A. They'll grow, no problem. Whether they'll give you much in
the way of flowers is another question. Sweet peas (Lathyrus
odoratus) bloom best where long, cool springs are followed by mild
summers. They must get plenty of water, so coaxing them to do well
on a Manhattan roof is going to be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by selecting heat-tolerant modern varieties, like
Spencers. Then, maximize your portion of cool spring weather by
starting seeds indoors, in individual peat pots, in late February
or early March.
</P>
<P>
   Plant about one and a half inches deep, and keep the soil evenly
moist but not wet. They will germinate and grow best at 60 to 65
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet peas need to start climbing early in order to form robust
plants. They'll sulk forever if they're denied support in their
youth, so when they're about four inches long, insert 10-inch twigs
(or bamboo skewers) about a half inch from the stems. You can set
plants outside as soon as nighttime temperatures usually stay at 40
degrees Fahrenheit or above _ late March or early April. Once
they're acclimated to the outdoors, light freezes won't hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   For their rooftop home, choose a container at least 10 inches
deep, and fill it with rich, slightly alkaline soil. The outside of
the container should be white or a pale color that will not absorb
heat, and it should be placed where it will be lightly shaded in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Set the plants two inches apart in each direction, and give them
five-foot strings or something similar to climb. You can be
creative about this, but don't ask them to embrace uncoated wire,
which would turn hot.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed Spencers are widely sold in garden stores. Named varieties
are available from Fragrant Garden Nursery, P.O. Box 627, Canby,
Ore. 97013; telephone (503) 263-6643; catalog, $1; and from
Thompson &AMP; Morgan, P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, N.J. 08527; telephone
(800) 274-7333; catalog free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEED SAVING 101
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are beginning vegetable gardeners eager to save our own
seeds. We know we must avoid hybrid varieties. Can you provide any
other tips?  &QL; 
A. To start with, start slowly. Seed saving isn't difficult, but it
does add one more class to your course load at Food Grower's U.
There are significant differences between the reproductive systems
of common vegetables, and you'll have the best luck if you confine
your first efforts to the ones that are easiest to manage.
</P>
<P>
   That means self-pollinating annuals, like tomatoes, beans and
peas. They flower and set seed in one season, you can eat some
fruit from the seed-bearing plants, and they do not require wide
separation from other varieties to make seeds that are true to the
parent type.
</P>
<P>
   You can grow and save as many different kinds as you want, as
long as they are about 25 feet apart. That's enough to prevent
accidental interbreeding.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've chosen which varieties to save, get ready for the
fun part: fine-tuning them to suit your situation. Notice which
plants are the healthiest, and mark them with a twist tie. Use
another color twist tie to mark the earliest producers. Choose a
third color for tastiness, another for heavy crops. By the end of
the season, with any luck you'll have at least one or two plants
that sport multiple ties. Save the seeds from those. After a few
seasons, you'll have a custom-tailored garden no amount of money
could buy off the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you may (or may not) want to move on to the
advanced class. Squash, for instance, is cross-pollinated by bees.
To keep varieties true to type, put them in mesh cages and
pollinate them by hand. Corn is cross-pollinated by the wind, so
plan to separate your plantings by at least a quarter mile.
</P>
<P>
   Want to save biennials like carrots and onions, which don't
flower until their second year? Unless you live where they can
survive winter in the ground, plan to dig them up, keep them
dormant in cold storage, and then replant in spring.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's a lot to it. But there is also a lot of
help, some of it provided in the catalogs of companies that
specialize in heirloom seeds. These include Southern Exposure Seed
Exchange, P.O. Box 460, Mineral, Va. 23117; telephone (540)
894-9480; catalog, $2; and Fedco Seeds, P.O. Box 520, Waterville,
Maine 04903; telephone (207) 873-7333 catalog, $2.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q.&AMP; A., The New York Times, 229 West
43rd Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to
gardening(at)nytimes &QC; .com. Those of general interest will be
published. Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.

MCCAIN FUND RAISING SURGES, BUT IT'S STILL SHORT OF BUSH'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain's ability to raise campaign
funds has improved with his rising standings in the polls, but he
lags far behind the phenomenal fund-raising of Governor George W.
Bush of Texas, according to year-end figures reported by the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising total, as posted on Bush's campaign Web site,
exceeds $63 million for 1999. McCain said Wednesday that he has
collected $15.6 million, which, when bolstered by matching federal
funds, would give him $21 million for the year. Bush has decided
not to take matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain has garnered media attention, and has risen in the
polls in New Hampshire and elsewhere, the pace of his fund-raising
has accelerated. His campaign said it had raised $6.1 million in
the fourth quarter, and at times approached $1 million a week.
McCain doubled his previous quarterly mark, of $3 million in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, former Senator Bill Bradley appeared to
have capitalized on his improved position in the polls to raise
about twice as much money as Al Gore in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley announced Wednesday that he has collected $27 million in
1999, including $8 million in the fourth quarter. The Gore campaign
had no final results, but campaign officials said they had met
their fourth-quarter predictions, raising $4 million since Oct. 1
for a year-end total of about $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fourth quarter, his best yet, allowed him to spend
$10.4 million on television advertising and on other costs, while
leaving $8.3 million in cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, both Democratic candidates are accepting matching
federal money and are bound by fund-raising and spending limits.
Bradley and Gore each expect to collect more than $10 million in
federal funds early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain's fund-raising lags behind Bush's, Bradley's and
Gore's, his campaign war chest should permit him to be competitive
in the first round of primaries. This is a significant achievement,
since four Republican candidates have dropped out of the race,
citing fund-raising woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the $20 million that everyone says is the price of
getting into the poker game,'' said Howard Opinsky, a McCain
campaign spokesman. ``The over $21 million the McCain campaign will
have raised, had matched, or transferred, is more than
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, did not dispute the McCain
campaign's assertions, claims but wondered how those drawn to the
senator's support for campaign finance reform would view his
energetic fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to have shifted his focus from speeches dealing with
campaign finance reform to holding fund-raising events,'' said
Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   And though McCain ``appears to have gotten the resources to run
a campaign in two or three states,'' he has yet to raise the
Opinsky, McCain's spokesman, responded, ``What you need more than
money is ideas and a message.'' In contrast to Bush, he said, ``we
have a good message, and we'll be able to spend enough to get it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gary Bauer said his campaign would report $7
million in contributions this year and expected an additional $4.4
million in federal matching funds. The campaigns of Steve Forbes,
Senator Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes did not respond Wednesday to
requests for their fund-raising totals.
</P>
<P>
   Several campaigns noted the Internet is playing an increasingly
important role in campaign finance. Bradley has raised more than
$1.2 million from his Web page, and McCain topped the $1 million
mark in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, meanwhile, announced it is improving its
Web-based campaign reporting system. Bush's groundbreaking system
that lists every contribution on the campaign website has been
criticized by rivals for being difficult to search and for lagging
two weeks behind the actual totals.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is cutting in half the delay between the time
a contribution is collected and posted, said Tucker, and will now
provide the data in an easily searchable format.

THE NEXT WAVE? 3-D COULD BRING ON A SEA CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal and other publications.

<P>
   As we reset the Great Clock, new technologies are appearing by
the minute. Some filmmakers who have worked in the medium believe
that large-format 3-D is the wave of the cinematic future _ ``the
next click,'' in the words of Brett Leonard, director of ``T-Rex:
Back to the Cretaceous,'' a 1998 film that has become the most
popular large-format title to date.
</P>
<P>
   From this viewer's perspective, however, large-format 3-D looks
to be something more interesting than that, as distinct from
conventional cinema as symphonies from opera or poetry from prose
fiction, with a potential for greatness all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ``We Are Born Stars,'' an 11-minute history of
the universe created for the Fujitsu Pavilion at Expo '85 in Japan,
the large-format 3-D catalog now numbers 16 main attractions. Apart
from Christine Edzard's ``Imax Nutcracker'' (1997), a non-singing,
non-dancing holiday treat to rival Madame Tussaud's (based on the
same E.T.A. Hoffmann tale that inspired Tchaikovsky), each of them
springs surprises inconceivable in any other form .
</P>
<P>
   Runaway blobs of paint caroming through space (Roman Kroitor and
Peter Stephenson's lighter-than-air cartoon ``Paint Misbehavin',''
1997). A sky that hangs overhead not like a dome but like the lid
of an azure box, painted with clouds ( Leonard's ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
The Magic Box,'' 1999). Spherical holograms and luminous technical
displays that glow in midair (Allan Kroeker's ``L5: First City in
Space,''1996). Beyond image or point of view, what gives these
moments their charge is the sensation of physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   Stereoscopic photography, the technical heart of the medium,
supplies two slightly shifted ``flat'' perspectives of each image,
one for each eye. Still or moving, it has a long history. But the
large-format cinematic variety takes a quantum leap. Associated
with Imax Corp., a Toronto-based company that developed all aspects
of the system from cameras and sound to its proprietary projectors
and theater design, large-format 3-D has been picked up by
producers including Sony Pictures Classics, L-Squared Entertainment
and Mandalay Media Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your parents' 3-D!'' trumpets the trailer for Ben
Stassen's ``Encounter in the Third Dimension,'' which opened last
year. Beneath the cloak of zany escapism, the film incorporates a
casual survey of 3-D from its tentative beginnings to the present
day. We see the very first, very brief three-dimensional film clip,
``L'Arrivee du Train,'' shot by the Lumiere brothers in black and
white in Paris in 1903. For original audiences, we are told, the
illusion of an oncoming train was so potent that they ran
panic-stricken from the theater. The chronicle continues with
stereoscopic images _ wittily including people in exotic dress and
far-off lands gazing through stereoscopes at other stereoscopic
images. Vintage horror hokum from midcentury gets an airing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Stassen's original material features a dizzy supporting cast of
gadgets with a life of their own, a mad scientist and Elvira, the
bouncy Morticia Addams-type cult personality, who is imprisoned in
two dimensions. For those who miss the point, her little song and
dance about a haunted house is frozen in midphrase, someone gives
her a push and she falls over _ a cardboard cutout.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Stassen makes a joke of a glitch attentive viewers may
occasionally be troubled by elsewhere in the large-format 3-D
canon: the illusion of depth without the illusion of roundness and
solidity. Ghosting can be a problem too, not to mention the spacey
phenomenon of bodies that look round but empty, like soap bubbles.
As Stassen shows, a flaw consciously exploited ceases to be a flaw.
In what may be his wildest flourish of drop-dead bravura, he
presents a pre-title sequence ``behind'' the movie screen, which
hangs there like a dusty windshield. Then the words of the title
appear, blasting through one flying letter at a time, shattering
the ``screen'' and leaving the view crystal-clear.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the Imax variety isn't your parents' 3-D. What is it? Some
technical data may be in order. Your parents' 3-D _ Hitchcock's
``Dial M for Murder'' and George Sidney's ``Kiss Me, Kate'' from
the 1950s and Andy Warhol's retro ``Flesh for Frankenstein'' from
the 1970s, among the more ambitious titles; Andre de Toth's ``House
of Wax,'' starring Vincent Price, Arthur Hilton's ``Cat Women of
the Moon'' and ``It Came From Outer Space'' and ``Creature From the
Black Lagoon,'' both directed by Jack Arnold, among the more
representative _ was shot on film stock of standard size, shown on
screens of standard size and viewed through special glasses that
were flimsy and fit poorly over regular glasses, with splitting
headaches the frequent result. The scripts (seldom top-drawer) were
conventional movie scripts. In short, your parents' 3-D was
ordinary movies plus an illusion of depth.
</P>
<P>
   And the Imax variety? The stock measures 15 by 70 mm per frame,
10 times the size of the 35-mm films shown in the conventional
multiplex, but delivering a brighter and clearer image over a
vastly larger area. How much brighter? The light from a xenon bulb
in an Imax projector is so powerful that we could see it with the
naked eye from the surface of the new moon. The screen size varies
widely. ``We like to say to eight stories high and even wider'' is
the official word from an Imax spokesman, who gives the dimensions
for the screen at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, the first Imax
theater in a multiplex, as 75.6 feet high by 97.6 feet. The format
provides a ``natural'' field of vision that effectively has no edge
or frame. Eyewear comes in two styles, both designed to fit
comfortably over corrective glasses. The heavier,
interplanetary-looking type has a built-in personal stereo system,
for spatially enhanced sound effects. Partly for economic reasons,
films in Imax 3-D are short. But eyestrain is a factor, too. By the
end of a feature, many viewers are starting to experience
discomfort. The longest of them clock in at 50 minutes, some at
only 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically,'' says Richard Gelfond, co-chairman and co-chief
executive of the Imax Corp., ``Imax made its mark by taking people
where they couldn't go themselves. To the top of Everest or the
bottom of the ocean.'' A large-format cinematic answer to National
Geographic, in other words, a spectacular notch or two above
``Nova.'' Just the ticket for museums of natural history.
</P>
<P>
   That market segment still exists. But since 1987, the number of
Imax theaters has jumped from the original one in Vancouver to 77
worldwide (36 of them in the United States). Another 85 are in
development (about half of them in the United States).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new facilities are free-standing; others are like
the Sony Imax in Manhattan, tucked into a multiplex. Filling the
seats will take more than kelp forests and frolicking seals,
perennial favorites though such things are. In the expanding Imax
universe, picturesque travelogues _ ``Across the Sea of Time''
(1995), for instance, which stars New York City past and present,
or ``Mark Twain's America'' (1998), both by Stephen Low _ now
compete with old-school scientific documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, to combine delight with instruction,
as in John Weiley's ``Imagine,'' produced for Expo '93 in Taejon,
Korea. Between segments on depth perception came inspired set
pieces illustrating the educational points. One, a speedboat ride
down a gorge, was shot so as to simulate what we would see if our
eyes were spaced more widely than they are. Apart from the promised
optical effect, the scene confuses our perception: not only does
the colossal landscape look tiny, as if we were viewing it through
the wrong end of a telescope, but it also seems strangely fake,
like a meticulous scale model.
</P>
<P>
   In another set piece, Weiley showed how minimal movement in an
object allows the eye to ``construct'' the object's contours even
if they cannot be directly seen. From a flat white field
irregularly dotted with black spots emerged a spinning disc, a
rotating cube and a real, live elephant, waving its trunk close
enough for a viewer to tickle. For an encore, Weiley presented an
aquatic ballet by the modern-dance troupe Momix, involving sylphs
and ladders and a human salamander whose tail was longer than his
legs. It was projected upside down, so the performers seemed to
dive  &UR; up  &LR; through a wavy floor of silver. I forget Weiley's
theoretical point, if there was one, but the sequence was sheer
bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Prophetic, too. Entertainment pure and simple is shaping up as a
dominant mode for the large-format 3-D of the future. For other
prototypes, look at ``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' and
``Siegfried &AMP; Roy: The Magic Box,'' both by Brett Leonard. Cirque
du Soleil's ``Journey of Man,'' a sort of New Age ``Wizard of Oz''
punctuated with glamorous circus acts filmed in gorgeous
surroundings, is coming soon (and probably would be coming sooner
if, as of Jan. 1, Disney had not pre-empted many Imax flagships for
four months of ``Fantasia/2000,'' which is definitely 2-D).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, we are promised 3-D versions of ``Gulliver's
Travels'' and Stephen King's ``Sun Dog'' (featuring a diabolical
Polaroid camera) _ not to mention Homer Simpson. ``Cyberworld,'' a
``Fantasia''-style potpourri of phantasmagoric high-tech animation,
is also in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   As currently available technologies get cheaper, a prospect that
Imax executives assure me is no fantasy, original classics like
``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and the ``Star Wars'' series will
reappear in new editions, computer-enhanced for 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   The artistic touchstone of large-format 3-D, meanwhile, and
likely to remain so, is Stephen Low's ``Last Buffalo,'' created for
the Suntory Pavilion at Expo '90 in Osaka, Japan. Leonard calls it
``a visual poem.'' Or rather a symphony? Its message, told without
a word of text, is easy to intuit, yet hard to paraphrase.
</P>
<P>
   This is what we see. In alternating segments, Low shows wildlife
of the Canadian wilderness and a sculptor at his forge, pouring and
pounding sheets and rods of metal into a life-size buffalo. Under
the open sky, clouds and shadows of a day wash over canyons in a
moment. Looming before us, gigantically larger than life, a mother
buffalo licks clean her newborn calf. Mountain lion, buffalo and
rattlesnake wage their ancient warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Wading birds, filmed from below the water, pick the surface,
sending circles rippling where we suspected only air. Indoors,
rivers of molten metal threaten to flow into our laps, sparks spray
at our faces and wheels whir in air, the spokes dissolved through
rotation, like those of the spinning wheel in the Velazquez
allegory ``The Fable of Arachne.'' At the close, we pass one last
time through the studio. A desolate metal menagerie hangs in the
wind, and the sculptor is gone, replaced by himself in effigy, a
metal shell in welder's goggles. Outside, on a lonely bluff, a
bleached buffalo skull sinks into the blowing sands. In these
images, nature and art speak to us, and life and death, time and
eternity, linked in ways that are as lucid as they are mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   The beauties of ``The Last Buffalo'' are by no means lost on
Bradley Wechsler, Imax's co-chairman and co-chief executive with
Gelfond. But his sights are set on the future. ``Rather than think
of the successes to date, I think of the potential,'' he says.
``We're looking for a rhetoric, a grammar of the medium, for
directors who will do something special.'' (One top director who
has reportedly expressed an interest is James Cameron, though his
three-hours-plus ``Titanic'' suggests he might find the built-in
time constraints rather hard to cope with.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever developments may lie ahead, the grammar of the medium
is already in place. Any resemblance it bears to the grammar of
traditional movies is purely accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Of the countless streams that feed the ocean of the traditional
cinema, none is mightier than the age-old river of storytelling.
Traditional movies were born from the union of the proscenium
theater and the photograph. The true subject of Imax 3-D is solid
geometry: the drama of pure form in pure space.
</P>
<P>
   Up vs. down, round vs. flat, shallow vs. deep, horizontal versus
vertical, hollow versus solid, open versus enclosed: these
abstractions (more precisely, the illusion of these abstractions)
are the stuff large-format 3-D is made of, as music is made of
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are realities to which neither filmmakers nor critics are
necessarily in any hurry to awaken. By the standards of ``real''
movies, the celebratory, gauzy saints'-life treatment accorded the
entertainers Siegfried and Roy seems overblown, to be sure. But the
momentous scale and depth and the exquisite artifice of the imagery
are their own reward. By way of illustration, the recurrent motif
of a magic clockwork must suffice, at its most impressive at the
periphery of one's vision, steering destinies tick by tock by tick.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional storytelling is less impossible than immaterial, a
point driven home by the failure of the Academy Award winner
Jean-Jacques Annaud's ``Wings of Courage'' (1995), a true yarn
about early attempts _ heroic or foolhardy? _ to fly mail across
the Andes. Billed as ``the first dramatic motion picture filmed in
Imax 3-D,'' it fielded a solid script and a solid cast of respected
Hollywood names, including Tom Hulce, Val Kilmer, Elizabeth
McGovern and Craig Sheffer. What anyone who saw the film remembers
is a prancing dog, 3-D to the max.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, what captured viewers in ``L5: First City in Space''
was not the slender intergalactic rescue tale but the handful of
special effects. The preview blew the cover on all of them, a more
devastating move than giving away the ending of any story, for
there was nothing else, really, to see. And if ``T-Rex'' rules at
the box office, the explanation has nothing to do with its
toothless sub-``Jurassic Park'' fantasy, but with its king-size
in-your-face raptors.
</P>
<P>
   It is only fair to add that Stephen Low (``The Last Buffalo'')
believes that as the costs of filming in large-format 3-D fall, 2-D
will go the way of the dinosaurs, silents and black-and-white. ``I
believe 3-D is absolutely the cinema of the future,'' he said
recently, between dives for his Imax 3-D documentary on undreamt-of
life forms that flourish in volcanic vents 14,000 feet below the
sea. ``Because we have two eyeballs. Hollywood guys tell me,
`What's really important is the script, not the 3-D.' But the two
things have nothing to do with each other. Any script is better in
3-D. It's more like what God gave us. Humans will never be
satisfied with flat screens. The pictures aren't real enough.''
</P>
<P>
   By this reasoning, sculpture would be an inherently superior
medium to painting _ not a tenable proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Low has an answer to that objection: ``One of the struggles of
the great painters in the history of painting has been to make 2-D
three-dimensional. The object has been to make the painting come
alive. First they had to learn perspective. Then they came up
against other barriers. The eye doesn't see everything in focus, so
they developed Impressionism to get around that. In every period,
artists made the best of their technical limitations. If painters
could do it, they would make their paintings 3-D.''
</P>
<P>
   With respect, I believe the greatest artist in his medium has it
wrong. As time goes on, 2-D and 3-D will grow further apart, not
closer. The flat screen _ like the stage, like the novel _ is a
canvas for storytellers. And large format 3-D _ like architecture,
like dance, like absolute music _ is a vehicle for visionaries.
Will the medium stay true to itself in the face of commercial
necessities? Only time will tell.

AS CULT LEADER RELEASED, JAPAN FACES SURGE IN `NEW RELIGIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ First, there was news that a religious group named
Ho-no-hana Sampogyo was charging people tens of thousands of
dollars to tell their fortunes by reading the soles of their feet.
Then, police discovered a four-month-old corpse hidden in a hotel
room by another group called Life Space. The cult's guru, a former
tax accountant, claimed the man was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese are wondering what's next. More than four years
after the Aum Shinrikyo cult sprayed sarin gas on the Tokyo subway,
killing 12 and injuring more than 5,000, religious sects of all
kinds are flourishing here.
</P>
<P>
   That has some people worried about possible new threats to
public safety, concerns that were piqued by Wednesday's release of
an Aum leader after three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the government is starting to crack down on cult
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say they are not surprised at the sects' appeal. In
today's Japan _ a consumerist, secular society facing economic
uncertainty _ cults and so-called ``new religions'' offer a
spiritual balm that many Japanese, especially young people, find
attractive, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People increasingly are looking for something to fill their
hearts, and dangerous religious groups are just waiting for them,''
said Toshi Yamakawa, a former bureaucrat turned spiritual writer.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with what she calls the ``rampant consumerism'' of Japan,
Yuko Enomoto joined a group called Place of Truth several years
ago. She attended weekend prayer sessions, where members would tell
stories of how the group's dead founder, the Great Leader, had
cured them of cancer or helped them win a promotion. So-called
spiritual mediums would predict the future.
</P>
<P>
   Enomoto, now 34, became disillusioned and left after she spotted
one of the group's leaders trying on fur coats at a designer sale.
But she still feels the group had value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're a cult, but they come with some truth mixed
in,'' she says. ``I don't think it was all lies and fabrications.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of registered religious groups in Japan has risen 15
percent over the last decade, to more than 6,500, according to the
Japanese government's religion almanac.
</P>
<P>
   Most groups register with the government for tax purposes, but
that is little indication of whether their beliefs or activities
pose a public threat. Aum Shinrikyo was a registered religious
corporation when it carried out the sarin gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   One of its leaders, Fumihiro Joyu, was released from jail
Wednesday after serving three years for perjury, fueling concerns
that the group might stage a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have been responding to the growing public alarm.
</P>
<P>
   A law designed to curb Aum Shinrikyo's activities went into
effect earlier this week. Several weeks ago, police raided
Ho-no-hana's offices, on suspicion that three former believers were
defrauded out of more than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leader, Hogen Fukunaga, claims to be able to divine
people's fate by examining the soles of their feet. Fukunaga also
claims he was instructed by the Pope to ``take care of things after
I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also raided four Life Space centers, looking for evidence
to prosecute the group's leaders in connection with the death of
Shinichi Kobayashi, 66. According to media reports, Kobayashi, a
Life Space member, suffered a brain hemorrhage and was taken to a
hotel near Tokyo's international airport. There he died, and the
group's guru spent months patting the body in the belief that it
could be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Japan's economic malaise is partly responsible for
the current spiritual yearnings. ``We have focused on money and
materials so much for the past 50 years that we have had it up to
here with it all. And so after the bubble economy burst, we began
to look for something more in this world,'' said Yasuko Yamakawa,
who translates books on spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, says Yamakawa, the search often draws people to
fringe sects, always eager to recruit new members. The problem, she
says, is compounded by the Japanese tendency to seek out group,
rather than individual, activities.
</P>
<P>
   Cult watchers are especially concerned about a group called
Kenshokai, which is targeting university and high school students.
Many have dropped out of school to join, and membership has grown
more than threefold to 670,000 in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has for years had an uneasy, often hostile, relationship
with religion. Until the end of World War II, Shintoism was the
state religion and was used to persuade the Japanese they were
fighting a holy war in the name of the emperor, who was considered
a deity. After the war, many Japanese became deeply suspicious of
all things religious.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most Japanese follow a loose mix of Buddhist, Shinto, and
Christian rites, but with little ideology attached. Many Japanese
describe themselves as secular.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the dearth of organized religion has fueled the
popularity of the so-called ``new religions,'' many of which are an
amalgam of several faiths plus Japanese folk beliefs. ``We don't
really have any religion here, so Japanese are like blank slates,''
said Seigo Iwatachi, who deprograms cult members.
</P>
<P>
   Iwatachi belonged for years to the Buddhist-inspired Sokka
Gakkai, Japan's largest religious group and a political force as
well. But he says even that group has cultish tendencies _ a faith
centered around an almost deified leader and, he claims, the use of
mind control. He says it took him 10 years to leave the group
because their indoctrination had convinced him bad things would
happen to him if he left.
</P>
<P>
   Sokka Gakkai has been controversial for decades, accused of
kidnapping, brainwashing, and heavy-handed recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the group says it fears being tarred by the
activities of fringe groups, because most Japanese are so hostile
to religion, they don't know how to separate true faith from fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a backlash, people are afraid to touch religion,''
said Rie Tsumura, a spokesperson for Sokka Gakkai. The group says
it is worried that the law aimed at curbing Aum Shinrikyo could
eventually be used to attack legitimate religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Former Place of Truth member Yuko Enomoto, thinks the government
should only interfere if lives are threatened. ``As long as they
aren't murdering or maiming anyone, they should be allowed to do
what they want,'' she said.

SITESCAPE TO SHARE IN TIMES SQUARE FESTIVITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the recent barrage of TV ads from new dot-com companies,
it's hard for a tiny Internet company to stand out anymore. But
SiteScape Inc. of Maynard, Mass. thinks it can make some noise by
being part of the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   What is SiteScape? The millennium party crowd may soon find out
that it is a firm that offers Web-based collaborative software that
is sometimes compared to Lotus Notes.
</P>
<P>
   SiteScape is one of about a dozen companies advertising on a
six-story video billboard overlooking Times Square. Over the next
few days, plans call for the NBC network to air millennium-themed
documentaries on this Sony Trinitron billboard. The ads will be
similar to TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a small technology company, this is the equivalent of
being in the Super Bowl,'' claimed Chip Venters, SiteScape's
executive vice president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Venters, SiteScape was approached a few weeks ago
by a company selling airtime on the video billboard.
</P>
<P>
   The media company said it had seen the magazine ads that
SiteScape had begun running recently, and wouldn't those ads look
great on a six-story billboard?
</P>
<P>
   SiteScape agreed, in part because the idea of a Times Square
cameo on a millennial New Year's Eve struck the company as a good
way to stand out in a crowded marketplace, Venters said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, a 15-second animated spot for SiteScape is set to air
more than 100 times over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Partly created by DRK Inc., a small Boston ad agency, the
brand-building ad has its theme: ``In the next millennium, you
won't just be connected on the Web. You'll also be connected at the
brain.'' The ad's image is of a brain being wired.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just new customers that the ad is trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   SiteScape executives plan to get some Times Square footage for a
video on the company that they hope to show to venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   SiteScape, which employs about 20 people, recently completed an
initial round of funding for $1.5 million from private investors
and Massachusetts Technology Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   SiteScape looks to raise $10 million in an upcoming second round
of funding that is scheduled to begin in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   SiteScape can trace some of its roots to Digital Equipment Corp.
When DEC was acquired by Compaq Computer Corp. in 1998, Compaq
began to sell off some pieces of DEC's business.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, SiteScape bought the Alta Vista Forum package of
collaborative software. Along with the software, SiteScape gained a
client list that included the US Air Force, the Vatican, and
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Under Compaq, marketing for Alta Vista Forum languished, and
SiteScape is using the new ad campaign to reassure customers that
it is serious about re-energizing the brand with a sustained
marketing push, said Venters, who noted that SiteScape has spent $1
million on marketing in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   A private company, SiteScape does not disclose revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For SiteScape, the big challenge may be intense competition
because many rivals offer similar products, from small firms to the
likes of Lotus and Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The category of collaborative software is ``is heating up,''
said Dave Kasabian, president of DRK, SiteScape's ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, SiteScape wanted a campaign and an event that would
have it stand out from the crowd and create a little buzz, and
that's why it will be in Times Square for New Year's Eve.

   Interested in granting the wish of a child with a serious
illness? You could give to the Make-A-Wish Foundation or the
Grant-A-Wish Foundation, which is not the same as the Grant-A-Wish
Network. Or perhaps the Children's Wish Foundation International or
Fulfill a Wish Foundation or Wishing Well Foundation USA.
</P>
<P>
   Especially around the holidays, when many people whip out
checkbooks or credit cards at the last minute, there is rampant
confusion about exactly which charity has its hand out. Some
charities happily exploit the confusion, trading on the names of
better-known rivals. Others simply reap whatever comes their way
and ask few questions. Some may not be charities at all. But as the
number of registered charities tops 650,000, and the Internet
brings more and more within easy reach, the problem of sound-alikes
and look-alikes has intensified, forcing some established charities
to hire lawyers and engage in uncharacteristic finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing among charities is ``becoming more and more of a
challenge,'' said Bennett M. Weiner, an official of the Council of
Better Business Bureaus, whose national office reviews 300
charities.
</P>
<P>
   There are well over 150 charities registered with the Internal
Revenue Service with ``breast cancer'' in their name.
Shop2Give.com, a Web site that promises to send to charity a
percentage of what visitors spend on its site, lists 146 cancer
charities in California alone. Searching for ferret rescue
organizations? Yahoo, the Internet search engine, has 14.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing which charity is which can be nearly impossible when
hearing a pitch by a fast-talking phone solicitor or when calling
directory assistance. Donors ``don't really know,'' said Kathryn
Jones, president of the Better Business Bureau in Idaho Falls,
Idaho. ``They hear certain words.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, of six easily confused wish-granting organizations,
only Make-A-Wish, the oldest, gets a passing grade from all three
of the leading consumer groups that rate charities. The other five
are either not rated or fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fund-raising company hired by the Wishing Well
Foundation told potential donors, ``I'm sure you've heard of us; we
send terminally ill children to places like Disney World,''
according to a lawsuit filed by the Minnesota attorney general's
office. The suit, settled this month, contended that Wishing Well
had misled donors by implying that it was a local charity (it is
based in Metairie, La.) and by preying on possible confusion with
better-known charities.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing Well and its fund-raiser, Gecko Communications, neither
of which admitted to wrongdoing, agreed not to solicit Minnesota
residents before 2004. They also agreed to pay civil penalties and
legal fees of $22,500 and spend $38,000 for wish-granting in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intention to be confused with anybody,'' said
Matthew Brown, a lawyer for Wishing Well. Errol Copilevitz, a
lawyer for Gecko, said that while there was a settlement, ``there
were no findings of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case of mistaken identities, Robert Bardavid, who
lives in Phoenix, was feeling generous in October when he got a
flier from the Cancer Control Society asking for donated clothes
and jewelry. He later learned that the group is unrelated to the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Since he had promised a gift, Bardavid did contribute some items
when the truck arrived. But he said: ``The organization is playing
on the name of the cancer society. I think it's misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cancer Control Society, based in Los Angeles, has been
around since 1973, said one of its founders, Lorraine Rosenthal.
``There is no similarity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, of course, spend millions to advertise their names
and vigorously protect their trademarks in court. Charities,
however, have traditionally been reluctant to use donor money to
take on their doppelgaengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confusion is always going to exist,'' said Arney
Rosenblat, a spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society, which had some problems with sound-alikes when a New
Jersey charity, the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America, was
accused by state regulators of misusing charitable funds. While the
latter is operating under an interim consent decree with new
management, the society still gets calls from confused donors.
Still, Ms. Rosenblat says it wants to spend its money on its
mission, not public relations or lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Other nonprofits are tired of turning the other cheek. Many are
explicitly flagging the more vexing look-alikes on their Webs sites
and advising donors to consult charity watchdogs or state attorneys
general.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern ``is the loss of donors' trust,'' said Don L.
Rigin, chief executive of the Arthritis Foundation, the largest
charity doing arthritis research and education among some 150
related groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the foundation joined with the American Cancer
Society and the American Heart Association in suing Citizens Action
Group, a Glendale, Calif., group that was the subject of two recent
investigations by the ABC News program ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also named Kent Stryker, the group's president. The
older charities contended that Stryker was collecting for various
groups with names ``confusingly similar'' to their own, like the
National Cancer Association or National Heart Foundation. The
parties later settled.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, no one is suggesting that different charities cannot
tackle the same problem. ``There are thousands of children's
nonprofits,'' said Brian R. Morrison, executive director of the
Grant-A-Wish Foundation, a Baltimore charity he founded in 1982,
two years after Make-A-Wish. ``It is very difficult to find a name
that isn't somewhat similar to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charities acknowledge that donors may not always realize which
is which. Guide Dogs for the Blind and Guide Dog Foundation for the
Blind, for example, have both been operating for more than 50 years
and do much the same thing: provide guide dogs and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an occasional time when we get checks made out to
another organization,'' said Wells Jones, chief executive of the
foundation. ``We will forward those checks.'' His counterparts at
Guide Dogs say they do the same, but their Web sites (guidedog.org
and guidedogs.com) make no reference to each other.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion created by Stryker was not resolved as
courteously. Stryker defends having picked names that struck some
as clones. ``The major charities have been around for a long
time,'' said Stryker, arguing that consumers could hardly be
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The big charities beg to differ. The parties reached an
agreement in which Stryker faces restrictions on how he publicizes
his causes. No longer using the name Citizens Action, Stryker
continues to run the National Association for Alternative Medicine,
which accepts donations of cars. He says he is in full compliance
with the settlement agreement, and the charities do not dispute
that.
</P>
<P>
   Other Johnny-come-latelys have also had to contend with
lawsuits. Make-A-Wish recently settled its lawsuit against Fulfill
A Wish, in which it contended that Fulfill was confusing donors.
While the terms of the settlement are confidential, Fulfill now
operates as Kids Wish Network.
</P>
<P>
   Although Make-A-Wish is reluctant to spend money on lawyers, it
felt it had little choice, said Paul G. Allvin, a spokesman. ``We
are not doing our job as a charity if we do not defend our name,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Charities also worry about the effect of publicity when a
sound-alike gets into trouble. Grant-a-Wish Foundation lost sleep
over an NBC News broadcast about the Grant-a-Wish Network in
October that criticized the network for not spending enough on
children. The show never mentioned the foundation, yet the
foundation felt obliged to spend $5,000 on a mailing to its own
donors to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   The network is no longer operating, said a woman who answered
its telephone number but would not give her name. ``We never knew
there was any confusion,'' she said. The woman said no one was
available to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, it is anybody's guess how much of the money sent
to some groups goes to charity. The IRS does not dictate charities'
names, and enforcement is mostly left up to the states. So if
organizations go out of business or leave town before they have to
file tax returns that would disclose such details, state regulators
may not have much to go on.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet only adds to the problem. Search engines can
uncover huge numbers of charities, and some, like Goto.com, give
priority to organizations that pay for placement, meaning that
less-established charities can pay to bump aside better-known ones.
</P>
<P>
   MyCause.com, a shopping site that promises to forward some of
what is spent to charity, does not accept such fees. Yet its lists
are rather random. Type in ``american heart,'' and shoppers are
given their choice of, among others, the American Heart Association
and the American Heart Disease Prevention Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Unless donors do their homework, they may not know that the
American Heart Association is the long-established charity, while
the foundation is a newcomer. ``On the Internet, there are
additional opportunities with a flick of a button to feel like
you're doing something good,'' said Ami Kassar, the founder of
Shop2Give.

GE TO BUY STAKE IN POWER PLANT MAKER IN SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL LEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The South Korean government has announced
that it is in talks to sell as much as a 25 percent stake in Korea
Heavy Industries and Construction Co., or Hanjung, to General
Electric Co. and a unit of ABB Ltd., the Swiss-Swedish company.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE and ABB have proposed in writing the range of their
interest in acquiring Hanjung,'' Chung Duck-koo, the minister of
commerce, industry and energy, said Wednesday. Officials at both GE
and ABB declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The planned sale is the government's latest move to raise money
by privatizing state-run companies. The government plans to sell 51
percent of Hanjung, South Korea's leading manufacturer of power
plants, to both foreign and domestic investors by June 2000. It
also plans to offer 24 percent of the company in a public share
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean government owns Hanjung through stakes held by the
state-run Korea Electric Power Corp. and the Korea Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   While the current talks aim at strengthening existing
technological alliances with GE and ABB, Chung said that neither
company was interested in management control of Hanjung.
</P>
<P>
   A strategic alliance with GE and an ABB unit, ABB-CENP, would
mean stable orders for power generation equipment for Hanjung, as
well as technological expertise from the foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   GE and ABB-CENP are major clients of the Korean company. This
year, GE purchased $170 million worth of power plant equipment from
Hanjung, while ABB-CENP bought $50 million of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Hanjung hope to finish negotiations on the
sale of the 25 percent stake with the two foreign companies by the
end of April 2000, Chung said. The sale of another 24 percent stake
to the public is also expected to take place by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering price will be based on the sales of
government stakes to GE and ABB-CENP, Chung said, adding that a
premium would be added.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to sell another 26 percent stake to
domestic companies through a public bidding at some time during the
first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The government will decide by the first half of 2001 how to sell
its remaining 25 percent stake in Hanjung. However, if a majority
shareholder emerges after the first round of stake sales, the
government will dispose of the remaining 25 percent stake through
further sales or by issuing depository receipts overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said the government would also hand out 4.8 percent of
Hanjung's shares to the company's unionized workers, as agreed
during negotiations held earlier this week that put an end to a
crippling 48-day strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation of Korean Industries, which represents the
interests of South Korea's major business conglomerates, criticized
the privatization plan, saying it would cause significant protests
from domestic power generation businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has changed its original plans to privatize
Hanjung,'' said Lee Byoung-wook, head of the corporate management
team at the federation. He declined to comment further, saying that
the matter pertained to individual Korean companies.

STUDY SHOWS VIGOROUS GUM CHEWING COULD LEAD TO WEIGHT LOSS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lose weight by chewing gum? Fat chance, most people would say.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be possible, according to a letter being published
Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. The letter was
written by the same Mayo Clinic researchers who conducted a study
about a year ago suggesting that people could lose weight by
fidgeting.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that chewing by cows accounts for 20 percent of the
calories they burn, the team, led by Dr. James Levine, an
endocrinologist, decided to find out how humans might compare.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recruited seven people with normal, stable
weights and had them sit in a dark, quiet laboratory and chew
sugarless gum for 12 minutes, in time to a metronome. The rate was
set at 100 chews a minute, a value that Levine had determined was
typical by surreptitiously timing people who chewed gum.
</P>
<P>
   Before, during and after the subjects' chewing in the
laboratory, the researchers measured how much energy they were
expending. The team calculated that gum chewing burned an extra 11
calories an hour, a 20 percent increase over normal resting values.
</P>
<P>
   A person could lose 11 pounds a year just by chewing gum, the
researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But a few conditions would have to be met: the person would have
to chew gum during every waking hour except at meals, when, of
course, other things would be chewed. To match the subjects in the
study, one would need a mighty wad of gum: the equivalent of six
pieces at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't advocate this as a form of exercise,'' Levine said in
an interview, adding that he had no ties to the chewing gum
industry. ``The experiment just makes a conceptual point: that very
minor changes in nonexercise activity can have an impact on energy
expenditure.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine acknowledged that many people find gum-chewing obnoxious.
``Is it appropriate in a business meeting?'' he wondered. ``In a
bank teller if a client comes in? In school? On the phone?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Burrell, a spokesman for the American Dental
Association, said Levine's findings were reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The muscles of mastication are powerful,'' Burrell said. ``If
you were chewing constantly, I could see where you would burn
calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal teeth would not be harmed, he said, but the jaw muscles
might become overdeveloped. ``It might make your face squarer,'' he
said. ``I think there are more efficient ways to burn calories
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine agreed, and said people who really needed to lose weight
would be better off exercising more and watching what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   But since doing his experiment, he admitted, ``I find myself
chewing gum all the time.''

 &HT;        FEMA does not fear the Millennial unknown 
 &HT;     By Laura J. Winter  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 - Federal Emergency Management Agency
officials gave assurances today that they are prepared to respond
to any emergency that might mark the dawn of the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a life threatening situation, we will react,'' said
Robert Adamcik, FEMA's deputy associate administrator for response
and recovery. However, ``we will not be fixing computers.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for what some fear may be a nation-wide computer
melt-down, the agency took the last year and a half to plan for the
worst. In its nerve center, federal officials and the Red Cross are
manning Y2K compliant computers, phones and, if need be, radios
round-the-clock to coordinate disaster relief efforts - just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   The agency named 10 regional directors to oversee an army of
deputy directors already poised to work with the government
officials in every state, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and other
U.S. territories, Adamcik said. Together they will decide if and
how to provide shelter, food, clothing and medical treatment to
those in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will step up to the plate if there is a serious
emergency,'' Adamcik said. His definition of emergency - ``an
explosion somewhere, a power outage, a nuclear plant meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's computers were programmed to record the
year of a data file by only using the last two digits of that year.
These computers, come New Year's Eve, will recognize 00 to
represent 1900, not annoyance for the home computer user, electric
power grids, water and sewer systems, subways and hospitals rely on
computers to stay open and provide services.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in addition to Y2K, we are going to be dealing with traffic
snarls,'' said Bruce Baughman, FEMA's chief of operations.
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government has taken steps to make sure the
glitch will not seriously impair federal agency functions, it is
feared that local governments may not be so prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A scoreboard of sorts inside FEMA will track the problems of
each state from firefighting to emergency declarations. To the left
hangs a score card, tracking what FEMA sends, like food and
generators, and even disaster mortuary teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried. I'm not anxious. If something's going to
happen, it's going to happen,'' said Patricia Appino, a state
disaster specialist for the Red Cross. ``We're used to things
happening. And we're used to responding to them.''

 &HT;    Campaign coffers of Bradley and McCain grow in 4th quarter
 &HT;    PREVIOUSLY SLUGGED BUSH-CAMPAIGN ON COX BUDGET
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In what may be a sign of their growing strength,
presidental candiates Bill Bradley and John McCain enjoyed notable
fund-raising success during the last three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, former New Jersey Sen. Bradley raised $8
million _ twice as much as Vice President Al Gore _ between October
and December, his most lucrative quarter thus far.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race, Arizona Sen. McCain raised twice as much
money during the last three months of 1999 as he did during the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has raised a total of $27 million, $1 million less than
Gore. McCain, who still trails Texas Gov. George W. Bush in every
poll outside of New Hampshire and his home state, raised $6.1
million during the last three months of 1999 for a year-long total
of $13.6 million. The Bush campaign plans to release its
fund-raising totals today and is expected to announce that it
collected more than $6 million during the last quarter, for a total
of more than $63 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Gary Bauer said Wednesday that he has
raised a total of about $7 million for the year. The fund-raising
totals for GOP candidates Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes
were not available. Final year-end numbers for all the presidential
candidates will be filed with the Federal Election Commission on
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign boasted Wednesday that it had exceeded its
original fund-raising goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill Bradley announced his candidacy, he said we would
need between $20 million-$25 million to communicate his positive
message to the voters. Without taking special interest PAC money
and without exploiting any loopholes in the campaign finance
system, we have exceeded that goal well ahead of schedule,'' said
campaign chairman Douglas Berman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign said it spent about $10.4 million in the
fourth quarter of 1999, leaving it with about $8.3 million in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign expects to receive $10.1 million in federal
matching funds, while the Gore campaign expects $12.1 million. The
federal government matches the first $250 of each individual
contribution for presidential candidates who agree to limit their
campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   McCain characterized his fourth quarter fund-raising success as
evidence that his campaign, which is centered around his call for
campaign finance reform, is gaining momentum as presidential
primary voting fast approaches. The Iowa caucuses are on Jan. 24,
and the New Hampshire primary is on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am proud that our campaign has been about ideas not
bucks, I am grateful that we have raised the funds necessary to run
an aggressive campaign that will get my message out even further,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the money he's raised in his presidential bid,
McCain has transferred $2 million from his Senate campaign and has
qualified for $4.2 million in federal matching funds, raising his
total to $19.8 million. The campaign says it has $1.5 million in
the bank, enough to ``wage a winning campaign,'' according to
finance chairman Herb Allison.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the last reporting period, Bush had $37.7 million
in the bank. The governor has decided to forgo federal matching
money, thereby avoiding the spending limits that come with it.

NASDAQ TRADING TOPS THE 4,000 MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting an exclamation point on an extraordinary year for
technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index closed above 4,000
for the first time Wednesday, just eight weeks after topping the
3,000 milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Light holiday trading Wednesday combined with encouraging news
about key stocks sent the Nasdaq leaping 69.35 points, or 1.75
percent, to a record 4,041.46.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-driven index logged records all year long as Internet
fever gripped the nation's investors. But it had languished some in
the fall, when the luster of hightech appeared to dim. In recent
sessions, the 4,000 level was elusive, despite several tries.
</P>
<P>
   The rise marked an astonishing 84 percent increase in 1999 for
the Nasdaq. By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 25
percent his year and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is up 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Nasdaq holds on to its gains until the end of the year, it
would be the best yearly performance ever for a major US index _
topping a record 81.49 percent set 84 years ago by the Dow .
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum is fabulous,'' Buck Newsome, managing director at
Cambridge Financial Group Inc. in Cincinnati. For the Nasdaq, the
4,000 level ``is a great psychological barrier to eclipse. It will
foster a lot of enthusiasm for computer and telecommunication
stocks going into the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's leap Wednesday came as all three major stock
indexes logged records.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow gained 7.95 points, or, 0.07 percent, to 11,484.66 . The
S&AMP;P 500 climbed 5.80 points, or 0.40 percent, to a record 1,463.46.
It also set a new intraday high at 1,467.47.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been Nasdaq's climb that has grabbed the attention of
analysts and investors. Once considered an also-ran repository for
small, lesser-known companies, the Nasdaq's performance this year
has surprised even the optimists and highlighted the growing
importance of technology to the nation's economy .
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq has not only defied gravity, it has defied
investors' wildest dreams,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. .
</P>
<P>
   Technology dominated broadly Wednesday. Software and computer
makers as well as telecommunications equipment companies saw their
shares soar. Biotech companies did particularly well as investors
looked to breakthrough medications and to the possiblity of
takeovers , analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Affymetrix Inc., a maker of products that analyze genetic
information, gained 20 7/16 to close at 180 3/16. That's double its
share price at the end of October .
</P>
<P>
   Many tech stocks rose on nuggets of news from influential
analysts. The biggest gainer in the S&AMP;P 500 was Qualcomm Inc.,
which rocketed 156 to 659 after Walt Piecyk, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc., said the stock could reach $1,000 within 12
months. A $1,000 investment in Qualcomm made at the end of 1998
would be worth more than $25,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Piecyk predicted that 85 percent of phones sold will use
Qualcomm's cell phone technology by the next decade, up from 18
percent today.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick Inc., a seller of advertising on Internet sites,
rose 28 3/16 to 249 1/8 after analyst Jamie Kiggen at Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities said the stock may be trading at $300
within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the markets showed broad improvement Wednesday in
part because investors are shifting money back to stocks that had
languished earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Nasdaq gain was the index's 60th record this year,
allowing it a chance to match its 1980 total of 62 record closes.

COME WHAT MAY, MEGIDDO IS PREPARED FOR THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEGIDDO, Israel _ If the biblical battle of Armageddon begins
here Friday, as some believe it will, the cost of admission will be
18 shekels (about $4) and there is plenty of parking.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient hilltop known as ``Har Megedon,'' or Mountain of
Megiddo, is the place referred to in the bible as Armageddon, which
in the Book of Revelations is the final battleground between the
forces of good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is a popular tourist site that features the layered
archeological remains of some 24 civilizations destroyed by one war
after another through thousands of years of history.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioned tour buses idled Wednesday in Armageddon's
parking lot, recently expanded to handle the increase in tourists
coming to the Holy Land for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of tour groups from Europe and America shuffled
past the ticket booth and then made their way up a steep hill to
the rocky outcropping that is a treasure trove of archeology and a
site that tourism officials are eagerly trying to market.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was a mix: curious tourists armed with video cameras
to record one of the most dramatic archeological sites in Israel;
religious pilgrims of mainstream denominations interested in the
biblical significance of the infamous hilltop; and a small minority
of biblical literalists filled with apocalyptic expectations of
``The End of Days'' and what they believe is the coming battle to
end all battles.
</P>
<P>
   For this fringe of Christian believers, Friday night's
millennial turn of the calendar has sparked the belief that the
ultimate battle may well be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Siske, of Iredell, Texas, was walking through the vast
archeological site, which includes remants of prayer altars that
date to 3000 B.C., horse stables for the chariots of Israelite King
Ahab from the 9th century B.C., and a circular stone silo for grain
storage from the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe in the literal interpretation of the bible,''
said Siske, a Southern Baptist and retired history teacher, ``So I
believe this is the place where the battle that will end the world
will happen. I believe there is a lot that tells us that we are
very close to the time when these events will occur. Very close, a
matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of the roughly 200,000 yearly visitors _ a
number that could double over the next year _ aren't bracing for
the end. Most are from mainstream Christian denominations and tend
to view Revelations, the last book of the New Testament that is
believed to have been written by the Apostle John, as a biblical
drama that should be seen as a sweeping metaphor. Most say it
should not be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Florine Postel of Cincinatti, Ohio, were touring the
site Wednesday, their two young boys climbing over the rocks and
running through the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a millennial vacation,'' said Jim, 41, an architect
and a member of an Episcopal congregation. ``We are here out of
curiosity, but certainly not for any sense of interpreting the
biblical prophecies. I see all of that as metaphor, a kind of
poetry in scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Valentino Cottini, a Catholic priest from Verona, Italy,
was leading a group of 25 nuns from the Order of the Daughters of
Charity. They were walking deep inside a tunnel that dates to 1000
B.C. and was used for gathering water when the city was under
siege.
</P>
<P>
   In the damp, dark passageway, Cottini explained, ``The Book of
Revelations and the passage referring to Armageddon has to be seen
as a symbol, a metaphor of the battle between good and evil. It is
not to be taken literally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Floria joked as she ascended the steep stone stairs that
lead out of the tunnel, worn smooth through the ages, ``You don't
have to worry about the world ending, but you should be very
careful on these steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 20 miles southeast of the port city of Haifa, the
hilltop of Megiddo looks out over the fertile plains of the Jezreel
Valley, one of the great military theaters of history.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's foothills and wheat fields stood witness to
countless bloody battles. The strategic hill _ positioned along
crucial trade routes from Egypt to the south and Mesopotamia to the
north _ was conquered by the Pharaohs of Egypt, the Canaanites, the
Persians, and the Hebrew kings.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this military context that the Book of Revelations
(16:16) describes Armageddon as the final battleground between the
forces of good and evil. Historians note that it is interesting
that the fortified city of Megiddo was destroyed and abandoned by
the 4th century B.C., yet it still resonated as a place of epic
battles when John wrote about it nearly 500 years later.
</P>
<P>
   In modern history, the area around Megiddo was the site of
battles in World War I, when the British troops overcame the
Ottoman Empire, and later in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war when troops
of the new Jewish state defended the land against Syrian and Iraqi
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the site was quiet _ a serene perch to view the lush
fields of the nearby Kibbutz Megiddo. Nevertheless, Israeli police
for the first time posted ten officers on the hilltop to prevent
anyone from carrying out an act of millennial violence, or perhaps
suicide, over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   Badran Ismael, the Israeli Parks Department manager of the small
museum at the foot of the site, said, ``We are afraid of what might
happen here, and so the site will have to be guarded for the first
time ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Terrorism Analysis Unit gave the name ``Project
Megiddo'' to the team it created to investigate millennial threats
of violence. A classified report titled ``Project Megiddo: Threat
Analysis for the New Millennium,'' was published in October,
assessed security risks posed by an underground of extremist groups
and cults that see themselves playing an active role in the
biblical battle of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   But the report underlined that the area of Jerusalem, where the
Old City is revered holy ground to three major religions _
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism _ is a more likely site for
millenial violence than Megiddo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was to Megiddo that Vince Duran, 50, his arms covered
with apocalyptic prison tatoos, came from his trailer home in New
Mexico. He was there Wednesday to see the ``spiritual war,'' as he
put it, that he believes will begin Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are either a child of light or a child of darkness, and we
will find out (Friday),'' he said, during a rambling discourse in
which he also inquired about staying at the kibbutz in exchange for
work.
</P>
<P>
   David Rubins, 53, was one of the kibbutz leaders politely trying
to steer Duran away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the world is going to end,'' said Rubins, who
manages the kibbutz's beautiful gardens of bougainvillea and roses.
``In fact we planted new roses today. You don't do that when you
think the world is ending.''

CHRISTMAS GIFT A REAL WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A simple overcoat turned out to be the Christmas gift
of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Justin T. Krook, a senior at Fitchburg State College, received
the coat on Christmas Eve from his high school sweetheart. Inside
the pockets, she had stuffed 10 Millennium Spectacular tickets,
which cost $10 each.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, one by one, the 22-year-old New Hampshire native
scratched each ticket. One of them yielded $20, some found cash to
treat his girl to the movies. But it was the 10th ticket that
forced him to catch his breath: A $2 million prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all still awe-struck,'' said Krook's father, Timothy,
Wednesday from the family's New Ipswich home. ``He called us
Christmas Eve and said he had won the money. I said, `No kidding!'
What else could I say? I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Krook, who commutes daily to his college and rarely plays
the lottery, was at home Wednesday but declined comment and asked
that his girlfriend not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of five children _ ages 15, 18, 20, 22, and 23.
His father runs a commercial construction company, and his mother,
Joy, is a secretary for another construction firm in the area.
Justin works for the family business when he is home, his father
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Krook and his girlfriend went to lottery
headquarters in Braintree to collect the prize. He will receive
$100,000 a year for the next 20 years, according to lottery
officials. He brought home his first check Tuesday, which, after
taxes, amounted to $67,000.
</P>
<P>
   Krook, a business major, told officials that he plans to use
some of the money to buy a new car and pay off his student loans.
He also said that he plans to consult with a financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do with the money, his father offered
practical suggestions: no great vacations or electronic gadgets, at
least for now. ``I would want to pay off the bills _ the mortgage,
the car loans, the truck loans,'' said his father, ``but, you
understand, this all just happened. We are all still awe struck.''
</P>
<P>
   Krook's girlfriend bought the winning ticket at a Honey Farms
convenience store in Leominster, which will get a $20,000
commission for the sale. She apparently told Krook she has no
regrets about giving away such a valuable ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows that I'm going to share it with her,'' said Krook in
a discussion with lottery officials.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Millennium Spectacular'' instant ticket made its debut
in early November and Krook is the fourth winner of a $2 million
jackpot. The odds of winning one of the $2 million or $4 million
prizes is one in 5 million, a lottery official said.

 By ADAM THOMSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BOGOTA, Colombia _ It is 6 a.m. and the sun is just creeping
over the mountains in downtown Bogota. But already, hundreds of
Colombians are standing outside the U.S. Embassy, rubbing their
hands to ward off the cold.
 &HT;    Dressed as if going to church, they wait restlessly in line,
clutching folders stuffed with documents they hope will get them a
visa to the United States. A short, dark-skinned woman wheels a
rusting trolley along the street and offers syrupy coffee and
cigarettes to the human snake that is now coiling around the far
corner of the embassy.
 &HT;    Long lines at U.S. embassies across Latin America are a fact of
life, but there are more people than ever applying for visas in
Colombia. From October 1998 through August 1999, the U.S. Embassy
handled almost 315,000 applications, up by roughly a third over the
period between October 1997 and October 1998.
 &HT;    No secret what's driving the exodus _ the country is living
through its worst recession in recent memory. The economy in the
first half of the year contracted by 6 percent over the same period
last year. President Andres Pastrana's administration initially
forecast growth of 2.5 percent, but now is forced to admit that
output could shrink as much as 3 percent this year. Unemployment is
at an all-time high of 19.8 percent of the work force.
Construction, the major employer of unskilled labor, is at a
standstill.
 &HT;    And now the jobless numbers increasingly include young _ and
professional _ Colombians. Many are leaving behind their drug- and
guerrilla-ravaged country with the hopes of finding jobs abroad.
 &HT;    Juan Manuel Trujillo, a 25-year-old Bogota resident, recently
graduated from the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano as an industrial
designer. ``This is my unemployment certificate,'' he says,
pointing to his diploma. Trujillo is now taking the same road as
many of his friends and peers and in January is leaving the country
to look for better opportunities abroad.
 &HT;    Others have already left. Julieta Aponte, a 24-year-old lawyer,
is now living in London, where she plans to brush up on her English
for at least a year. Until recently, Aponte enjoyed a good salary
working in the research department of Caja Agraria, the largest of
the country's state-owned banks. One morning, however, the
government liquidated the bank and offered its 8,000 employees the
chance to accept a voluntary retirement plan. She accepted, along
with about 2,000 other former employees. ``Sooner or later, they
were going to make the cuts and it seemed better to accept a
voluntary package than to be dismissed,'' she says.
 &HT;    Now Aponte is just relieved to be living in another country _ at
least until the situation improves. ``The entire country is
crumbling,'' she says. ``High unemployment has forced the poorest
people onto the streets to ask for money or sometimes to steal. I
am tired of so much violence and the lack of any job
opportunities.''
 &HT;    For those who are successful in their visa applications, living
abroad offers the chance to escape the steadily worsening domestic
environment. Outside the main cities, the ongoing conflict between
the army, left-wing guerrilla groups and right-wing death squads
continues to wreak havoc.
 &HT;    According to a recent Catholic Church-sponsored study, there are
now approximately 1.5 million displaced Colombians fleeing from the
violence, more than fled Kosovo at the height of its recent war.
The homeless and landless typically arrive in the country's urban
centers to look for work that no longer exists.
 &HT;    Since last year, for example, the massive General Motors plant
south of Bogota has shed half its 2,000-strong work force in
response to the hard times. ``The restructuring has taken place
right across the board, from the plant floor to the administrative
and managerial positions,'' says Jaime Ardila, president of General
Motors Colmotores subsidiary in Colombia.
 &HT;    For most of the unemployed, going abroad remains a distant
fantasy. But those who can leave are usually the well-educated
professionals who have earned Colombia its reputation for a highly
skilled managerial class.
 &HT;    That poses many potential problems for the country in the
future. Indeed, if the trend continues, the reputation for capable
young professionals may not be so discernible in the future. ``It
is an exodus,'' admits Rue Swabey, head of research at Santander
Investment in Bogota. ``The country is losing many of its most
talented people.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BOGOTA, Colombia _ It is 6 a.m. and the sun is just creeping
over the mountains in downtown Bogota. But already, hundreds of
Colombians are standing outside the U.S. Embassy, rubbing their
hands to ward off the cold.
 &HT;    Dressed as if going to church, they wait restlessly in line,
clutching folders stuffed with documents they hope will get them a
visa to the United States. A short, dark-skinned woman wheels a
rusting trolley along the street and offers syrupy coffee and
cigarettes to the human snake that is now coiling around the far
corner of the embassy.
 &HT;    Long lines at U.S. embassies across Latin America are a fact of
life, but there are more people than ever applying for visas in
Colombia. From October 1998 through August 1999, the U.S. Embassy
handled almost 315,000 applications, up by roughly a third over the
period between October 1997 and October 1998.
 &HT;    No secret what's driving the exodus _ the country is living
through its worst recession in recent memory. The economy in the
first half of the year contracted by 6 percent over the same period
last year. President Andres Pastrana's administration initially
forecast growth of 2.5 percent, but now is forced to admit that
output could shrink as much as 3 percent this year. Unemployment is
at an all-time high of 19.8 percent of the work force.
Construction, the major employer of unskilled labor, is at a
standstill.
 &HT;    And now the jobless numbers increasingly include young _ and
professional _ Colombians. Many are leaving behind their drug- and
guerrilla-ravaged country with the hopes of finding jobs abroad.
 &HT;    Juan Manuel Trujillo, a 25-year-old Bogota resident, recently
graduated from the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano as an industrial
designer. ``This is my unemployment certificate,'' he says,
pointing to his diploma. Trujillo is now taking the same road as
many of his friends and peers and in January is leaving the country
to look for better opportunities abroad.
 &HT;    Others have already left. Julieta Aponte, a 24-year-old lawyer,
is now living in London, where she plans to brush up on her English
for at least a year. Until recently, Aponte enjoyed a good salary
working in the research department of Caja Agraria, the largest of
the country's state-owned banks. One morning, however, the
government liquidated the bank and offered its 8,000 employees the
chance to accept a voluntary retirement plan. She accepted, along
with about 2,000 other former employees. ``Sooner or later, they
were going to make the cuts and it seemed better to accept a
voluntary package than to be dismissed,'' she says.
 &HT;    Now Aponte is just relieved to be living in another country _ at
least until the situation improves. ``The entire country is
crumbling,'' she says. ``High unemployment has forced the poorest
people onto the streets to ask for money or sometimes to steal. I
am tired of so much violence and the lack of any job
opportunities.''
 &HT;    For those who are successful in their visa applications, living
abroad offers the chance to escape the steadily worsening domestic
environment. Outside the main cities, the ongoing conflict between
the army, left-wing guerrilla groups and right-wing death squads
continues to wreak havoc.
 &HT;    According to a recent Catholic Church-sponsored study, there are
now approximately 1.5 million displaced Colombians fleeing from the
violence, more than fled Kosovo at the height of its recent war.
The homeless and landless typically arrive in the country's urban
centers to look for work that no longer exists.
 &HT;    Since last year, for example, the massive General Motors plant
south of Bogota has shed half its 2,000-strong work force in
response to the hard times. ``The restructuring has taken place
right across the board, from the plant floor to the administrative
and managerial positions,'' says Jaime Ardila, president of General
Motors Colmotores subsidiary in Colombia.
 &HT;    For most of the unemployed, going abroad remains a distant
fantasy. But those who can leave are usually the well-educated
professionals who have earned Colombia its reputation for a highly
skilled managerial class.
 &HT;    That poses many potential problems for the country in the
future. Indeed, if the trend continues, the reputation for capable
young professionals may not be so discernible in the future. ``It
is an exodus,'' admits Rue Swabey, head of research at Santander
Investment in Bogota. ``The country is losing many of its most
talented people.''

 &HT;    Qtera founders accused of stealing trade secrets
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida _ Just two weeks after upstart Qtera
Corp. announced a multibillion-dollar deal to sell, the former
employer of two Qtera founders has accused them of stealing trade
secrets and is seeking to block the deal _ or get a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens Information and Communication Networks says Qtera Chief
Executive Fahri Diner and Chief Scientist Xiang-Dong Cao breached
their employment agreements and are improperly using Siemens'
confidential information and trade secrets in fiber optic data
transmission, according to a lawsuit suit filed Tuesday in Palm
Beach County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diner and Cao betrayed Siemens and violated their duties of
good faith and loyalty by pursuing a course of conduct during their
employment which was marked by personal greed ... ,'' the suit
says.
</P>
<P>
   Cao refused to comment Wednesday, and Diner could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Siemens Information, a subsidiary of Siemens AG of Germany,
and Qtera are based in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, Qtera, founded in September 1998, announced it
intends to sell itself to fiber optic networking giant Nortel of
Brompton, Ontario, Canada, for $3.25 billion in stock. The deal
would make millionaires of half of Qtera's 140 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens Information is seeking an injunction to block the deal,
as well as a ``constructive trust'' on the ``misappropriated''
information, the money raised by Qtera executives to launch the
company and any profits Qtera gains from the information.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the suit is unrelated to the Nortel-Qtera deal
announcement, said Benjamin Reid of Miami, Siemens Information's
attorney. The company sued only after its discussions with Qtera
failed to satisfy it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid wouldn't disclose the amount of money Siemens Information
is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Diner and Cao founded Qtera to develop technology that boosts
the speed of data sent through hair-thin fiber-optic cables.
High-speed transmission technology is a hot field as companies look
for cheaper, more efficient ways to move data.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Qtera launch, Diner and Cao were high-ranking Siemens
Information employees privy to the company's top-secret business
and technical information, the suit says. They signed ``Employee
Patent and Secrecy Agreements'' that said they would keep sensitive
information secret. Those agreements also gave Siemens Information
control of any inventions created by Diner and Cao.
</P>
<P>
   While they were working for Siemens Information, they drafted
business plans for Qtera and used Siemens Information's computer
system to e-mail the plans to prospective lenders, the suit says.
Diner used information gleaned during his employment at Siemens
Information to develop similar fiber-optic technology at Qtera.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera hasn't generated a penny in sales, but its work to send
light a greater distance without amplification drew many suitors,
with Nortel winning out.
</P>
<P>
   If Qtera's technology works _ and it's already passed
preliminary testing _ it will mean lower costs to operate fiber
optic networks because less equipment will be needed to boost
signals. Costs also would be less for every fiber optic network
user, including Internet access providers and cable TV and
telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortel-Qtera deal is scheduled to close in the first quarter
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   A Nortel spokesman said the company's offices are closed this
week and that no one could comment on the suit.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BOGOTA _ Son las seis de la manana y el sol comienza a dejarse
ver sobre las montanas que rodean a Bogota. Pero ya hay cientos de
colombianos esperando frente a la embajada de Estados Unidos,
frotandose las manos para combatir el frio.
 &HT;    Vestidos como para ir a la iglesia, esperan intranquilos en la
fila, aferrados a sobres llenos de documentos que van a presentar
con la esperanza de conseguir una visa estadounidense. Una mujer de
baja estatura y piel oscura empuja un carrito oxidado, donde lleva
cafe azucarado y cigarrillos que ofrece a esta serpiente humana que
se pierde por la esquina mas alejada de la sede diplomatica.
 &HT;    Las largas filas en las embajadas norteamericanas en
Latinoamerica son cosa comun, pero en Colombia la cantidad de
solicitantes de visa es mayor que nunca antes. Entre octubre de
1998 y agosto de 1999, un total de 315.000 colombianos solicitaron
visa para viajar a Estados Unidos, casi una tercera parte mas que
entre octubre de 1997 y octubre de 1998.
 &HT;    Y las razones del exodo no son un secreto para nadie: el pais
vive su peor recesion de los ultimos tiempos. La economia se
contrajo un 6 por ciento en el primer semestre del ano en
comparacion con el mismo periodo del ano pasado. El gobierno del
presidente Andres Pastrana inicialmente pronostico un crecimiento
del 2,5 por ciento, pero ahora se ha visto obligado a admitir que
la economia colombiana podria contraerse hasta en un 3 por ciento
este ano. El desempleo esta a un nivel record del 19,8 por ciento
de la fuerza laboral. La construccion, que da trabajo a una gran
cantidad de personal no calificado, esta detenida.
 &HT;    Y ahora las cifras de desempleados se nutren cada vez mas de
colombianos jovenes y profesionales. Muchos han abandonado el pais,
asolado por los problemas de la narcoguerrilla, con la esperanza de
buscar empleo en otros paises.
 &HT;    Juan Manuel Trujillo, de 25 anos y vecino de Bogota, hace poco
se graduo de disenador industrial en la Universidad Jorge Tadeo
Lozano. ``Este es mi certificado de desempleado,'' dice mostrando
su diploma. Trujillo ha tomado el mismo rumbo que muchos de sus
amigos y colegas, y en enero saldra del pais en busca de mejores
oportunidades en el extranjero.
 &HT;    Otros ya se han marchado. Julieta Aponte, una abogada de 24
anos, vive en Londres, donde planea mejorar su dominio del ingles
por lo menos durante un ano. Hasta hace poco, Aponte disfrutaba de
un buen salario en el departamento de investigaciones de Caja
Agraria, el mayor de los bancos estatales colombianos. Sin embargo,
una manana el gobierno liquido el banco y ofrecio a sus 8.000
empleados la oportunidad de aceptar un plan voluntario de retiro.
Aponte acepto, con 2.000 de sus colegas. ``Tarde o temprano iban a
reducir personal, y parecio una buena idea aceptar el retiro
voluntario antes que ser despedidos,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Ahora Aponte se siente aliviada de vivir en otro pais, por lo
menos hasta que la situacion mejore. ``El pais entero se viene
abajo,'' dice. ``El desempleo ha obligado a los pobres a salir a la
calle a pedir dinero, y a veces a robar. Estoy harta de tanta
violencia y de la falta de oportunidades de empleo,'' se queja.
 &HT;    Para los que logran conseguir una visa, vivir en el extranjero
ofrece la oportunidad de escapar del ambiente interno, cuyo
deterioro no parece tener fin. Fuera de las grandes ciudades, el
conflicto entre el ejercito, los grupos guerrilleros y los
escuadrones de la muerte deja un profundo caos.
 &HT;    Segun un estudio reciente auspiciado por la Iglesia Catolica, en
Colombia hay 1,5 millones de desplazados que huyen de la violencia,
mas que los que huyeron de Kosovo durante el reciente conflicto en
ese pais. Los que no tienen techo ni tierras suelen irse a las
ciudades a buscar empleo, un empleo que ya no existe.
 &HT;    Desde el ano pasado, por ejemplo, la enorme planta de General
Motors ubicada en el sur de Bogota ha despedido a la mitad de sus
2.000 empleados. ``La reestructuracion ha sido generalizada, desde
las lineas de ensamblaje hasta la administracion y los
ejecutivos,'' explica Jaime Ardila, presidente de Colmotores, la
filial colombiana de GM.
 &HT;    Para la mayoria de los desempleados, emigrar es una fantasia
casi irrealizable. Los que logran marcharse son por lo general
profesionales que le han ganado a Colombia la reputacion de graduar
gerentes de primera clase.
 &HT;    Eso significa un gran problema para el futuro del pais. Si la
tendencia sigue, la ausencia de esa clase gerencial capacitada se
hara sentir. ``Es un exodo,'' dice Rue Swabey, a cargo de las
investigaciones de Santander Investment en Bogota. ``Es pais esta
perdiendo a muchos de sus individuos mas talentosos.''

   When you stare, glassy-eyed, across the river and into the next
millennium, do you hope to see happiness and light, or _ as Time
magazine asked a couple of years ago _ is there no balm in chiliad?
</P>
<P>
   (Good word, chiliad; it's a 50-cent synonym for millennium.)
</P>
<P>
   Or, to get more specific, thinking about wine in the coming
(pick one: year, decade, century, millennium), do you see red or
white, or are you squinting through rose-colored binoculars?
</P>
<P>
   So where does wine go from here?
</P>
<P>
   XXX
</P>
<P>
   Take technology _ please:
</P>
<P>
   Wine remains a natural agricultural product. Squeeze the juice
from grapes. Yeast in the air reacts with the sugar in the grape
juice. Result: carbon dioxide (that blows off) and ... fermented
grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   Wine has been made this way for thousands of years, but now it's
helped along by technology. And that can be a good thing. For
example, in the old days, wines could oxidize quickly. But later,
with the technological onset of cold fermentation, the wines became
fresher and cleaner. Score one for science.
</P>
<P>
   A constant problem remains: wines ruined by corks tainted by
chlorine in the bleaching process. But now plastic or composite
corks are slowly (very slowly) turning the tide against
natural-cork closures. And that's another upside of technology.
</P>
<P>
   I once talked with a very bright guy who claimed he had invented
a process by which he could ``fingerprint'' all the complex aspects
of any bottle of wine. Eventually, he said, he hoped to be able to
duplicate any wine. ``You like '61 Latour,'' he said, ``and I can
replicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's bad. That's not winemaking; that's industrial
duplication.
</P>
<P>
   While that's just fine for soft drinks and beer _ all of which,
to be successful, must maintain a consistent flavor profile _ it's
not fine for wine. Yes, the cliche is true: Wine is a living thing;
each bottle is different. And that's one of the reasons we love it
_ for the adventure, for the anticipation and, hopefully, for the
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a hope for the future: That while technological
progress can be a good thing, too much isn't. May the winemakers of
the new millennium remain artists and craftsmen _ not
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   XXX
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider viticulture: Another 50-cent word that just means
growing wine grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of the world _ the Old World, where wine grapes have
been grown for chiliads _ have figured out by trial and error which
grapes grow best where. Sounds simple, but it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Classic case: California.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, as the wine boom began to unfold, wine grapes
were planted willy-nilly, often with unfortunate results.
</P>
<P>
   California is an agricultural paradise: You can grow just about
anything anywhere. But just because you can grow chardonnay next to
cabernet doesn't mean you should.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay needs a cool climate; cabernet a warmer one. Maybe
the farmers in the Napa Valley, for example, thought that, with
their combination of warm days and cool nights, they had the best
of both worlds. They didn't. It took a plague of the plant louse
phylloxera to force farmers to replant, but this time with more
compatible results.
</P>
<P>
   That's been a boon in the Golden State. With better available
information, California winegrowers have begun planting varietals
where they are better suited to the individual microclimates.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the cabernets and chardonnays are better, and
some world-class syrahs have been produced, as well.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a hope for the future: That growers everywhere, from
Australia (which suffers from that ubiquitous approach to planting
everything in sight) to Spain and Italy (where cabernet has gained
a foothold), learn from their and their neighbors' mistakes and
plant the right grapes in the right ground.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean better wines for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   XXX
</P>
<P>
   And let's talk wine prices: Unless you're a visitor from the
Planet Moron, you've seen wine prices rise to absurd heights. Young
California cabernets with less than 10 years' history have sold in
Houston for more than $100 a bottle. Good, but hardly great,
burgundies have cost $500-$600 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou may be worth $150 a bottle to
well-heeled connoisseurs, but Ducru has a track record. Not so
Valandraud. Nor Le Pin. These are good wines, but they are selling
at artificially high prices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a funny thing: So many winemakers talk the talk about
making wine more accessible to the general public, and then they go
and price their wines out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   What message does that send to consumers?
</P>
<P>
   So here's a hope for the future: That prices come down to Earth.
Not crash, like they did in the early '70s with Bordeaux, but at
least find a level of sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sanity, let's also hope that restaurateurs find a
little of that precious commodity, and make their wine prices
reflect more than their greed.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth _ straight, no chaser. &QL;

HIJACKERS DROP DEMANDS FOR MONEY AND RETURN OF MILITANT'S BODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDIA-HIJACK-WAKIL)

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Hijackers holding 154 hostages in an Indian
Airlines jet at an airport in Afghanistan dropped demands Wednesday
that India hand over $200 million and the body of a slain militant,
Indian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the hijackers continued to insist that India release a
jailed Pakistani Muslim cleric and 35 other people whom the Indian
government considers terrorists opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Afghanistan's ruling militia, the Taliban _
itself a fundamentalist Muslim group that has been criticized for
harboring terrorists _ impressed on the hijackers that they had
violated the conditions of landing in Afghanistan by adding the
demands for money and the body, the Taliban's foreign minister,
Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, told reporters Wednesday in Kandahar, the
Afghan city where the plane is parked.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly important role played by the Taliban in efforts
to end the six-day-old hostage crisis became even more intriguingly
apparent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like most countries, India does not have diplomatic relations
with the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan and have been
aggressively seeking international recognition as the country's
legitimate government. But Indian officials continued to praise the
Taliban effusively Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taliban continues to play an extremely cooperative and
constructive role,'' India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said
at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Indian officials were noncommittal about whether they
would be willing to make a deal with the hijackers and free some of
the jailed militants. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan
minimized the significance of the hijackers' decision to reduce
their demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the demands in totality,'' Mahajan said after a
cabinet meeting. ``We are not counting the number of demands or the
number of people they want us to release.''
</P>
<P>
   India's kind words for the Taliban may not buy its cooperation
indefinitely. Muttawakil seemed to be telling India not too subtly
Wednesday that it needed to compromise with the hijackers, and
quickly, to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the two sides are unable to solve their problems soon, the
Taliban will force the hijackers to leave Afghanistan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages' terrifying odyssey began last Friday, when five or
six hijackers took control of the plane during a scheduled flight
from Katmandu, Nepal, to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has come in for vituperative criticism
from newspapers and relatives of some hostages, most of whom are
Indian citizens, for the lax security measures that allowed the
hijackers, armed with grenades, pistols and knives, to board the
plane.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government has also been taken to task for allowing the
plane to leave India after landing in the northern Indian city of
Amritsar. On Wednesday officials released excerpts of exchanges
between the pilot and air traffic controllers that they said
explained the decision to allow the plane to proceed on to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcripts, the pilot said _ mistakenly as it
turned out _ that the hijackers had AK-47s and had already killed
four people and would kill more unless the plane was allowed to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   From Pakistan, the plane flew to the United Arab Emirates, where
27 hostages were released and the body of a passenger who had been
killed was unloaded. The plane then landed in Kandahar on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers have said that they want the Pakistani Muslim
cleric, 31-year-old Masood Azhar, and 35 others jailed in India
released. Azhar, a leader of Harakat ul-Ansar, a group that is on
the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations, was
active in opposing Indian rule of Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim
area in the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's 1998 report on terrorism said the group,
which now goes by the name Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, had operated
training camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Militants have made three violent attempts to secure Azhar's
release since he was jailed in 1994. In one case, a Westerner who
was kidnapped was beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Airlines officials said there are still 154 hostages on
board the plane, including 54 women and five children under the age
of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions aboard the plane Wednesday were more comfortable than
on Tuesday, when the electrical power broke down for hours, Indian
officials said. The hostages were receiving medical care and
medicine, and the toilets were being cleaned, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food and water is constantly being made available and is
supplied on demand,'' said Singh, India's foreign minister.

FEMA PREPARING FOR POTENTIAL Y2K DISASTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal emergency response teams are gearing up for
any potential disasters that might accompany the Year 2000
rollover.
</P>
<P>
   While hastening to point out that they expect no major problems
associated with the Y2K computer bug, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, nonetheless, must brace for the unspeakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``FEMA is confident nothing serious will happen,'' said Bob
Adamcik, the agency's deputy associate director for response and
recovery. ``But we are prepared to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials began planning for the Year 2000 rollover a
year and a half ago, coordinating their efforts with state and
local authorities. And despite a busy 1999 _ during which the
nation experienced 55 major disasters, including five Category 4
hurricanes _ agency officials believe they're ready.
</P>
<P>
   They say they've tried to plan for any contingency, envisioning
problems ranging from plant explosions to major power outages.
</P>
<P>
   On the agency's master planning board at its headquarters here,
disaster planners will use red, yellow and green stickers to assess
the emergency response needs around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster planners will be evaluating each region's ability to
cope with a potential problem without outside assistance, assessing
issues ranging from food supplies to urban search-and-rescue
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all areas are coded green.
</P>
<P>
   Agency planners also are trying to assess the potential needs of
the regions after the rollover for such items as generators, ice
and shelter, as well as medical-assistance teams and mortuary
crews.
</P>
<P>
   To coordinate efforts with local authorities, disaster planners
have divvied up the nation into 10 regions.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented nature of the Y2K computer problem puts
emergency response officials in something of a pickle. Agency
officials say they'll have to guard against the impulse to throw
their resources against any disaster until they can make an
assessment of the full nation's emergency needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful we do not overreact and overcommit,''
Adamcik said.
</P>
<P>
   American disaster planners, however, will have the advantage of
watching for Y2K-related problems around the globe before the New
Year breaks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials have drawn up time-zone charts so they can
track developments. The New Year begins in New Zealand at 5 a.m.
CST on Dec. 31.

PRACTICE PROCEDURE PERFORMED ON THE DYING SHOULD BE STOPPED, STUDY
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Md.)  (th) 
 By DENISE GRADY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study is calling for a halt to something that is little
known to the public but familiar to doctors in emergency rooms:
allowing doctors in training to perform an unnecessary invasive
procedure, just for practice and without informed consent, on
patients for whom resuscitation efforts appear to be failing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the practice does no physical harm, and a third of the
doctors in training said they approved of it, it should be stopped,
says a report being published Thursday in The New England Journal
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the report say the practice reduces patients to
``mere objects of use in education'' and may reinforce unethical
attitudes among interns and residents, especially since it is
normally done without the patient's consent.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure described in the article involves threading a tube
into the femoral vein in the groin. It is an important skill that
every doctor must learn because it must be performed quickly in
emergencies so that patients can be given intravenous fluids or
transfusions. And it is best learned on a live patient because
pulsating vessels are used as landmarks to guide the insertion of
the tube.
</P>
<P>
   In some teaching hospitals, house officers _ also known as
interns or residents _ are encouraged to practice the technique on
patients who do not need it during ``codes,'' or emergency
resuscitation attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Such practice sessions usually take place when resuscitation
efforts have failed for 20 minutes, doctors are about to give up
and the patient is just minutes from being pronounced dead.
Families are not generally asked for permission, or told about the
procedure afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a practice that should not be performed,'' said Dr.
Lauris C. Kaldjian, first author of the article who is an ethicist
and an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Yale
University School of Medicine. ``It represents an unacceptable
departure from a system of medical ethics that focuses on the
welfare of the patient and the need for informed consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaldjian said he doubted that anyone would do such a procedure
if the patient's family was watching. ``And that is a telling
observation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not aware of any other unnecessary procedures
being practiced on patients undergoing resuscitation. But other
doctors said that in the past, interns and residents sometimes
practiced inserting breathing tubes into the throats of patients
who had just been pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas P. Duffy, a co-author of the study who is a professor
of medicine at Yale, said the issue was significant because ``it is
important how we pass on the tradition of what is acceptable; it
determines how people behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Williams, co-chairman of the ethics committee at
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, who was not involved with the
study, said: ``It brings up something that people are uncomfortable
with: doctors must learn to care for patients and master their
skills on people. Doing it in a responsible and ethical manner is a
responsibility of all of us who teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the authors had made a good point in criticizing
the use of a procedure that has no benefit to the patient. But he
also said he had not encountered it himself or heard colleagues
talk about it, and he worried that the study might frighten
patients needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to alarm people that every time
somebody is doing something to them in a teaching institution it
must not be necessary and is only done for practice,'' Williams
said, adding that it was far more likely that patients would
encounter interns and residents learning procedures that were
actually beneficial to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Kaldjian said he and his co-authors expected some doctors to
disagree with their position. ``We hope it will engender vigorous
discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaldjian said the issue was brought to his attention by a house
officer who, he said, felt ``deeply disturbed'' after watching a
colleague practice on a dying patient.
</P>
<P>
   To determine how common the practice was, Kaldjian and other
researchers conducted an anonymous survey of 234 house officers
from three residency programs at five different hospitals in
Connecticut, from September to November 1998. The researchers did
not name the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not known whether the findings would be similar
at other hospitals, Kaldjian said he believed that the people and
institutions in the survey were a representative sample.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that 26 percent of house officers had seen
someone else practice the femoral-vein technique on a patient, 16
percent had done it themselves, 13 percent had been asked to do it
and 6 percent had asked a colleague to do it.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge the house officers' attitudes, the researchers asked
them to react to a hypothetical situation in which an elderly
patient had undergone resuscitation for 20 minutes and seemed
likely to die. The patient did not need a tube inserted into the
femoral vein, but, the researchers asked, would it be appropriate
to practice the procedure anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the house officers said no. The most common
reasons were that it was medically unnecessary, it violated
patients' rights or dignity and it could be learned in other
settings.
</P>
<P>
   The one-third who favored the practice said it was harmless and
would enable them to improve their skills and help future patients.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy and Kaldjian said there were other ways for doctors to
learn invasive procedures. Both said doctors in training should
obtain consent before practicing new techniques on patients, and
should be closely supervised by an experienced doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No procedure should occur without consent,'' Duffy said. He
and Kaldjian said that also applied to practicing on newly deceased
patients; in that case, they said, the family's permission should

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In wood-paneled VFW halls and drafty high school
gymnasiums, John McCain likes to summon audiences to join a ``great
crusade'' to seize government back from the monied interests. Then
in the very next breath he strikes a discordant note of fatalism:
he talks about defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll win this election,'' the Arizona senator
characteristically told a standing-room-only crowd in Burlington,
Vt., on a recent blustery Sunday afternoon. ``I can't tell you that
I'm going to.'' As the rapt audience listened intently, he added
the clincher that signals he is someone quite different from all
the other combatants for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of losing,'' he said, ``because I know that
I'll act on principle if I'm not afraid of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are hardly unfamiliar for a senator known more
on Capitol Hill for his passionate embrace of lost causes than for
signature accomplishments. But now these Quixotic strains are at
the very heart of McCain's insurgent candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination, marking him as the anti-politician, the
man of integrity for whom winning isn't all.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of President Clinton's lies about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent impeachment,
McCain and his advisers have calculated that voters are longing for
a new quality in their president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every presidential election is a reaction against the
incumbent's worst flaw,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications
director. Or as McCain recently mused about the mood of the voters,
``perhaps they want someone who tells it exactly as he sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is probably as good an explanation as any for what has
happened to McCain in the past five months. Riding a campaign based
on his maverick positions and personality and on his gripping
biography as a former prisoner of war, McCain has outlasted other
more prominent Republicans to become the only realistic challenger
to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's unscripted, free-wheeling style of campaigning
through town meetings where he gamely invites ``questions,
comments, insults,'' has added to his mystique. He has risen
steadily in popularity in New Hampshire, piercing Bush's aura of
inevitability and establishing himself as the current front-runner
in the nation's first primary state.
</P>
<P>
   And across the campaign, he has managed to turn the tables so
that despite his 17-years in Congress, he can stand as the outsider
against the governor from Texas whose broad support from party
leaders has made him the establishment insider.
</P>
<P>
   The question now as the 2000 presidential campaign approaches a
fast-moving series of caucuses and primaries is whether McCain can
really compete beyond New Hampshire against Bush's formidable
organization and a money advantage so overwhelming that the
governor has chosen not to accept federal matching funds and the
spending limits that go with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at those numbers,'' McCain jokes mordantly of
Bush's campaign funds, ``I'm reminded of the words of Chairman Mao,
who says it's always darkest before its totally black.''
</P>
<P>
   To husband his limited resources, McCain made an early and
unconventional decision to skip the Iowa caucuses, the first
telling vote of the 2000 race, because they would consume too much
money. Instead the Arizona senator put most of his effort into New
Hampshire, a gamble that appears to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   To secure the nomination, McCain hopes to upset Bush in New
Hampshire and then ride a wave of news media exposure to victory in
South Carolina on Feb. 19. Three days later come the Arizona and
Michigan primaries. McCain expects to win his home state, and aides
see a long-shot chance of winning Michigan as well, despite Gov.
John Engler's endorsement of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush stumble badly and lose all four states, McCain's
advisers argue that the Texan would be seriously, if not fatally,
damaged going into the March 7 primary day when a multitude of
states vote, including New York and California. ``We'll need to win
Michigan to finish Bush off, and he needs to win it to survive,''
said John Weaver, McCain's political director.
</P>
<P>
   Still New Hampshire has a history of favoring mavericks, and
many Republicans predict that Bush's formidable campaign war chest
and 50-state organization will resurrect him after New Hampshire,
barring any significant blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think McCain can beat Bush unless Bush gives him the
opportunity to do so,'' said Eddie Mahe, a Republican strategist
unaligned with any presidential campaign. ``There's a heavy
component of organization in primaries,'' Mahe said. ``If you don't
have the organizational capacity to get people out to vote, you
have a tremendous handicap.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers counter that his fund-raising has improved
with his surge in New Hampshire, making it easier to begin
organizing in places McCain would not have hoped to contest just a
few months ago. The campaign announced Wednesday that it had taken
in $6.1 million since the beginning of October and its fund-raising
total would soon reach more than $21 million. That figure includes
$6.2 million in federal matching money that becomes available after
the New Year as well as $2 million transferred from a Senate
campaign account.
</P>
<P>
   In previous election years, that kind of money would have been
enough to mount a strong primary campaign. But against Bush's $63
million, McCain has had to focus narrowly and intensively on a few
states. ``The $20 million in six states can beat $60 million in
50,'' said Mike Murphy, a strategist to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   With money growing, the campaign has now expanded its organizing
into Virginia, Michigan and Washington. And it went on the air with
a third television commercial this week, showcasing McCain's pledge
to protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say an important challenge for McCain, as his poll
standings bring him new plausibility and more scrutiny, is to move
beyond his biography and start to show where he stands on issues
like education, tax cutting and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, his campaign has been based almost entirely on his
personal story of heroism in Vietnam and on his free-wheeling style
with voters and journalists alike. The signature issues on which he
is running _ a restored military, a campaign finance overhaul and a
crusade against pork-barrel spending _ all seem to relate to his
personality and background.
</P>
<P>
   Even the first serious broadsides against McCain this fall came
not over issues but on personality _ the accusation by critics that
his hot temper would make him a bad president. In defending
himself, McCain argued that he would need a temper to fight for the
public against entrenched special interests in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has started to deliver a series of policy speeches
to flesh out his positions. He has already spoken on military
policy, health care and the environment and plans to move on across
the next few months to citizenship, tax cuts, Social Security,
education and technology.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to his ease at town meetings, he is impatient in
giving speeches, rushing through them in a sing-song as if they
bore him. And once off the topics of the campaign finance law or
national security policy, he can seem surprisingly uninterested in
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of his bare-bones staffing also start to show. After
a recent speech in Charleston, S.C., about health policy, McCain
was unable to answer questions about program costs, saying he had
misplaced his fact sheet. His staff gave out one set of numbers
then paged reporters at night to say some of the figures were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Setting out his positions also runs the risk for McCain of
highlighting just how conservative he really is and possibly
diminishing his ability to reach out to conservatives and
independents alike in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where the
primaries are not restricted only to party members. His tendency is
to sound Democratic on issues while putting forward conservative
programs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That can become a difficult balancing act, as McCain learned the
hard way when he talked with editors of The San Francisco Chronicle
on abortion last August.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision,
he said, ``I would love to see a point where it is irrelevant and
could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary.'' He
added that ``certainly in the short term or even the long term, I
would not support the repeal of Roe vs. Wade'' because repeal would
``force X number of women in America'' to undergo ``illegal and
dangerous operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer drew a wave of criticism from conservatives, who
thought he was backtracking from his anti-abortion record. Now,
whenever he is asked about abortion, McCain immediately points out
that he has consistently voted against abortion in his 17 years in
Congress and says that he would support repeal of Roe vs. Wade. He
then goes on to argue that both sides on the polarized abortion
issue should try to work together on adoption. But this response
often proves unsatisfactory to social moderates in New Hampshire,
who are trying to decide whether to vote for him or Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is when goring special interests that McCain becomes most
animated and passionate. In fact, he revels in being downright
contrarian.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent county Republican dinner in St. Johnsbury, Vt., he
happily told his listeners ``you have to tell the American people
sometimes what they don't want to hear,'' and talked about how he
had spoken out against ethanol subsidies during a debate in Iowa,
where the subsidy for corn-based fuel is popular.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd applauded him, he could not resist mentioning
provocatively that he also opposed the Northeast Dairy Compact,
which the state's congressional delegation had just vigorously
fought for to maintain milk prices favorable to Vermont dairy
farmers. ``I don't support it because I think it raises the price
for average citizens,'' he said, drawing no immediate response from
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely this quality that is winning him converts.
In a VFW hall in Berlin, N.H., Margaret Hill, 87, bundled in a
white ski jacket, suddenly stood up recently and told McCain in a
quavering voice, ``It would be so wonderful to get a president of
the United States who doesn't say what they think you want to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pack up,'' shot back McCain. ``I'm taking you with me wherever
I go.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia's chief representative in Chechnya, Nikolai
Koshman has seen plenty of hardship. But he was visibly troubled by
what he saw in Alkhan-Yurt, a village near Grozny that residents
say was pillaged by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear that I have not seen anything like this in Chechnya,''
Koshman exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw, shown in a videotape of his visit, was distraught
villagers with tales of summary executions, truckloads of looted
goods and burned and pillaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Koshman was involved in a confrontation in which
Russian soldiers threatened to shoot him, only to learn that they
had threatened a top Kremlin aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you know whom you are talking to,'' Maj. Gen. Vakha
Ibragimov, a senior military aide to Koshman, screamed at the
soldiers. ``This is not like torturing women.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations that Russian soldiers plundered Alkhan-Yurt have
stirred up a political storm here. They were documented on a
videotape prepared by Malik Saidullayev, an affluent Chechen
businessmen from Alkhan-Yurt who supports the three-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
   Fragments of the tape have appeared on Russian television.
Saidullayev allowed The New York Times to view the entire tape,
more than an hour long.
</P>
<P>
   The tape does not document all of the charges, but it strongly
supports the allegations that Russian troops went on a rampage,
terrorizing civilians, killing some and stealing their goods.
</P>
<P>
   Located 10 miles southwest of Grozny, Alkhan-Yurt was the scene
of a bloody battle. Hundreds of Russian troops laid siege last
month when, residents say, the town was occupied by about 50 rebels
who refused the townspeople's appeals to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians approached the village believing the militants had
fled, only to be drawn into a bloody ambush. When they finally
seized Alkhan-Yurt on Dec. 1, Human Rights Watch has reported, the
Russian soldiers plundered the town over a two-week period and
killed 17 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The tape essentially supports this account, and the story of how
it was made is itself an intriguing tale about Chechen politics.
</P>
<P>
   Saidullayev, who has close ties with top Russian officials, said
he first learned about the allegations on Dec. 15 from several
residents who had managed to escape. He rushed to the Russian
military base at Mozdok, in North Ossetia, the next day. There he
met with Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the Russian general
staff, and Koshman, a deputy prime minister who administers the
Russian-controlled area of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin and Saidullayev flew by helicopter to Chechnya that
night, and the general put a small force of soldiers and armored
personnel carriers at Saidullayev's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, Saidullayev ventured to Alkhan-Yurt, accompanied by
his cameraman. As the tape ran, Saidullayev was besieged by two
desperate woman, who said Russian soldiers had ripped their
earrings from their ears and stolen their food. Shirvani Dakayev,
an elderly man, complained that the soldiers had terrorized the
settlement: ``The village has been destroyed. The soldiers did it
on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   On a drive through the town, Saidullayev uncovered caches of
television sets, video equipment and carpets that had been taken by
Russian soldiers who were still occupying the town. He said in an
interview that the troops were from the 15th Battalion, part of the
Western Group of forces under the command of Maj. Gen. Vladimir A.
Shamanov.
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov has denied that his soldiers committed any crimes.
Rumors have circulated that he might be forced to retire because of
the allegations, but on Tuesday, Shamanov was one of several
commanders who were awarded one of the highest military honors,
Hero of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Saidullayev, however, was not the only one concerned about
Alkhan-Yurt. Koshman was filmed inspecting the town, accompanied by
Gen. Ivan Babichev, the senior Russian military commander, and
other aides.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, villagers approached Koshman with tales of looting
and summary executions of residents who objected to the plunder. He
listened attentively, occasionally expressing outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was a colonel in the militia,'' said Zakri Muradov, an
old man. ``He was taken out of his room and shot _ for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man handed Koshman a list of villagers who were
reportedly gunned down by Russian troops: 23 civilians, according
to Saidullayev.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to one home occupied by Russian troops, Koshman
came upon a stack of family photo albums smeared with blood. He
promised to supply food and medicine. He also promised a thorough
investigation. ``The government prosecutor must come here _ today
or tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian and military prosecutors have since begun an
investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even Koshman had some difficulties with the Russian troops. As
he left one house, nearby soldiers shouted menacingly, ``We will
shoot you.'' They had no idea about the identity of the visitor but
did not want him snooping.
</P>
<P>
   The military aide, Ibragimov, shouted at the soldiers that they
had just threatened a top Kremlin official. Koshman then demanded
that the soldiers, who included a commanding officer, hand over
their documents and report to military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, Koshman promised the villagers that they would
be protected. ``There are a sea of people who are supposed to
defend you,'' Koshman said, referring to the Russian troops. ``Our
question is why this isn't being done.''

&HT;     CENTURY'S GREAT LEADERS HAD FASCINATING RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid the post-mortems on the turbulent and now
departed 20th century, it is fascinating to study the interplay
between the remarkable individuals who dominated and shaped the
period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the atomic bomb, which may have been the greatest
scientific breakthrough of the era, resulted initially from a
letter sent by Albert Einstein, chosen by Time Magazine as the
``person of the century,'' to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the
top runner-up for that honor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, the year World War II began, scientist Leo Szilard
learned that Nazi Germany had made progress in the fission of
uranium, and he passed the word along to Alexander Sachs, a New
Deal economist, who then got in touch with Einstein. All three men
were immigrants from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If Einstein would write a letter to Roosevelt explaining the
possible dire consequences of Germany's accomplishment, Sachs
promised to deliver it in person.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Oct. 11, little more that a month after the war began,
Sachs visited Roosevelt and did something unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of handing Einstein's letter to the busy president, who
might lay it aside and pay little attention to it, Sachs read it
aloud to him. Roosevelt knew little about nuclear fission, but
Einstein's warning captured his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new phenomenon,'' wrote the brilliant scientist who had
escaped Adolf Hitler's tyranny, ``would lead to the construction of
bombs, and it is conceivable _ though much less certain  &Cx1f; _ that
extremely powerful bombs of a new type may be constructed. A single
bomb of this type, carried by boat or exploded in port, might very
well destroy the whole port together with towns of the surrounding
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt sent Einstein's letter and an accompanying scientific
report to an aide with the order, ``This requires action.'' Thus
began the monumental project that six years later ended World War
II when atomic bombs were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki and
Japan surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of intertwining of the lives and achievements of
two of the great men of the century can be found in the
relationship between Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, who was
selected by Time Magazine 50 years ago as the ``man of the half
century.''
</P>
<P>
   In that dark April of 1945 when Roosevelt died, Churchill
declared: ``For us, it remains only to say that in Franklin
Roosevelt there died the greatest American friend we have ever
known, and the greatest champion of freedom who has ever brought
help and comfort from the new world to the old.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, Churchill provided a personal assessment of
his heroic and courageous partner in the ``Grand Alliance'' that
triumphed over murderous fascism in Europe and brutal imperialism
in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   At the time that Churchill delivered his tribute in the House of
Commons, Germany lay in ruins, and victory in Europe was less than
four weeks away. Triumph in the Pacific would be achieved in four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt and Churchill, who sometimes disagreed vehemently with
each other, shared certain qualities. Both were scions of
well-placed families who were proud of their heritage. Both were
master orators, who understood the art of marshaling the English
language and using the radio as magic weapons for leadership. Both
were Victorians who left an indelible imprint on the post-Victorian
era.
</P>
<P>
   Both were Machiavellian politicians who understood when to
cajole and when to command. Both could be arrogant and petty. Both
were magnificent, theatrical leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both also were men who, like the other outstanding individuals
of the 20th century, kept their eyes focused on the future. They
led their people through the blood and treachery of war filled with
a vision of a better future for them and for peoples throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill and another illustrious figure of the century,
Mohandas Gandhi, had an unusual relationship. While Churchill vowed
that he did not become prime minister to ``preside over the
liquidation of the British Empire,'' Gandhi sought to hasten that
liquidation by winning independence for India.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gandhi, whom Churchill characterized as a
``half-naked fakir,'' was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The lives and achievements of the big industrialists and
manufacturers were intertwined, as were those of the scientists,
the medical pioneers, the statesmen, the contributors to the arts
and leaders in many other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside his fellow Americans atop the world pinnacle at
the beginning of a new millennium _ a position occupied in
centuries past alternately by leaders of England, France and Spain
_ Roosevelt would understand that America's stance could be
transitory. He, like Einstein, Churchill, Gandhi and others who
shaped the 20th century, would be seeking ways to improve life in
the 21st century by strengthening democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   If the famous 19th-century editor Horace Greeley were to return
from the dead, he might alter his famous counsel to young men to
``go west.'' He might instead suggest that they go forward in hopes
of making the 21st century better than the 20th.

 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba _ Elian Gonzalez is everywhere and nowhere on the
streets of his hometown. As if summoning a phantom, his neighbors
point to the narrow sidewalks where he used to scamper about with
his friends or to the roof where they often saw him flying his
kite. They cling to his memory almost as dearly as Elian himself
held on to the inner tube he was strapped to when a boat carrying
him, his mother and several other Cubans capsized as they tried to
flee to Florida last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had children, I am too old,'' said Diria Rosa Ojeda,
60, a neighbor. ``But the child I never had, I see in him.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, the 6-year-old boy has been at the center
of an international tug of war and hearts that has roiled Cubans on
both sides of the Florida Straits as they await the decision of the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Since his mother and most of the other would-be refugees died on
the journey, Elian was taken in by his father's relatives in Miami,
who want him to stay with them for a chance at a better life. But
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and both sets of grandparents are
very much alive here in Cardenas and want the child returned, a
demand that has been echoed by thousands of Cubans in rallies
throughout the island organized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   As with other issues and people caught in the limbo of U.S. and
Cuban relations, the case has been enmeshed in exile intrigue and
international policy. Like the homages to Che Guevara and President
Fidel Castro, a snapshot of Elian _ his hand touching his chin in a
pensive moment _ has become an icon here, put on T-shirts,
billboards and posters. In Cardenas, where the houses are as worn
and weary as the people inside, his neighbors hold a vigil that is
more personal than political.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have no lives here,'' said Giralda Diaz, 70, a
neighbor who stood in a friend's doorway across the street from
Gonzalez's house. ``We do not work. We spend the day waiting for a
car to stop in front. People are sad. If you had a child, you would
feel it in your spirit. It is not humane.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's parents had divorced, but neighbors said the parting was
amicable.
</P>
<P>
   They described both parents as dedicated to the boy, who they
said lacked for nothing because they held tourism jobs, which gave
them access to dollars and, more important, life's elusive daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, they saw Elian at his father's house,
spending the night when his mother had to work late or awakened
early because of her maid's job at a hotel in the nearby resort
town of Varadero. The father would often take him to a restaurant
and resort complex where he worked, or treat him to outings and
toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obsessed with that child,'' said Isabel Alarcon. ``If
the boy wanted a movie, he rented it. Everything he wanted, he
got.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was all the more shocking when they learned that Elian's
mother had spirited him away when she left Cuba. The neighbors can
only believe that she had fallen under the sway of her new husband,
who organized the failed escape. Among themselves, they talk about
how the mother must have known that the boat was not seaworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know how that woman was crazy enough to follow that
man,'' said Elsa Diaz Vidal. ``She took the boy because of him. She
had no one over there to go to. Then she died in that horrible sea.
His real father would never let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest residents on the block, Hilario Sanchez Menendez,
88, and his wife, Ramona, 80, feel a special kinship with the
Gonzalez clan, remembering when they used to cradle Juan Miguel in
their arms. On days when they did not pass by for a chat or a cup
of coffee, Juan Miguel would pass by their home to make sure
everything was all right. Sanchez Menendez said that his mood
brightened recently when he was at the Gonzalez home when Elian
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you coming here?'' he asked Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ```I will be there in a few days when my vacation is over,''' he
said the boy replied. ``Then he started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears are shed inside Gonzalez's home, too. The neighbors said
they often see him looking depressed, sitting inside his living
room, where pictures of Elian outnumber those of Castro and Che. In
the last few days, they have not seen him in the neighborhood. The
man they described as a hard worker for his son has become barely
able to summon the strength to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved here, he was born,'' Ms. Ojeda said of Gonzalez.
``Now he is an old man because of this. He is in a lot of pain. He
is suffering. His co-workers come by and say, `Let's go to the
hotel.' He feels bad, because the hotel is by the sea. He sees that
and is traumatized again.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors say they cannot understand why Elian's relatives
in Miami are so intent on keeping the boy, and they dismiss any
suggestion that he could have a better life there. At home, they
said, despite the country's economic hardships, he had free
schooling and health care and the chance to be with the people he
has known all his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better opportunity does he have being raised among
strangers,'' Ms. Alarcon said. ``How many other children from other
countries have to go back? Why not Elian? Because he is Cuban? Be
we poor or rich, whatever we are, we have the right to have our
child next to us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do his grandparents on both sides, they argue. It was
not that long ago that the grandparents or the father would pick up
Elian at the Marcelo Salado Primary School, where his desk now sits
empty. . If he returns, Cuban officials have promised that his
homecoming will be without fanfare or public celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would only affect him even more,'' said Maribel Casas
Reyes, the school's director. ``We are struggling to have him in a
happy situation, not to bruise his emotions more. If we did that,
it would be worse than what he experienced in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The students, wearing T-shirts that proclaim ``We Will Save
Elian,'' sing songs and recite poems in his honor each day, while
others have drawn pictures that are on exhibit at the town's
museum, along with photographs of Elian in Miami under the heading
``The Child They Kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   In one classroom, a banner declaring ``Happy Birthday Elian''
still hangs, a reminder of the day this month when Castro himself
visited the school. To commemorate the occasion, he signed a guest
book with the inscription, ``For Elian's Liberty, Motherland or
Death.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan has been a familiar refrain at the many rallies held
in recent weeks. At one at the University of Havana, students
recited poetry and read essays about how Elian should return to the
island where he has his family, his flag and his comandante, and
how the only things he would learn about in the United States were
drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many praised Castro while denouncing American imperialism as
well as the gifts and attention bestowed on the boy by Miami's
exile community, a group they called a ``Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Events calling for Elian's return have begun to annoy some
Cubans, who agree that the boy needs to be with his father but have
nonetheless tired of turning on their radios or televisions only to
encounter yet another rally with revolutionary songs or demonic
caricatures of exile politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rallies have been smaller than the earlier ones that
brought the city _ and workplaces _ to a standstill. At a recent
university event, several hundred students politely waved flags
near the stage while many others milled about chatting and
laughing. The feeling in some quarters has been that the government
has seized on the public's sympathy with the custody issue to
bolster political enthusiasm at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up with this,'' said one Havana resident who
declined to give her name. ``I think there has to be something
deeper politically. There has to be something more significant than
we can see.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the strong words uttered by the youngest demonstrators have
led some critics to accuse the Cuban government of politicizing the
case just as much as the exile community has.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would happen if a child stood outside and shouted `Down
with Fidel'?'' said another Havana resident. ``They would detain
his family because someone taught him that. Here, they put 5- and
6-year-old children at rallies making political statements about
North American policy. They say that Miami is playing with the
child? Here they are playing with him too.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the talk of toys and politics remains a motherless child
with a father who wants him back. On his street in Cardenas, it is
a constant refrain. No plaything or great-uncle in Miami, they
said, could ever replace his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is a little humanity,'' said Maria Alian Scott, a
teen-age neighbor. ``To see how that father suffers for his son
while he is not returned to him. And that boy has had the trauma of
seeing his mother die in front of him. What better psychiatrist
than his father? What better hospital than his home?''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exodus Communications Inc., born of the Internet, lost money
this year. And last year. And the year before. But it is spending
hundreds of millions of dollars anyway on new high-technology
centers to house and operate the Web sites of hundreds of clients.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the Year 2000 date switch. Companies like Exodus _
young, profitless, but gambling on a golden future _ help to
explain why capital spending has not faltered despite all the fears
from experts that business investment would slow in the fourth
quarter as corporate America braced for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The investment slowdown has not happened and is not likely to
happen early next year either, even after all the spending to
upgrade computer software to overcome the Year 2000 problem slows
to a crawl. Quite the contrary: The capital spending boom that has
lasted for much of the decade appears to have plenty of steam to
continue well into the new year, sustaining in the process the
nation's robust economic growth of roughly 4 percent a year since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a corporate executive and the economy is strong and
labor is scarce and financing is inexpensive, as it is today, what
do you do?'' asked David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI forecasting unit. ``You buy new equipment, or more equipment,
and increase output that way and cut production costs in the
bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong consumer demand, new technology and relatively low
interest rates, which reduce the cost of new investment, have all
contributed to the investment boom. So has the frequent replacement
of office computers with faster and more powerful ones. High on the
list of contributing factors is the constant retooling to produce
new products. Consumers are increasingly willing to pay more for
new models or new twists on existing models, and these changes are
made more frequently now than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case at the DaimlerChrysler Group, where model
changes now come every five years instead of every six to eight
years, and where $8 billion in capital spending in 1999 is expected
to rise to $9 billion in 2000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of this is direct spending to develop and make new
models,'' said Wynn Van Bussman, chief corporate economist at
DaimlerChrysler. ``Computer spending for Y2K is lost in the
rounding off of these billions.''
</P>
<P>
   American capital spending represents the total cost of all the
new factories and office buildings, machinery, software, computers
and other equipment that companies acquire to produce their goods
and services in this country or to expand and modernize their
operations here.
</P>
<P>
   Such spending in the third quarter, the Commerce Department
reported last week, came to $1.2 trillion at an annual rate, or
12.7 percent of the value of the national economy. That is the
highest percentage since the early 1980s, a decade in which
businesses around the country revamped operations to meet the
challenge of formidable Japanese and European competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the 1980s, very little of the $1.2 trillion is
being spent on new factories, office buildings and other
structures. Most of the investment, $910 billion, has gone for
machinery and equipment, particularly computers and software. In
the late 1990s, spending in these high-technology sectors has risen
faster than any other aspect of capital spending, reaching an
annual rate of $247 billion in the third quarter. The rise reflects
substantial real gains, but also flows, in part, from a peculiar
way of pricing computers in the official statistics.
</P>
<P>
   If a computer cost $2,000 in 1998 and a more powerful version in
1999 still sells for $2,000, the Commerce Department assigns a
value to the extra power, say $500. The computer then enters the
government's investment account at $2,500. That sort of
bookkeeping, obviously only a rough guess that may over- or
underestimate the genuine advances in computing, has fattened
capital spending in an age of frequent breakthroughs in technology.
</P>
<P>
   The investment boom is easier to see and touch in other
industries. Aircraft orders, for example, have more than doubled
since 1996 as passenger traffic has risen on the nation's airlines.
Electric power shortages that first appeared in the Midwest and
Southeast three summers ago have set off a rapid expansion of
generating plants fueled by natural gas. The demand for more gas,
in turn, has raised investment in that industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price spikes that accompanied the electricity outages were
a signal to step up investment,'' said Lawrence Makovich, director
of electric power research at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Power companies have increased their investment to $8 billion a
year in the United States from $2 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Further, during the last 18 months the industry has announced
projects, Makovich said, that should eventually increase the
generation of electricity in this country by more than a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   New technology is a big source of capital spending. The Internet
is an eye-catching industry in mid-construction, giving rise to
hundreds of start-ups like Exodus, which operates computer networks
for companies with Web sites. On Wall Street, hundreds of millions
of dollars are being spent for Internet links and online trading.
Big telephone and cable companies are rewiring American homes,
hoping to provide each with a single new connection that will carry
not only voice communication but also cable television, e-mail and
high-speed Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is driving us is the exploding technology, not the strong
economy,'' Eileen Connolly, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T said, although
she acknowledged that the two can be hard to separate.
</P>
<P>
   Optimistic investors are also a prod to capital spending. Their
enthusiasm finances the expansion plans of companies like Exodus,
whose stock price has soared 985 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are convinced,'' said Kenneth J. Matheny, a senior
economist at Macroeconomic Advisors Inc., ``that Internet-based
methods of distributing information and products will turn out to
be much more profitable than traditional methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Exodus, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., with 700
employees, operates at 15 locations around the United States and
one in London. The buildings resemble large warehouses from the
outside. Inside are the computers, servers and communications gear
that store and manipulate Web sites and make them appear on
computer screens around the world at the touch of a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Each location cost Exodus about $50 million, and from the start
of this year to the end of 2000, the company expects to spend more
than $750 million _ most of it next year _ on 15 more locations,
the majority to be erected in this country.
</P>
<P>
   That is quite a feat for a company with only about $200 million
in revenue this year from 1,700 customers. Making the feat possible
are the rising stock market and the optimism of investors who
gamble that Exodus will emerge from intense competition as a
dominant player and thus a cash cow in a key industry in the new
information economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well positioned in a market where the demand is
outstripping the supply,'' said Adam Wegner, vice president and
general counsel. He says that without the heavy spending on
expansion, Exodus would be profitable today. But he also points to
a Catch-22: Without the expansion, competitors would push Exodus
out of the business of managing Web sites. ``The whole name of the
game is to expand to supply the growing demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus went public in March last year, raising $70 million with
an initial public offering at $15 a share. Since then, the stock
has split two-for-one three times, and its shares closed Wednesday
at $87.1875 on the Nasdaq exchange. With that strong performance as
backdrop, Exodus has raised $1.52 billion on the bond market,
through four high-yield offerings. These are the securities that in
the 1980s were called junk bonds, a term now out of fashion even
though the high risk is the same.
</P>
<P>
   The last and biggest offering, $1 billion, took place this
month, and Exodus now faces $100 million a year in interest
payments. That represents a huge chunk of its annual revenue but is
a burden made lighter through its soaring stock price.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The expectation that share prices will rise more has become ``a
big component of capital investment,'' said Robert Pollin, an
economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   A rising stock market also encourages capital spending among
companies that do not need to raise more from the markets. That is
because a rising market makes an investment in new equipment
automatically worth more as a company's share price rises,
effectively raising the resale value of the new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If capital investment is rising in many industries, it is
notably absent in others. Some oil companies are just beginning to
respond to higher petroleum prices, announcing that if prices hold
up, they will increase spending on exploration and drilling. Excess
production capacity inhibits the steel industry and paper and pulp
companies, which have shut down older mills. Phelps Dodge, the big
copper producer, is holding back, too, even though the demand for
copper is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the interest that people have in quality of life drives
copper demand,'' said Thomas Foster, vice president and controller
at Phelps Dodge. ``Telephones in every room, pop the trunk with a
button rather than a key _ all these things use copper. But the
market can't handle more investment now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a high-technology company like Motorola is cautious,
preferring to outsource its production to manufacturers in Taiwan,
Singapore and Thailand. ``We don't have to pump the capital into
expansion,'' said Scott Stevens, a spokesman for Motorola's
semiconductor business, ``but we are locking in the available
capacity that we need and faster than if we went and built it with
our own bricks and mortar.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly not the mood, however, among the thousands of
companies, many of them newly incorporated, that are opening Web
sites. iVillage is in this herd, creating an Internet site that
offers all sorts of information and shopping leads, of interest
mainly to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are spending between $5 million and $8 million a year on
capital investment, primarily for computers, servers and
communications gear,'' said Craig Monaghan, chief financial officer
at iVillage, which is four years old and has 400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even a stock market correction might not inhibit iVillage,
although the profitless company pays for capital spending by
raising money through share offerings, the most recent last summer.
</P>
<P>
   If its stock price fell sharply, would iVillage cut back on
investment? Not right away, Monaghan said. ``We have sufficient
cash on hand so that we can fund our operations for a while.''

 &HT;    Falcons' plea to youth: step up _ or step out
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When a NFL team limps into its final game with a 4-11
record, it would be nice to think that an abundance of talented
young players is ready to blossom.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta Falcons have just an average group, even though
27 active players have three years of experience or less.
</P>
<P>
   Seven will start Monday against the San Francisco 49ers _ guards
Bob Hallen and Calvin Collins, tackle Ephraim Salaam, tight end
O.J. Santiago, wide receiver Tim Dwight and linebackers Keith
Brooking and Henri Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, Santiago and Crockett will become restricted free
agents after the season, and there's no guarantee they will return
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the other young players might start next
season _ defensive tackle Ed Jasper, defensive end Patrick Kerney,
tight end Reggie Kelly and middle linebacker Jeff Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons don't have players with the talent of Jevon Kearse
or Edgerrin James. Some might blossom suddenly. But in the era of
the salary cap, more young players must factor into a team's plans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a financial fact: Older players cost more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to count on young people playing quicker than
in the past,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``When you draft guys now,
particularly in the first, second or third round, you have to count
on those guys contributing pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The new-age logic, with a strong emphasis on the draft, explains
why the Falcons cut linebacker Cornelius Bennett last offseason and
moved Keith Brooking _ their first-round choice in 1998 _ into the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The first player Reeves drafted, cornerback Michael Booker,
hasn't earned a starting job. The second, defensive tackle Nathan
Davis, is out of football. The third, running back Byron Hanspard,
is recovering from a serious knee injury. The fourth, Santiago, has
seen his pass receptions drop from 27 last season to 12 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Booker has a $1.62 million cap charge this season, and $1
million of his salary was guaranteed. Next season, he has a cap
charge of $1.82 million, and no salary is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, it puts me in a situation where I either step up or
step out,'' said Booker, who has struggled to overcome an Aug. 7
injury to his right thigh. ``I'm ready for that. I ain't ready to
go anywhere; I love Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Falcons sign Crockett, Collins or Santiago to new
long-term contracts, which is unlikely, they will become restricted
free agents. The team probably will tender one-year contracts to
all three to guarantee that if another team signs them, the Falcons
get draft compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In Collins' case, the compensation would be a sixth-round
choice, because that's the round in which he was drafted in 1997.
It makes him more likely to draw interest from other teams.
Santiago was a third-round pick in '97, Crockett a fourth-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard, another restricted free agent, probably won't draw
much interest, because he would cost second-round compensation and
the jury is out on whether his surgically repaired left knee will
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about where I'll be, but ... I don't worry about
it,'' said Hanspard, who after a four-week layoff rushed for 102
yards last Sunday. ``I feel confident in my ability ... and I know
my career is by far not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago has been a starter since his first pro game.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows the Falcons traded the 2000 draft's first-round
pick to the Baltimore Ravens in order to draft tight end Reggie
Kelly in the second round in April. The chances of him being traded
are real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll relax for a little while (after the season) and then get
back to work,'' Santiago said. ``I definitely will be the player I
want to be in this league, and I will work toward that.''
</P>

 &HT;    UGA's Jennings appears healthy heading into the Outback Bowl
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The scene became all too familar for the
University of Georgia Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   It would be in the second half, usually in the fourth quarter,
and suddenly play would stop. The reason for the stoppage lay in a
red-and-silver heap on the field. Jonas Jennings, No. 75, would be
face down in the turf, writhing in obvious pain and unable to get
up.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' training staff would rush to his side. After
several minutes, Jennings, with the trainers' assistance, finally
would be able to stand and, ever so slowly, hobble off to the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Georgia, its offensive production often was
sidelined with him.
</P>
<P>
   That scene repeated itself in the Bulldogs' last four games of
the year. Not coincidentally, three of them ended in losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years, Jonas has been the heart and soul of
the offensive line,'' Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter said.
Jennings protects Carter's blind side.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he does for this football team goes unmentioned most of
the time,'' Carter said. ``He just means so much to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' value was evident in the Florida game on Oct. 30.
Georgia trailed 16-14 and seemed to be gaining control of the game
as it moved into the fourth quarter. Then Jennings went down,
aggravating the chronic right ankle injury that has plagued him the
last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Florida's heralded defensive end, Alex Brown, who had
not been heard from most of the first three quarters, recorded two
sacks. Both plays set up Florida touchdowns and the Gators went on
to win 30-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is a warrior,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said about
Jennings. ``I think he's got a chance to be a similar type of
player as the other tackles we've had. We've had (Adam) Meadows,
(Chris) Terry and (Jon) Stinchcomb drafted, and I think Jonas has a
good shot at that. . . . He probably missed out on some post-season
recognition because he was hurt this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, a 6-foot-4, 302-pound junior from College Park, Ga.,
has started at all three offensive line positions since arriving at
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jennings settled in at left tackle. It is the line's
most challenging position because its chief function is to protect
the quarterback's blind side. It also usually requires facing the
opponents' best pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the case again Saturday when Georgia faces Purdue
in the Outback Bowl. Jennings will line up across from defensive
end Akin Ayodele, who leads the Boilermakers with 10 sacks and 18
tackles for loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonas is probably the most versatile lineman that I've ever
coached,'' Donnan said. ``He's a good enough athlete that he could
play tight end if he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings suffers from a chronic inside ankle sprain. He first
injured the leg in the South Carolina game in 1998. Although he
never missed any playing time that season because of the injury, he
has felt the effects of it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings had arthroscopic surgery ``to clean out'' the ankle
after spring practice this season. He didn't encounter any problems
with it until the Florida game. He was unable to finish that game
or the Ole Miss and Auburn contests. He went out in the fourth
quarter but returned against Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' weekly rehabilitation became a matter of routine the
last third of the season. He would have the ankle iced down and
placed in a boot cast on Sunday. He would sit out Monday's
practice, get treatment and do some limited running on Tuesday,
practice on Wednesday and Thursday and be ready to go for Saturday
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sundays were painful,'' Jennings said. ``I'd go in, ice it
down, put my boot on, then start the rehab over again and get ready
for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the swelling would go away. Jennings' tolerance for the
ever-present pain has become legendary within the team.
</P>
<P>
   So what got him through it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly a will thing, having Georgia pride,'' Jennings
said. ``If you believe you're an asset to the team, you know you've
got to go out and help. . . . You just think about (how) you're
family, how everybody's behind you, all the guys who are counting
on you, things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't want to let anybody down, that's the main
thing.''

   Peach Bowl gains respect and reputation as competitive game
</P>
<P>
   By Jack Wilkinsonc. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a bank senior vice president, Glenn Cornell makes
a pretty persuasive Peach Bowl chairman. Cornell can tell you
precisely how competitive the Peach has become, citing the bowl's
3.2-point margin of victory over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell Jackie Sherill and Tommy Bowden the very same thing.
And has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the coaches to do their best to try and keep that
up,'' Cornell said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   When No. 16 Mississippi State and resurgent Clemson meet tonight
in the 32nd Peach Bowl, they not only can enhance their
considerable successes but also maintain the Peach Bowl's
burgeoning reputation as a top bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, the Peach Bowl is fourth in bowl
attendance with an average of 69,643. The only bowls higher are the
Rose (98,960), Sugar (73,105) and Fiesta (72,228). Last year's
Peach, in which Georgia rallied for a thrilling 35-33 victory, drew
a Peach-record crowd of 72,876 to the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This year's game sold out on Dec. 9, the earliest sellout in the
bowl's history.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the Dome's safe haven and bigger crowds, and
the game's SEC-ACC affiliation, that have helped transform the
Peach into a plum bowl. It's the dramatic, competitiveness.
Starting with Virginia's 27-24 win over Purdue in 1984, only one of
the last 15 Peach Bowls has been decided by as many as seven points
-- Virginia's 34-27 victory over Georgia in 1995. Twelve have been
decided by four points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Mississippi State and Clemson both are perfect
for the Peach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've accomplished, under the circumstances, a lot
this year,'' said Bowden, whose first Clemson team went 6-5. ''I
wouldn't want a loss to tarnish it, but ... .''
</P>
<P>
   It won't. Back in the Peach Bowl for the third time in four
years, Clemson has risen rapidly from last year's 3-8
disappointment. Playing the second-toughest schedule in the
country, the Tigers suffered four of their five defeats by three
points, including losses to No. 1 Florida State and 13-0 Marshall.
Their biggest loss, 31-11, came against the nation's third
undefeated team, No. 2 Virginia Tech, which plays FSU for the
national championship in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens tonight, Clemson has what it's lacked in recent
years: Hope. And a future.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State, meanwhile, is hoping to win 10 games for just
the second time in school history. The 9-2 Bulldogs are comfortable
in the clutch, too. Five of their wins have come by three points or
less. After blowing out Vanderbilt to go 5-0, State rallied to edge
Auburn by two points, then LSU and Kentucky by a point each to
reach 8-0 and No. 8 in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite close losses at Alabama and Arkansas, Mississippi State
beat Ole Miss 23-20. Now the Bulldogs can join State's 1940 team as
the only ones in school history to win 10 games. As much as
Sherrill wants to win tonight, he knows, ''There's so much made of
losing momentum (with a bowl loss). That's because your fans are
unrealistic.'
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for both teams, Sherill said, ''We're not playing for
the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden will have Brandon Streeter, his starting quarterback,
back. Streeter, who set a Clemson season record by completing 67.7
percent of his passes, dislocated his hip in the first quarter
against Georgia Tech on Nov. 13. Asked how he will use Streeter and
backup Woody Dantzler tonight, Bowden said, grinning, ''A lot will
be by feel, by injury: which one gets hurt first.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no set plan or quarterback rotation. Whichever Clemson
quarterback plays must contend with a blitzing, pressure
Mississippi State defense that led the nation in total defense and
rushing defense and the SEC in scoring defense and pass efficiency
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being in the top five (nationally) in all four major
categories,'' Bowden said, ''that's what scares you.''

RUSSIANS DETAIN, INTERROGATE 7 WESTERN JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russian forces detained seven Western journalists,
including Globe Moscow Bureau Chief David Filipov, in Chechnya
Wednesday, releasing them only after a lengthy interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Filipov, along with four other reporters, a television camera
man and a photographer, was stopped by Russian soldiers on the
outskirts of the Chechen capital of Grozny and flown by helicopter
to the Russian military base at Mozdok. The group was not
mistreated, Filipov said by telephone from Mozdok after he was
released.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have vehemently discouraged journalists from
traveling and reporting independently in Chechnya, where Russian
forces are locked in a brutal war with rebel fighers.
</P>
<P>
   Three journalists _ all of Chechen origin _ have been killed
covering the war, and numerous others have been detained or
expelled, said Stewart Chisholm of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian police really don't want journalists reporting in
Chechnya'' and have used lack of proper accreditation to get some
reporters out, he said. The Russians also have ``really played up
the danger'' of being kidnapped by Chechen rebels to scare away
journalists, Chisholm added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not abused. They were very polite. They just were
slow,'' Filipov said of his ordeal. The other detained journalists
were Washington Post correspondent Daniel Williams, Marcus Warren
of Britain's Daily Telegraph, British freelance photographer
Michael Jasokuvich, Rodrigo Fernandez of Spain's El Pais, Spanish
television reporter Ricardo Ortega and a cameraman working with
him, Teimuraz Gabashvili of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department reiterated its warning to all Americans to
stay out of Chechnya. ``Our ability to assist US citizens who
travel there is limited,'' said State Department spokesman Philip
Reeker.
</P>
<P>
   The detained journalists were at first allowed to go to the
front lines, accompanied by a pro-Russian, Chechen guard. The group
witnessed heavy fire before they were told they did not have the
right papers, and were subsequently taken to Mozdok and questioned
by the FSB, a successor to the communist-era KGB, for eight hours.

   JACKSONVILLE _ If you shine enough light on the wreck that has
been Georgia Tech's defense this season, you can actually find some
bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   None shined more brilliantly than Recardo Wimbush, Greg Gathers
and Jeremy Muyres, three first-year starters who were preparing to
watch Tech play in the Gator Bowl last year instead of playing in
the game. Yet, in a season marred by injury, faulty execution and
missed tackle upon missed tackle, the freshmen led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbush, an outside linebacker, paced the Yellow Jackets with 91
tackles. In becoming the first freshman to lead Tech in tackles,
Wimbush had four games with double-figure stops, including 14
against Wake Forest and 13 in the win over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers, a 6-foot-1, 249-pound defensive end, was third (71) and
Muyres, a free safety, finished fourth (69).
</P>
<P>
   ``For freshmen, they've done an outstanding job,'' coach George
O'Leary said Wednesday. ``People don't understand how hard it is to
play freshmen. But they've done an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   Wimbush and Gathers started every game, while Muyres stepped
into the lineup in the fifth game, against North Carolina, after
senior captain Travares Tillman injured his back.
</P>
<P>
   Muyres, from Parkview High, performed so well Tech was able to
shift Tillman to cornerback, helping to shore up the secondary.
Wimbush, out of Early County, was promoted when Matt Miller did not
respond to knee surgery and Matt Uremovich was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The case was different for Gathers, who supplanted junior Andy
Josephson in preseason, then made an immediate impact. In the
opener against Navy, he had nine tackles, including one for loss
yardage and two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers knew then he could play this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I came in, I'd get some playing time but not as
much,'' says Gathers, who was selected to The Sporting News
Freshman All-America team. ``When they gave me the (starting) call,
I never looked back. I've only looked forward from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Maryland, Gathers was named ACC rookie of the week
following a four-tackles-for-losses outing. He led Tech with seven
sacks, nearly half of the Jackets' ACC-worst 16.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbush, who fractured his left thumb in the second game against
Florida State but never missed a start, said it took him awhile to
grasp the college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the secondary was making most of the tackles that
the linebackers should have made,'' Wimbush said. ``After the
Florida State game (six tackles), I realized that if I could play
with them, I could play with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Undersized at 6-1, 205 pounds, coaches say the only thing
standing in the way of greatness for Wimbush is 20-25 more pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adjusted well to the speed and quickness of the college
game going against our offense,'' said defensive coordinator Ted
Roof, a former standout linebacker at Tech. ``He plays hard, always
getting after it. It's fun watching him play.''
</P>
<P>
   Muyres was thrust on the scene when Tillman went out early vs.
Maryland and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to rise to the occasion,'' said Muyres, whose 18
tackles at Wake fell one shy of the school record for a defensive
back. ``As each game went on, I got better and better and started
playing with more confidence.''

 &HT;    Contractor wants stolen gun back and explanation from Puff Daddy
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ralph Cooper doesn't give a hoot about Sean ``Puff
Daddy'' Combs' music. The 53-year-old churchgoing building
contractor from metro Powder Springs, Ga., prefers Frankie Avalon
and Pat Boone.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper does want to know how his 9 mm Smith &AMP; Wesson pistol
walked from metro Atlanta to New York City, then crawled inside the
millionaire rapper's Lincoln Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, he wants the gun back _ because he likes to
drive the speed limit. He'd gotten the weapon, his first, to
protect himself from road rage. Someone had tried to run him off
the road, and the grandfather of two decided it was time for some
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got crazy people on these roads,'' Cooper said. ``I'm a
skinny little fellow, but that 9 mm makes me 10 feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper reported his pistol stolen from his Dodge pickup truck in
August. Early Monday, Combs, 30, was arrested on a weapons charge
after New York police found the stolen 9 mm in the front seat of
his sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper and his girlfriend, actress-singer Jennifer Lopez,
were in the back seat of the SUV as a driver and bodyguard drove
them from the club _ where a shooting had just left three people
wounded. Combs has denied possession of the gun and any involvement
in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Combs was released on $10,000 bail and ordered back to court
Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Charged in the shooting was Jamal Barrow, 19, who raps under the
stage name ``Shyne.'' Barrow was charged with three counts of
attempted murder. Investigators accuse Combs of brandishing a gun
inside the club, but he emphatically denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms are trying to trace the path that Cooper's gun took to New
York, but still don't have any answers, said Joseph Green, an ATF
spokesman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Powder Springs, Cooper suspects the gun was stolen while
his pickup was parked in a mobile home park. He was renovating some
trailers there when he noticed the pistol missing from the console
of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has since replaced the 9 mm with a .40-caliber pistol
that he sometimes wears on his construction belt. He is glad he
did. He was recently stopped in traffic when a large man, ``maybe
300 pounds,'' tried to hop into his front seat. Cooper, who attends
church every Sunday and Wednesday, reached for his console.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pointed the .40-caliber at him and said, `I don't think you
want to do this,''' Cooper said. ``He stepped back. I'm an old man.
I need some protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The building contractor has heard of Puff Daddy, but doesn't
know him outside of hearing his music a couple times from guys at
work who fiddled with the radio. Cooper, who lives on golden
oldies, demanded they change the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Puff Daddy) is one of these guys that talks to you. He
doesn't know how to sing,'' Cooper said. ``I don't listen to this
boom-boom (stuff).''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says he wants the gun returned when police are finished
with it. ``ASAP,'' Cooper said. ``Do you know what that means? As
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he's no longer angry about the theft of the gun,
which was valued at $400, and has received insurance money for it.
But he would like to see the person who stole it go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really made me mad,'' Cooper said. ``I worked six or seven
months saving for it. I do want my gun back. It was my first one.
It's sort of sentimental.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper may have to wait. New York police spokeswoman
Detective Madelyne Galindo said Wednesday the gun was resting in
the property clerk's office at 1 Police Plaza in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo said the gun is evidence and will likely be used if the
case against Combs and his associates ever goes to trial. The gun
may never be returned if it is found that it was used to commit a
crime, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's gun wasn't the one used in the shootings, police said.

 &HT;    `Fresh starts' is a popular theme among clergy
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Behind the signature red doors of the Lutheran Church
of the Redeemer on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, the Rev. Mark
Beatty preached his last sermon of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty, the youngest of the historic church's clergy, didn't
even mention Y2K. Instead, he stuck to a timeless message for
Christians _ that Jesus came to give everyone the opportunity for
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by tall trees decorated with Christian symbols and red
poinsettias that seem to magnify the red in the magnificent stained
glass windows, Beatty told several hundred worshipers, ``Sometimes
it's dangerous to have limitless faith in people. It's always safe
to have boundless faith in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Around metro Atlanta, ministers are addressing their flocks with
a once-in-a-millennium message. Most say they are emphasizing the
changeless nature of God in changing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transition to a third millennium is particularly
significant to the Christian community because it marks the 2000th
celebration of the birth of Christ,'' said the Rev. Peter Rhea
Jones, senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Decatur, Ga. As the
calendar changes, Jones said he will stress ``the continued
relevance of Jesus _ Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new millennium is what Christianity is all about, fresh
starts and new beginnings,'' said the Rev. Sam Matthews, pastor of
First United Methodist Church of Fayetteville. ``No matter what
we've been or what we've done, we all start at the same place. We
have exactly the same thing in front of us, which is the rest of
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   A new year offers an opportunity for people to reassess the way
they live, said the Rev. Cynthia Hale of Ray of Hope Christian
Church in south DeKalb County, Ga. She said she will be urging her
church members to look at ``issues of peace, racism, sexism,
classism, homelessness, education of our children, etc.'' as they
enter the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Some ministers said they will acknowledge either the secular
concerns of computer failure at Y2K and the religious beliefs that
2000 is a milestone on the road to the end of the world. But they
said they will urge their members not to focus on either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know when the final hour will be at hand,'' said the
Rev. Calvin Adams, senior pastor at Greater Mount Carmel African
Methodist Episcopal Church in Doraville, Ga. ``We are living our
last days but Christians shouldn't be fearful. If we trust in God,
why should we be fearful?''
</P>
<P>
   ``God is the controller of our future and he is our hope and our
confidence and our security,'' said the Rev. Larry Vaughan of
Rockdale Alliance Church. ``Barricading ourselves will do no good.
... Our real desire is to reach out to our community if negative
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At Brooks United Methodist Church in Brooks, the congregation
will sing ``O God Our Help in Ages Past'' on Sunday and hear the
Rev. Randy Kanipe tell them not to put too much emphasis on all the
zeros in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's time is not our time,'' Kanipe said. ``In other words,
God created everything in the universe including the incredible
dimension of time. Humankind, however, invented a means for
measuring that time. While our measurements of time have been
helpful in this world, our measurements may not necessarily
coincide with God's plan. Therefore we are best served by taking
this new year change as just another year, as merely one in
thousands that have preceded us, and many that will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Riley, senior pastor of Cornerstone Bible Church
in McDonough, said he also regards Jan. 1 as just another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not preaching brimstone, but rather a vision of hope for
the future,'' he said. ``We live by four rules that I'll be
outlining: love like you won't get hurt, learn like you'd live
forever, dance like no one's watching and live like you'd die
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Rev. Al Myers, senior pastor of Conyers Presbyterian
Church, the first Sunday of 2000 will be the first Sunday of his
retirement. On the last Sunday of 1999, Myers took the time to
thank God for the opportunities of his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that we are to live a total life as if we were
to die tomorrow,'' he said. ``We should live in such a way that we
will be ready when the end of the world comes. I am not worried
about it because God is the only one who knows when the end will
come.''

 &HT;    What time is it? Past and present mix in great flicks
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the clock ticking down to the _ mass gasp here _
millennium, it's time that we reminded ourselves that time is
relative. At least it is in the movies, where time-tripping is a
regular pastime. Here are a few fun journeys to sample. And
remember, in the immortal words of 1984's cinematic wacko hero
Buckaroo Banzai: ``No matter where you go, there you are.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ``Back to the Future'' trilogy: The first one, which took
Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) back to 1955, where he helped his
parents-to-be (Crispin Glover and Leah Thompson) get together, was
the most popular _ and it briefly turned Fox into a viable movie
star. But our favorite has always been ``Back to the Future III,''
in which Marty and his mentor, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), end
up back in the Old West, where Doc falls for comely Mary
Steenburgen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Time After Time'': This time, Steenburgen is the modern one
(well, modern for 1979) and Malcolm McDowell is a time-traveling
H.G Wells, who pursues a murderous Jack the Ripper (David Warner)
to the streets of San Francisco, circa the late '70s. Juxtaposing
the attitudes of Victorian England with those of contemporary
America, director Nicholas Meyer weaves a deliciously clever
romantic thriller.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Time Machine'': More Wells-ian time warping. In George
Pal's adaptation of Wells' famous book, Rod Taylor is the fearless
inventor who takes his time machine _ a gloriously Victorian doodad
_ far into the future, where he finds mankind has divided into two
species: pre-flower-children Eloi, who are gentle and golden-haired
(a la the film's romantic interest, Yvette Mimieux) and the
monstrous Morlocks, who prey upon them (and could use a haircut and
a good dentist). The film's best parts are Taylor's early forays
into world wars and a changing culture, conveyed by special effects
that now seem charmingly dated (fast forward!) but still were
worthy of an Oscar in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Time Bandits'': That wondrous things should come out of an
old wardrobe makes perfect sense to any of us who've been to Narnia
with C.S. Lewis. In this case, a British kid and some busy dwarfs
go time-hopping to defeat the devil (David Warner). Cameos include
John Cleese as Robin Hood, Ian Holm as Napoleon, Sean Connery as
Agamemnon and Sir Ralph Richardson as the Supreme Being. There's
even a brief stop on the Titanic (no Leo, though). Director Terry
Gilliam recalls that Connery only liked to talk about two things:
golf and money. Luckily, the set in Morocco was right next to a
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Peggy Sue Got Married'': Ah, the perils of high school
reunions. Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner), a respectable wife and
mother, faints at her 25th. When she wakes up, she's back in 1960
(the movie came out in 1986), looking like a typical teen from that
era but with the mind of an '80s grown-up. Sounds like a circle of
hell to some of us, but there are some good gags (the Beatles,
pantyhose) _ and the overall poignant tone suggests ``Our Town''
more than ``Back to the Future.'' Look for a young, positively
sweet Nicolas Cage as her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'': Yep, this is the endearing
save-the-whales one where Cap'n Kirk (William Shatner), Mr. Spock
(Leonard Nimoy), Bones (DeForest Kelly) and the rest go back to San
Francisco circa 1986 to rescue the universe three centuries hence.
It's a lighter, funnier, goofier ``Star Trek'' movie, one that
depends on our affection for these enduring characters more than
anything else. Moment of harmonic convergence: One of the
screenwriters is Nicholas Meyer, who apparently likes to send time
travelers to San Francisco (see ``Time After Time'' above).

 &HT;    10 a.m. and 7 p.m. key times for Delta
 &HT;    By Scott Thurstonand Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Y2K rollover comes at 10 a.m. Friday for Delta Air
Lines.
</P>
<P>
   That's when midnight strikes in Tokyo, the first of
Atlanta-based Delta's destinations to enter 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists at Delta's small Tokyo reservations center will be
watching to make sure everything functions properly, from mundane
items such as lights and elevators to vital computer links to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big operation and we don't expect any problems, but
it gives us a chance to run through the checklist with a local
system,'' said Walter Taylor, a Delta vice president who oversees
Y2K preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenes will play out at other Delta destinations as
midnight rolls westward across Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Another key moment will come at 7 p.m., when air traffic control
systems convert to 2000. That's because the systems are keyed to
Greenwich Mean Time, for the sake of standardization.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight Atlanta time, Delta's internal systems roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Delta will have dual Y2K command posts in its Operations Control
Center at the Atlanta headquarters complex, and at the nearby
offices of Delta Technology, a subsidiary that handles its computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Like all U.S. airlines, Delta has spent years updating and
testing systems to assure a safe and uneventful Y2K. Delta has
spent about $110 million on the effort and will have an extra 700
employees on duty New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about where we stand,'' Taylor said, adding
the airline completed all its Y2K fixes earlier this year. He noted
Delta began taking advance reservations for 2000 last February, so
those systems have been smoothly handling the rollover for months.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's jets have one system, the Flight Management Computer,
that couldn't display 2000 properly. But the glitch has been fixed
and didn't affect operations anyway, spokesman Kip Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no date-reliant pieces on our planes that will
affect their operation,'' he said. ``Controls and engines are all
governed by pressure and heat but not time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than some other industries, aviation depends on the smooth
integration of government-run and private computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs and maintains
the air traffic control network, was initially criticized for being
behind on preparations but now says it's ready. It successfully
simulated the rollover last April in a much-publicized test in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta has spent $11
million to make sure airport systems such as runway lighting,
emergency equipment and people movers work properly.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield's been on a heightened state of alert since federal
officials this month warned of terrorist threats. Airport officials
are considering whether to restrict access to concourses to
ticketed passengers, although no decision has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield will have its own New Year's Eve command center where
managers can monitor operations and conduct systems tests at
midnight. Some, such as trains and moving sidewalks, routinely shut
down overnight and will do so as usual at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated reassurances that aviation will fly through the
Y2K rollover, many travelers are staying out of the air Friday and
Saturday. That's prompted a wave of flight cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has cut 18 percent of its schedule _ about 485 flights _
on Friday and Saturday. AirTran Airways, the second-largest carrier
after Delta at Hartsfield International Airport, has canceled the
last 30 flights on Friday evening and several Saturday morning. The
airline cited slack bookings.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday schedule cuts aren't unique, but this year's are broader
than usual because of the length of the weekend and lower demand.
United, Northwest, American, Continental and TWA also have cut
weekend schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Still, big airlines will have hundreds of flights in the air at
midnight all over the world. Delta will have about 50 _ including
one carrying the airline's chief executive, Leo Mullin, who'll be
in the air during the 7 p.m. air traffic control system rollover.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's Y2K czar, John Koskinen, also is booked on a
Delta Shuttle flight that evening. Federal Aviation Administration
chief Jane Garvey is booked on an American Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
   Delta hopes to keep the Y2K atmosphere light. It will serve
champagne to all passengers aloft at midnight, while rewarding
on-duty employees that day with drawings for special prizes. The
top 10 winners will get $2,000 each.

 &HT;    Millennium madness: There's no escaping it on TV
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer, Drew Jubera and Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you ready for Y2K-TV?
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no matter where you turn for the next few days, TV
channels will be covering the turn of the year/century/millennium,
or throwing on special programming to mark the event. There'll be
everything from serious news coverage to parties worldwide to a
``Jetsons'' marathon on the Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   Some scenes will get multiple coverage; CNN, ABC and PBS (among
others) will have live coverage as midnight strikes in time zones
through Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the big ones:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CNN: At a time when everyone is claiming to have the biggest
and most, CNN truly does. The news network has 100 hours of
programming, ``Millennium 2000,'' starting at 5 a.m. Friday and
running through Jan. 4. The backbone will be rolling coverage, time
zone by time zone, of midnight celebrations starting in the
Kiribati Islands in the Pacific Ocean. CNN has also banked 60 hours
of special reports looking back and ahead on topics such as
population, pollution, medicine, technology, war and peace,
science, faith and natural disasters. On Friday, ``Larry King
Live'' will host the Rev. Billy Graham and the Dalai Lama, and on
Saturday, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ABC: Anchor Peter Jennings has the longest duty of anyone in
Y2K-TV, starting at 4:50 a.m. Friday and running 24 hours, the kind
of stunt usually reserved for Jerry Lewis on his telethon weekend.
There will be lots of concert coverage (Aerosmith in Japan, 'N Sync
at Disney World, Andrea Bocelli in New York) and live reports from
ABC correspondents. Plus, only ABC has Dick Clark along with the
Times Square ball drop.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NBC/WXIA: Katie Couric and Tom Brokaw anchor coverage from
Times Square from 9 p.m. Friday to 3 a.m. Saturday. Jay Leno has a
special 15-minute monologue that will be dropped in since his show
is pre- empted. WPBA will air four hours _ from 7 to 11 p.m. Friday
_ of local coverage produced by WXIA, while WXIA itself carries
NBC's coverage. WXIA then will air live coverage of the peach drop
in Atlanta from 11:30 p.m. to 12:05 a.m., follow with a newscast
devoted primarily to Y2K issues until 1:05 p.m., then rejoin NBC's
coverage until 3 a.m. The station will also air two news specials
Friday, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CBS: Dan Rather anchors a special ``48 Hours'' live at 9-11
tonight that will look at the future of technology, medicine and
lifestyles. At 8 p.m. Friday, a special ``Late Show With David
Letterman.'' At 10 p.m. Friday, CBS covers the ``America's
Millennium'' festival in Washington, D.C., hosted by Will Smith.
Steven Spielberg will premiere his new short film, ``The Unfinished
Journey'' and President Clinton is scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fox: Fox News anchors Brit Hume and Paula Zahn anchor a ``Fox
2000'' special from 11 p.m. Friday to 12:30 a.m. Saturday. News
reports from New York, London, Moscow and Roswell, N.M., and
performances by Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Neville Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PBS: Beginning at 4:45 a.m. Friday, PBS has 25 hours of live
coverage, hosted by Gwen Ifill and Will Durst. Highlights (some of
which will also be on CNN and ABC) include Maori warriors welcoming
the new year in New Zealand, the opening of the Millennium Dome in
London, scenes from the Taj Mahal and the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MTV: With its main studio right in the middle of Times Square,
MTV will have a great vantage point. Beginning at 5 p.m. Friday, it
will host a concert with Goo Goo Dolls, Blink 182, Sean ``Puffy''
Combs, Jay-Z, Bush and Christina Aguilera. MTV also will have a
party plane travelling to England, France, Italy and Finland for
New Years celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nickelodeon: At 7 p.m. Friday Nickelodeon will present an
exclusive President Bill Clinton address to kids about their future
in the new millennium. The address will kick off Nickelodeon's New
Year's Eve celebration, hosted by Amanda Bynes and Kenan Thompson,
and featuring millennium-themed episodes of some of Nickelodeon's
most popular series. The block will end at midnight with the
premiere of Nickelodeon's 24 hour commercial-free Nickellennium
event on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cartoon Network: Beginning at 10 a.m. Thursday, the cable
channel will celebrate the future by airing every episode of ``The
Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Turner Classic Movies: Feed your paranoia with movies about
computers gone haywire. Starting at 8 p.m. Saturday, TCM will play
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' followed by its sequel, ``2010'' at
10:45 p.m., then ``Westworld.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TBS: The cable channel that was built on Andy Griffith offers

 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index, on its way to the best
year ever for a major American stock index, closed above 4,000 for
the first time on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone came less than two months after the index first
topped 3,000, and was based largely on the strength of the
technology stocks that have come to dominate the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   The index rose 69.35 points, or 1.75 percent, to 4,041.46 and is
now up 84.3 percent since the end of 1998. Three stocks in the
index have gained more than 1,000 percent this year, with Qualcomm,
a leading company in mobile phone technology, surging 2,444 percent
since the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   No broad index of American stocks has ever risen as much in one
calendar year as the Nasdaq composite has this year. Moreover,
nearly all moves even half as large have come in years when the
stock market and the economy were rebounding from recessions.
</P>
<P>
   The current economic expansion of more than eight years will
soon become the longest in American history. The Nasdaq composite,
meanwhile, has gained at least 20 percent in each of the last four
years, and the 1998 gain of 39.6 percent was the third biggest in
its history.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and Internet-related stocks have been the strongest for
most of 1999, but biotechnology stocks have come on strong in the
last two months. Many other stocks, particularly those in the
financial and transportation industries, have lagged far behind
these technology leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq average's gains have come amid the greatest
volatility in the history of the Nasdaq stock market, which dates
to 1971. ``Five years ago you'd see a 1 percent move every two
weeks,'' observed George Cohen, a portfolio manager at Cohen,
Klingenstein &AMP; Marks, referring to the wide swings in price, mostly
up, this year. ``Now you see a 1 percent move almost every day.''
That is only a small exaggeration. So far this year, there have
been three such days a week, on average.
</P>
<P>
   The old record for a major American index was set by the Dow
Jones industrial average in 1915, at a time when the economy was
moving from a recession into a boom caused by demand for industrial
products from European countries then fighting World War I, which
the United States had not yet entered. Barring a collapse during
the two trading days left in the year, the Nasdaq will finish with
a gain well in excess of the 73.9 percent recorded by the Dow that
year.
</P>
<P>
   The only other years in which a major United States index rose
by more than 50 percent were 1933, when the Dow leaped 66.7
percent, and 1991, when the Nasdaq composite rose by 56.9 percent.
There were five other years _ 1904, 1908, 1928, 1935 and 1954 _
when one or more indexes showed annual gains of at least 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While other major indexes also set records on Wednesday, their
1999 gains do not even approach that of the Nasdaq. The Dow
industrials are up 25.1 percent in 1999, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
index of 500 stocks has gained 19.1 percent and the Russell 2,000
index of small stocks has added 17.8 percent. The record set by the
Russell was the first one for that index since April 21, 1998. Many
small stocks suffered in 1998, and many of them still have not
recovered their losses from that year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rally for the Nasdaq composite has been a relatively
narrow one, centered on the computer and other technology stocks
that have excited investors. The Nasdaq computer index, which now
makes up more than half of the value of the entire Nasdaq index, is
up 103.8 percent for the year, and 40 percent since the composite
index hit 3,000 on Nov. 3. The Nasdaq biotech index has done even
better recently, leaping 51.6 percent since Nov. 3, to raise its
annual gain to 103.7 percent. Of the 200 stocks in the biotech
index, 32 have more than doubled since Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Nasdaq bank index is down 7.7 percent
since Nov. 3, and is off 8.9 percent for the year. Similarly, The
Nasdaq insurance index is off 7.7 percent since Nov. 3, cutting its
1999 rise to 4.6 percent. The Nasdaq transportation index is up 3.3
percent since Nov. 3, leaving it with a 1.5 percent gain for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq 100 index has outperformed the broader Nasdaq
composite of nearly 5,000 stocks and is up 38.1 percent since Nov.
3 and 101 percent for 1999. Among the large stocks that make up the
Nasdaq 100, six have doubled in price since the composite index
reached 3,000, according to calculations by Bloomberg Financial
Markets. In addition to Qualcomm, they are CMGI, a company that
invests in Internet companies; I2 Technologies, a software company;
Yahoo, a pioneering Internet firm; Broadvision, a software company,
and Intuit, another software company.
</P>
<P>
   White the Nasdaq composite's gain for 1999 is on course to be
the best year ever for a widely followed broad index of American
stocks _ a category that includes the Dow Jones industrials, the
S.&AMP;P. 500 and the Russell 2,000 _ some foreign indexes, as well as
narrower ones of American stocks, have done even better this year.
An Internet stock index maintained by TheStreet.Com, for example,
is up 186 percent this year, and an index of South Korean stocks is
up 100 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1915, when the Dow rose 73.9 percent, the index had only 12
stocks. In 1916, the index was enlarged to 20 stocks, including
many that had been excellent performers. That new, enlarged, index,
would have risen 81.7 percent had it existed in 1915. That figure
has sometimes been cited as the best performance ever for a general
American index, but is misleading because the index did not contain
those stocks at the time. The Dow was enlarged to its current size
of 30 stocks in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index now has 4,832 stocks, and adds new
stocks as companies go public. But the index is weighted according
to market capitalization, and the 10 largest companies in it
account for more than 40 percent of the index.

RED SOX BOOST TICKET PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox Wednesday announced another raise in ticket
prices, including a $10 bump in field box seats, citing a need for
additional revenue to remain competitive. The raise will be the
third in as many seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A field box seat that cost $30 in 1998 will now cost $45. The
Fenway Faithful will not be happy about this. Neither will the
bleachites who will pay $14-$16 for a view of Fenway Park that
hasn't changed since 1934. Based on a conservative estimate, the
raise in ticket prices could generate an additional $12 million in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Loge box seats and infield roof box seats will cost $40,
reserved grandstand seats $28, right field box seats and right
field roof box seats $27, outfield grandstand seats $20, lower
bleacher seats $16, and upper bleacher and standing room $14.
</P>
<P>
   When the club announced its hike last year, there was an outcry
from season ticketholders. But the furor died down in July when
they were allowed primary access to the three-day All-Star
celebration and game tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The latest raise should produce a similar reaction. The club
will no doubt be accused of trying to bleed every penny out of old
Fenway. The Red Sox say they are running out of room and there
won't be a new park before 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from in-park concession and advertising in recent years
has helped. But neither can compare to a full house 81 times a
year. Last season, the Red Sox drew 2.45 million to Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember, if we are going to compete against
the best teams in the American League _ which we have been able to
do _ if we are going to ultimately prevail, we're going to have
additional revenues,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette.
``The fact is that Boston baseball is still a very affordable
family adventure compared to the other sports. We're still
moderately priced and we continue to deliver a good product with
good value for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette hinted that there is no guarantee the Red Sox won't
raise their prices again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see how things go with our team,'' he said. ``The
longer we wait on the new ballpark, the more we fall behind our
competitors who have new ballparks. If you take a look at our new
park and its projected year (2003), just about all the other teams
would have put in a new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our fans love to see a good ballgame year in and
year out. When they come to see the Boston Red Sox, they want to
see a good team. We'll put this additional revenue to good use by
continuing to maintain an aggressive, as well as a solid,
development staff to bring up good young players from the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox announced their ticket raise in 1998, it was
revealed by Red Sox executive John Buckley that the Sox would earn
an additional $6.5 million. Duquette said Wednesday that the Red
Sox didn't think like that with this ticket raise. They are
concerned about the long haul. Economic certainty, stable rosters,
and a steady flow of talent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Boston had a payroll estimated at $85 million. It could
be a lot more in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we _ and you _ all know, a high payroll does not guarantee
a playoff spot,'' said Duquette in his Internet message to
stockholders and fans on Red Sox.com, ``but keeping pace
financially is vital in order to stay competitive within baseball's
expensive economic climate. Thus, this year's ticket price increase
is intended to help us remain financially competitive, playing in
baseball's smallest ballpark. We remain faithful to our goal of
maintaining a perennial championship contender with economic
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   A new Fenway is still three years away, says Larry Cancro, vice
president for sales and marketing. The Red Sox have modernized in
many areas, including an Internet site where fans can order
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just about tapped out,'' said Cancro. ``Besides, nothing
generates as much revenue as much as ticket sales. And even then,
we're limited to around 2.7 or 2.8 million fans. We think we're
worth it. If you compare it to live entertainment, including
concerts and other professional sports, we're still the the lowest
price. On family days, we're competitive with a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   However, according to Chicago-based Team Marketing, the Red Sox'
average season ticket price ($24.05) in 1999 was the highest in the
majors. The Yankees ($23.33), Rangers ($19.93), Mets ($19.89), and
Orioles ($19.82) followed.

WISCONSIN'S WELFARE CRUSADE LEAVES LIVES OF THE POOR LITTLE

 By JASON DePARLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ So, did it work?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else can be said about Wisconsin's crusade to end
welfare _ whether one judges it kind or cruel, whether one thinks
it left the safety net stronger or in shreds _ the effort achieved
two things.
</P>
<P>
   It left far fewer people on welfare. It put more people to work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is the dawning surprise: It may end up making less of a
difference in the lives of the poor, socially or economically, than
politicians or the public imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Less welfare and more work _ it sounds like an impressive
achievement, and surely in some ways it is. After imposing the
nation's toughest work requirements, Wisconsin has cut its welfare
rolls more than 90 percent, far deeper than expected. At any time,
about two-thirds of those once on welfare are clinging to some sort
of job, a level of employment that few experts thought could be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For tens of thousands of Milwaukee families, the story seems _
and on the surface is _ one of dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   But after three years of tracking the nation's boldest
antiwelfare campaign, what seems most noteworthy about the lives of
the poor is not the change, but the long list of things that remain
the same: violent neighborhoods, absent fathers, bare cupboards,
epidemics of depression, the temptations of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Those hardships endure not just for the families who are obvious
failures, those left with neither welfare nor work. They endure for
the seeming successes. They endure for those with jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After dozens of visits and hundreds of interviews inside a
welfare revolution _ at public-aid offices early in the morning and
in slum-district homes late at night _ the real surprise is how
rarely a life seems truly transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare's end left Lashanda Washington at a Taco Bell at
midnight, as a shift manager closing the store. But it also left
her still quarreling with a violent boyfriend, evicted from her
home, and worrying that child-welfare officials may try to take
away her son.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare's end left Nicole Keeler at a bus stop at 5:45 a.m. on
her way to an assembly line at an electronics factory. But it also
left her and her six children with no health insurance, and they
still cannot afford to leave the gang-dominated neighborhood where
they have lived for years.
</P>
<P>
   If welfare's end brought progress for anyone, it did for
Michelle Crawford. After two decades on public aid, she has
completed a year as a machine operator at a plastics plant, where
she earned nearly $16,000 this year _ more than twice the average
annual earnings of former welfare recipients. But she still races
to food pantries to feed her three children and blames her long
workday for a daughter's new behavior problems at school.
</P>
<P>
   The national conversation about poverty has focused so intensely
on welfare, it almost defies the imagination to think that welfare
could end and the lives of the poor remain the same in so many
important ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is more than just a weekly paycheck,'' President Clinton
said this spring, in arguing that poor communities were being
transformed. ``It is, at heart, our way of life. Work lends purpose
and dignity to our lives, instills in our children the basic values
that built our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But putting people to work was only one of the goals of the 1996
federal law that put an end to the guaranteed welfare checks of Aid
to Families With Dependent Children. The other was to reduce the
percentage of children born to unmarried women, a front on which
progress has been slight.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the prospects of poor children may depend more
profoundly on whether they have fathers than whether their mothers
move from subsistence welfare checks into subsistence jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real test _ of work and family _ rests not in one
year, but over a generation. The nation takes it as an article of
faith that, if nothing else, the children of working parents will
be better off, inspired by their discipline, raised under a new
social code.

<P>
   At Pulaski High School here, the senior class president, Keona
Marsh, articulates the ideal: ``If you have a working parent, you
have a positive image to look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   But as visits to poor neighborhoods sometimes show, life is
often more complicated. They are filled with examples of
hard-working mothers, occasionally fathers, too, whose children
succumbed to familiar ills: teen-age pregnancy, educational
failure, the fast life of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marsh was raised by a working single mother who knew little
of welfare. But her mother was working so much that Ms. Marsh's
older sister got pregnant at 12. Now at 17, Ms. Marsh is pregnant,
too, which may end her plan to join the Army after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I wanted to have a child,'' she said. ``It's
just something that happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the hurdles at welfare's end, they bring little
yearning for welfare's past. In retrospect, the old system seems
even more flawed than it did at its abolition _ providing little,
demanding little, derided by taxpayers and welfare recipients
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Even with low wages, many former recipients share Ms. Keeler's
pride in her identity as a worker. ``I can say this is Nicole's
money, not welfare's money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever else it has done, the movement from welfare to work
has taken the edge off taxpayers' anger at the poor, bringing new
investments by states in support services like child-care.
</P>
<P>
   This sense that ending welfare will prove less epochal than it
seems is not a firm conclusion. It cannot be proved with charts and
graphs. It arises instead as a nagging suspicion, a word of
caution, the more one travels in poor neighborhoods behind doors
typically kept closed.
</P>
<P>
   It arises with confessions from many women on welfare that they
were secretly working all the time. It arises when a woman with a
seeming success story confides she is bolstering her income by
selling cocaine. It arises when another returns home from work to a
boyfriend who shoots up the house.
</P>
<P>
   It arises with the growing impression that welfare was just one
in a swirl of influences that shaped the lives of the urban poor, a
force that meant less to most welfare families than the outside
world believed.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, ending welfare may mean less, too.

   The History: Urban Woes Rooted In Mississippi Delta
</P>
<P>
   It does not look like a big-city ghetto, Milwaukee's near north
side. The streets are lined with duplexes, once-proud structures
built nearly a century ago for factory workers awash in new
prosperity. The factories and the prosperity are gone, and so are
many of the houses, replaced by vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise is still two hours away as William Love guides his No.
12 bus up Teutonia Avenue, through the heart of Milwaukee's welfare
belt. In more than 25 years as a city bus driver, he has had plenty
of opportunities to witness the area's decline. Since the end of
welfare, he has also speculated about its future.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that Wisconsin was going to require welfare
recipients to work for their checks, Love was enthusiastic. ``I
thought, `If I can get up at 4 in the morning, they can, too,''' he
said. In 1998, when a reporter from The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
rode with him, Love commented that he saw more women with children
on the early-morning bus and surmised they were former welfare
families on their way to work.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent article portrayed a ``new infusion of energy,''
sweeping the central city, and soon it was quoted everywhere by
supporters of the tough new laws. In a radio address this spring,
President Clinton cited the article, which also quoted two other
drivers, as ``evidence of our progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But by then Love was having doubts. He is a central-city
landlord, too, and like many others he was finding that welfare's
end made it harder to collect the rent. ``In the past, they had
their check, so you pretty much knew you were going to get your
money,'' he said. Now he finds families doubled up, and when the
rent is due, ``you get these excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   This particular morning brings no clear sign of uplift or
decline. A passenger heading to work at a food pantry grumbles that
ending welfare left ``a lot of people in need.'' A woman who works
at a child care center acknowledges that the tougher laws pushed
her to get a job. ``I was getting welfare money, so why should I
work _ that's the idea I had at the time,'' she said. But
economically, she said the job has left her ``about the same.''
</P>
<P>
   That, more or less, is Love's reconsidered opinion. ``So far,''
he now says, ``I haven't seen a big difference, one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   If the problems of the inner city do not end with welfare, that
is at least in part because they did not begin with welfare. On
Milwaukee's north side, they often began in the poverty and
subjugation that black families experienced on plantations in the
Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things one notices in talking to Milwaukee
welfare families, 79 percent of whom are black, is how many came
from the Delta. Another is how recent the journey has been. For a
middle-aged woman on welfare in Milwaukee, the legacy of rural
disenfranchisement is not a distant memory. Sometimes it is the
story of her own mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   One evening last spring, one such matriarch _ young, at 62 _
told the story of her own migration from a Mississippi plantation
in the late 1950s, to a Chicago housing project, from which her
daughter then moved to Milwaukee. It was a story of grinding
poverty. She worked the fields and was paid in scrip, redeemable
only at the plantation store. It was a story of family disarray.
She scarcely knew her father, and she had the first of her eight
children at 13.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was a story with many of the same problems
that came to dominate the urban, welfare-dependent North.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a story of welfare; for decades, local officials
in the South kept most black families from getting welfare. ``I
didn't know nothing about welfare,'' she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100,000 Wisconsin families ultimately came to rely on
welfare, formally called Aid to Families with Dependent Children,
and the number in Milwaukee peaked at nearly 39,000. Now just 5,800
Milwaukee families are on the successor program, Wisconsin Works or
``W-2.'' But welfare was almost never their only means of support,
another factor that helps explain why its demise may change things
less than might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia has estimated that AFDC typically provided just 34
percent of the average recipient's monthly income. Another 25
percent came from food stamps, where reductions have been less
extreme. The rest came from boyfriends, charities, relatives and
jobs, including under-the-table work.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, checking wage records, John Pawasarat, a researcher at
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, found that 30 percent of the
city's AFDC recipients had worked _ half of them in secret, to keep
their benefits from being cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more people working now, sure,'' Pawasarat said. ``But
the difference is not as large as people think, because a lot of
people were already working under the old system.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that even at its peak, welfare accounted for less
than 4 percent of the total income in Milwaukee's central city.
``If you can't get that, you can't understand why there hasn't been
more of a dramatic change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For all the political focus on welfare, the problems of the
inner city also persist in families where parents are busy at work.
Consider the saga of Tremayne Franks, a charming if troubled
10-year-old who caught a reporter's attention last spring with his
flamboyance on an after-school job at a corner grocery store. At
4-foot-6, he stood on a milk crate to reach the cash register,
swore at his customers and awarded himself a fancy title: the
``Always, Only, Assistant Boss.''
</P>
<P>
   In one light, his family's problems might seem those of a
permissive welfare culture. His mother collected welfare checks for
years while running with fast men, ignoring her son and giving
little thought to a job. When officials took away her check, she
left town to work as a stripper.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Tremayne's paternal grandmother, Glendora Johnson, who
is raising him, blames welfare for rewarding his mother's
irresponsible behavior. ``They just made a bunch of sorry people,
welfare did,'' Ms. Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet similar problems have run through her side of the family,
though she is the very epitome of a worker. After arriving from
Mississippi in the mid-1960s, Ms. Johnson held her family together
with a series of factory jobs _ her hard-drinking husband was
little help _ and for nearly two decades she has worked the late
shift as a hospital housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson is an embodiment of the working mother hoped for
under W-2 _ a hard-at-work provider whose disciplined example might
save her children from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It did not: Four of her five children developed problems with
drugs, and two wound up behind bars, including the Always, Only,
Assistant Boss' father, Terry Johnson, who served 17 months for
selling cocaine. Released last summer, he is back at work as a
maintenance man at $8.50 an hour, trying to set an example for his
son. A recent visit found him scolding the boy after one of his
frequent suspensions from school, this one for selling Pokemon
cards.
</P>
<P>
   But as he knows from his own childhood, a beleaguered parent's
earnest example is sometimes no match for the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother showed me what it means to be a citizen in this
country _ you got to work, you pay for what you get,'' Johnson
said. ``But when you hit that jungle out there, there's all kinds
of things you think you want. You got gold people with gold cars.
They got money. They got guns. They got posses behind them. I'm
just Fred Flintstone going to work.''

<P>
   The Program: An Impressive Effort With a Trouble Start
</P>
<P>
   Welfare was disliked in almost equal measure by the taxpayers
who financed its modest benefits _ AFDC offered a family of three
about $6,200 a year in Wisconsin _ and the families who received
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welfare people, they didn't care what you did,'' said
Lashanda Washington, the Taco Bell worker. ``They just gave you
money to keep you from snapping in their face.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Works, or W-2, is the nation's most ambitious effort
to redesign a social safety net. It is far more strict than the
system it replaced. Almost everyone who receives assistance is
required to work at community service jobs such as sweeping schools
or answering telephones at nonprofit agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But W-2 can be much more generous, too. Wisconsin raised the
standard grant to nearly $8,100 a year. It poured millions of
dollars of state and federal money into new services for workers
who left the welfare rolls, most notably for child care, health
care and wage subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptually, it is an impressive effort to demand work and
support it. Operationally, it has often been a mess, a tangle of
unresponsive bureaucracies, uninspired casework and so much initial
chaos and confusion that many needy families still express contempt
at the name W-2.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Personalized casework to guide people into jobs was supposed to
be a hallmark of W-2. But at the program's start in 1997, one
caseworker's idea of job counseling reached the level of farce. He
spent an hour reading aloud from an occupation almanac to a roomful
of restless women:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematics _ reading graphs and stuff like that it gets real
deep when it comes to mathematics. Agriculture, that thing with
cows, gets real deep _ giving them those hormones. ... Forestry.
Why don't we see any more wolves. Somebody eating them?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to work for a welfare check or endure more pointless
classes, the poor voted with their feet. Most simply left. At the
end of the transition from AFDC, W-2 had been projected to enroll
54,000 families statewide. Instead, it had 13,000, and in the last
18 months the number has fallen to 7,100.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that W-2 has worked, that is, it has done so
despite itself, by wrapping welfare in so many new obligations that
the poor have sought other options.
</P>
<P>
   Where, then, did they go?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that most went to work on their own, in numbers
much higher than expected. The bad news is that the journey from
welfare to work is, so far at least, typically a story of running
in place.
</P>
<P>
   This month, researchers at the University of Wisconsin released
the most extensive study yet of families leaving the state's rolls.
Examining the wage records of 16,000 former recipients, they found
that 68 percent were working a year after leaving welfare. More
than 80 percent had worked at some point in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hailing the ability of the poor to find jobs, Lawrence Mead, a
welfare expert at New York University, argues that work levels like
these ``represent the greatest achievement in antipoverty policy
since the Great Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for most families the work has failed to translate into
economic progress. Among those who went to work in 1998, average
annual earnings were just $7,700, $400 less than they would have
received by staying on welfare. And it is just 59 percent of the
$13,100 the government says a family of three needs to escape
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers look better when they include wage subsidies like
earned-income tax credits, which at these levels typically total
about $3,000 a year. Adding up wages, subsidies and food stamps,
the researchers did a more sophisticated set of calculations and
still found limited progress.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in the work force, only 36 percent of the former
recipients had more total income than they had on welfare. Only a
quarter lifted themselves above the poverty line. Just 4 percent
exceeded what might be called a threshold of dramatic change,
incomes of above 150 percent of the poverty line _ in other words,
$19,700 for a mother with two children.
</P>
<P>
   Examining a group of women who began working in 1996, the
researchers did find they made modest progress over time,
increasing incomes about $1,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Averages obscure the subplots, of course. If here and there some
families have made it, about 16 percent have been left with neither
welfare nor work. Surveys indicate that about half of them have
other means of support, like boyfriends or disability payments; the
rest may be experiencing significant new hardships, as the growing
homeless shelter population suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two poles of failure or advancement, the most
striking thing is that for most families little has changed. ``On
average, for the middle family here, in terms of their overall
economic well-being, W-2 hasn't had a whopping impact,'' said
Robert Haveman, one of the authors of the study.
</P>
<P>
   A similar portrait of families largely running in place was
drawn this year in a survey of 375 former welfare recipients
sponsored by the state. Again, about two-thirds were working and
most said they preferred doing so to being on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But most also said the movement from welfare to work had done
little to ease material hardship, and in some cases might have
increased it. Significant percentages reported problems paying for
such basics as utilities, 47 percent; housing, 37 percent; and
food, 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving welfare for work, poor families were 50 percent
more likely to say they did not have enough money for groceries, a
finding that rings true after many conversations with former
welfare families who spontaneously talked about their struggles for
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to my house, look in the refrigerator _ you'll be
lucky if there's a gallon of milk in the house,'' said Tiffany
Fiegel, 17, a senior at Pulaski High School whose mother recently
left welfare for a job as a receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating the empty refrigerator, Ms. Fiegel broke down in
tears. ``We've got to struggle just to buy toothpaste,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why do earnings remain so low? In part, the problem is low
wages. The state survey found former recipients averaging $7.42 an
hour. But an equal if not bigger problem is that few women keep
working full time year round. Even at $7.42 an hour, a full-time
worker would earn $15,400 a year _ twice the actual earnings
documented in the recent wage study.
</P>
<P>
   For single parents with few skills, the problems that prevent
full-time work run the gamut. Jobs are sometimes part-time or
temporary. New workers grow discouraged and quit. Crises erupt at
home: sick children, violent boyfriends, unreliable baby sitters
and cars.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say work will bring new order over time. Still a
third recent study of an experimental work program, Project New
Hope in Milwaukee, planted a seed of doubt, while underscoring the
chaos in many poor families' lives. The program offered needy
workers a guaranteed job at a wage sufficient to lift them out of
poverty. Still, the average participant worked only 27 hours a
week, and 73 percent remained poor.
</P>
<P>
   A team of psychologists studying New Hope also found that it
brought no declines in depression or growth in self-esteem. After
two years in the program, the average worker still registered
levels of depression above the threshold that most psychologists
consider cause for clinical referrals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether the studies are seen as good news (frequent
employment) or bad news (continued high poverty) depends on two
things. One is the intrinsic value of work itself, even when the
pay merely keeps pace with welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Q. Citizen would say that it is reasonable to expect
people to get their income from work,'' said J. Jean Rogers, the
state official who oversees W-2. ``This program has helped tens of
thousands of people do that. That's a huge change in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is expectations for the long term _ will work bring
order and advancement to difficult lives, or will the difficulties
continue to interfere with work?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rogers takes a positive view. ``When you move into the work
force you have the opportunity to move up,'' she said. ``What
opportunity did they have when they were spending year in and year
out on a welfare check?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the first few years of a new system after 60 years of
welfare. You have to give people time.''

   The Lives: Sometimes Work Is Not Enough
</P>
<P>
   Off welfare and at work: if the goal is that alone, Lashanda
Washington is a portrait of success. She got her first job as soon
as she turned 16. She left high school to work two jobs at once.
And her spells on welfare have never lasted more than a couple of
months. ``I felt that was lazy, just sitting around getting a
check,'' she said. ``That would lower my self-esteem. I've always
been a worker.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the goal is something deeper _ less chaos, more order;
reason for confidence in her young son's future _ Ms. Washington's
story takes on a different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she works and she has for years, even at the age of 20. But
her life continues to be thrown into disarray by her troubled
family, especially an alcoholic mother who mocks her efforts to get
ahead. And her jobs never overcome the chaos at home. Whether she
is bagging groceries, wrapping burritos, or standing on an assembly
line, she is a textbook example of the major difference between a
new job and a new life.
</P>
<P>
   She thought she was turning a corner in July, shortly after an
article about her in The New York Times. Her mother checked into a
sobriety program. Ms. Washington found the job at Taco Bell. And
following an eviction, a social worker helped her find a new
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Then chaos erupted again, this time with her unemployed
boyfriend. They fought; he hit her; she put him out. He retaliated
by calling child welfare officials to complain she was mistreating
her 2-year-old son. Afraid to leave him with a baby sitter as
social workers investigated, Ms. Washington simply walked off the
job.
</P>
<P>
   A recent visit found the house, as ever, engulfed in mid-day
turmoil. Her short-staffed boss was at the door, asking her to
return. Her mother was drinking beer and asking for cigarette
money. A new boyfriend was lying around the house, trying to get
her attention. Ms. Washington, ever the weary family lynchpin,
returned to her bedroom where she had spent the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of starting all over again,'' she said. ``Sometimes
I just want to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it has not happened to Ms. Washington yet, every now and
then a real transformation does begin to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone offers an example of deeper success _ a new job and a
new life _ it is Michelle Crawford, a 39-year-old Milwaukee woman
who went to work last year at a plastics plant, after two decades
of desperation and chronic dependence on welfare. Thirteen months
later she is still on the job despite a cascade of challenges, and
a recent visit to her home served up two reminders.
</P>
<P>
   One is how seldom one encounters people similarly transformed.
The other is how difficult life remains, even at the upper-echelons
of post-welfare experience.
</P>
<P>
   The story of triumph is one she told to the Wisconsin
Legislature in January, at the request of Gov. Tommy G. Thompson,
the four-term Republican who created W-2. Though much of the
program's casework has been impersonal and ineffective, Ms.
Crawford's was a marked exception. Beginning in the spring of 1998,
the private agency that handled her case, Y-W Works, coaxed her
through months of psychological counseling before pushing her to
work at a plastics plant it bought to train clients.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after two months of training, her supervisor drove her to
an interview in the suburbs where she landed a full-time job.
``Thank you, Jesus,'' she said at the time, falling to her knees.
</P>
<P>
   While her public story was powerful, it was also incomplete.
Behind the scenes, her 19-year-old son had just gone to prison for
selling cocaine; her depression was at times galloping out of
control; and she was locked in constant, sometimes physical fights
with her unemployed husband, Donald Crawford, a recovering addict.
Each had been arrested in recent months for attacking the other.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit quieter now. Though Ms. Crawford said, ``I
still just have fits sometimes _ I go off,'' she and her husband
have prayed and sought psychological counseling to avoid the
escalations to violence. ``The punching and the blah-blah _ that's
stopped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband found a job, as a hotel maintenance man, and he is
up shortly after midnight to work a 2 o'clock shift. Ms. Crawford
is up at 4 a.m., to catch the first of three buses to the suburban
plant where her shift starts at 6:55.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, life remains in turmoil, even with an income of
nearly $16,000. No longer eligible for food stamps, Ms. Crawford
struggles simply to keep food on the table. She is a regular at
food pantries, and her husband recently sold a car, for $250, to
re-stock the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   A commodity as basic as a gallon of milk remains a prized
household item. To trick her children into drinking it in cheaper,
powdered form, she started sweetening the watery substitute with
sugar and slipping it into regular milk jugs. ``Then we ran out of
sugar,'' she said, laughing at her dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to the Legislature, Ms. Crawford drew the biggest
applause when she pointed toward her three children _ Lorenzo, 14;
Lavita, 11; and Yolando, 7 _ who were watching from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud when I got the job,'' she said. ``Now I tell my
kids this is what happens when you do your homework. My kids see a
difference in me.'' Nothing captures the national hopes about
ending welfare more than that, the faith in example-setting.
</P>
<P>
   In separate recent conversations, Ms. Crawford and her children
did not exactly reject that notion. But they certainly did
complicate it, tempering its appeal with real-world nuance.
Whatever future benefits her example of hard work sets, it has also
brought new stress, especially for the two girls who miss their
mother's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Both have begun acting up in school, and Yolando, a second-grade
charmer with a million-dollar smile, was recently suspended for
punching a classmate. To steal back her time with her mother,
Yolando has even begun getting up with her at 4 a.m. ``I thought I
was going to have my kids go see a whatchacallit _ child
therapist,'' Ms. Crawford said. ``But they just want attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing the effect of the job on the household, the
children spoke less of abstract pride than of concrete stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``She don't want to cook _ she said she's too tired and stuff,''
Yolando said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she's tired, she's crabby,'' Lorenzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Lavita said, ``She says, `Just leave me alone.' She acts
mean.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``She don't act mean,'' Lorenzo said. ``She just don't want to
be bothered.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavita predicted she might turn to welfare one day because
``I'll probably have kids before I have a job,'' and she does not
want a husband. (``He'd probably get on my nerves.'') But Lorenzo
mocked her. ``That's ghetto!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford told much the same story of stress, saying she is
typically too tired at night to help them with the homework, and
she is often too tired to cook. For a moment, her words took an
uncharacteristic turn toward the bitter. ``Right now, I got to
concentrate on myself and what I got to do,'' she said. ``I'm sorry
my kids are taking it the way they are. They're acting like little
selfish brats.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly she talked in the tones of working mothers
everywhere. ``I sometimes feel like I'm not taking care of my
family like I should,'' she said. ``But a lotta times, when I come
home, I'm just so tired.''

   With the nation's welfare rolls down 43 percent, President
Clinton, as well as his Republican critics, count the landmark 1996
welfare law as the cornerstone of their respective legacies. That
law replaced a 60-year-old cash safety net with a program of time
limits and work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   No place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of ``ending
welfare.'' A decade ago, 100,000 Wisconsin families relied on
public aid. Now 7,000 do.
</P>
<P>
   The changes taking place in the state, particularly in its
largest city, Milwaukee, continue to reverberate in broad and
unpredictable ways. Throughout 1999, The New York Times returned to
Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change. This is the last article
in the series.

REPUBLICANS NOT HAPPY ABOUT AUTOWORKERS' ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mich.)  (th) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Election Day will be a paid holiday for 400,000
unionized autoworkers under a contract clause that union leaders
hope will increase labor's influence and that Republicans call a
corporate sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders fear that more union workers, who tend to
vote Democratic, will go to the polls and that activists from the
United Auto Workers union will use their day off to urge nonunion
Democrats to vote. Republicans are particularly concerned because
the bulk of the union's workers are in Michigan and Ohio, two big
states that have played pivotal roles in recent presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials are angered at their traditional
corporate allies at General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, the
companies that agreed to the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the biggest corporate contribution in American
political history,'' Gov. John Engler of Michigan said in an
interview, ``because the corporations will be paying the wages and
the UAW will be using the manpower to attempt to defeat Republican
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined daily payroll of GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler for
the autoworkers is about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Yokich, the union's president, said that the union's
goal was not to elect more Democrats, but rather to elect more
candidates who advocated issues important to workers. By increasing
labor's importance on Election Day, the union hopes to give
candidates an incentive to take stances more sympathetic to the
unions, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the party that matters, it matters what they do for
us and where they stand on issues,'' Yokich said, adding that, ``If
I were a candidate, I'd be talking not about free trade but about
fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The union was a leader of peaceful protests at the recent World
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and outspokenly opposed the
North American Free Trade Agreement. Tens of thousands of auto
parts manufacturing jobs have gone to Mexico and other low-wage
countries even while assembly plants have tended to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   Union members will be asked to go to the polls on Election Day,
and not just treat it as an extra day of vacation, Yokich said,
adding, ``It's not a holiday, it's a day to show you're a good
American citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Engler predicted that candidates would address some of the
union's concerns, although he said that Gov. George W. Bush, whom
he has endorsed, continued to support free trade in general.
``There are a lot of openings for Bush to speak to some of the
issues the UAW is talking about, and be pro-fair trade as well as
free trade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said that he doubted the automakers had thought carefully
about the political implications of their Election Day holiday
concession, including the risk that Democrats elected with union
support to state offices might favor laws that could prove
burdensome to employers.
</P>
<P>
   An auto executive, who insisted on anonymity, said the political
consequences were not a major concern of the companies in contract
negotiations this fall. The automakers, he said, were more
concerned about the risk of absenteeism on the Monday before
Election Day and preferred to give workers an extra Monday or
Friday off, but the union insisted on Election Day. Workers will
have only three days off on the Fourth of July weekend rather than
four, but most factories are closed that week anway to retool for
new models.
</P>
<P>
   With factories running day and night to meet record demand, the
automakers agreed to almost all of the union's demands this year,
fearing a strike otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, the UAW was in a poor position to demand new
concessions from the domestic automakers, which were struggling for
survival. But that changed this year, as a strong economy produced
record sales for the automakers and allowed the union to make and
win many demands, including annual wage increases exceeding the
inflation rate by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has consistently supported Democrats for president but
has endorsed some Republicans in others elections. Surprisingly
little is known about the voting habits of the autoworkers, who
tend to be lumped in with other union workers in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich said that the union's own polling showed that members
were somewhat more likely to vote Democratic than Republican. Yet
many of the so-called Reagan Democrats of the 1980s _ Midwestern
union members who began voting Republican _ were members of the
UAW.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 study by the Bureau of National Affairs, a research and
publishing group in Washington, found that only 6 percent of the
nation's unionized workers had half or all of the day off on
Election Day. Lane Windham, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO, said
that it was still rare for workers to get part of the day off on
Election Day, and even rarer for workers to have the entire day
off.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters and Engler agreed that the biggest effect from the
holiday would lie not in increased voting by union members but in
greater political activity by union activists, who will be able to
drive voters to polling booths and staff telephone banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may give them manpower to get out the vote, not necessarily
of union members but in heavily Democratic areas,'' said Robert
Teeter, a pollster in Ann Arbor, Mich., who was the chairman of
President Bush's 1992 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be 400,000 who have the day off, but more important
is that 5,000 will be able to work all day,'' added Teeter, who is
not affiliated with a presidential campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis Gans, the director of the nonpartisan Committee for
the Study of the American Electorate, said that giving union
workers the day off might actually depress their turnout slightly
on Election Day, by preventing the union from urging them at their
workplaces to vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Engler said that while he had been discussing the union's
contract provision with Bush's campaign strategists, he did not
believe that its effects would be limited to the presidential
campaign. Giving autoworkers the day off will also affect next
year's Senate race in Michigan, in which Sen. Spencer Abraham, a
Republican, faces a tough race for a second term, Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Closely matched Senate and governors' races in Missouri, where
the UAW also has tens of thousands of members, will be influenced
by the labor contract provision too, Engler added.
</P>
<P>
   While the AFL-CIO has already endorsed Vice President Al Gore,
the autoworkers opposed the early choice. Yokich said that the
union's executive committee would meet in the first week of
February to discuss endorsements, and was likely to choose
candidates in the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries.
No decision has been made on whether to endorse a Reform Party
candidate, he added.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford officials declined to comment, while DaimlerChrysler
is closed this week, and seven officials did not return calls to
their homes and offices. The UAW negotiated its contract first with
DaimlerChrysler, including the Election Day provision, and then
demanded that GM and Ford accept identical terms.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers' contracts, which run through September 2003,
also call for Election Day in 2002 to be a paid holiday. Engler's
third, four-year term expires in 2002, but a 1992 term-limits
amendment to the state's constitution bars him from seeking
re-election then.

BRADLEY PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON DIFFERENCES WITH GORE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CAMPAIGN-MONEY) 
(rk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARNER, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley said Wednesday that the
three most important differences between him and Vice President Al
Gore were national health insurance, handgun control and commitment
to campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a town meeting held to provide footage for his
television commercials, Bradley said his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination was basically ``cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has, for example, been the doctrine of the Democratic Party
since the beginning almost of the modern Democratic Party that
Democrats stand for universal access to affordable, quality health
care,'' Bradley said. ``I provide it. He does not provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out and I see kids getting guns,'' he continued. ``I
say we have got to make it more difficult for kids to get guns. I
say we need registration and licensing of all the handguns in
America. If we can do it for automobiles, we ought to be able to do
it for handguns.'' Gore does not support such a plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supports licensing and registration of all handguns,
while Gore favors requiring new buyers of handguns to obtain
licenses with photo identification. In some other respects, their
stances on gun control are similar.
</P>
<P>
   On campaign finance reform, Bradley said that while Gore
supported the same measures he did, especially a ban on so-called
soft money and federal financing for congressional elections, the
issue was one of commitment. After seven years, he said, nothing
had happened under the current Democratic administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to push it?'' Bradley asked. ``I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed an expansion of health insurance for children,
but has dismissed Bradley's plan for universal access to insurance
as ineffective and too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these issues, Bradley said, required courage and invited
opposition. But he asked what there was to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing?'' he said. ``That's how you lose, by being afraid of
losing. You win by saying, `This is the future folks, follow me.'''
</P>
<P>
   He listed other things he wanted to do as president in an effort
to ``move our collective humanity a few feet forward.'' They
included increasing the minimum wage, improving early childhood
education and making it easier for workers to organize unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The untapped potential of the presidency,'' he said ``is to
unlock in each of us our capacity as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offered these views, which were warmly received, at an
event that both he and his staff said would be closed to reporters,
even though it had been advertised to the public in fliers around
town.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley Campaign had rented the Town Hall for $115. But
while a staff producing television footage required all those
attending to sign releases allowing them to be shown in television
ads, a reporter who signed the form like the others was able to
attend the meeting. Most of the questions here were prefaced by
declaration of support and were not intended to embarrass the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of an earlier campaign event in
Henniker, where Bradley talked with children at a day care center
about his plans to expand and improve day care and to subsidize the
education of new ``great'' teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One fourth grader asked if he had arrived in a limousine. He
said, ``I really don't like limousines; I drove up in a van with
six people.'' Another child asked if he was rich, and he said no. A
third followed up: ``Are you a millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   He replied, ``Am I a millionaire? I guess if you added
everything up, it would come close.''
</P>
<P>
   In May of this year, Bradley filed a federal financial
disclosure form showing his net worth to be between $5.1 million
and $20.7 million.

ARGENTIN A'S  NEW PRESIDENT  WINS $2 BILLION TAX INCREASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ After weeks of tough negotiations, the
Congress gave President Fernando de la Rua his most important
victory Wednesday by raising taxes more than $2 billion to
counteract an expanding budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a $1.4 billion cut in spending, enacted on Tuesday,
the package should reassure foreign investors and lower interest
rates to speed business expansion, government officials said. Most
economists expect a $4.5 billion deficit for 2000, which the
government should be able to finance as long as economic activity
continues to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the economic package should help dispel fears that de
la Rua will be unable to work with a Senate controlled by former
President Carlos Saul Menem's Justicialist Party. De la Rua, who
has been in office for only 18 days, was able to break a deadlock
by negotiating with congressional allies of Menem and with several
Justicialist governors now competing with the former president to
take charge of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a working detente has led some members of the
left wing of de la Rua's governing alliance to grumble that he is
backsliding on campaign promises to open a serious investigation
into alleged corruption in the last government.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the president's allies characterized the
series of congressional votes as a big victory. But the legislative
achievements may end up planting seeds for political problems in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increases will primarily affect the middle class, which
is the base of support for de la Rua and his Alianza coalition,
which will face a mayoral election in Buenos Aires next year and
congressional elections in 2001. But the president is betting that
his economic program will spur a bond and stock rally and bring
down the 14 percent unemployment rate much as some economists have
credited President Clinton's deficit-cutting package as having done
in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   The de la Rua package levies new taxes on soft drinks, alcoholic
beverages, cigarettes, airport use and private medical services. A
separate tax on automobiles costing more than $20,000 will go
toward increasing teacher salaries modestly.
</P>
<P>
   The Justicialist opposition proposed a package that would have
hit upper income people harder, including taxes on interest from
bank accounts. The opposition also wanted to exclude fruit juices
and tobacco from the new taxation to protect provinces dependent on
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Alianza majority in the lower house of Congress
was able to block opposition amendments Wednesday and the tax
package was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends exactly the right message to the country and
investors,'' Sen. Jose Genoud of Alianza said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Redrado, an economist who was once a close aide to Menem,
said the new budget was more ``credible'' than the one inherited
from the last administration. But he estimated that $1 billion of
the $1.4 billion in cuts was merely ``accounting cosmetics.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's economic package will also take aim at tax evasion,
which is estimated to cost the treasury $25 billion a year, or half
the total owed by taxpayers. The tax collection agency will now
have the power to freeze bank accounts, and special prosecutors
will be appointed to investigate high-income tax evaders.
</P>
<P>
   In his Christmas message, de la Rua made the budget deficit his
primary economic concern. ``The deficit is our worst enemy,'' he
said, adding that ``it is suffocating us.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 budget deficit of $6.2 billion far exceeded guidelines
set by the International Monetary Fund and increased concerns among
foreign investors that the government would have trouble servicing
its debt.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that the worst recession of the decade
bottomed out in the final weeks of the Menem government, although
the auto industry is still contracting and retailers complained
that their holiday sales were below those of last year. Government
and private statistics show that industrial production has been
slowly picking up momentum since August, and improved agricultural
commodity prices should help cut a trade deficit that has grown
sharply since Argentina's major trade partner, Brazil, devalued its
currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua will need an improving economy to sustain his recent
electoral mandate, given that the Senate, most of the nation's
governors and the judiciary are controlled by the opposition. In
his first three weeks in power, de la Rua has governed cautiously,
offering few initiatives apart from the plans to trim the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   He campaigned on a platform that promised to clean up official
corruption, but government prosecutors have so far indicted only
one official in the last government, Victor Alderete, the former
head of the state-run pensioners' welfare institute. He faces 17
corruption charges and a $6,000 lien has been placed on his assets.
</P>
<P>
   Menem quickly came to Alderete's defense, charging that there
was a witch hunt against his supporters. Without specifying what he
would do exactly, the former president told reporters that if
prosecutions of his former aides continued ``I will have to speak
up.''

SOME EMPATHIZE WITH PARENTS WHO LEFT DISABLED CHILD AT HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (th) 
 By IVER PETERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXTON, Pa. _ Parents with disabled children reacted with sad
recognition Wednesday to accusations that a wealthy couple,
apparently unable to find home care for their incapacitated son
over the Christmas holiday, left the 10-year-old at a hospital,
saying they could not care for him any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't abandon him _ they were trying to get help,'' said
Jackie Golden, program coordinator for the National Parents Network
on Disabilities, an advocacy group for disabled children. ``You
cannot judge this family.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Delaware Family Court on Tuesday charged Richard and
Dawn Kelso of this Philadelphia suburb with child abandonment and
conspiracy after police say they left their son Steven, who has
cerebral palsy, at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in
Wilmington, Del., on Sunday. According to the hospital, Dawn Kelso
told the emergency room receptionist that she could not care for
Steven and did not want to talk to anyone about it.
</P>
<P>
   When the receptionist returned with a nurse, the Kelsos were
gone, leaving behind Steven in his wheelchair, his diapers,
medications and toys, and a folder containing his medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso, 62, is president and chief executive of PQ Corp., a
privately held chemical company in Valley Forge, Pa., with $500
million a year in sales. Ms. Kelso, who is 45, is just finishing a
three-year term as a volunteer board member of the Pennsylvania
Developmental Disabilities Council, a position to which she was
appointed by the governor. The council advises the state on issues
affecting disabled persons, and Ms. Kelso is on two council
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, who breathes with the aid of a ventilator, has been a
frequent patient at the hospital, and he will remain there in the
custody of the Delaware Department of Family Services while the
department investigates ``the child's needs and the parents'
abilities to parent,'' said Trish Hearn, a spokeswoman for the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   News of the charges took the Kelsos' neighbors by surprise, said
Pat Mastricola, who lives a few doors down from the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had around-the-clock nurses that pretty much kept him
indoors,'' Mrs. Mastricola said, ``but they brought him out to go
trick-or-treating last year, and he could ring the doorbell
himself, so that was something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsos, who have lived on Shallow Springs Court for about
three years, were largely unknown to their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very family-oriented community but nobody I've
talked to knew them,'' Mrs. Mastricola said.
</P>
<P>
   Several people aware of Steven's plight said that the Kelsos'
schedule of visiting nurses fell apart over the Christmas holiday
and that the boy's parents were suddenly on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Hanlon, chairman of the Pennsylvania Developmental
Disabilities Council, said Ms. Kelso had expressed frustration in
dealing with agencies that sent nurses to her home to care for the
boy. Ridgaway Philips, a home health agency, said it provided
nursing care for Steven for 10 hours a day and the Kelsos hired
nurses for an additional eight to 10 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon said Ms. Kelso told him the situation was ``a
nightmare'' and that she felt she had no control over the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kelso's uncle, Glover Crouch, 74, told The News Journal of
Wilmington, Del., that the couple had been left without nursing
help over Christmas and had to sleep in shifts to handle Steven's
round-the-clock needs. Crouch described the Kelsos as loving
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Savitz, the family's lawyer, did not return telephone calls
Wednesday. John Reed, a spokesman for PQ Corp., also would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their anonymity in their neighborhood, the Kelsos'
situation was clearly recognizable to other parents with disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a handicapped child is overwhelming enough by itself,
without being able to find help when you need it,'' said Beth Gage,
an Elizabethtown, Pa., parent of a 17-year-old son with several
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People put up a good front in public, acting like everything's
hunky-dory, but behind closed doors, they fall apart,'' Ms. Gage
said. ``I can't tell you how many time I've felt like quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Golden, of the National Parents Network, whose severely
retarded son is 18, agreed. ``It's obvious that this family cares
for this child, but you reach a breaking point. People assume that
you have all kinds of options but you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of her volunteer work, Ms. Kelso was likely to be aware
of the services available to parents of disabled children, said
Susanmarie Trout, the Philadelphia mother of a disabled daughter,
who said she has lobbied state agencies on disability issues with
Ms. Kelso. She said the fact that Steven required mechanical help
to breath was one of the most severe burdens his parents had to
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children with ventilators are often denied access to
programs,'' Ms. Trout said. ``They train us parents to operate
those things, but when it comes to your child being involved in the
community they say, `No, no. This child needs a nurse at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilliam Rangle-Diaz, a member of the National Council on
Disabilities, a federal advisory panel, was less inclined to give
the Kelsos the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to judge this family, but abandoning a child is
simply not acceptable, so this certainly sounds like an extreme
case,'' Ms. Rangle-Diaz said from her Florida home. ``He is not the
only child on a ventilator.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsos were released Tuesday. As a condition, they are
forbidden to send letters or gifts to Steven or to call him on the
phone.

</P>
<P>

TALIBAN DENIES ISLAM BINDS THEM WITH HIJACKERS

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, the Taliban's foreign
minister, said in an interview Wednesday that his government is
dealing with the hostage crisis in Kandahar strictly as a
humanitarian issue and has no sympathy for the hijackers of the
Indian Airlines plane because they might be fellow Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our best,'' he said. ``With whatever we have, we
are serving the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing to do with Islam,'' said Muttawakil, speaking
in Pushtu through an interpreter in a telephone interview from
Kandahar airport, where he is taking part in talks to end the
crisis. ``Whatever they are doing from the beginning is against
Islam. They are using force.''
</P>
<P>
   Muttawakil said that the hijackers had been persuaded to
withdraw demands they had added after they landed in Afghanistan on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day the aircraft landed in our territory they passed
us a message asking for refueling and talks,'' he said. ``In the
talks, they requested the release of one particular man, Maulana
Masood Azhar, and some others. They did not ask us to pass on the
message of ransom or any other things.''
</P>
<P>
   On that understanding, he said, the plane was permitted to stay
in Kandahar. When new demands were added on Monday _ a $200 million
ransom and the exhumation of the body of a militant slain in India
_ ``we told them that it was against their promises,'' he said.
Together, the Taliban and the Indian delegation worked to convince
the hijackers that the new demands would not be met. ``They reduced
their demands, and they withdrew these two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Azhar, the religious leader whom the hijackers want
freed in India, was not well known in Afghanistan. ``He had been
jailed before the Taliban were on the screen,'' he added. But he
did not want to talk about links with the Kashmiris seeking
independence from India, whom Azhar supported. ``We don't want to
comment on our relations with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muttawakil, who was only recently named foreign minister, said
that the Taliban are not seeking praise or a change of heart from
India, which supports an armed opposition that is trying to
overthrow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to take credit when people are in a bad
condition,'' he said. ``This is not a channel to improve relations
with anybody. It is a critical situation, and whatever we are doing
is just for the sake of human rights and the humanitarian
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to come here,'' he said of the Indian officials now
in Kandahar. ``We know that the key to this problem is with two
people: the hijackers and the Indian government. It is just like a
lock. We are holding the lock in our hands, and the keys are with
the two sides. We are not in a position to open the lock; it is
they who can open the lock.''
</P>
<P>
   Muttawakil said the Taliban are more observers than negotiators
in the talks with hijackers. ``It is the Indians who are talking,
in our presence. It is the Indians who are negotiating with them,''
he said, adding that most of the talks are going on by radio from a
room in the building housing the airport control tower.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The foreign minister said that the Taliban's supreme leader, the
Mullah Muhammad Omar, had been regularly apprised of the situation.
``He has been briefed on everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muttawakil said that while negotiations looked as if they might
go on for some time, the Taliban wanted the standoff to end or the
plane to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some technical problems in the plane, and upon
the request of the Indian government and the Western diplomats
whose citizens are among the hostages, we are told to be patient,''
he said. ``Our first priority is that they solve the situation
peacefully with the hijackers. If not, we will have to force them
to leave Afghanistan.''

AS HIJACKING DRAMA PLAYS OUT, VIEWS ON TALIBAN SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDIA-HIJACK, INDIA-HIJACK-WAHID)

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As the Indian Airlines hijacking entered its
sixth day Wednesday, growing attention is turning to the Taliban,
the Islamic movement that rules most of Afghanistan but has been
scorned by the world.
</P>
<P>
   India, which actively supports an armed opposition to the
Taliban and applauds the United States for persuading the Security
Council to punish Afghanistan with sanctions, is suddenly full of
praise for the group. India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh,
facing a political calamity if the drama ends in tragedy, has
publicly thanked the Taliban for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban leaders, who would have preferred U.N. mediation _ a
course vehemently opposed by India, which prefers to deal directly
with the hijackers _ have nevertheless smoothed the way for an
Indian negotiating team and have allowed international relief
experts to set up an emergency center at the airfield near the
Taliban's spiritual headquarters in Kandahar. They have arranged to
clean and guard the plane but not in ways that would antagonize the
hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, said in
an interview Wednesday that his government was treating the
hijacking as a strictly humanitarian issue and that this case had
nothing to do with Islamic solidarity, even though the hijackers,
whose identities remain something of a mystery, are thought to be
Muslims. He also said that the Taliban were not looking for praise
or gratitude abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the region say that there is no certainty that the
militantly Islamic Taliban fighters, who run a loosely organized
government at best, will be able to significantly improve their
reputation through their management of this unexpected crisis _ or
that a hostile world will accord them any longterm goodwill when it
is over. Their image remains one of a medieval theocracy that
denies both men and women basic rights and seems unable to develop
the country or educate and feed its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world, for the most part, has basically been on a campaign
for the last couple of years to isolate the Taliban,'' said Paula
Newberg, a consultant to the United Nations in the region who has
also written studies on Afghanistan and Kashmir for the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ``Afghanistan has
become an empty hole for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, demanding that the Taliban turn over Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi-born militant wanted in the United States on
charges of complicity in the bombing of two U.S. embassies in
Africa last year, not only imposed its own sanctions on Afghanistan
but led a successful campaign to add an international embargo. The
embargo, coincidentally, prohibits most air travel to and from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the embargo, many already poor and malnourished
Afghans, battered by decades of civil war, are enduring extra
hardship this winter, some relief organizations say. Meanwhile,
almost all U.S. contacts with the country have been severed, and
Afghanistan's U.N. seat is held by an exiled leader who is not even
part of the opposition forces fighting in the country's northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this policy of isolation, the number of contacts,
the knowledge anyone has of who within Afghanistan is capable of
doing what is very limited,'' Ms. Newberg said. ``This is what you
get when you impose sanctions on an already isolated regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostility toward the Taliban, albeit for differing reasons, has
made unlikely allies of India, Iran, Russia, the United States, the
European Union and several Central Asian governments. All these
countries see Afghanistan as a dangerous haven for Islamic
terrorism. In the region, only Pakistan _ whose Inter Services
Intelligence organization, or factions of it, still aid the Taliban
_ has recognized the Taliban government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Now everybody is saying, the Pakistanis should be exercising
their influence on the Taliban _ something they have been trying to
persuade the Pakistanis not to do for the last two years,'' Ms.
Newberg said. ``The Americans have been on the path to try to get
Pakistan to de-recognize the Taliban, while the Pakistanis say they
could be a conduit for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Oakley, a former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and a State
Department counterterrorism expert, said the concerted attacks on
the Taliban miss some points about the nature of the Islamic
jihadists, or holy warriors, whom they are accused of harboring or
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban are Afghans,'' he said, ``but the terrorists are
jihadist. The cause is important, but the nationality is
irrelevant. Call them Pakistanis, or Afghans or Kashmiris, Tajiks
or Uzbeks _ it doesn't make any difference because they don't think
of themselves that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley draws two analogies. He sees the Islamic holy war as a
cause for Muslims not unlike the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s was
for the European left and others opposed to the rule of Francisco
Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Afghanistan is a safe haven in the way Lebanon once
was 20 years ago for all the terrorists because there is no strong
central government,'' he said. ``They can hide out and they are
able to appeal in various ways to Islamic solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's interests would be served, including India's and
Pakistan's, if they could work together to throttle this disparate
group that's spreading all over Central Asia and up into the
Caucasus,'' he said. Instead, he added, India and some officials in
the United States use the issue to isolate not only Afghanistan but
also Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   This approach also suits the Russians, now trying to convince
the world that Islamic terrorism is the reason for Moscow's
military campaign in the separatist region of Chechnya, where there
are reports of links to bin Laden's holy warriors. Shiite Iran,
opposed to the Sunni Taliban for religious, ethnic and strategic
reasons, generally backs the punishment of Afghanistan, although in
recent days the Iranians have revived calls for more talks with the
Taliban to end the Afghan civil war.
</P>
<P>
   At the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Murphy, a former
assistant secretary of state for the Near East, said that the
Islamic terrorist threat may be exaggerated. As a nation, he said,
``we have tended pretty consistently to hype Islamic terrorism.''
It used to be the Palestinians, he said, now it is the Taliban and
the militants they harbor. He questions the Afghans' staying power,
a theme now appearing in the writing of some Pakistani commentators
critical of their country's links with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the high drama of Chechnya and now this hijacking,''
Murphy said, ``I think the Taliban is on the decline. They just
aren't satisfying anyone inside the country.'' He described them as
a rough, ill-educated group ``willing to punish their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban is kind of falling from its own weight,'' he said.

RING IN THE NEW YEAR IN FRONT OF YOUR TV -- ALL DAY

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Illustrating the technological accomplishments of the
last millennium, broadcast networks, cable news organizations and
local stations will cover New Year's Eve like the
once-in-a-lifetime event that it is.
</P>
<P>
   PBS, ABC, NBC and Pax TV plan no less than around-the-world,
24-hour coverage. So do CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, New Year's Eve will be no holiday for TV newsrooms. In
fact, stations report that they will be staffing at two or three
times the holiday norm, at the ready in case of Y2K meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists can rejoice: Dick Clark will again be on hand to
do his thing, and New York's Times Square will once again be party
central.
</P>
<P>
   Those who pffft tradition can console themselves with cable.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a station-by-station, network-by-network rundown of who's
doing what when:
</P>
<P>
   ABC and PBS
</P>
<P>
   From the BBC in London, executive producer Zvi Dor-Ner, who
originated the idea of an international consortium, is coordinating
``2000 Today,'' a 25-hour telecast that draws from reports from
more than 50 nations. Participants include the BBC, TV Asashi in
Japan, CBC Canada, TV 3 New Zealand, ABC Australia, ONCE TV in
Mexico, SABC in South Africa, Italy's RAI, TF1 France and, for the
United States, ABC and PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Hoyt, executive producer of PBS' contributions, said the
complicated production is based on the BBC's ``hub'' model:
Contributions go first to country-control centers, then to regional
hubs. The hubs send the footage to London, where it is uplinked to
satellites and downlinked by individual broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do with it is up to them,'' said Hoyt. ``ABC has a
lot of money and a lot of options. PBS is going to rely pretty much
on this broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Yellin, one of three executive producers at ABC, agreed: ABC
has a lot of options and is going to exercise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the single-most ambitious program ever produced by
anybody, and I say that without hesitation,'' he said. ``We have
deployed the whole of all the resources of ABC News.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and PBS will begin their telecasts at 3:50 a.m. Friday in
the South Pacific at the Polynesian islands of Kiribati, then go to
Mount Hakepa on Pitt Island, where residents will honor their Maori
past by lighting a torch, placing it in a canoe and sending it out
to sea. In New Zealand, all 70 maternity hospitals will have
cameras to record the millennium's first newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt said his program is ``structured so that the celebration is
at the top of the hour, for 10 minutes _ five before the hour, five
after. Then there are other segments in daylight from other parts
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the international entertainers whose performances will be
covered by the consortium are Annie Lennox from the new Millennium
Dome in Greenwich, England; Jean-Michel Jarre from the pyramids
near Cairo; and the Manic Street Preachers from Cardiff, Wales.
Concerts by Aerosmith, Billy Joel and Whitney Houston also will be
featured.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt said the first entertainment contribution from PBS will be
from New Orleans' Storyville District, where jazz pianist Allen
Toussaint will explain that, earlier that day, the city had a jazz
funeral parade to bury the old millennium.
</P>
<P>
   One of ABC's acts, of course, will be the eternal Clark. From
10:30 p.m. to midnight, ABC will air ``Dick Clark's Rockin' New
Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt said PBS will head toward midnight with the Gipsy Kings'
multilingual version of Bob Marley's ``One Love,'' featuring Ziggy
Marley, Tsidii Le Loka and the Boys Choir of Harlem. Then, he said,
PBS will switch to Times Square, also using tape of what Hoyt calls
``the midnight moment'' in the East: Miami; Toronto; Montreal;
Niagara Falls, N.Y.; Panama; Lima, Peru; and Chile's Easter Island.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jennings will host for ABC. Gwen Ifill and Will Durst will
host for PBS.
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   Coverage begins at 4 a.m. Friday with hourly updates on New
Year's observances and Y2K developments. Reports will come from 16
U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign coverage begins in the South Pacific, including New
Zealand, and moves to Australia, Asia, Russia, the Middle East and
across Europe, where Jodi Applegate will anchor reports from
England, Paris, the Vatican and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline NBC,'' at 7 p.m., will report on the expectations of
the new millennium. At 8 p.m., Katie Couric and Tom Brokaw's news
special will cover Y2K developments and entertainment nationwide,
including performances by Sting, Aretha Franklin and Gloria
Estefan. At 10:35 p.m., an abbreviated ``Tonight Show'' will air
live, then the network will return to New York for the ball drop in
Times Square and a laser and fireworks display. Network coverage
will continue until 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   Jane Clayson and Jon Frankel will report from Sydney, Australia,
for ``The Early Show.'' The network will then offer one-minute
reports at the top of each hour, beginning at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A millennium edition of the suddenly misnamed ``Late Show With
David Letterman'' will air at 7 p.m. It will include a special
presentation of ``Stupid Pet and Stupid Human Tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m. Friday, CBS will carry ``America's Millennium: A
Celebration for the Nation'', then break for 10 p.m. news and
resume coverage from 10:35 p.m. to midnight. The production will
focus on New Year's Eve on the Mall, where Will Smith is hosting
with Trisha Yearwood, Kenny Rogers, Jack Nicholson, and President
and Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others. The telecast will include
Celine Dion in Montreal and a short film by Steven Spielberg, with
a score by John Williams, that focuses on the United States'
achievements during the last century.

performances by the Neville Brothers in Las Vegas and the Red Hot
Chili Peppers in Los Angeles. Fox also checks in at Roswell, N.M.

</P>
<P>
   Composer Glen Roven's ``Dona Nobis Pacem (Let There Be Peace),''
recorded in 12 languages, is the theme song for ``Millennium Live
... A New World's Eve,'' another global production that begins at 5
a.m. in Fiji and ends 24 hours later in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 countries are participating in the event. Concert
appearances by Beausoleil, Aerosmith, the Bee Gees, Blondie,
Chicago, the Spice Girls, Santana, Sting, Phil Collins, 'N Sync and
the Pretenders are planned.

STORM DEATH TOLL RISES AS FRANCE CLEANS UP
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 9th graf, Across the ..., to clarify reference to Savoy

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As skies cleared Wednesday, the pace of the cleanup from
the past days' devastating storms quickened.
</P>
<P>
   The French government deployed 9,000 soldiers to clear trees and
deliver drinking water while crews from Germany, Belgium, Italy and
Spain arrived to help the French national electricity company
restore power to the millions of people cut off by the two
back-to-back storms that began last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the death toll from the storms, which battered the country
with gale winds of up to 125 mph, continued to rise. Officials said
that 74 people had died in France, which was hardest hit, and 49
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The state electricity company, Electricite de France, said
Wednesday that it had managed to send 40 helicopters, 5,000
vehicles and some 52,000 workers into the field.
</P>
<P>
   But the company said about one quarter of its grid had been
damaged. By Wednesday night, 1.9 million households _ nearly 5
million people _ remained without power.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-hit area in France was the southwest, which bore the
brunt of the second storm. In many towns, residents faced another
night without electricity, which in some cases also meant no heat
and no water, because the water systems depend on electric pumps.
And without electricity for power tools, many homeowners were
unable to begin dealing with broken branches and damaged roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone service was also widely affected and could get worse,
officials said. About 400,000 homes had no service and another
350,000 stood to lose their service, as back-up batteries that had
been powering exchanges ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's airports were back in working order
Wednesday, but train service remained at about 80 percent. The head
of the national railroad, Louis Gallois, said he expected service
to be virtually back to normal by the weekend. The bill for
damages, he said, would probably come to about $83.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, the winds tore up roof shingles, knocked
down chimneys and devastated forests. But in some areas the real
danger was flooding from rains and snow that accompanied the wind.
In Calvados, 100 people had to be rescued from flooded areas and 12
houses were completely submerged. In the north, and also in the
Savoy region, snow clogged the roads and avalanches were a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said that the
government was making about $16 million available to the worst hit
areas and would declare 60 disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Brittany coast, the oil spill from the tanker Erika,
which sank on Dec. 12, continued to wash up along a 250-mile
stretch of beach. The first oil had hit land late last week, and
the storms hampered clean-up efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of TotalFina, the oil company that had chartered
the decrepit tanker, apologized Wednesday, pledging to help clean
up the mess, which could have devastating consequences for the
local fishing and tourist industries. He also promised to donate a
day's salary to an environmental preservation group.
</P>
<P>
   The national weather service predicted that strong winds would
continue to sweep Corsica and the Mediterranean coast, while
freezing temperatures and snow was expected in the north.

QUALCOMM SOARS, HELPING NASDAQ TO CLOSE ABOVE 4,000 MARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Powered by an eye-popping 156-point gain for
Qualcomm, the Nasdaq stock market closed above 4,000 for the first
time Wednesday after coming close in the three preceding sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and Dow Jones industrial
average also climbed to new highs, though with gains much smaller
than Nasdaq's 1.75 percent, as investors engaged in year-end
transactions to minimize taxes or, in the case of professionals, to
spruce up portfolios before reporting to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Activity was subdued in a week when many market operators were
away for the holidays. Traders said other investors had stepped
aside to avoid possible disruption from Year 2000 computer mishaps
during the last three business days of the year during which
transactions are settled. The markets will close at 1 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, already up twentyfold this year, rocketed to 656 from
503 after a PaineWebber analyst, Walter Piecyk, called it a buy,
predicting shares of the cell-phone technology company, to be split
4 for 1 on Friday, would double again in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Piecyk estimated that 85 percent of cell phones would use
Qualcomm's technology by the end of the coming decade, compared
with 18 percent today, generating annual royalties of up to $20
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stock of the San Diego-based company opened at 562~ and traded
as high as 662 1/16, vaulting it well ahead of Motorola, which has
seven times as much revenue, in the market value of all its
outstanding shares. It was the fourth most active issue, with 14.6
million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   A late surge left the Nasdaq index ahead by 69.35 points, to
4,041.46, or 84.3 percent higher than at the beginning of 1999.
This is the biggest yearly gain for any of the major stock indexes,
surpassing a 73.9 percent jump for the Dow industrials in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-driven Nasdaq index did not reach the 3,000 mark
until Nov. 3, meaning it has soared nearly 35 percent in less than
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russell 2000, a gauge of smaller stock
performance that lagged for much of the year but has been rising
smartly of late, jumped 1.75 percent Wednesday to swell its 1999
advance to 17.8 percent, just short of the 19.1 percent gain by the
S&AMP;P 500. The Russell 2000's 8.53-point rise pushed the index up to
497.01, surpassing its April 21, 1998 peak of 491.41.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip Dow, which slumped in late trading after being
ahead by 66 points, eked out a gain of 7.95 points, to 11,484.66.
This gauge, which did not exceed its previous peak set Aug. 25
until last week, is now up 25.1 percent for the year.

<P>
   Except for its weak drug stocks, Johnson &AMP; Johnson down 2 15/16,
to 93, and Merck down 1{, to 68\, there was little pattern among
the Dow's components, 15 of which rose while 13 fell. American
Express, the most expensive stock in an average weighted by price,
made the biggest positive contribution, rising 3}, to 165{.
Hewlett-Packard was second, up 2 5/16, to 113|.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq was, as usual, paced by high-tech stocks, though
nothing remotely approached the performance of Qualcomm. Oracle
climbed 3~, to 110, Yahoo 13 7/16, to 403 11/16, eBay 2\, to 142[
and JDS Uniphase 11 15/16, to 331 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts continued to express caution, as they have for months,
about the highfliers. ``We're stretching this a bit, especially the
Nasdaq 100,'' said Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer at
PNC Advisors in Pittsburgh. ``One really has to question how much
more the stock market can do with good yields on Treasury bonds
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks were big gainers, led by Charles Schwab, which
jumped 5 13/16, to 39}, after the company, which is the biggest
online broker, said it expected to earn 2 or 3 cents more in the
fourth quarter than the 17-cent Wall Street consensus.  &QL;

   Nasdaq Ends Above 4,000 and Is Up 84 Percent For the Year
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, on its way to the best year ever for
a major American stock index, closed above 4,000 for the first
time. The milestone came less than two months after the index first
topped 3,000 and was based largely on the strength of the
technology stocks that have come to dominate the Nasdaq market. The
index rose 69.35 points, or 1.75 percent, to 4,041.46, and is now
up 84.3 percent since the end of 1998. Three stocks in the index
have gained more than 1,000 percent this year, with Qualcomm, a
leading company in mobile phone technology, surging 2,444 percent
since the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones
industrial average also climbed to new highs. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 5.80

   Two online combatants, separated in cyberspace by a single

is eToys, the Web's leading toy retailer. On the other is an arts
group that has already had to give up its address, www.etoy.com,

<P>
   Nearly a week after a proposal was circulated in Germany that

untangle more than $100 billion worth of cross-shareholdings, it
appears to have a serious chance of becoming law. Even though the
plan would be an enormous tax break for big business, it has not

 &HT;    Y2K flop: Hopes for Highland fling dashed
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta sculptor George Beasley hoped he'd end the
century in a blaze of glory.
</P>
<P>
   He would sear the night skies of a tiny town on the northern
coast of Scotland with a 500-pound mass of molten iron hurled from
a medieval, catapult-like device that is called a trebuchet.
</P>
<P>
   The effect would be of a comet brushing close to Earth, symbolic
of ``the end of the Iron Age and the beginning of a new era,''
Beasley said. The event would take place near the Greenwich Mean
Time meridian in Scotland, Britain's traditional iron-making
center.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday morning, the sculptor's fling with fame
unceremoniously came crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Three years of planning _ and 4 1/2 months of preparation _ came
to naught when the catapult was destroyed during a final test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miscalculated something,'' said a disconsolate Beasley in a
telephone interview from Portsoy, Scotland was running very
smoothly. We made a mistake testing it without the proper weight,
and it all just came apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, nobody was hurt, and nobody was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, 56, head of the Georgia State University sculpture
department, is probably best-known in Atlanta for his
brass-and-iron sculpture ``Five Points,'' at the intersection of
Marietta and Peachtree Streets in downtown Atlanta. On Tuesday,
when the trebuchet project seemed to be on track, Beasley had
described the planned New Year's event as the ``most important in
my life as an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   A crew from Atlanta-based Commotion Films had arrived in Portsoy
on Tuesday to produce a documentary of the event, dubbed the
Millennium Project. The project was funded by Georgia State
University, the Scottish Sculpture Worksho and private donations,
as well as Beasley's own money. Beasley declined to say how much
the project cost. Officials from GSU could not be reached for
comment
</P>
<P>
   ``It took all kinds of approvals from all kinds of committees,''
said the sculptor, ``but they became very excited about it as a
part of their millennium celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr Hill a member of the Portsoy Millennium Committee, said,
``We're very disappointed about the accident, but we understand
they are going to go on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flinging the molten iron into the harbor, Beasley and
his crew will carry it by buckets to the water's edge and pour it
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or the other, the iron is going back into the earth,''
Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we're going to burn everything. All the pretense, all the
ego is going up in one huge fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that what's going on at the end of the millennium. Maybe
there's something going on here that I don't quite understand.''

2 DIE IN LOUISIANA PRISON HOSTAGE-TAKING
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A prison guard and an inmate were killed on Tuesday
night in a bloody hostage-taking at the Louisiana State
Penitentiary that may have been inspired in part by the recent
success of Cuban inmates in negotiating their deportation during a
hostage standoff at another Louisiana jail, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Six murderers, all serving sentences of life without parole,
took three corrections officers hostage about 8:30 p.m. CDT
Tuesday, apparently after a botched escape attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a homemade knife, a small hammer and other
rudimentary weapons, the inmates bludgeoned and stabbed one veteran
officer to death before heavily armed guards subdued the rebellion
by shooting one inmate to death and wounding another. The incident
lasted less than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The dead officer, Capt. David Knapps, 49, had worked for 12
years at the maximum-security prison farm, which is better known by
its place name, Angola. Like many other officers at Angola, Knapps
came from a family of prison guards. His father, five of his
siblings, two of his children and his fiancee are all current or
former Angola staffers, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officers found Knapps' body in a bathroom. ``They beat
him to death with a hammer because he wouldn't give up his keys,''
Warden N. Burl Cain said. ``He's a real martyr and a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Cain said one inmate involved in the uprising told one of the
hostages, a sergeant, that when their planned escape failed, they
had determined they ``were going to have to do it like St.
Martinville.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martinville is the site of the parish, or county, jail where
a group of Cuban inmates used a homemade knife and a screwdriver to
take the warden, two deputies and several female inmates hostage on
Dec. 13. The Cubans had all completed sentences for crimes
committed in the United States but were being held indefinitely
because their deportation _ the usual fate for felons who are not
citizens _ had been blocked by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-day siege, the State Department negotiated an
unusual deal with Cuba that allowed seven Cuban inmates to be
deported. Local prosecutors criticized the arrangement, saying the
hostage-takers deserved to be charged for crimes related to the
rebellion. And they quickly predicted that the deal would invite
other inmates to take hostages at prisons around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff W.M. Daniel of West Feliciana Parish, who was at Angola
during the standoff, called Tuesday night's uprising ``more or less
a copycat deal from St. Martinville.'' And Warden Cain noted that
the rebellious inmates had demanded to speak to Justice Department
officials, just as the St. Martinville inmates had.
</P>
<P>
   J. Phil Haney, the first assistant district attorney in the
circuit that includes St. Martinville, and a critic of the federal
government's deal with the Cubans, said information traveled fast
between prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it wasn't a direct result of what happened here,'' he
said, ``but it's certainly an ongoing concern.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman, Gretchen B. Michael, said it
was ``far too speculative'' to assess whether the inmates at Angola
had been encouraged by the fate of the Cubans. And Richard L.
Stalder, the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety
and Corrections, who was at Angola when the hostages were freed,
emphasized that there were significant differences between the two
groups of hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they referenced St. Martinville, I don't think you
could say they were attempting to do anything that was mimicking
St. Martinville,'' Stalder said. ``After they murdered the captain,
they may have thought, `Well, we better do something,' and maybe
they did think they could get some relief by taking hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   State and local law-enforcement agencies had yet to press
charges against the inmates, but Cain said he expected that two
inmates would be charged with capital murder, which carries a
possible death sentence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The warden said the incident took place in Camp D, an 850-bed
unit of cellblocks and dormitories. A sergeant, Reddia Walker,
noticed Knapps tussling with several inmates as they were
approaching the camp's educational building and sounded an alarm.
Sergeant Walker ran to help Knapps, but was taken hostage herself,
along with Lt. Douglas Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   When Cain arrived at the educational building, backed by a
tactical squad of armed guards, he turned down the inmates' request
to speak with federal officials. The warden, who did not know at
the time that Knapps had been killed, agreed to allow the inmates
to return to their cells without consequence if they released the
two hostages, and he delivered the offer in writing. Two of the
inmates surrendered at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Louisiana's tough sentencing laws, Angola is one of
the country's most hopeless prisons. More than half the inmates are
there for life, without the possibility of parole, and most others
are in for terms that are longer than their expected life spans. So
when Cain tried to negotiate with Joel Durham, the 26-year-old
inmate who was later killed by the prison guards, Durham responded:
``I've got nothing to lose. I came here as a young man. I'm going
to die in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it'll be all right,'' Cain said. ``We'll work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't looked in the bathroom,'' Durham answered.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering Knapps' body, Cain and Stalder decided to
move. ``Once they've hurt someone, you know that they'll hurt the
others,'' Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   An officer tossed a percussion bomb into the room, stunning the
inmates. As Durham lunged with a knife at the screaming Sergeant
Walker, ``one of the officers shot him twice in the chest and once
between the eyes,'' Cain said. Another inmate, David Mathis, 23,
was shot ``smack dab in the bottom of his lip,'' but survived, the
warden said.
</P>
<P>
   Cain said his policy was not to negotiate for hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a message all the inmates know,'' he said. ``They just
forgot it. And now they know it again.''

COMMENTARY: TORMENTED CHILDREN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are not usually part of our consciousness, these
children. They shiver and tremble and act out to the awful
imperatives of mental illness. Sometimes they shut down. Sometimes
they lash out, attacking others, or they turn their fury on
themselves. Often they are the victims of terrible crimes. We do a
lousy job of reaching them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Legal Aid Society went into federal court and
filed a class action suit against New York state's mental health
system, charging that youngsters who are known to be severely
mentally ill are being denied treatment because the state has
refused to provide the mental health facilities they require.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 children are on waiting lists for admittance to
residential treatment facilities but cannot be admitted because the
existing facilities are filled to capacity. So the kids, according
to the suit, have been left to languish in hospitals, foster care
or jail.
</P>
<P>
   These are children like the 12-year-old boy identified in the
suit by the pseudonym Alexander A.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, cocaine and heroin were detected in
Alexander's system at birth, and he was physically abused before he
was four months old. He was later placed in a foster home where he
and his two sisters were physically and sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   In the dry language of court papers, the suit said: ``Alexander
A.'s mental health condition worsened sharply in 1999 when one of
his younger sisters in the home was beaten to death, allegedly by
his adoptive mother. Alexander A. became suicidal and was
psychiatrically hospitalized for several weeks, during which he was
maintained on psychotropic medications.''
</P>
<P>
   In July the boy was transferred to Geller House, a diagnostic
reception center on Staten Island, for evaluation. ``While at
Geller House,'' the suit said, ``Alexander A. has consistently
engaged in self-mutilating, self-destructive behavior, and
provocative and physically aggressive behavior toward others, whom
he views as `bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was decided at Geller House that this youngster required
long-term residential treatment, and his case was referred to the
state Office of Mental Health. Officials there agreed. But instead
of being admitted to a residential treatment facility, Alexander
was promptly placed on a waiting list. He is still at Geller House.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters remain on the waiting lists for months, sometimes
more than a year. While they wait, they often deteriorate. It's a
cruel, wasteful and frequently tragic situation.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Drinane, the lawyer in charge of the Legal Aid Society's
juvenile rights division, described these children as ``some of the
most gravely mentally ill young people imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``If we do not intervene in their lives at this point,
then we're putting ourselves in a self-defeating mode because
without these critical services many of these children will become
the people that you see talking to themselves on the street
corners. They will not be able to become productive members of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit asks the court to compel the state to place children in
residential treatment facilities within 30 days of the
determination that they are eligible for such services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is in disagreement that these children need serious
psychiatric intervention right now _ today,'' said Ms. Drinane.
</P>
<P>
   Until the plight of these youngsters is taken more seriously by
public officials and the public at large, they will continue to
suffer and cause harm to themselves and others. Many will be
condemned to the kind of nightmarish world that has settled over a
14-year-old girl identified in the lawsuit as Bernadette B.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, according to the suit, she was subjected to
``severe verbal, physical and sexual abuse, including sodomy, by
her father, beginning when she was 8 or 9.''

   She considered suicide and had to be hospitalized for
depression. The suit said her condition currently ``is
characterized by frequent episodes of extreme shaking and crying
and intense flashbacks of her father's abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   She is subject to violent mood swings and has assaulted at least
one person. At 14, her life is a mess. Everyone involved says she
needs intensive therapy in a residential treatment facility.
Instead, she's in a juvenile jail upstate.

 &HT;    Y2K flop: Hopes for Highland fling dashed
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta sculptor George Beasley hoped he'd end the
century in a blaze of glory.
</P>
<P>
   He would sear the night skies of a tiny town on the northern
coast of Scotland with a 500-pound mass of molten iron hurled from
a medieval, catapult-like device that is called a trebuchet.
</P>
<P>
   The effect would be of a comet brushing close to Earth, symbolic
of ``the end of the Iron Age and the beginning of a new era,''
Beasley said. The event would take place near the Greenwich Mean
Time meridian in Scotland, Britain's traditional iron-making
center.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday morning, the sculptor's fling with fame
unceremoniously came crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Three years of planning _ and 4 1/2 months of preparation _ came
to naught when the catapult was destroyed during a final test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miscalculated something,'' said a disconsolate Beasley in a
telephone interview from Portsoy, Scotland was running very
smoothly. We made a mistake testing it without the proper weight,
and it all just came apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, nobody was hurt, and nobody was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, 56, head of the Georgia State University sculpture
department, is probably best-known in Atlanta for his
brass-and-iron sculpture ``Five Points,'' at the intersection of
Marietta and Peachtree Streets in downtown Atlanta. On Tuesday,
when the trebuchet project seemed to be on track, Beasley had
described the planned New Year's event as the ``most important in
my life as an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   A crew from Atlanta-based Commotion Films had arrived in Portsoy
on Tuesday to produce a documentary of the event, dubbed the
Millennium Project. The project was funded by Georgia State
University, the Scottish Sculpture Worksho and private donations,
as well as Beasley's own money. Beasley declined to say how much
the project cost. Officials from GSU could not be reached for
comment
</P>
<P>
   ``It took all kinds of approvals from all kinds of committees,''
said the sculptor, ``but they became very excited about it as a
part of their millennium celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr Hill a member of the Portsoy Millennium Committee, said,
``We're very disappointed about the accident, but we understand
they are going to go on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flinging the molten iron into the harbor, Beasley and
his crew will carry it by buckets to the water's edge and pour it
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or the other, the iron is going back into the earth,''
Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we're going to burn everything. All the pretense, all the
ego is going up in one huge fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that what's going on at the end of the millennium. Maybe
there's something going on here that I don't quite understand.''
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: JUST RANTING AND RAVING DOESN'T WIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell took the high road the other night when asked
the inevitable questions about P.J. Carlesimo, who was dismissed as
head coach of the Golden State Warriors earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for anyone who loses their job,'' Sprewell said
in the direct but diplomatic style he has adopted since coming to
the New York Knicks last season. Sprewell could have claimed
vindication. He could have pointed out that, based on winning
performances, he has been more successful in his pro career than
Carlesimo has been in his as a coach. Sprewell chose to let it go,
knowing that even then he and P.J. would never be allowed to let
go.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Sprewell's physical attack on Carlesimo
catapulted them into the national spotlight, the two have resigned
themselves to being locked in an eternal embrace for as long as
their respective basketball careers live. They are tied to each
other, like Russell and Chamberlain, Bird and Magic. Like Rudy
Tomjanovich and Kermit Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's Knick loss to New Jersey, Sprewell said: ``I
understand that's something I have to live with for the rest of my
career. And frankly, I can live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo, 3,000 miles away in San Francisco, said: ``That's
something that happened, that's there, that's part of my resume.
That's always going to be there for Spree and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago this month _ Dec. 1, 1997 _ Sprewell grabbed
Carlesimo around the neck during practice. For all the subsequent
oceans of ink written about the attack, all the mountains of paper,
have we learned anything from the episode, or has it all been just
one long, open-ended soap opera?
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Carlesimo have each suffered in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was suspended by the NBA for a year and had his
contract terminated. An arbitrator eventually reduced the
suspension to 68 games and reinstated his contract. He was traded
to the Knicks in January and helped New York reach the NBA finals.
In the process, he became the most popular Knick, the Knick most
identified with the team's playoff run. Yet, there is a permanent
stain on his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of many in the news media, Sprewell is still
Richard Wright's Bigger Thomas, Claude Brown's Manchild. Every deed
and misdeed will be balanced against his action against Carlesimo,
who in turn will always be remembered as the coach choked by his
own player.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has tried to modify his image, but what about
Carlesimo? Read between the lines for evidence that he, too,
understands the need to modify his style. No signs are forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more important that you're respected, and it's
more important that you're effective than you be liked,'' he said
on Tuesday, the day after he was fired. ``Coaching isn't a
popularity contest. You'd like to be liked, but if you're concerned
with that in coaching, you're not going to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't be successful if players despise you, either. For the
second time in a brief span, Carlesimo was dismissed as a head
coach. He was dismissed by Portland in 1997, despite three straight
winning seasons. Losing has not been the issue for Carlesimo, but
rather it has been his incessantly grating style.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the ever confident Carlesimo said he believed there
was still a place for the hard-nosed, abrasive, taskmaster approach
to coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a general manager or owner that wants a
particular type of coach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That point is another reason the savvy Sprewell remains
contrite. He knows that every goodbye ain't gone. He knows he may
cross paths with Carlesimo again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see someone else give P.J. another
opportunity to coach,'' Sprewell said. Given the NBA's tradition of
recycling fired coaches, P.J.'s next job may be as head coach and
general manager. Who knows? Carlesimo might end up being Sprewell's
coach again one day.
</P>
<P>
   And if Sprewell plans to work in the NBA after he retires,
Carlesimo will probably have worked his way into the position of
vice president or president for some NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though Carlesimo's coaching skills may be suited for
the pros, his coaching personality is designed for college. In the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, where players are like
field hands, held hostage to the whims of a coach who has them by
the one-year renewable scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   For Carlesimo, the right situation is a league in which players
have no options, where they're obliged to take what he hands out.
</P>
<P>
   That's the NCAA, not the NBA.
</P>

   A second ferry line linking Iraq to other nations in the Persian
Gulf has opened with the arrival of a car ferry at the Iraqi port
of Um Qasr from Bahrain. Iraq, barred from international air
traffic under United Nations sanctions, was permitted to open the
first ferry link in the gulf last year, from Dubai. The ferries
take passengers, cars and some cargo, since each passenger is

   Eight people accused of being involved in bombings that rocked
Moscow and other cities last September are in custody, a Russian
Federal Security Services official, Vladimir Kozlov, said
Wednesday. But Kozlov, who is in charge of the security services'

   Seven journalists were stopped Wednesday as they drove through

where they were held for nine hours before being released. It was
unclear if the journalists, six of whom were accredited in Moscow,
would be permitted to remain in the Caucasus. Daniel Williams, a
reporter for The Washington Post, called his editor, Robert
McCartney, to report that he and the others had been released. The
other journalists were David Filipov, of The Boston Globe; Marcus
Warren, of The Daily Telegraph in London; Rodrigo Fernandez, of El

in Spain, and Michael Yassukovich, a photographer.

   The government began a $16 million campaign to discourage

JUDGE DENIES BAIL TO SCIENTIST CHARGED WITH MISHANDLING WEAPONS
SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ A federal judge on Wednesday refused to
grant bail to Wen Ho Lee, the government scientist charged with
mishandling nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addressing the central issue in a three-day bail
hearing, the judge said he would reconsider if it could be shown
that Lee told the truth when he said he had destroyed seven missing
computer tapes containing much of the trove of secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, James A. Parker, of District Court, said that he
would have been inclined to free Lee under restrictive home
detention were it not for the grave concerns expressed by a number
of senior government officials that the missing tapes were not
destroyed and could still be passed to a hostile power.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has acknowledged transferring a huge volume of information
about the design, testing and construction of nuclear weapons from
secure to unsecure computers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
where he worked for years, and then downloaded much of the
information onto computer tapes. He has also said he destroyed
seven of those tapes. The remaining three were found by government
officials in his office after Lee was fired in March for security
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted in his decision, on a defense appeal of a
magistrate's earlier refusal to grant bail, that Lee's lawyers have
said the scientist would be willing to submit to a lie detector
test about the missing tapes. Lee was indicted on 59 counts of
having mishandled the secret information, although he was not
charged with espionage or giving anyone else the information. He
has said he is not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have so far refused the offer to conduct a lie
detector test partly, the judge said, because of concerns about the
precise questions that would be asked.
</P>
<P>
   The judge encouraged, but did not order the U.S. attorney here,
John J. Kelly, to try to negotiate a deal for Lee to take the test.
But afterward Kelly was noncommittal and noted that the concerns
that have made an agreement impossible until now had not gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take the judge's counsel concerning these questions,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Holscher, one of Lee's lawyers, said prosecutors had
refused the defense's offer of to have Lee take the polygraph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the decision, Lee showed little reaction but wore a grim
expression as he was immediately led from the courtroom by federal
marshals. He waved briefly to his son and daughter, both of whom
burst into tears in a courtroom more than half filled with his
supporters. His wife said shortly afterward that she would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had also said that Lee was being held in extremely
severe conditions at a jail near here, in Santa Fe, and asked Kelly
to consider easing the restrictions. Lee is in solitary confinement
and can see no one, except his immediate family members and his
lawyers for just one hour a week. Lee, a naturalized U.S. citizen
from Taiwan, is prohibited from speaking Chinese with his family
and a guard must be next to him at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said only that he would consider the judge's request.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have said that a trial might not be held for a year
or more, given the enormously complex nature of the case, so Lee
now faces the prospect of a year's incarceration if he cannot find
some way of answering the court's doubts about what happened to the
computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   One senior government scientist said that the tapes contained
``the crown jewels'' of the American weapons program, an almost
complete description of the physics and practical information
needed to design anything from simple to highly sophisticated
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision came at the end of a hearing that all those
involved said was unlike any other such detention hearing in their
experience. Normally, such hearings are brief, with evidence
offered in summary form and any testimony taken quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But in this instance the judge allowed extensive examination and
cross- examination of a number of witnesses. Since the normal rules
of evidence do not apply to a preliminary hearing, the testimony
ranged widely, involving much speculation and opinion that would
have been excluded in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution was not able to show that Lee gave the secrets
to anyone, only that he had methodically violated security rules in
assembling and downloading it onto unsecure computers, where
hackers or others might have gained access.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examinations, the defense tried to show there could be
benign explanations for Lee's actions and that he had done little
to conceal most of what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, however, never addressed what the judge on
Wednesday said was the most critical issue for Lee, and perhaps the
American weapons program: why he made those tapes, and precisely
what he did with them.

AMERICANS STOCK UP CAUTIOUSLY FOR THE TURN OF THE CENTURY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Colo., Fla, Wash., Ga., Texas, N.Y.)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charlotte White knows something about surviving
the end of the world. As a girl living in England during World War
II, she weathered the German air force's constant barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, she is not taking any chances a computer
glitch will accomplish what the Luftwaffe could not.
</P>
<P>
   Already stocked up on apples, crackers, bottled water and
cheese, Mrs. White, 69, and her husband, Hugh, 80, shopped this
week at a San Francisco camping store for a propane stove to use in
the event of a millennium catastrophe caused by any year 2000
computer glitch. ``If something goes wrong, at least my husband
will have hot soup,'' Mrs. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, people are approaching the computer scare
not with panic but with pragmatism and precaution. Stores report
measured buying, in particular of two basics: water and light (as
in, batteries and flashlights).
</P>
<P>
   The buying patterns, and philosophy suggest a populace preparing
for a hurricane whose force is dwindling. Many sense this man-made
disaster will pass by or never materialize, but they are stocking
up on necessities just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers say they have felt comforted by assurances from
government and corporations, banks in particular, that their
computer systems are ready for the rollover to the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problem is that some computers read dates in only
two digits _ 99 rather than 1999 _ so that at midnight on New
Year's Eve, the computers may process information as if the year is
1900 rather than 2000. Computers and networks that have not been
prepared for the changeover may crash or data may become lost or
scrambled. More dire prophecies warn of widespread power and
computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers still are as unable to quantify the buying
patterns of emergency-related items, but some national chains that
use computer tracking systems validate the anecdotal claims.
</P>
<P>
   At 300 7-Eleven stores in Texas and Florida, sales were up 60
percent for bottled water and 30 percent for batteries from Dec. 20
to Dec. 27, compared with the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some other items were in unusual demand. Compared with a week in
early October, 7-Eleven said sales were up 52 percent for can
openers and 64 percent for candles, presumably not because people
were planning romantic evenings. ``We really do think the
incremental increases are because people are getting prepared,''
said Jim Keyes, chief operating officer of 7-Eleven Inc., which has
5,800 stores in this country and is based in Dallas, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sinegal, president and chief executive of Costco Wholesale
Inc., which operates 220 stores in the United States and is based
in Issaquah, Wash., said sales for water were up 150 percent,
battery sales up slightly, but that canned goods and other
emergency supplies were selling at normal levels. The buying, he
said, ``hasn't hit anything like the panic stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some people are practicing a higher level of caution.
In Athens, Ga., John Myers, 46, a computer animation designer at
the University of Georgia Center for Continuing Education, shopped
for bottled water Wednesday at Harris Teeter, a neighborhood
grocery store, and said he also had stocked up on a water purifier
and duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to use the tape to put over the doorways in
his home ``for security reasons'' and said if things went awry, he
had plans to ``live off the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of guns appear to have risen in some regions. The Colorado
Bureau of Investigation has performed 6,000 more background checks
during December than it did in December 1998, 17,704 compared with
10,997. Dave Anver, owner of Dave's Guns in Denver, said his
business had been booming in the past six weeks. One man, he added,
bought a gun and asked if he could return it after Jan. 1. ``He
said, `What if I fire it off a couple times, and then bring it
back?''' Anver said. ``Only chap I've ever met who wanted to lease
a firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   The official position of the Red Cross of America is that people
should be stock two to three days of emergency supplies, including
a gallon of water per person per day, canned food, food for infants
and the elderly, first-aid kits, flashlights with extra batteries,
money and matches kept in waterproof containers.
</P>
<P>
   In a study released this month, PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated
that consumers would spend $14 billion stocking up for possible
problems. Some retailers say they have been surprised by heavy
sales.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany County, N.Y., Phillips Ace Hardware Stores reported
unusually strong demand for kerosene lamps, lamp oil, batteries and
flashlights. At B.J.'s Wholesale Club in the Albany, N.Y.-suburb of
Colonie, the emphasis has been on water.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Korszun, a forklife operator, pointed out that 23 pallets
of bottled water stacked in the afternoon had been whittled down to
three pallets. ``If you go down our cereal aisle, it's beat up
bad,'' Korszun said. ``Empty, empty, empty. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   At Home Depot in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, N.Y., workers
reported brisk brisk sales of flashlights, lanterns and ``Y2K
Emergency Kits,'' a $16.88 packages that include lanterns,
flashlights, radios and Red Cross checklists of what to do in case
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   One Brooklyn resident, Maryse Pearra, 37, said that in addition
to buying ``everything _ water, juice and canned food,'' she knew
precisely how she'll handle New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be home that night hiding under the blanket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But those experiences are not universal, either for businesses
or consumers. Some business owners around the country said they had
increased inventories to cater to demand but were disappointed with
the returns. The reason may be that many consumers say that while
they want to be minimally prepared for a millennium bug, they think
it will come with a whimper, not a bang.

PATRIOTS, MANAGEMENT PLAYING BY DARWIN'S RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There is chaos now in the front office and
on the sideline of the New England Patriots. They have become a sad
joke, little men scrambling on their knees to save face or their
job as their team dissolves into the laughingstock it was for years
before Bill Parcells came to town.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, coach Pete Carroll had a closed-door meeting
with his team, in which he urged his players to play hard and play
with pride in the final two meaningless weeks of the season despite
being out of the playoff race for the first time since 1995. To
most of them, it sounded like a valedictory speech. A last hurrah
by a man who knew his time in New England was short.
</P>
<P>
   Several days earlier, a sheet of paper hung in each man's
locker. On it was a parable urging them to ``hold the rope,'' an
oddly timed appeal for teamwork since they had just hung themselves
individually the day before in an embarrassing loss to the lowly
Philadelphia Eagles that ended their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Carroll told Terry Glenn to stay home for the Buffalo
game after Glenn declined to attend a Saturday night meeting at the
team hotel. After that game and again the next day, Carroll said
Glenn had been sent home because he had the flu. There was no
mention of any violations of team rules then, even though Glenn had
made a habit of violating those rules over the previous three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Carroll reiterated that explanation despite the fact
Glenn had now refused to show up as ordered twice for the trainer
to assess his medical condition. Glenn would decline to check in
again on Tuesday as well, leading Carroll to finally suspend him
Wednesday for the season's final game, a case of, as Bruce
Armstrong put it, ``locking the door after the horse's been stolen
and somebody burned the barn to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   During the course of his regular Monday press conference,
Carroll was also asked if he thought he'd be retained next season.
It was not a subject he had much of an opinion on beyond stating
the obvious, which was that the owner would do what he was going to
do when he did it ``but two weeks is a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the two weeks he was left dangling in
the wind last season while he was being ``evaluated'' by upper
management before he was finally told he could stay if he fired
somebody, which he did when he let line coach Paul Boudreau go.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Carroll wasn't the only guy talking. Vice president of
personnel Bobby Grier went on a club-sanctioned radio talk show to
defend the indefensible, claiming his draft picks had been fine the
last three years and the only problem was that the coaches hadn't
played them enough.
</P>
<P>
   He went so far as to insist that Chris Canty was taken on the
first round to be a nickel back, a position he now plays in
Seattle. The very clear implication was that if Carroll and his
staff had just done a little coaching, those draft picks would now
be going to the Pro Bowl and none of the mess that today sits in
Foxborough would exist.
</P>
<P>
   Grier made the same statements in the Globe Wednesday, and
Wednesday night told Mike Lynch of Channel 5, ``there's plenty of
talent on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, Grier called in defensive coordinator Steve
Sidwell and upbraided him for having said publicly he was
disappointed in the play of another of Grier's No. 1 draft picks,
cornerback Tebucky Jones. By then Jones had been removed from the
nickel and dime packages for his often shaky play. The following
Sunday Jones was back, and last week Sidwell said he was happy with
his progress.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Wednesday, Grier met with Globe football writer Nick
Cafardo to again defend his picks. During that conversation Grier
said he didn't know a thing about what everyone was now talking
about, which was Carroll's decision to suspend Glenn for the final
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:53 p.m., Carroll was asked if he had talked to Grier about
his move before he did the deed and he said he and Grier were on
the same page but added, ``This was really my decision.'' Carroll
had no comment when asked if he was surprised Grier had said he
knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:57 p.m., just after the press conference ended with a no
comment from Carroll on whether Grier had told the truth when he
told the Globe he didn't know about the suspension, Grier and
Carroll came tearing out of Grier's office with Carroll steaming
because this reporter had said he talked to Grier when it had
actually been Cafardo. In these parts, the Globe is seen as one
entity on such matters and I had been waiting outside in the
parking lot for Carroll to head to practice to confirm the
suspension while Cafardo talked with Grier.
</P>
<P>
   This type of effort on a breaking story only cryptically being
discussed by the Patriots' brass requires cooperation, something
that has all but disappeared in Foxborough in recent weeks. It has
been replaced there by social Darwinism.
</P>
<P>
   It is survival of the fittest now, a time when you hear the
coach didn't play the young players, and one minute the director of
football operations doesn't know anything about a suspension and
the next it was a group dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   With each new act, Carroll and Grier have been writing their own
resignation letters if owner Bob Kraft has the stomach to read
them.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, Carroll finally takes the tough stand he should
have made months ago with Glenn and comes away looking like Jake La
Motta in ``Raging Bull,'' after the Ray Robinson fight when he
stood bloody and beaten but screaming, ``You didn't put me down
Ray. You didn't put me down'' as Glenn's teammates shake their
heads in bewilderment and disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, Grier goes from ``The Silent Man'' to the author of
``Advertisements for Myself'' as the pressure on him mounts,
quietly stabbing his coaches in the back along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is the way Kraft wants his organization run. One
doubts it, but perhaps he feels chaos and backstabbing and everyone
having his own agenda is the way to do business once the ship takes
on water. Certainly it's the way they used to do it before he got
here.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he thinks it more important to have a head coach who is
better at dinner conversation than communicating with his team.
Perhaps he thinks it didn't undermine that coach's authority to
repeatedly have some of his players backdoor him by running
upstairs to see the man they call ``B.G.'' time and again when they
had complaints.
</P>
<P>
   When one veteran receiver was recently asked who he went to when
he had something on his mind, he responded, ``B.G.'' without even
thinking twice about it. When asked if he didn't think that
undermined his coach, he said he'd never thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   So now, as chaos reigns again in Foxborough, Kraft must ask
himself these questions: He needs to ask himself if he wants Jake
La Motta or Ray Robinson on the sideline leading his team. He needs
to ask himself if he thinks the Green Bay Packers call Ron Wolf
``R.W.'' or the Denver Broncos bypass Mike Shanahan to go tell
their troubles to John Beake or Neal Dahlen. He needs to ask
himself if Jim Mora would suspend Marvin Harrison before he told
Bill Polian about it or if Polian would go on local radio and TV
and try to cover himself by saying Mora didn't play his draft picks
often enough for them to develop into the great players he knows
they are.
</P>
<P>
   After he gets the answers to those questions, he'll know what
needs to be done next in Foxborough. Then all he has to do is ask
himself if he has the courage to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, he has only one question left to ask: ``Anybody
got Victor Kiam's home number?''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The work of creating one of the world's biggest
parties continued hurriedly in Times Square on Wednesday. The
Waterford crystal ball that will kick off the millennium did a
practice drop or two, glittering like daytime stars in the
afternoon sun. Sound technicians hooked up 54 speakers over a dozen
square blocks for a 26-hour concert, while electricians threaded
cables so that 45 newscasters could come to you live on New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   News crews videotaped the throngs of tourists and tourists
videotaped news crews, in the ultimate validation that something
big, communal and self-fulfilling was happening there.
</P>
<P>
   Over all the bustle, there was even one mechanism in place to
bring order, if necessary, to the 2 million people expected to
crowd into Times Square on Friday night. In a modular trailer
sitting on top of another at 44th Street, technicians made sure
speakers would be ready to sound in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the VOG system, what we call the voice of God,'' said
Michael Mordente, an audio engineer with Maryland Sound
International. ``It's all run on a generator.'' So in case danger
crashes the party, there will be a way to tell everyone to proceed
home, slowly. Even if the lights go out.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were working in Times Square on Wednesday to
prepare for the arrival of enough guests to populate a small
nation. A cherry picker was used to replace the burned-out lights
on One Times Square. And metal garbage cans were to be pulled off
the sidewalks, to be replaced by cardboard ones, which were deemed
less likely to be sabotaged by terrorists. The cardboard versions
will hold, among other things, the bottles confiscated by police
officers enforcing the city's no-open-bottle policy.
</P>
<P>
   The talent was arriving Wednesday, too. Michael Curry, a
puppeteer who worked on ``The Lion King,'' brought 160 puppets from
Portland, Ore., to be carried through Times Square on poles by 500
puppeteers, mostly volunteers. They will parade hourly, beginning
at 6:30 a.m., depicting whichever time zone is celebrating midnight
at that point.
</P>
<P>
   (``Yeah, they've got a lot of fish,'' said Jan Wootten, a
spokeswoman for the Times Square 2000 celebration. Hours one
through six of the celebration will mark midnight over Pacific time
zones.)
</P>
<P>
   The puppets, made of carbon fiber, fiberglass and aluminum
frames, will dance down a lane kept clear by the police, and will
be a few feet above the heads of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A storefront on 41st Street served as a temporary headquarters
for Curry's puppeteers. Boxes of Toasti Toes and Hot-Hands,
footwarmers and handwarmers, stood near clothing racks of black
costumes printed with suns, stars and moons. Another row of water
bottles lined the back wall.
</P>
<P>
   James Cariot, who works for DSG Productions, gave a brief tour
of the room while his walkie-talkie crackled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mike Curry people need 50 more sandbags,'' a woman's voice
announced over the walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have 50,'' a man's voice answered. ``What does he
need them for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid the puppets will fly away,'' the woman
explained.
</P>
<P>
   A request for two mountain bikes was followed by assurances that
someone was working on it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During one hour, in which midnight reaches 27 countries at once,
Curry will have to lasso in eight banners depicting faces of people
who live in those places. He was not sure which hour that would be,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't slept,'' he said. ``I took a nap later this morning.
Or earlier this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Midnight in New York will be celebrated with a parade of puppets
representing the world's cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said he had wanted to bring what he called his puppetry
and pageantry to Times Square for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all this conjecture about Y2K, all the disruptions we may
have, I want this to be uplifting, and to create a positive
feeling,'' he said. ``It's a perfect audience waiting for a
performance to happen.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Party? What Party?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine working in a big high-rise, glass windows forever, in
the center of the millennial universe, Times Square. And what could
be better than a big catered party, with deep corporate pockets
keeping the champagne flowing as the ball drops into the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Conde Nast party at Four Times Square? ``None whatsoever,''
said a company spokeswoman, Maurie Perl. The company closed at 1
p.m. Wednesday, Ms. Perl said, and will not reopen until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The plans at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, at 1585 Broadway,
sounds like even less fun. ``That building will be closed at 3
p.m.,'' a spokeswoman said. ``We are operating a communications and
command center over the event weekend which is off-site, and will
link together all of our business centers through the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A soiree at the media conglomerate Bertelsmann Inc. at 1540
Broadway? That office is already closed, and no employees could be
reached for comment Wednesday.

   Setting the Stage
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hale has designed stage sets for off-Broadway shows and
outdoor concerts, but nothing has been as hard on his nerves as
building a stage in Times Square for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in a war because you have to think about your
environment all the time,'' said Hale, 34, a production carpenter
from Rahway, N.J., who has been hammering and sawing nearly nonstop
for the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could get hit on the head or run over if you're not
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale and his crew were dodging cars and pedestrians Wednesday
afternoon as they unloaded sheets of plywood from a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, he said, that would be a simple task. But in Times
Square, nothing is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned a certain area of Times Square into a parking
lot,'' he said a bit anxiously as drivers honked and traffic came
to a halt around him.
</P>
<P>
   Hale and his crew are building a suitably grand stage from which
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Dr. Mary Ann Hopkins, a surgeon who
volunteers with Doctors Without Borders, can push the button to
drop the New Year's Eve ball on Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The steel-and-plywood monolith _ weighing 58,000 pounds _
stretches 100 feet along Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets,
and rises more than 35 feet in the air. There are wide white steps
at each end, flamingo-pink arches, and more than 70 spotlights
moving overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But do not be deceived by the fanciful touches. The sturdy stage
is intended to withstand wind gusts of 70 miles per hour, and
nearly everything is strapped down with steel cables.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a blustery mayor could blow this stage down.
</P>

   Looking For The Deal Of The Millennium
</P>
<P>
   It may have been three days before the big countdown, but
Anthony Mack was not taking any chances with his van-load of New
Year's party accouterment.
</P>
<P>
   He staked out a patch of pavement on Broadway and 43rd Street,
unfolded his rickety card table and set out boxes of noisemakers,
plastic fedoras, and paper blow-outs, all of them screaming
``Millennium 2000.'' He was, by the look of things, the first such
entrepreneur to appear in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   With a $1,641 investment at stake, Mack said he was prompted to
come out early by a bout of premillennial jitters. ``Everything has
got to go before Friday night,'' he said, keeping a wary eye on the
double-parked van he rented for the occassion. ``It's not like I
can sell this stuff next year.''
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned street vendor who normally hawks shish kebabs, Eskimo
pies and kosher hot dogs, Mack, 43, said he had been dreaming of
this sales event for years. ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, an unending river of tourists and office workers
flowed by. Some rolled their eyes, bemused by his early showing,
while others loaded up on $5 party hats and $1 foil horns, a
considerable markup from what Mack paid for his merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy tonight and you'll save,'' he shouted to the crowd. ``The
early bird gets the worm.''
</P>
<P>
   If his bullish projections pan out, Mack hopes to make between
$15,000 and $18,000 in the next two days, enough to buy himself a
truck. But he knows unseen forces might interfere with his profits.
``My biggest worry is that I might not be allowed to sell here on
Friday,'' he said. ``I just want to finish by 7 or 8, so I can go
home and watch the ball drop on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, as if on cue, a pair of policemen approached his van
and ordered him to move it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always tomorrow,'' Mack said, as he packed up his
merchandise and headed home. ``There's always tomorrow.''

GLENN TO FIGHT SUSPENSION BY CARROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Terry Glenn was suspended by Patriots coach
Pete Carroll Wednesday for violating team policies, but the wide
receiver plans to fight the suspension in time to play Sunday
against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carroll, Glenn was suspended for not showing up for
a meeting at the team hotel at the Milford Radisson Saturday night
and for not showing up Monday and Tuesday for treatment for his
flu.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gould, Glenn's agent, said it's all hogwash and he's asking
for an expedited arbitration hearing that could get Glenn back on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incomprehensible it's come to this level,'' said Gould
from his Cincinnati home. ``Terry is 47 yards shy of being the
(Patriots') second all-time leading receiver in a season. He did
everything he was told to do. He had one bad day (on Thanksgiving)
after doing everything asked of him all year, and did not take
himself out of the game (Sunday against Buffalo), the club did.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday night he still had a 102-degree temperature. He
took his medicine, that the team doctors prescribed for a
respiratory infection, slept, and called the team the next day to
say he wanted to play even with a temperature of 101. This nonsense
of not wanting to play is a trumped-up charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry has been speaking to (trainer) Ron O'Neil the whole
time. He checked with Ron on Tuesday and Ron told him he didn't
have to come in and he was told to show up Wednesday morning, which
is exactly what Terry did.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who took a lot of criticism from teammates for not
showing up Sunday, came in Wednesday morning and immediately met
with Carroll and was informed of his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a series of team guidelines that I asked Terry to
take care of and that was to show up Saturday night at the hotel so
we could take care of him so he would be all right for Sunday. He
didn't do that,'' said Carroll. ``On Sunday, we told him to stay
home because he was sick. He didn't make it for that and then on
Monday his unwillingness to come in and allow us to check up on him
and again on Tuesday showed a lack of willingness to communicate on
the whole issue. The timing is that he's not with the right
attitude to be with us this week. It's unfortunate but that's the
way it is. It wasn't any one thing. It was a number of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, asked what Glenn's reaction was said, ``Not much of a
reaction. (Glenn) internalized it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Carroll spoke to the team about the punishment levied on
Glenn. Carroll said he and Glenn have spoken on a number of issues
in their three years together. ``This is an attitude situation that
wasn't right. We've worked together on a lot of situations over the
years. This one just came at the wrong time,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said he talked to vice president of personnel Bobby Grier
three times on Tuesday to tell Grier that Glenn not only wanted to
play last Sunday, but that he was ready to return to practice
Wednesday and play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It does not appear that Carroll and Grier are on the same page
regarding the discipline though Carroll said they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do a darned thing wrong,'' said Gould. ``I told
Terry to report to practice at 1 p.m. and the team told him to go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould said that the union will use Tom DePaso to defend Glenn at
the hearing. The problem with this expedited hearing is that the
union and management council arbiter have to meet in Boston prior
to New Year's Day, which could be a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   After Glenn met with Carroll, he walked to his car in spot No.
130 at 1:33 p.m. trailing Patriots public relations director Stacey
James, who carried his locker belongings in a green trash bag which
he placed in the back seat of Glenn's Range Rover. Glenn, wearing a
yellow leather jacket, a cap, and sunglasses, got into his car and
left without speaking to the media, which had gathered behind a
chain-link fence hoping he would say something.
</P>
<P>
   Players always have team meetings at a designated team hotel on
Saturday when they're home. The Patriots' team hotel is the Milford
Radisson. Glenn had been excused from practice on Friday because of
the flu and was also excused from the team's walk-through Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's point was, if Glenn was excused, why would he have to go
to the team hotel? ``We're fighting this with everything we've
got,'' said Gould. ``This isn't right. It comes out of the blue.
Terry gave every indication that he wanted to play Sunday despite
his sickness. He gave every indication he wanted to practice
Wednesday and both times he was told no.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould was not notified of the suspension by letter, so he has no
idea whether there's money involved. If there is, it appears that
Glenn will lose a week's pay. The wide receiver was to be paid
$2.66 million with bonuses this season. His base salary is $1.84
million, so a game check is worth about $115,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what this guy (Carroll) is doing,'' said Gould.
``Is he trying to make an example out of Terrry, when indeed Terry
wants to play?''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe said: ``I think Terry can be a
great player. And I will remain true to him forever. I care about
him as a person. And I think he can be an excellent player.
Obviously he's got (some maturing to do). He's run into some bumps
in the road, but he can be one of the best who ever played the
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had a tough Thanksgiving. After a team function the night
before, a Dorchester woman accused him of groping her in a Saugus
nightclub parking lot. On Thanksgiving morning, he was stopped for
speeding and driving to endanger through the streets of Walpole,
then was three hours late for a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent countless hours with Pete (Carroll) trying to make
this relationship as strong as possible. This is out of the blue.
He's singling Terry out and in this case, it's not fair,'' said
Gould.

FANS' VIEWS MIXED ON RAPPER'S ARREST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Max Julian, 14, and Mario Thatcher, 13, stood on a
Bronx street corner Tuesday and pondered Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nice guy,'' Max, who is from Queens, said of the
producer and rapper Sean Combs, who was arrested on weapons
possessions charges this week after a loaded gun was found in his
car as he and his entourage fled a shooting at a Times Square dance
club early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not like most rappers that bring guns,'' said Mario, who
lives in the Edenwald section of the Bronx. ``He sings mostly good
lyrics _ good lyrics for the kids,'' Mario added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hardly sings about violence,'' Max said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sings about love,'' Mario said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's innocent,'' Max said. ``His face, when I saw him
on the news, said, `I didn't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It would be an exaggeration to say that Puff Daddy, who was
released late Monday on $10,000 bail, was the talk of the streets
this week. Many other rappers, some more popular than Combs, have
had brushes with the law recently. Earlier this month, for example,
Jay Z, whose name is on far more young lips these days, was charged
with stabbing a record promoter at the Kit Kat Klub, also in Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   But there were plenty of young people in the Bronx and in Harlem
over the past two days who were willing to offer opinions about
Combs as icon, as role model, as criminal defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Many offered an outraged defense of Combs, either because they
believed he was singled out for being an ultrasuccessful black man
or because they were dazzled at his celebrity. Some pointed out
that there was no proof that the gun found in his car as he fled
with his entourage _ including the actress and singer Jennifer
Lopez _ was his. Others said that in the context of urban culture,
in which success is resented as well as admired, it was not
surprising that Combs, like many rappers, would carry a gun. (Jamal
Barrow, a protege of Combs who is accused of firing his own gun in
the nightclub and wounding three people early Monday, was being
held on attempted murder charges Wednesday on $35,000 bail.)
</P>
<P>
   From others, there was a wagging finger for Combs, whose record
label, Bad Boy Entertainment, produces and promotes his and other
rap artists' albums. And from some, there was an indifferent shrug,
a lack of interest in his fate corresponding to a lack of appetite
for his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fake hard-core,'' said Washington Santana, 17, of Harlem,
explaining why the tabloid headlines about Puff Daddy left him
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews, both for Combs' music and his arrest, were mixed
outside the Edenwald Houses in the Bronx. ``He's all right, but not
all that,'' said Everton Sterling, 16, a resident of the housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, Nailah Hinton and Samantha Castro, both 8, were on
inline skates, taking a sidewalk by storm. Their smiles illuminated
the gray day, and their comments were those of Puffy loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got mad at the police,'' Nailah said of the arrest, ``'cause
Puff Daddy would never do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha added, ``I think someone put the gun in his car _ I
don't think Puffy or Jennifer Lopez would ever do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Combs did have a gun, Jemeal Johnson, 14, said, but for
good reason. ``He's probably got a gun because he knows how people
are,'' Jemeal said. ``They're jealous when their friends got money
and they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Magali Ramirez, 36, who also lives in the Edenwald projects,
said: ``There are a lot of player-haters out there.'' Players are
those, like Combs, who have made it to the top and flaunt it.
Player-haters are the nobodies who resent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be allowed to walk around with a gun,'' said Ms.
Ramirez, a police clerk in the Bronx. ``The guy's got millions _
he's got to protect what's his.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, she believed that Combs should not have gone to
Club New York, the nightclub. ``There are so many low-status people
there,'' Ms. Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Hines, 18, newly arrived in Harlem from Minnesota, was
more critical. ``A lot of people look up to him _ black, white,
kids,'' she said of Combs. ``He needs to do a better job of being a
role model.''

HISPANICS SAY SHOOTING WAS A DOUBLE LOSS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLYOKE, Mass. _ The shots allegedly fired by Eddie Morales last
week not only took the life of Officer John DiNapoli, Latino
leaders say; they also threw the city into mourning for a popular
officer.
</P>
<P>
   And, in less visible ways, those shots have damaged the fragile
relationship between the Puerto Rican community and other
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 27, was in the spotlight Wednesday as he pleaded not
guilty to charges of first-degree murder in Holyoke District Court.
Dozens of city police officers and friends of DiNapoli packed the
courtroom to watch the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's Latino community took notice, too. Leaders in the
community said the accused was a relative newcomer with a checkered
past and a fearsome presence that made his neighbors eye him
warily.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, DiNapoli, 52, was well known, with deep friendships
in the Latino community. Neighborhood women now tend the shrine on
the streetcorner where the shooting happened. In a nearby
convenience store, where Spanish is spoken as much as English, a
velona _ a candle in a tall glass pillar _ burns on the counter,
DiNapoli's picture pasted on the front.
</P>
<P>
   But in the hours after the shooting, the massive manhunt for
Morales spurred resentment against police, community leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Though police searched every road in and out of town, they
focused on Hispanic neighborhoods, circling helicopters, leading
dogs through buildings and stopping any man who looked Latino,
sometimes more than once.
</P>
<P>
   The search ``created a feeling of being singled out, a feeling
that their rights were being trampled somewhat,'' said Carlos Vega,
executive director of Nueva Esperanza, a community development
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was terrible, Esperanza said. On the brink of a new
century, the city had elected a new mayor and was making strides
toward harmony. Now, the process of recovery, many say, will not be
easy. And many say Morales, if guilty, is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man, who is not part of our community, left us with this
mess,'' said Betty Medina Lichtenstein, executive director of the
social service agency Enlace de Familias.
</P>
<P>
   Morales had an apartment in town and his mother once lived here,
but he did not belong to the city's close-knit network of Puerto
Ricans, who began migrating here in the 1950s and now make up at
least a third of the population, Lichtenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy transition, she said. The Puerto Rican
population began growing just as factories were leaving and jobs
became scarce. The years that followed have sometimes been rife
with ethnic tension, crime, and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But the community has recently inched toward recovery.
Government grants have been used to fight drugs and replace
decrepit public housing with clean, affordable homes, Lichtenstein
and Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Latino population has become a part of Holoyke's fabric.
Latinos make up nearly three-quarters of the students in Holyoke
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Latino families shared in the mourning for DiNapoli,
who died in Churchill, a neighborhood edging toward renewal. The
feeling toward Morales is far colder, community leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Their coalition urged Morales to surrender and guaranteed his
safety, but most Latinos ``are conscious of what he has done and
that he must pay for it,'' said the Rev. Miguel A. Cruz of the
Pentecostal Church Ebenezer Assemblies of God, a Spanish-speaking
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The intent, Lichtenstein said, was to ``send a very clear
message to the rest of the community'' that violence would not be
tolerated from anyone. ``We were sticking together to say, `You
need to come in.' . . . There's a price to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cruz and Lichtenstein said the city must acknowledge that
Latinos were upset about the search and communicate with residents
to learn why.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something happens like this, we all suffer,'' she said.
``When we lose like this, we lose together.''
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Morales was virtually alone: No visible
supporters or family members were there for the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said nothing as a judge ordered him held without bail,
and prosecutor Joan Lynch said the defendant had admitted knowing
that he had fired at a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   In Scranton, Pa., where Morales was captured, police said he
told them he thought DiNapoli was someone he had been arguing with.
The officer, who volunteered to help break up a fight, was chasing
Morales in an unmarked police car.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ellenberg, Morales' court-appointed attorney, said he is
weighing several defense strategies, but will consider arguing that
his client acted in self-defense. He also said that Morales feels
remorseful about DiNapoli's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sad,'' Ellenberg said. ``He feels bad about all of this
that's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing Wednesday, DiNapoli's daughter, Jobeth, 25,
couldn't bring herself to say Morales' name at an impromptu news
conference outside the courthouse. Yet she said she isn't angry at
the man accused of killing her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for this man,'' she said. ``He obviously never had
a John DiNapoli in his life, because if he did, this would never
have happened.''

OLAJUWON'S BROTHER FILES LAWSUIT OVER DENNY'S FRANCHISES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Akinola Olajuwon, the brother of Houston Rockets
basketball star Hakeem Olajuwon, has filed a lawsuit claiming that
an Arizona company is attempting to defraud him out of 71 Denny's
franchises he bought in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   Akinola Olajuwon, 36, left investment banking in 1994 to open
his first Denny's franchise. He is now the second-largest owner of
Denny's franchises in the country, with a total of 85.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Harris County state district court lawsuit that
Olajuwon filed Friday, Phoenix, Ariz.-based Phoenix Restaurant
Group sold Olajuwon 71 franchises in the spring of 1998 with the
promise that each restaurant was in good condition. Olajuwon's
attorney, Russ Abney, said his client borrowed $29 million to buy
the franchise rights, lease rights and furniture at the
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings and land are owned by landlords at the various
locations, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Olajuwon allegedly discovered after the sale that 14 of
the restaurants were in such poor condition that they could not be
operated without extensive repairs. According to the lawsuit, some
of these restaurants were closed and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon said in his suit that he ``temporarily fell behind'' on
the rent payments for most of these restaurants that were
temporarily closed. Abney said this is because the restaurants
generated no income while they were being repaired.
</P>
<P>
   He said Olajuwon was two months behind on the rent payments for
10 restaurants and three months behind for two restaurants. The
lawyers said the delinquent rent, totaling $150,000, was paid in
full earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Phoenix Restaurant Group was not the landlord at the
restaurant sites, it claimed it had the right to take back all 71
restaurants because of the late rent payments and keep the $29
million initial payment. Of the restaurants, 22 are in Ohio, 14 are
in Kentucky, eight are in Texas, seven are in Alabama, and the rest
are in eight other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see this as an opportunity to take the $29 million and
take back the profitable stores,'' Abney said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Phoenix Restaurant Group did not return a call
from the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit included a copy of a Dec. 23 letter from Jack Lloyd,
chief executive officer at Phoenix Restaurant Group, asking
Olajuwon to ``peacefully and immediately turn over to us possession
of the restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon filed the lawsuit the next day. State District Judge
Brent Gamble signed a temporary restraining order Friday preventing
the Arizona company from taking any action at least until a further
hearing on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said that all the landlords are supportive of
Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to keeping ownership of the franchises, Olajuwon is
seeking unspecified actual and exemplary damages against Phoenix
Restaurant Group.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has said that he saw a great opportunity to invest in
the Denny's chain because of the bad publicity it received over
alleged discrimination against black customers.
</P>
<P>
   After Denny's settled a $45.7 million racial discrimination
lawsuit in 1994, Olajuwon felt the company would strongly support
his ownership efforts because he is black.

SCHWAB EXPECTING RECORD PROFIT FOR FINAL QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The invasion of the full-service brokers doesn't seem to be
slowing Charles Schwab Corp. so far.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, now the leading online brokerage firm, said Wednesday
that the first quarter in which it faced head-on competition from
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter will be its most
profitable quarter ever. The San Francisco-based Schwab expects to
earn $162 million to $171 million, or 19 cents to 20 cents a share,
in the quarter that ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a penny or two a share more than any analyst
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected, and 2 to 3
cents a share higher than their average estimate of 17 cents a
share. Schwab rose $5.8125, or 17.1 percent, Wednesday to $39.75 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that no one is interrupting their momentum,'' said
Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., who has been
recommending Schwab's stock to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have taken dead aim at Schwab
with recent introductions of online trading services for the same
$29.95 commission that Schwab charges. Strauss said he does not
think that those competitors pose immediate threats to Schwab's
growth, but other analysts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firm's chief financial officer, Chris Dodds,
attributed its better-than-expected performance to a surprisingly
active stock market this quarter, especially in December, when some
thought that trading would decrease as the end of the century
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, who is not
recommending purchase of the Schwab stock, said the brokerage
firm's increases in commission revenue should not have come as a
big surprise. ``We know the Nasdaq has been going bananas,''
Moszkowski said. ``And the New York Stock Exchange has been no
slouch either.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of several other online brokerage firms also jumped
Wednesday as investors recognized that robust trading should
benefit all firms that derive much of their revenue from
commissions. The ETrade Group rose $2.75, to $28.50; TD Waterhouse
gained $1.8125, to $17.125, and Ameritrade Holdings closed up
$2.875, to $23.375.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds said Schwab earned commissions in December on an average
of 236,000 trades a day, its highest rate ever. About 80 percent of
those trades were placed electronically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the Y2K situation, there was a little bit more
uncertainty than normal,'' Dodds went on. But as the year drew near
an end, it became clear that Schwab would again show a rate of
growth in customer assets that its competitors and some analysts
have called unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab now holds more than $700 billion in customer assets, a
gain exceeding 40 percent from the end of 1998, Dodds said. The
company has opened more than 1.3 million accounts for the second
straight year, giving it in excess of 6 million accounts held by
about 5 million clients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was gains like those for several consecutive years that
caused traditional brokers like Merrill Lynch to take notice. The
final slap came a year ago, when Schwab's stock market value
surpassed Merrill Lynch's.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Schwab is considered a direct competitor to the
biggest brokerage firms. After all, analysts say, each of them is
trying to gather as many customers and investment assets as fast as
it can.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Schwab has been doing that with a much lower cost
structure than the full-service firms have. Unlike Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley and Salomon Smith Barney, a Citigroup unit, Schwab
does not have an army of stockbrokers on its payroll. But it does
have a network of 320 branches to support, a financial burden that
pure online brokers like ETrade do not have to shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's combination of electronic technology and personal
service has become the model for the entire financial services
industry. But, some analysts wonder how Schwab will distinguish
itself once that model is replicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some concerns about Schwab's ability, over the
next year or so, to cope with some of the competitive responses
that their success has generated,'' Moszkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he would not underestimate the ability of
Schwab's management to continue to reinvent the firm's business
model. ``They have always figured out a path that has been
successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other analysts said that even though they believed Schwab
would continue to grow, they questioned why investors placed a much
higher value on the firm's shares than on those of Morgan Stanley
and other successful securities firms. Shares of Schwab have been
selling for as much as 50 times per-share earnings, compared with a
multiple of about 15 for some of its traditional competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that this is about as good as it gets'' for
Schwab and other brokerage firms that cater to individual, or
``retail,'' investors, said Steve Galbraith, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein. ``All the stars are clearly aligned right now
in retail land.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors came rushing back into the market in the
last few months of the year, buying shares of mutual funds and
bidding up prices of a small number of technology stocks. All the
trading pushed the stock market indexes to record high after record
high.
</P>
<P>
   The question, analysts say, is, what happens to shares of Schwab
and other online brokers when the markets cool off?
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Dodds said, Schwab's managers are confident that
``the things we have to offer investors are going to enable us to
keep growing at this rate.''

BOEING SETS RECORD, DELIVERS 620 PLANES IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. ended its year with bang Wednesday,
delivering a record 620 airplanes as promised and landing another
$300 million airplane order.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing handed the last four airplanes to Bavaria International,
a German leasing company, Wednesday, according to John Kvasnosky, a
Boeing spokesperson. In doing so, Boeing achieved its target for
number of planes delivered during 1999 and beat its old record, set
last year, by 57 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The record stands in stark contrast to Boeing's performance two
years ago, when an effort to ramp up production created bottlenecks
and other problems and forced some customers to wait for their
multi-million dollar airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the world's largest airplane manufacturer has untangled
many of the knots and released a steady stream of strong financial
data, according to analysts. In the third quarter alone, Boeing
posted profits of $477 million, 37 percent higher than during the
same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been surprised from what the anticipation was a
year-and-a-half ago,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst for JSA
Research. But ``it became apparent they were going to do it
(deliver 620 airplanes) with relative ease.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said the deliveries were the last of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's other news Wednesday was something of a belated
Christmas present: an order from Air Berlin for six 737-800s worth
roughly $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was a positive ending for a mediocre year for Boeing. For the
first time in the history of the Seattle-based company rival Airbus
Industrie logged more orders. Overall, Boeing won 386 commercial
airplane orders (as of Wednesday), while Airbus landed 417 orders
as of Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The production snags also haven't totally disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing temporarily halted delivery of some planes
in November after discovering substandard cockpit insulation
strips.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month the Federal Aviation Administration began
an extensive audit of Boeing's manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several financial analysts downplayed the company's most
recent troubles as relatively minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a minor production issue that is getting a lot
of play,' said James Kawai, an analyst at Neuberger &AMP; Berman, a New
York-based investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kawai and others gave Alan Mulally, head of Boeing's Commercial
Airplanes Group, much of the credit for the smooth delivery
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management systems that are now in effect give him far
more information of progress or lack of it, as the case may be,
than was the case with his predecessor,'' JSA's Nisbet said,
providing one example of the changes Boeing has made.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet also praised chief financial officer Debby Hopkins, who
has implemented a variety of changes, including creating new ways
to measure the company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   And the company should have an even easier time reaching its
goal next year, when it plans to deliver 480 airplanes, Kawai said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a piece a cake,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Hijackers holding 154 hostages in an Indian
Airlines jet at an airport in Afghanistan dropped demands Wednesday
that India hand over $200 million and the body of a slain militant,
Afghan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the hijackers continued to insist that India release a
jailed Pakistani Muslim cleric and 35 other people whom the Indian
government considers terrorists opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Afghanistan's ruling militia, the Taliban _
itself a fundamentalist Muslim group that has been criticized for
harboring terrorists _ impressed on the hijackers that they had
violated the conditions of landing in Afghanistan by adding the
demands for money and the body, the Taliban's foreign minister,
Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, told reporters Wednesday in Kandahar, the
Afghan city where the plane is parked.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly important role played by the Taliban in efforts
to end the six-day-old hostage crisis became even more intriguingly
apparent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like most countries, India does not have diplomatic relations
with the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan and have been
aggressively seeking international recognition as the country's
legitimate government. But Indian officials continued to praise the
Taliban effusively Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taliban continues to play an extremely cooperative and
constructive role,'' India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said
at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Indian officials were noncommittal about whether they
would be willing to make a deal with the hijackers and free some of
the jailed militants. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan
minimized the significance of the hijackers' decision to reduce
their demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the demands in totality,'' Mahajan said after a
cabinet meeting. ``We are not counting the number of demands or the
number of people they want us to release.''
</P>
<P>
   India's kind words for the Taliban may not buy its cooperation
indefinitely. Muttawakil seemed to be telling India not too subtly
Wednesday that it needed to compromise with the hijackers, and
quickly, to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the two sides are unable to solve their problems soon, the
Taliban will force the hijackers to leave Afghanistan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages' terrifying odyssey began last Friday, when five or
six hijackers took control of the plane during a scheduled flight
from Katmandu, Nepal, to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has come in for vituperative criticism
from newspapers and relatives of some hostages, most of whom are
Indian citizens, for the lax security measures that allowed the
hijackers, apparently armed with grenades, pistols and knives, to
board the plane.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government has also been taken to task for allowing the
plane to leave India after landing in the northern Indian city of
Amritsar. On Wednesday officials released excerpts of exchanges
between the pilot and air traffic controllers that they said
explained the decision to allow the plane to proceed on to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcripts, the pilot said _ mistakenly as it
turned out _ that the hijackers had AK-47s and had already killed
four people and would kill more unless the plane was allowed to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   From Pakistan, the plane flew to the United Arab Emirates, where
27 hostages were released and the body of a passenger who had been
killed was unloaded. The plane then landed in Kandahar on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers have said that they want the Pakistani Muslim
cleric, 31-year-old Masood Azhar, and 35 others jailed in India
released. Azhar, a leader of Harakat ul-Ansar, a group that is on
the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations, was
active in opposing Indian rule of Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim
area in the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's 1998 report on terrorism said the group,
which now goes by the name Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, had operated
training camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Militants have made three violent attempts to secure Azhar's
release since he was jailed in 1994. In one case, a Westerner who
was kidnapped was beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Airlines officials said there are still 154 hostages on
board the plane, including 54 women and five children under the age
of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions aboard the plane Wednesday were more comfortable than
on Tuesday, when the electrical power broke down for hours, Indian
officials said. The hostages were receiving medical care and
medicine, and the toilets were being cleaned, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food and water is constantly being made available and is
supplied on demand,'' said Singh, India's foreign minister.

 &HT;    Qtera founder denies stealing trade secrets
 &HT;    (Eds: Adds statement from Qtera's Diner after 4th graf.)
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Just two weeks after upstart Qtera Corp.
announced a multibillion-dollar deal to sell itself, the former
employer of two Qtera founders has accused them of stealing trade
secrets and is seeking to block the deal _ or get a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens Information and Communication Networks says Qtera Chief
Executive Fahri Diner and Chief Scientist Xiang-Dong Cao breached
their employment agreements and are improperly using Siemens'
confidential information and trade secrets in fiber optic data
transmission, according to a lawsuit suit filed Tuesday in Palm
Beach County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diner and Cao betrayed Siemens and violated their duties of
good faith and loyalty by pursuing a course of conduct during their
employment which was marked by personal greed,'' the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Cao refused to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Diner, in a statement late Wednesday, called the Siemens
allegations unfounded, and said Qtera would defend itself
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dismayed by Siemens' actions and suspicious about the
timing of their suit given the recent announcement of our pending
merger with ... Nortel Networks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Qtera, founded in September 1998, announced it
intends to sell itself to fiber optic networking giant Nortel of
Brampton, Ontario, for $3.25 billion in stock. The deal would make
millionaires of half of Qtera's 140 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens Information is seeking an injunction to block the deal,
as well as a ``constructive trust'' on the ``misappropriated''
information, the money raised by Qtera executives to launch the
company and any profits Qtera gains from the information.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the suit is unrelated to the Nortel-Qtera deal
announcement, said Benjamin Reid of Miami, Siemens Information's
attorney. The company sued only after its discussions with Qtera
failed to satisfy it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid wouldn't disclose the amount of money Siemens Information
is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Both Siemens Information, a subsidiary of Siemens AG of Germany,
and Qtera are based in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Diner and Cao founded Qtera to develop technology that boosts
the speed of data sent through hair-thin fiber-optic cables.
High-speed transmission technology is a hot field as companies look
for cheaper, more efficient ways to move data.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Qtera launch, Diner and Cao were high-ranking Siemens
Information employees privy to the company's top-secret business
and technical information, the suit says. They signed ``Employee
Patent and Secrecy Agreements'' that said they would keep sensitive
information secret. Those agreements also gave Siemens Information
control of any inventions created by Diner and Cao.
</P>
<P>
   While they were working for Siemens Information, they drafted
business plans for Qtera and used Siemens Information's computer
system to e-mail the plans to prospective lenders, the suit says.
Diner used information gleaned during his employment at Siemens
Information to develop similar fiber-optic technology at Qtera, the
suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera hasn't generated a penny in sales, but its work to send
light a greater distance without amplification drew many suitors,
with Nortel winning out.
</P>
<P>
   If Qtera's technology works _ and it has passed preliminary
testing _ it will mean lower costs to operate fiber-optic networks
because less equipment will be needed to boost signals. Costs also
would be less for every fiber-optic network user, including
Internet access providers and cable TV and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortel-Qtera deal is scheduled to close in the first quarter
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   A Nortel spokesman said the company's offices are closed this
week and that no one could comment on the suit.

BITTER DEBATE ON PRIVACY DIVIDES TWO EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Questions about the data collection practices of
a subsidiary of Amazon, the Internet's largest retailer, have
erupted in a confrontation between a respected computer security
expert and a renowned Internet pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The security expert is Richard M. Smith, who has recently
dedicated much of his professional life to uncovering privacy
issues arisingfrom software flaws and e-commerce schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet pioneer is Brewster Kahle, founder of Alexa
Internet, the San Francisco-based Amazon subsidiary that developed
the data-collection software in question. The software is being
tested for use with Amazon's forthcoming zBubbles
comparison-shopping service.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which is currently available only in a trial
version and only on the Alexa Web site, monitors which sites a
consumer visits, looks for patterns shared by many individual
shoppers and then aggregates information about the collective
navigation of Web users. It is designed to continually learn about
shopping behavior and improve the quality of information it makes
available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Smith filed a formal complaint with the Federal
Trade Commission in which he said his examination of the behavior
of the Alexa software had revealed that it was capable of gathering
far more personal data about consumers than Amazon tells customers
it is collecting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who earlier this year drew widespread attention to the
privacy practices of a number of large Internet companies including
Microsoft Corp. and RealNetworks, said he discovered that both
Alexa programs occasionally pass on personal information including
names, postal addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses. They
also gather information about the things people are searching for
and pass all this data to network server computers operated by
Alexa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the transmission of this personal data is a
breach of the zBubbles License and Usage Agreement,'' Smith
asserted in a letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chairman. ``In
addition, the software may also violate a number of federal laws
including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Kahle defended the Alexa
technology, saying that while some information was unavoidably
collected from Web surfers, the important point was that the
information was not stored permanently and was not used to connect
Web behavior to a person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard that we're attempting to uphold,'' Kahle said,
``is that if a government agency were to come and subpoena us and
ask, `Where was an individual going on the Web before he bombed the
federal building?' we'd be able to say, `We don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the confrontation is an Internet privacy issue
that is currently being bitterly disputed in Washington: whether
the good intentions of a corporation are sufficient to protect
individual privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important about what Richard's identified here,'' said
James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington based lobbying group, is how easily Web
sites can collect pieces of data that ``come to include information
that most people would consider personal.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is extraordinary because it positions two well
regarded technologists on opposite sides of a complex debate.
Kahle, who had previously designed information retrieval software
at Thinking Machines Inc., and WAIS Inc., two companies he helped
found, started Alexa Internet in 1996. Since the company was
acquired by Amazon earlier this year, Alexa has focused on
developing the retail giant's zBubbles service.
</P>
<P>
   The Alexa technology attempts to offer online shoppers improved
guidance on how to retrieve information about goods and services.
It does this by studying the paths followed by many Web surfers so
that individual consumers can benefit from an aggregation of
shopping experiences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company states on its Web site that it
does not link individual identity to Web activity. Smith asserts
that this discrepancy intentionally misleads customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kahle said the behavior of his software reflected his own
struggle for more than a decade over the potential privacy issues
raised by information retrieval technology. During the 1980s while
at Thinking Machines, a Cambridge, Mass.-based maker of
supercomputers, Kahle said, he was already developing information
retrieval technology used commercially by Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, he said, the challenge was making sure that
employees did not misappropriate information about what Dow Jones
customers were searching for. In 1992, Kahle wrote a paper titled
``Ethics of Digital Librarianship,'' which dealt with the
responsibility of librarians to keep personal information private
in the computer era.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing the very criticism he is now facing, Kahle wrote,
``At this point this is not a problem since few servers are of a
personal nature yet, but as the system grows to include
entertainment, employment, health and other servers, it is easy to
imagine the types of information that will be accessible through
operating such a server.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith argues that despite policy statements published on both
the Amazon and Alexa Web sites, most users are not fully aware of
the nature of the information that is being sent to the Alexa Web
servers.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Web sites are increasingly becoming massive
databases that gather personal data in order to personalize content
or advertising to individual consumers. A byproduct of that trend
is that universal resource locators, or URLs, as the addresses of
Web pages are known, increasingly contain personal information that
sites have gathered. All of this information gets collected,
intentionally or not, by simply monitoring the URLs of pages
consumers visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems is that all of this stuff is very
slippery,'' Smith said. ``I respect Brewster's ethics, but what
happens if he leaves? There are no legal protections on the Web.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index, on its way to the best
year ever for a major American stock index, closed above 4,000
points for the first time on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone came less than two months after the index first
topped 3,000, and was based largely on the strength of the
technology stocks that have come to dominate the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   The index rose 69.35 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,041.46 and is
now up 84.3 percent since the end of 1998. Three stocks in the
index have gained more than 1,000 percent this year, with Qualcomm,
a leading company in mobile phone technology, surging 2,444 percent
since the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   No broad index of American stocks has ever risen as much in one
calendar year as the Nasdaq composite has this year. In only eight
previous years did any major index rise by even half as much as the
Nasdaq has this year, and in all but one of those cases the market
was rebounding after prices had fallen the previous year, usually
during a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions now are far different, however. The current economic
expansion of more than eight years will soon become the longest in
American history. The Nasdaq composite gained at least 20 percent
in each of the last four years, and the 1998 gain of 39.6 percent
was the third biggest in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and Internet-related stocks have been the strongest
components of the index for most of 1999, but biotechnology stocks
have come on strong in the last two months. Many other stocks,
particularly those in the financial and transportation industries,
have lagged far behind these technology leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the largest gains have come in stocks with little or no
current earnings, but with expectations that they may flourish in
the new Internet-based economy. ``Certainly there are a lot of
stocks in Nasdaq that are overvalued,'' said Edward Kerschner, the
chief investment strategist at Paine Webber, ``but companies like
Cisco and Microsoft are growing rapidly and deserve high
valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq average's gains have come amid the greatest
volatility in the history of the Nasdaq stock market, which dates
to 1971. ``Five years ago you'd see a 1 percent move every two
weeks,'' observed George Cohen, a portfolio manager at Cohen,
Klingenstein &AMP; Marks, referring to the wide swings in price, mostly
up, this year. ``Now you see a 1 percent move almost every day.''
That is only a small exaggeration. So far this year, there have
been three such days a week, on average.
</P>
<P>
   The old record for a major American index was set by the Dow
Jones industrial average in 1915, at a time when the economy was
moving from a recession into a boom caused by demand for industrial
products from European countries then fighting World War I, which
the United States had not yet entered. Barring a collapse during
the two trading days left in the year, the Nasdaq will finish with
a gain well in excess of the 73.9 percent recorded by the Dow that
year.
</P>
<P>
   The only other years in which a major United States index rose
by more than 50 percent were 1933, when the Dow leaped 66.7
percent, and 1991, when the Nasdaq composite rose by 56.9 percent.
There were five other years _ 1904, 1908, 1928, 1935 and 1954 _
when one or more indexes showed annual gains of at least 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While other major indexes also set records on Wednesday, their
1999 gains do not even approach that of the Nasdaq. The Dow
industrials are up 25.1 percent in 1999, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
index of 500 stocks has gained 19.1 percent and the Russell 2,000
index of small stocks has added 17.8 percent. The record set by the
Russell was the first one for that index since April 21, 1998. Many
small stocks suffered in 1998, and many of them still have not
recovered their losses from that year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rally for the Nasdaq composite has been a relatively
narrow one, centered on the computer and other technology stocks
that have excited investors. The Nasdaq computer index, which now
makes up more than half of the value of the entire Nasdaq index, is
up 103.8 percent for the year, and 40 percent since the composite
index hit 3,000 on Nov. 3. The Nasdaq biotech index has done even
better recently, leaping 51.6 percent since Nov. 3, to raise its
annual gain to 103.7 percent. Of the 200 stocks in the biotech
index, 32 have more than doubled since Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Nasdaq bank index is down 7.7 percent
since Nov. 3, and is off 8.9 percent for the year. Similarly, The
Nasdaq insurance index is off 7.7 percent since Nov. 3, cutting its
1999 rise to 4.6 percent. The Nasdaq transportation index is up 3.3
percent since Nov. 3, leaving it with a 1.5 percent gain for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq 100 index has outperformed the broader Nasdaq
composite of nearly 5,000 stocks and is up 38.1 percent since Nov.
3 and 101 percent for 1999. Among the large stocks that make up the
Nasdaq 100, six have doubled in price since the composite index
reached 3,000, according to calculations by Bloomberg Financial
Markets. In addition to Qualcomm, they are CMGI, a company that
invests in Internet companies; I2 Technologies, a software company;
Yahoo, a pioneering Internet firm; Broadvision, a software company,
and Intuit, another software company.
</P>
<P>
   White the Nasdaq composite's gain for 1999 is on course to be
the best year ever for a widely followed broad index of American
stocks _ a category that includes the Dow Jones industrials, the
S.&AMP;P. 500 and the Russell 2,000 _ some foreign indexes, as well as
narrower ones of American stocks, have done even better this year.
An Internet stock index maintained by TheStreet.Com, for example,
is up 186 percent this year, and an index of South Korean stocks is
up 100 percent.

   In 1915, when the Dow rose 73.9 percent, the index had only 12
stocks. In 1916, the index was enlarged to 20 stocks, including
many that had been excellent performers. That new, enlarged, index,
would have risen 81.7 percent had it existed in 1915. That figure
has sometimes been cited as the best performance ever for a general
American index, but is misleading because the index did not contain
those stocks at the time. The Dow was enlarged to its current size
of 30 stocks in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index now has 4,832 stocks, and adds new
stocks as companies go public. But the index is weighted according
to market capitalization, and the 10 largest companies in it
account for more than 40 percent of the index.

BAY STATE JUDGE DEALS HANDGUN MAKERS A SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The year-long legal battle between the attorney
general's office and the handgun industry took another turn
Wednesday when a judge threw out the industry's challenges and let
state regulations to block the sale of cheap handguns begin
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge John C. Cratsley ordered the
implementation of new safety standards and asked both sides to
submit a proposed final judgment to the court.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, the first in the nation, would require
handguns pass minimum performance and drop tests. They would also
require gun manufacturers to include built-in childproof
protection, indicators that show the number of cartridges left in a
gun, tamper-proof serial numbers, and guns that come equipped with
safety devices such as hard-to-pull triggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are common sense precautions that put safety first,''
said Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly. ``We're pleased that we can
now put these regulations into effect and work on eliminating the
sale of defective, low quality, and unsafe handguns in
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Snow, of the Gun Owners Action League, said the ruling
would only add to the confusion among gun manufacturers who are
struggling to cope with the state's 1998 gun control law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to have regulations which conflict with
the law which has since been enacted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make more sense for the regulations to be canceled or
for a clear and concise directive to be sent to dealers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry likely will appeal, said sources familiar with
the case. Representatives from the gun manufacturers and lobby
groups, including the American Shooting Sports Council Inc., could
not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who include Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson
Corp., Glock Inc., and Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., have long said the
regulations are not a foolproof means of keeping guns out of the
hands of children. Industry spokesmen have also said they have yet
to come up with a design that would completely childproof a gun or
keep it out of the hands of criminals without limiting an owner's
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations have been on a legal roller coaster since
being introduced in 1997 by then Attorney-General Scott
Harshbarger. In January 1998, the day before the regulations were
to be phased in, gun-industry groups sued claiming that the
attorney general did not have the authority to dictate design and
manufacture of products, and that some regulations conflicted with
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, a Suffolk Superior Court judge blocked
the implementation of the regulations after ruling Harshbarger had
overstepped his bounds. This July, the state's Supreme Judicial
Court ruled that the attorney general had the right to impose
safety measures on gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Cratsley ruled all the regulations are constitutional and said
the state needed only to show that the purpose of the regulations
were related ``to the promotion of public health, safety, morals,
or other phase of the general welfare'' and the means chosen were
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   John Rosenthal, founder of Stop Handgun Violence campaign, said
he was thrilled. ``It's just common sense that the attorney general
should be able to initiate consumer protection regulations and
manufacturing standards for guns which kill 90 Americans every
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has some of the most comprehensive gun laws in the
nation, Rosenthal said. ``This will further prove what we've
already shown,'' he said, ``which is that gun laws work.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has seen a 53 percent reduction in gun injuries
since 1994, according to Rosenthal.

ADVERTISING: ART AND COMMERCE COLLIDE ONLINE, ALL OVER LETTER `S'
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How valuable is an ``s'' on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Two combatants, separated in cyberspace by that single letter,
are about to find out. One is a fiercely independent Web ensemble
looking to use the new medium to stir up the status quo and reshape
the boundaries of artistic expression. The other is an e-commerce
upstart seeking to build a business and establish its brand while
reshaping the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a legal dispute between the two has forced the arts
group to give up its Web address, even though it was online a year
before the business venture was formed. And as word of its
situation has spread, supporters have mounted a vigorous
Internet-based protest claiming that commercial considerations are
stifling creative expression on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now business is trying to find a way to coexist peacefully with
art.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, eToys Inc., the Web's leading toy retailer, said it
had offered to drop its trademark-infringement lawsuit against
etoy, a European group of online conceptual artists. Etoys, which
has already won a court order evicting the artists from their home
at www.etoy.com, also said it was willing to let the group resume
using that address.
</P>
<P>
   But the company said it was asking the group to relocate graphic
images and language to other Internet sites, where children and
parents shopping for Pokemon cards and Harry Potter books are less
likely to stumble upon them by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for etoy said that the group would not agree to limit
the content on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are artists, and this is just not acceptable to them,''
Chris Truax, etoy's lawyer, said in a telephone interview from San
Diego. ``Etoy cannot give eToys veto power over the content on its
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month etoy was forced to stop using www.etoy.com, its Web
address since 1995. EToys was not founded until the following year,
and put up its Web site, www.etoys.com, in 1997. Unlike etoy,
though, eToys holds a U.S. trademark for its name.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Ross, a spokesman for the Santa Monica, Calif., company,
said: ``We are initiating an end to the legal actions against etoy.
The reason is simple: over the last several weeks, we've received
lots and lots of communications that urged us to find a way to
coexist with etoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross added that eToys was asking etoy to find a way to move its
``more graphic pages'' _ one recently incorporated a picture of the
bombed federal building in Oklahoma City, with a satirical caption
_ but that it was not a condition for putting an end to the
lawsuit. ``It is only a request,'' he said. (Truax said etoy was
still studying the company's offer.)
</P>
<P>
   EToys had sued etoy after hearing from customers who went to the
art site by mistake, including some who complained about its
profane language. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a
preliminary injunction against etoy on Nov. 29, threatening the
artists with fines of as much as $10,000 a day unless they stopped
using the www.etoy.com address.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which mimics corporate behavior, went into Internet
exile at a numeric address (http://146.228.204.72:8080/). But etoy
is well known in Internet art circles, and as word of its situation
spread, defenders started protest sites and began blanketing the
Internet with e-mail messages. The case has become a cause celebre
among those who resent the growing influence of commercial
interests on the Internet because they fear it will limit artistic
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the offer from eToys was prompted because ``we
received a lot of heartfelt, well-reasoned e-mails,'' adding, ``It
was never our intention to silence artistic expression.''
</P>
<P>
   But etoy's supporters had reacted with alarm to the shutdown of
the site. Supporters who believe the artists were being muzzled put
up several sites urging visitors to boycott eToys and send
disapproving e-mail messages to the company's executives. A few
parody sites have also appeared.
</P>
<P>
   An etoy spokesman who gave his name as ``zai'' (the group's
dozen or so members do not divulge their real names) said the
domain name and the Web site that accompanied it were in themselves
the group's and that giving up the domain name ``will be the end of
this art piece.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the origins of the group's name, it was one of several
choices generated by a computer program, he said, and was latched
onto because it sounded like something electronic, playfully
ironic, and possibly Japanese.)
</P>
<P>
   RTMark, another group of anonymous online provocateurs, has
successfully tweaked the campaigns of Gov. George W. Bush and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani this year by creating parody sites with addresses
confusingly similar to those of the campaigns' official sites. The
group has been selected to exhibit in the Whitney Museum's biennial
survey of American art next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since etoy was formed before eToys existed, no one could accuse
the artists of pulling a similar prank or of being cybersquatters _
people who register company and product names and then demand
payment for them. But if the two parties cannot reach an agreement,
it will be up to the courts to decide if the dispute is an example
of reverse domain-name hijacking, in which someone who covets a
domain name but has no legal right to it tries to coerce the owner
into surrendering it. Etoy is appealing the preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Cooks Levitan, an analyst at Robertson, Stephens who
follows eToys, said that the retailer was not likely to experience
anything more than limited damage from potential customers who
visit the arts site in error, but that bad publicity from the
lawsuit might have a different effect.
</P>
<P>
   Before filing suit, eToys officials indicated they were willing
to buy etoy, and the most recent offer was somewhere over $400,000,
in a mix of cash and eToys stock. If accepted, the price would
probably set a record for a work of Internet art _ and for the
letter ``s.''

HOW TO AVOID THE CROWD IF YOU'RE IN IT
</HEADLINE>
 (With NEWYEAR-TIMESSQUARE) 
 (nk) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is, perhaps, the single most important question
facing the 2 million brave-hearted revelers expected to pack into
Times Square on New Year's Eve: What to do if things get out of
hand?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, as is the case in this era of endless self-help guides,
there is a perfect book available to offer some advice.
</P>
<P>
   The book is the ``Reader's Digest Action Guide: What to Do in an
Emergency'' (1988), a comprehensive doomsday manual containing
helpful nuggets on weathering every problem from roadside
breakdowns to unexpected tropical storms. But of greatest interest
to those planning to visit Times Square on Friday night is the
detailed lesson on surviving an unruly throng, laid out clearly
under the wry, apocalyptic heading of ``When a Crowd Turns Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being part of a large, good-humored crowd _ at a public
occasion, say, such as the New Year's Eve celebration in Times
Square, New York _ can be exhilarating,'' the guide assures its
readers, setting them up for the inevitable fall. ``Panic, however,
can turn any crowded place into a potential death trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Step one in surviving a dangerous mob is simply to walk away.
But should there be no time to flee, the guide recommends knocking
on the door of the nearest house for help. (Not in Manhattan,
guys.)
</P>
<P>
   Should you find yourself swept away by the crowd, the guide
lists two overriding priorities: Stay on your feet and stay away
from glass. In a tidbit from the Oh, Really? Department, it notes:
``If you get pushed through a plate-glass window or trampled by the
crowd, you are unlikely to escape without serious injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide counsels hanging on to something fixed and solid, like
a lamppost, and letting the crowd surge past. If necessary, you can
brace your arms in front of your chest to create a temporary pocket
of air.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario _ falling to the ground _ the guide
has a remedy of last resort: tucking into the fetal position
without delay. ``Do not panic,'' it warns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the guide's air of authority, several martial arts
experts, bouncers and professional security men said they found its
techniques less than state of the art. ``If you curl up on the
ground, you're just going to get trampled,'' said Babs Olusanmokun,
a bouncer and Brazilian jujitsu instructor. Olusanmokun said that
if he were trapped in a swarm of uncontrollable party animals he
would simply hoist the person in front him into the air and toss
him at the crowd ahead, creating space.
</P>
<P>
   For Alan Teo, an instructor of jeet kune do, the martial art
created by Bruce Lee, the crucial step is getting your back up
against a wall. ``Once you're at a wall,'' he said, ``nobody can
swarm you.''
</P>
<P>
   To Marc Lavine, a former karate and kick-boxing instructor, the
surest survival technique is finding a quiet room and not showing
up at Times Square at all.

 BRADLEY AND McCAIN REPORT BIG FUND-RAISING GAINS  
(sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley and John McCain, two insurgent
presidential candidates challenging their parties' front-runners,
made striking gains in campaign fund raising in the final months of
the year, each exceeding the amount raised by Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey who is Gore's only
rival for the Democratic nomination, announced on Wednesday that he
raised more than $8 million from October through December. That was
twice as much as the vice president raised in the same period and
brought Bradley's total for the year to $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the senator from Arizona, raised $6.1 million for the
quarter. That total more than doubled his fund-raising pace of the
previous three months, although he could not keep pace with the
money machine of the Republican he is chasing, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas. Bush's organization said on Wednesday that when it
announced its figures on Thursday, they would show that the
governor had raised upward of $7 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gore reported contributions of $4 million in the last three
months, for a full-year total of slightly less than $29 million _
barely $2 million ahead of Bradley. And to reach that $4 million,
the Gore campaign had to hastily schedule three additional
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the $29 million it has raised this year, the Gore
campaign has qualified for $11 million in federal matching funds
and expects an additional $3.5 million in matching funds in the
first quarter of 2000. Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, would not
say precisely how much the campaign now had in the bank. But he did
say that with the matching funds included, the vice president would
start the new year, and the early-primary season, with almost as
much money to spend as Bradley. For each organization, that figure
will be roughly $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Bradley's fund-raising totals continue to be one
of the big surprises of the campaign and a sign of trouble for the
vice president, who has been planning his run and lining up support
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $27 million for Bradley is a stunning number,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of a political newsletter in
Washington. ``His ability to match a sitting vice president almost
dollar for dollar is remarkable and exceeds all expectations the
handicappers laid out a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the advantages that Gore ought to have,'' Rothenberg
added, ``these figures have to be frightening to the vice
president. The only way Bradley could have done so well is for so
many Democrats to have doubts about Al Gore. If Gore were as
popular as he should be, Democrats wouldn't be writing checks for
Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley raised money at a faster rate than the vice
president in the year's final months, he also spent more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator has $8.3 million in the bank and expects to
receive $10.1 million in matching funds in early January. But he
spent $10.4 million from October through December, much of it on
staff and advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the
campaign's first two contests will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by comparison, spent about $8 million in the quarter, a
slightly slower pace than in previous periods. He reaped savings by
moving his campaign headquarters from Washington to Nashville and
by cutting back on the size and salaries of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain's fund-raising surge, it still leaves his total
for the year, $13.6 million, dwarfed by more than $63 million
raised in 1999 by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the amount raised by his organization, McCain is
eligible for $6.2 million in matching funds, and earlier in the
year he transferred $2 million from his 1998 Senate campaign to his
presidential candidacy. The McCain campaign says it has $1.5
million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush said his campaign raised more than $7 million in
the fourth quarter and more than $63 million for the year. But the
Bush campaign said it would not issue its precise figures until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bush aides give any indication how much money the
campaign had on hand; at the end of September, the figure was $37
million. Bush's campaign is not accepting matching funds and will
not adhere to the spending limits that go with them.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who joined Bradley at a campaign event in New Hampshire
earlier this month to criticize the role of money in modern
politics, said in a statement issued on Wednesday that he was
delighted by the surge he had enjoyed in financial support over the
last 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely gratified by the overwhelming enthusiasm for my
independent conservative reform message,'' he said. ``While I am
proud that our campaign has been about ideas, not bucks, I am
grateful that we have raised the funds necessary to run an
aggressive campaign that will get my message out even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Bradley campaign said that early this year they
set a fund-raising goal of $25 million for 1999, and noted that
they had now surpassed it, ``without taking special-interest PAC
money and without exploiting any loopholes in the campaign finance
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the campaigns of the other presidential candidates
_ Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, who are
seeking the Republican nomination, and Pat Buchanan, running for
the Reform Party nomination _ said they would release their
fund-raising figures on Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Final reports for 1999 presidential campaign fund raising and
spending are due at the Federal Election Commission on Jan. 31.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The most pressing need for Texas A&AMP;M in 2000
became crystal clear during its final game of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   As they were losing 24-0 to Penn State on Tuesday night in the
Alamo Bowl, it was obvious the Aggies are in dire need of an
athletic, quick quarterback who can threaten defenses with the
ability to pass and run.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McCown, who played his final game for Texas A&AMP;M, got by on
grit and heart. But his mobility was not on par with other
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   While McCown was throwing four interceptions, Penn State's
Rashard Casey passed for one touchdown and ran for another. Before
Wednesday morning's season wrapup news conference, Aggies coach
R.C. Slocum remembered a conversation he had with Nittany Lions
coach Joe Paterno the week before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about the quarterback at Virginia Tech
(Michael Vick) and the guy at Georgia Tech (Joe Hamilton) and the
way they can open things up with their quickness,'' said Slocum.
``I told Joe that's what I'd really like to have, one of those guys
who can line up and be a legitimate threat to pass and run at
quarterback. He said, `I've got one I think is going to be pretty
good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that out firsthand. As I look at the game, I thought
their quarterback played exceptionally well. He made some real big
plays. He was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said finding a quarterback with that sort of big-play
ability is at the top of the team's wish list as recruiting builds
to the February signing date.
</P>
<P>
   Among the quarterbacks in Texas who fit what the Aggies need are
Carlyle Holiday of San Antonio Roosevelt and Dustin Long of Port
Neches-Groves. Both players list A&AMP;M among the schools they are
considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at college football today, having a mobile
quarterback adds another dimension to an offense,'' said Slocum.
``He can slow down the pursuit of the defense. When he drops back
to pass, you have to worry about having to tackle the quarterback
and about covering all the receivers. That really adds a lot of
concern to a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of quarterback I think most teams are looking
for. If the quarterback's not a threat to run, it eliminates a lot
of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCown graduating, the Aggies will have a battle among
three quarterback candidates this spring. Mark Farris and Vance
Smith are redshirt freshmen who were barely used this season.
</P>
<P>
   Neither appears to have shown game-breaking ability.
</P>
<P>
   Colby Freeman sat out his freshman year. Freeman was a top-rated
high school quarterback at Brownwood in 1998, gaining 1,782 yards
rushing and passing for 1,378 yards in his senior year. The Aggies
liked what they saw of Freeman during practice this season, but it
remains to be seen if he is the kind of quarterback who can open up
an offense.
</P>
<P>
   Another question the Aggies will have to answer is whether
265-pound Ja'Mar Toombs will play tailback or fullback. Toombs
finished the season at tailback and has expressed a desire to
remain there.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs gained 70 yards against Penn State and had 267 in three
games as a tailback. However, the Aggies lose fullback D'Andre
Hardeman and will be thin at that position, so Toombs may need to
move back. Joe Weber, who gained 278 yards as a true freshman,
would be the likely tailback under that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ja'Mar is a guy who can be a two-way back,'' said Slocum. ``He
can a fullback or a big `one' back. But if he plays there, you have
some limitations in what you can do overall. He gives you some
things that you can do, but you also are limited in certain types
of plays if he is the tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's at fullback, he's got work to do as a blocker. That's
a position where we've got a lot to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies lose three starters from their secondary _
cornerbacks Jason Webster and Sedrick Curry and safety Brandon
Jennings. Sammy Davis and Jay Brooks are the leading candidates at
cornerback, but depth could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies finished 8-4 but lost three of their final six games
and were pounded by Oklahoma, Nebraska and Penn State by an
aggregate score of 112-6. They were shut out twice in their final
four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be 8-4,'' said freshman linebacker Brian
Gamble, the most impressive newcomer on the team. ``It's been a
roller-coaster season with a lot of good and bad aspects. We are
not satisfied with this type of season.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said that while he expected better things this season, he
was never of the opinion that the Aggies were capable of contending
for a national championship, which was suggested in some quarters
before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things considered, this was probably a pretty good year,''
said Slocum. ``It was a frustrating year with some ups and downs.
Early in the year, there were some (high) expectations because of
where we were in some of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the same people who picked us in the Top 10 in the nation
didn't pick any of our players outside of the punter (Shane
Lechler) to be a preseason all-conference. That's illogical.''

DISCOURTESY PART OF SCENE ON THE SLOPES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Colo.)  (rk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOWE, Vt. _ Call it what you will _ mountain rage or slope rage
or some misguided sense of entitlement _ volatile temperaments have
invaded the tranquillity of Alpine skiing and snowboarding. While
no one incident has been bad enough to merit national headlines,
members of the ski industry are seeing an increasing deterioration
in common courtesy. And that's a worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to notice the disrespect a couple of years ago,''
said Hank Lunde, president of the mountain resort at Stowe. ``It
comes down to the true understanding of freedom, the idea that
everyone who comes here has to be accountable to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Stowe has decided to attack the problem this season with a
program that includes designating certain trails as Comfort Zones.
The effort, which includes posters admonishing skiers to focus on
three A's _ awareness, accountability and attitude _ is a way of
asking guests to be more polite. This in turn, they think, may
reduce accidents, and make skiing a more pleasant experience over
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're there to be reminding people of the things that their
parents maybe should have taught them but didn't,'' Lunde said.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, most ski operators were blaming snowboarders for
rudeness on the slopes. Boarding was largely a cult sport relegated
to teen-agers and 20-year-olds. But now boarders account for 27
percent of a mountain resort's population, with a large number of
middle-aged and older riders. No one knows who to blame for what
many view as an increasing lack of manners, and occasionally, rage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst examples occurred in 1994 at Breckenridge,
Colo. Two groups of skiers got into a fistfight that resulted in
the local sheriff's being called in, said Jim Tabor, a Stowe
spokesman who worked for Breckenridge at the time. The 15 people
involved were hitting one another with skis and poles during the
melee.
</P>
<P>
   Stowe, however, is concerned mostly with people who are
inconsiderate: cutting across in front of another skier; sitting
down in the middle of a slope to adjust gear; jumping in front of
someone else in the lift line, or simply leaving lunch waste on the
cafeteria floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rude behavior may or may not be related to accidents. But the
ski industry sees a link. Accident numbers are not spiraling, but
they are not dwindling either. A yearly average of 34 skiers or
snowboarders have died on the nation's slopes in the last 15 years,
said Stacy Gardner, a spokeswoman for the National Ski Areas
Association, an industry trade group in Lakewood, Colo. Last
season, 39 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are somewhat higher for serious accidents such as
spinal cord and head injuries. Last season, 45 resort guests hurt
themselves seriously on the nation's slopes; the 10-year average is
37. The ski association is concerned enough to initiate its own
awareness campaign this season with a Heads Up program on safety.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Stowe is not the only area trying to calm the
masses. At Vail, for example, a network of Yellow Jackets _
skiing's answer to traffic cops _ police the slopes. Stowe does
that, too, and resorts to clipping lift tickets if a person skis or
rides recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Merriam, director of Stowe's ski school, founded the AAA
policy at Stowe this season. ``If 5 percent of our guests don't
like our policy, then I can live with that,'' Merriam said. ``My
sense is that if 95 percent of our population is committed to it,
then the other 5 percent becomes abnormal. I think our skier visits
will actually grow from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Burton Carpenter, a founder of snowboarding in the late
1960s, knows the problem firsthand. He was hit by a novice skier
while snowboarding at Stowe five years ago. Carpenter, who is 45,
broke his leg badly. He now says the accident was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are riding and skiing faster because their
equipment and the grooming just keeps getting better,'' Carpenter
said. ``People are sharing the same surface with different
abilities. It looks like Stowe is trying to find a way to meld all
the levels of confidence on the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks it will work. ``It's too subtle,'' said
David Goodman, a ski magazine writer and author of a new book
entitled ``Backcountry Skiing Adventures.'' ``Do you want to tell
people to do something? Then tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman skied at Stowe last weekend, and found that the AAA
signs were hard to read, and the Comfort Zones too obscure. ``It's
too well-intentioned,'' he said. ``It's trying to deal with an
unsubtle problem in a subtle way.''

GERMAN STOCK-SALE PLAN STIRS ONLY LIMITED OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ At first, it seemed unlikely, perhaps even
a little preposterous: a tax break that would allow Germany's
banking and industrial conglomerates to untangle more than $100
billion worth of cross-shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
   It did not enhance the idea's credibility that it came from a
left-of-center government with sometimes frosty relations with
business. Or that the government buried it as a footnote in a much
larger tax plan, two days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, nearly a week after the proposal was circulated, it
appears to have a serious chance of becoming law. If it does,
Germany's corporate landscape may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would pull the carpet out from under Germany Inc.,'' said
Thomas Mayer, senior economist here for Goldman, Sachs. ``I think
it has a pretty good chance of getting through parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, companies will be allowed to sell their holdings
in other companies without paying taxes _ now 50 percent _ on the
profits.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, it would eliminate a huge obstacle that has thus
far made it prohibitively expensive for financial institutions like
Deutsche Bank and the big insurer Allianz AG to streamline and
reduce their vast portfolios of stock in other German companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it would free up tens of billions of marks that
have been blocked from reinvestment because of tax liability. It
could also be expected to accelerate the pace of mergers and
acquisitions. German banks and insurers would have new resources
for mergers and acquisitions but would themselves become more
vulnerable to hostile takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though the plan would be an enormous tax break for big
business, it has not yet generated much political opposition.
Left-leaning leaders within the governing Social Democratic Party
have praised the idea as a way to spur flexibility and new growth
in German industry.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change would spur ``more growth and employment by
creating more efficient corporate structures,'' said Joachim Poss
and Joerg Otto Spiller, two leading Social Democratic members of
parliament, in a joint statement on Tuesday. The move, they added,
``lies within the logic'' of current tax principles.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the Green Party, the junior member in Germany's
ruling coalition, were more emphatic in their support. ``This gives
the economy the push that it needs,'' said Klaus Mueller, a Green
member of parliament who speaks for the party on economic issues.
``I am presuming that the governing coalition will stand by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The main rumblings of discontent have come from the center-right
opposition parties, the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian
affiliate, the Christian Social Union, which are normally advocates
of tax relief and pro-business policies. But most economists doubt
that those parties would block the measure, because doing so would
enrage important supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Though German stocks have leveled off after rising 4.46 percent
last Thursday, some investors appear euphoric. People close to the
Finance Ministry say that the government delayed disclosure of its
plan to derail opposition from the Social Democratic Party's left
wing.
</P>
<P>
   Social Democrats in parliament were told nothing about the plan
until the stock market began to soar on Thursday. The market's
reaction _ sending the benchmark DAX stock index to a record high
and lifting some financial issues by more than 15 percent _ made it
difficult for opponents to speak out against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the German markets, the German system, this can only be
seen as positive news,'' said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at
Commerzbank, the country's fourth largest. Commerzbank, which has a
stock portfolio of less than $2 billion, would be only mildly
affected by the change. But the changes at other institutions would
be potentially much greater. Deutsche Bank's stock portfolio is
worth about $22 billion, and its holdings include major stakes in
DaimlerChrysler AG, the bankrupt construction company Philipp
Holzmann, Allianz and a number of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   If German financial institutions begin to sell their
cross-holdings, they could become more exposed to takeover
attempts. Thus far, the big banks have remained aloof from the kind
of merger activity that has occurred in France, Italy, Spain and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Allianz holds 21.6 percent of Dresdner Bank, the
country's third largest, and Dresdner in turn owns 10 percent of
Allianz. Munich Reinsurance and Allianz each own 25 percent of each
other, and both insurers have stakes in scores of industrial
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The issue goes beyond banks and insurers. Big utility companies
like Veba and manufacturers like Siemens hold shares in far-flung
companies, and in the midst of a large-scale shuffling of ownership
this would almost certainly increase.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These networks of interlocking holdings have been at the center
of postwar corporate Germany, in which banks, insurers and
industrial companies supported each other through good times and
bad. But the old ties have become too restrictive, dragging down
profits at big financial institutions by making it difficult to
move money from weak investments to better ones.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Political leaders have recognized the problem for years. But the
idea of giving big banks and insurers a tax windfall worth billions
had been dismissed as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has apparently decided to take on
the problem circuitously. He could afford to bury the plan because
it does not affect his government's budget. The tax liabilities for
big banks are so high that they were not about to sell their
holdings, and the government could not include potential revenue in
its budget planning.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer of Goldman, Sachs is increasingly convinced that the plan
will get through parliament, maintaining that the political left
has been pre-empted by the reaction from investors and that
opposition from the right would infuriate its business supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has angered the owners of small and medium-size
companies, the ``mittelstand,'' which form much of the backbone of
German business. Small-business owners complain that the proposal
does not help unincorporated companies.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials respond that such companies are free to
incorporate and avoid taxes on capital gains if they choose to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that stands up,'' Mayer said, ``the most severe criticism
of the proposal will have been deflated.''

RECALL OF LUXURY FOOD PROMPTS STATE TO INQUIRE INTO FOUR CASES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fallout from shipments of possibly tainted foie gras
continued Wednesday as New York state health officials said they
were investigating whether the product had made four people in New
York ill this fall. Epicures, meanwhile, scrambled to find safe
foie gras in time for New Year's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The company that sells the delicacies, D'Artagnan, of Newark,
N.J., voluntarily recalled 26 of its products on Tuesday _
including foie gras pates, mousses and terrines _ out of fear that
they might be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a
potentially deadly bacterium. It was the D'Artagnan's third recall
in the last two weeks, after health officials in Maryland reported
that its truffled foie gras mousse had made two people ill. The
company told its contractor to cease production of foie gras
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria monocytogenes does not pose much of a risk to healthy
people, causing only short-term gastrointestinal problems. But it
is a serious threat to the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and
people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, New York State Health Department officials said that
two Westchester County residents who were stricken with listeriosis
this fall recalled having eaten D'Artagnan pates.
</P>
<P>
   A third Westchester resident who became ill recalled eating pate
before being stricken but did not remember the brand, said Kristine
A. Smith, a department spokeswoman. A fourth person from Oswego
County did not mention eating any pate but will be reinterviewed,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The product recall comes in the midst of the high season for
foie gras. Charles Gagliardo, a manager at Citarella food market on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, said the store sells 80 percent of its
foie gras just before New Year's Eve. He hastened to add that his
customers need not worry; he sells only French foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   Ariane Daguin, an owner of D'Artagnan, said, ``All I know is I
don't want to get people sick, so I'm closed until I'm totally
satisfied it is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   She said tests that she ordered indicated that the Listeria may
have been introduced during the packaging process. She said that
earlier this week she told her contractor, Hannelore Gourmet Foods
Ltd., in Huntington, N.Y., which processes and packages the foie
gras, to stop production of the meat. Officials at Hannelore
referred one call to D'Artagnan on Wednesday, and did not return a
second call seeking comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The recall could not have come at a worse time for Thomas
Ferlesch, the chef at Cafe Des Artistes in Manhattan. One of his
appetizers is foie gras de canard with red cabbage, apple, raisins
and Calvados, for $16. The supplier was D'Artagnan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sous-chef called me with the news while I was at home,'' he
said. ``I was cooking and cursing. I had ordered it four weeks ago
to make sure I would have enough for New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Ferlesch said, he was able to find another supplier.
``I ordered 24 pounds,'' he said. ``I got half filled yesterday and
the other half will be delivered tomorrow.''

SCHWAB EXPECTING RECORD PROFIT FOR FINAL QUARTER

   The invasion of the full-service brokers doesn't seem to be
slowing Charles Schwab Corp. so far.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, now the leading online brokerage firm, said Wednesday
that the first quarter in which it faced head-on competition from
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter will be its most
profitable quarter ever. The San Francisco-based Schwab expects to
earn $162 million to $171 million, or 19 cents to 20 cents a share,
in the quarter that ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a penny or two a share more than any analyst
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected, and 2 to 3
cents a share higher than their average estimate of 17 cents a
share. Schwab rose $5.8125, or 17.1 percent, Wednesday to $39.75 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that no one is interrupting their momentum,'' said
Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., who has been
recommending Schwab's stock to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have taken dead aim at Schwab
with recent introductions of online trading services for the same
$29.95 commission that Schwab charges. Strauss said he does not
think that those competitors pose immediate threats to Schwab's
growth, but other analysts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firm's chief financial officer, Chris Dodds,
attributed its better-than-expected performance to a surprisingly
active stock market this quarter, especially in December, when some
thought that trading would decrease as the end of the century
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, who is not
recommending purchase of the Schwab stock, said the brokerage
firm's increases in commission revenue should not have come as a
big surprise. ``We know the Nasdaq has been going bananas,''
Moszkowski said. ``And the New York Stock Exchange has been no
slouch either.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of several other online brokerage firms also jumped
Wednesday as investors recognized that robust trading should
benefit all firms that derive much of their revenue from
commissions. The ETrade Group rose $2.375, to $28.125; TD
Waterhouse gained $1.8125, to $17.125, and Ameritrade Holdings
closed up $2.25, to $22.75.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds said Schwab earned commissions in December on an average
of 236,000 trades a day, its highest rate ever. About 80 percent of
those trades were placed electronically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the Y2K situation, there was a little bit more
uncertainty than normal,'' Dodds went on. But as the year drew near
an end, it became clear that Schwab would again show a rate of
growth in customer assets that its competitors and some analysts
have called unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab now holds more than $700 billion in customer assets, a
gain exceeding 40 percent from the end of 1998, Dodds said. The
company has opened more than 1.3 million accounts for the second
straight year, giving it in excess of 6 million accounts held by
about 5 million clients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was gains like those for several consecutive years that
caused traditional brokers like Merrill Lynch to take notice. The
final slap came a year ago, when Schwab's stock market value
surpassed Merrill Lynch's.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Schwab is considered a direct competitor to the
biggest brokerage firms. After all, analysts say, each of them is
trying to gather as many customers and investment assets as fast as
it can.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Schwab has been doing that with a much lower cost
structure than the full-service firms have. Unlike Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley and Salomon Smith Barney, a Citigroup unit, Schwab
does not have an army of stockbrokers on its payroll. But it does
have a network of 320 branches to support, a financial burden that
pure online brokers like ETrade do not have to shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's combination of electronic technology and personal
service has become the model for the entire financial services
industry. But, some analysts wonder how Schwab will distinguish
itself once that model is replicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some concerns about Schwab's ability, over the
next year or so, to cope with some of the competitive responses
that their success has generated,'' Moszkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he would not underestimate the ability of
Schwab's management to continue to reinvent the firm's business
model. ``They have always figured out a path that has been
successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other analysts said that even though they believed Schwab
would continue to grow, they questioned why investors placed a much
higher value on the firm's shares than on those of Morgan Stanley
and other successful securities firms. Shares of Schwab have been
selling for as much as 50 times per-share earnings, compared with a
multiple of about 15 for some of its traditional competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that this is about as good as it gets'' for
Schwab and other brokerage firms that cater to individual, or
``retail,'' investors, said Steve Galbraith, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein. ``All the stars are clearly aligned right now
in retail land.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors came rushing back into the market in the
last few months of the year, buying shares of mutual funds and
bidding up prices of a small number of technology stocks. All the
trading pushed the stock market indexes to record high after record
high.
</P>
<P>
   The question, analysts say, is, what happens to shares of Schwab
and other online brokers when the markets cool off?
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Dodds said, Schwab's managers are confident that
``the things we have to offer investors are going to enable us to
keep growing at this rate.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Shas Party, having received most of the money it sought
to subsidize its private schools and expand the budgets of its
cabinet ministers, has mercifully withdrawn its threat to desert
the governing coalition on the eve of Israel's crucial peace talks
with Syria. Prime Minister Ehud Barak was right to do what he could
to keep the allegiance of this ultra-Orthodox movement representing
Sephardic Jews. He needs the broadest possible coalition to
negotiate peace. But Shas' bargaining ploy was recklessly timed and
dishearteningly parochial.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' political strength is built in part on its network of
religious schools, which offer small class sizes and hot meals and
have become increasingly popular among the working poor. These
features are expensive, and Shas relies on government subsidies to
keep its school system solvent. The party's ability to provide
needed services to the Sephardic community has attracted many new
voters. Shas has increased its parliamentary representation from 10
members in the last parliament to 17 today, making it Israel's
third-largest party.
</P>
<P>
   Sephardim, descended from Jews who emigrated from North Africa
and the Middle East, have not often held top leadership positions
in Israel's two big parties, Labor and Likud. Shas has helped
provide them with the influence they deserve in national politics.
Shas' presence in the cabinet also strengthens Barak's political
base as he tries to negotiate peace agreements with the
Palestinians and Syria. But Shas' leaders also need to recognize
that transcendent national goals like peacemaking must take
priority over maneuvering for budgetary patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting Shas into his coalition earlier this year,
Barak rightly demanded changes in the party's leadership, including
the removal of its corrupt head, Aryeh Deri. Shas has also agreed
to management changes in its school system and will now accept
closer government supervision of its secular curriculum and teacher
credentials. But Shas' reforms have not yet gone far enough. The
pattern of this week's crisis suggests that Shas may continue to
threaten the future of peace negotiations and alienate more
responsible members of Barak's coalition. Israel's Orthodox
Sephardim are entitled to wiser political representation.  &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 30:
</P>
<P>
   For all the people wondering how to celebrate the turn of a
century that also turns a millennium, the greatest wonder is that
there are so many people still alive to think about it. The dawning
wonder _ and also worry, for those concerned about the quality of
old age and the allocation of resources _ is how many babies born
this centennial may still be alive for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand years ago the average person hardly had time to
wrinkle before life winked out, at 30 or 32. It would take 900 more
years for life expectancy to extend by half, so slowly did learning
about the body grow. It was in ancient Egypt that medicine first
divided into specialties. But in the farms and towns of Europe in
the Middle Ages, life was still stunted by diseases passed from the
animals and animal wastes that people dwelled among. Behind the
walls of monasteries, where knowledge lived, little more was known
about human biology and the various ways in which death teased upon
it than Hippocrates had theorized in the fourth and fifth centuries
B.C., or than Galen learned by dissecting a Barbary ape in the
second century A.D. The interiors of apes, it turned out, differ in
important ways from those of people. The methodical exploration of
the bones and organs and vasculature of humans did not begin until
about the time the Spanish set out to find another way to China and
bumped into a peninsula they called Florida, where they searched in
vain for the Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   Now some people have begun to wonder if perhaps science is not
on the verge of finding it. New faces, new hair, new curves,
flatter surfaces, focused minds, dispelled depressions,
transplanted lungs and kidneys, plastic hips, collagen lips, knees,
libidos _ Viagra! Thanks to better public hygiene and drugs to cure
infection, the average life expectancy, about 45 in 1900, has
extended in this century to almost 78. Many more people live to
greater age, and once old, resurface and repair themselves in ways
that past generations could not imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet refurbishment is not revitalization. Medical knowledge, in
effect, has created a new stage of life _ an extended old age. But
because science brought it into being before all the attendant
social and ethical questions could be answered, it is an age whose
quality, effect on the larger culture and true end are still
unknown. Rather than a place of youth, Florida has become a leisure
and withering ground for the old, a vision of what countries with
aging populations have in store. For the old themselves, for their
families and caregivers and for social scientists and politicians,
feelings of a mixed blessing abound.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States and other nations, the issues are huge.
How best to use these new old years? How to pay for them? It is not
just that people are getting older. Their working lives are
shorter. American men retire five years earlier than in 1950. Men
who used to die not long after they quit working now routinely live
another decade, women a decade and a half. People today often live
almost as long in retirement as they did in youth before they
worked. But the later years can be a stressful state. The honored
generation of the Great Depression and World War II, now deep in
its 80s, has discovered the diseases so prevalent in a newly common
old age: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, diabetes _
and heart attacks, which were still unrecorded in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Their children, drawn into the illness drama, have made a sad
discovery of their own. Medical science, which easily extends life
beyond the point at which it is still physically or intellectually
active, has created a painfully common new question: Who has the
right to end it?
</P>
<P>
   The ante, as poker players say, is going up. This century and
millennium close by chance on a transitional moment, between what
we know and the enormously greater sum of what we are about to
know. It is beneath the surface of existence, in the genetic
substructure of the human cell itself, that the intense lamp of
science now shines. The genetic engineering revolution comes at a
time when the largest generation in history is still young enough
to hope that its last decades can be extended by that knowledge. We
are within a few score years of knowing ways to prevent, treat or
cure many of the major illnesses of old age _ perhaps even of
knowing the outer limits of old age itself.
</P>
<P>
   Already the children of the boomers are growing up without a
fixed sense of the natural limits of life. They, their parents and
their children could coexist in a glut of healthful longevity such
as the world has never known. We cannot conceive what competition
that will provoke among generations for resources. The likelihood
is that many of us will live to know.

REALNETWORKS SUIT DEFENDS ITS COPYRIGHT ON AUDIO FILES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (js) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what could be a precedent-setting case in Internet copyright
law, RealNetworks Inc., whose products deliver audio, video and
other media content over the Web, is suing a company that makes
software that converts RealNetworks' products into the format
marketed by its rival, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks' suit accuses the company, Streambox Inc., of
violating several laws intended to protect intellectual property,
including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The suit is based
on a part of the act largely untested since it was enacted in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district judge in Seattle, where RealNetworks is
based, has issued a temporary restraining order preventing
Streambox from developing, producing or selling the software. A
hearing is scheduled for Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Streambox, based in Redmond, Wash., is primarily a Web site and
search engine that competes with RealNetworks' site. At issue in
the suit, though, are two software products, Streambox Ripper and
Streambox VCR, both of which the company began distributing in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Streambox Ripper enables users to copy compact discs to their
hard drives or to download music from the Internet, but it also has
the ability to crack the security features of RealNetworks'
RealAudio files and convert them to MP3, WAV or Windows Media
formats. Streambox VCR can intercept and play audio or video
programming from RealNetworks' secure servers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hildeman, Streambox's chief executive, said that his company
licenses Microsoft's technology and had purchased software known as
a ``developer's kit'' to enable its programmers to encode audio and
video content so that they can be played on Microsoft's Windows
Media Player. But he said Streambox had no other business
relationship with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, RealNetworks said that the products violated
copyright law because they circumvent the copyright protection
measures built into RealNetworks' multimedia files and can convert
them into digital formats that can be copied, stored and freely
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also contends that the Streambox Ferret, a plug-in
search engine designed to work with RealPlayer, violates
RealNetworks' copyright by changing the appearance of RealPlayer on
the screen and interferes with a contract between RealNetworks and
Snap.com, under which Snap's search service is built in to
RealPlayer. Snap.com is an Internet portal site owned jointly by
Cnet and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Streambox argues that it is merely providing consumers with a
choice of services and allowing them to choose the format in which
their music is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who should control the file format? Is it content owners and
consumers, or RealNetworks?'' Hildeman asked. ``The Internet is a
consumer medium, and technology must consider consumers' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the software did not circumvent systems that
require users to pay before they download files. It merely converts
one file format into another.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jaszi, a professor specializing in copyright law at
American University in Washington, said that the issue was whether
RealNetworks had the right to sue since the material that Ripper
translates is copyrighted not by RealNetworks but by its customers,
who license the software to publish their own multimedia products.
</P>
<P>
   The more important issue, he said, is that the court is being
asked to decide what technological protection measures are covered
by the copyright act, which makes it illegal to circumvent
technological copyright protections.
</P>
<P>
   Jaszi said that it was arguable that the primary goal of
RealNetworks' security is to protect the exclusivity of its own
distribution system. ``The system is really designed to protect a
delivery format but incidentally protects copyright,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry, which is struggling with growing threats of
digital piracy, is siding with RealNetworks. ``It's unfortunate
that Streambox has apparently decided to try and build a business
by selling hacking tools designed to undermine Real Networks'
support for creators,'' said Susan Lewis, a spokeswoman for the
Recording Industry Association of America.

JUDGE RULES TEXAS ABORTION LICENSING LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge barred Texas from enforcing a new law
that expands licensing requirements for abortion doctors, ruling it
unconstitutional on two counts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Rainey said the 1999 amendments to the
Abortion Facility Reporting and Licensing Act violate the equal
protection clause of the U.S. Constitution and are
unconstitutionally vague.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which took effect Sept. 1, requires individual doctors'
offices to be licensed if the physician performs more than 300
abortions a year. It also upgrades the criminal liability of those
who operate abortion clinics without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey granted the temporary injunction after a two-day hearing
on the new law's background and effects.
</P>
<P>
   Standards are high for granting even temporary injunctions, and
Rainey had to be convinced that:
</P>
<P>
   --The plaintiffs would likely prevail at trial.
</P>
<P>
   --The plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without the
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   --The harm to the plaintiffs exceeds potential harm to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   --The injunction would not be a disservice to the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey's order stands, pending a response from Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn. If the state appeals, a trial will likely be
held.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Texas Department of Health Commissioner
William Archer III declined comment on Rainey's order.
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for the group of physicians who filed the
lawsuit said the judge's decision removes a substantial roadblock
for Texas women seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great victory for physicians'' and their patients, said
attorney Craig Smyser. ``Come Jan. 1, 2000, they can continue to
practice medicine as they always have.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical clinics in Houston, Denton and Austin, as well as five
individual physicians, challenged the law in October, contending
that it violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution
and patients' rights to due process.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey agreed that the law is unconstitutional because it sets
physicians who perform abortions apart from those who perform other
outpatient surgeries, violating their right to equal protection
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the law contains three provisions
unconstitutionally vague, requiring physicians to:
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that patients are cared for in a manner that enhances
their dignity.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that patients receive care that maintains their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure quality care, defined as ``the degree to which care
meets or exceeds the expectations set by the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rainey took issue with the doctors' contention that the
statute deprives patients of their due process rights under the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the physicians had maintained that the legislation was
developed for the constitutionally invalid purpose of placing a
substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking abortions, Rainey
said the evidence was to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Current regulations appear to have been spawned by health
concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Sept. 1, state law provided an exemption from licensing
for physicians whose practice included less than 51 percent to
performing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The new law not only expands licensure requirements, it also
makes it a Class A misdemeanor, instead of Class C, to operate an
unlicensed abortion facility. That increases the penalty from a
$400 fine to a possible jail term of up to one year and a $4,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey said department data indicate that 12 doctors statewide
(20 percent of the abortion providers) must obtain licenses under
the new law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, more than 84,000 abortions were performed in Texas at
31 licensed abortion facilities by fewer than 30 physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed facilities must meet strict mandates on equipment,
credentialing and training of personnel, be inspected every year,
and pay a $2,500 application fee.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Vatterott, a board member of Life Advocates, said the law
is needed to protect women's health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Crepps, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive
Law &AMP; Policy, said a woman's right to an abortion is being
challenged by several states under the guise of health-facility
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which is funding the lawsuit in Texas, recently got
a similar South Carolina law struck down. It required licensure in
places that performed more than five abortions a month.
</P>
<P>
   Crepps said a federal judge in Greenville, S.C., ruled that the
law violated patient privacy laws and the equal protection clause
of the U.S. Constitutio NO CARRIER

   Deputy quits after allegations of abuse
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Eckhart
</P>
<P>
   NYT Regional Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   In a jealous rage, Charlotte County sheriff's Deputy First Class
Thomas Martin once grabbed a girlfriend by the hair and threw her
to the ground, breaking her wrists with the force of his
6-foot-6-inch frame, according to an internal affairs report by the
sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   He told her to lie to hospital officials and sheriff's office
investigators who asked about her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The report says he threatened to kill her if she told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he slipped a bite sleeve over one of her casts and
ordered his police dog to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a 13-year veteran, resigned Dec. 6 after being
confronted with the report, which details a decade of abuse. It
contains accusations from six women, including his ex-wife, who
dated Martin and said they feared for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Martin met one of them when he was sent to her house to break up
a domestic dispute with her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   The women are named in the report, but their identities are
being withheld by the Herald-Tribune because they are victims of
domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's spokesman Chuck Ellis said it's likely Martin would
have been fired had he not resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty much found guilty of all the offenses that were
brought against him,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office has conducted two internal investigations
of Martin in the past _ one after he made an obscene hand gesture
at an ex-girlfriend while in uniform, another after he allegedly
pulled out a gun and pointed it at his own head in a restaurant
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   He received a reprimand for the hand gesture. The girlfriend
involved in the parking lot incident told investigators that she
lied when internal affairs asked about it, and about the casts on
her wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's fellow deputies know him by his nickname, ``Lurch.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report:
</P>
<P>
   Martin once pushed a girlfriend out of his truck while it was
moving because she refused to take off her makeup as he drove her
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Martin would park his patrol car in front of their homes for
hours while he was on duty. One girlfriend said he would pull her
over with his patrol car just for fun when he saw her on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Another girlfriend said he would put sticks behind the wheels of
her car, so he would know if she left home.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that even while on duty he would walk up and down
the aisles of the grocery store where she worked to make sure she
wasn't too friendly with her coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   His ex-wife told investigators that Martin ordered her to do her
chores around the family farm, then stay in her room with the
telephone off the hook until he got home.
</P>
<P>
   He barred one girlfriend from wearing red because he thought it
made her look like a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   He racked up an $800 cellular phone bill for another girlfriend
with constant calls to find out where she was and who she was
seeing.
</P>
<P>
   He told another he knew where to put a body with a bag of lime
so that it would never be found.
</P>
<P>
   When they irked him, the girlfriends say, he would spit in their
faces and call them foul names, or he would tell them about his gun
with the red laser sighter _ the one that could ``blow away''
whatever the beam rested on.
</P>
<P>
   When they threatened to leave him, he cried and pulled out his
gun, threatening to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   While working for the sheriff's ca nine unit, he took a
girlfriend with him to a canine competition in Pensacola. Angry
because the dog did poorly, he strangled it until she thought it
would die.
</P>
<P>
   The report is more than 300 pages detailing similar incidents
alleged by the six women. It includes a chart that lists victims
and a check list for allegations such as psychological abuse,
abusive language, spitting in face, and threatening suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began Nov. 4, after Martin confronted
sheriff's Cpl. Terry Minns at the Port Charlotte Beach Complex.
Minns was talking to one of Martin's ex-girlfriends, a mutual
acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   Martin cursed at both of them and refused to step out from in
front of Minns' car, challenging the other deputy to step out of
the vehicle, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   When Minns was dispatched to a convenience store several miles
away during the confrontation, Martin followed him to the store and
continued to berate him, even though it was out of his service
area.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was also investigated for disrespecting his superiors in
the sheriff's office, neglect of duty and conduct unbecoming a
peace officer.

REPORT SAYS MOST OFFICERS CITED FOR BRUTALITY OR MISCONDUCT ARE NOT
PUNISHED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since 1996, the New York Police Department has
disciplined police officers in only 24 percent of the cases of
brutality and other misconduct substantiated by the civilian agency
that investigates complaints from the public, a report released
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
   Using data provided by the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review
Board, the New York Civil Liberties Union determined that of 1,543
complaints substantiated by the board and referred to police
officials for discipline, only 371 resulted in an officer being
punished. In the other cases, either the department did not find
the officer guilty, did not impose punishment or has still not
acted on the complaint. The Civil Liberties Union's report, which
tabulated the outcome of review board cases from January 1996
through June 1999, said that 48 percent of the substantiated cases
in those 3 1-2 years remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that in three of four cases in which disciplinary
action was taken between January 1998 and June 1999, the punishment
was relatively minor, ranging from the loss of vacation days to a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   To the Civil Liberties Union, the findings are evidence that the
Police Department has failed to act on most cases referred to it by
the 6-year-old board, which reviews several thousand complaints a
year and forwards hundreds it substantiates to the department for
resolution. The report's authors say the result is that the board
has remained an ineffectual agency that has failed to live up to
the dreams of those who fought for the establishment of an
independent body to investigate police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still do not have in New York an effective, independent
civilian review,'' said Norman Siegel, the civil liberties group's
executive director, who was a leader of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Police Commissioner Howard Safir has praised
the board as an effective agency, saying that fresh leadership and
increased funding have reinvigorated it. Wednesday he harshly
criticized the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Siegel looked,'' he said, ``he would find that we
discipline officers in the highest percentage of cases ever in the
department, and we continue to do that, and we take it very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that the department's relationship with the board had
improved significantly. ``The quality of cases coming out of the
CCRB has improved,'' he said, ``which gives me the ability to
impose discipline on cases that have evidence, which was not always
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The report contends that Safir and by extension Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani have in recent months been gracious in their assessment of
the review board to deflect federal prosecutors in Brooklyn who
have been investigating whether the police department has failed to
aggressively punish officers implicated in brutality cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department did not respond Wednesday to a request for
data to rebut the report. But Frank Wohl, the board's chairman,
said the 1998 figures used in the report showed that 75 of 102
cases closed by police officials that year ended in an officer's
being disciplined, a vast improvement over previous years. In 1996,
only 110 out of 332 cases ended in discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The report did acknowledge that there had been an increase in
discipline this year, with the department's meting out punishment
in 136 of 247 substantiated cases, a 55 percent rate. But Siegel
said that as of Nov. 1, the police had failed to act on 707
substantiated cases, some of them involving complaints filed years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a system that takes four to five years to find
out what happened to a complaint,'' he said.

EX-POLICE COMMISSIONER RELISHES BEING BACK IN HUNT FOR TERRORISTS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six years after stepping down as New York City's
police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly finds himself playing cop
again _ this time as commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, with
a mission that includes tracking down terrorists who might try to
cross the borders in time for this week's millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like I never really left the beat,'' said Kelly, who
ran the New York City Police Department when terrorists bombed the
World Trade Center in 1993, the last deadly attack by foreign
terrorists on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the Customs Service seems to have proved
that the potential millennium threat is real. On Dec. 14, customs
inspectors arrested an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, as he crossed
from Canada into Washington state. Prosecutors said his car was
packed with a nitroglycerine-like chemical and other bomb-making
components; he had a reservation at a motel in Seattle near the
Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle officials later canceled the public celebration there
because of security concerns. And five days after Ressam's arrest,
customs agents in Vermont detained two people who have since been
tied by prosecutors to Algerian militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly speaks somberly of what the arrests might suggest. ``We've
got to be concerned,'' he said, his stocky, compact frame and thick
New York accent bringing Jimmy Cagney to mind. ``I think you've got
to be realistic. You can't sugarcoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly knows what terrorists bent on slaughter can do. He
recalled rushing to the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, when a
bomb unleashed a fireball, killing six people and leaving a
seven-story crater where a parking garage had been. ``The thing I
remember most vividly,'' he said, ``was looking down and seeing
this hole, this huge hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But every so often, the solemnity in Kelly's voice gives way to
his obvious excitement at how the Customs Service, among the least
glamorous of law enforcement agencies, has found itself on the
front lines of the war against terrorism. ``Yes, absolutely, I feel
energized, invigorated,'' he said. He is convinced that the
professionalism of his agents in Washington state prevented a
terrorist attack. ``There's no question about it. They're heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest prompted President Clinton to announce a heightened
state of alert for federal law enforcement agencies. In the last
two weeks, Kelly has added 500 inspectors to border stations.
``Will there be more searches? Yes,'' he said. ``Will there be more
interviews with people? Yes. Are there going to be some delays?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   This whirlwind of excitement is a reminder of why he told
Clinton last year that he wanted to run the Customs Service. It was
technically a demotion from his last job, as the Treasury
Department's undersecretary for enforcement, a post in which he
supervised not only the Customs Service but also the Secret Service
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a step down, but it was an inside-the-beltway step
down,'' he said. ``Undersecretary was a policy job, and that's
fine, and I enjoyed it. But this is more fun. This is a law
enforcement organization. I feel more comfortable here. I'm much
more comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   There were worries earlier this year that Kelly might have to
cut short his tenure. In June, he had a heart bypass operation.
``This was a shock to me,'' said Kelly, a 58-year-old Marine Corps
veteran who always prided himself on staying in shape. He was back
at work within days of the surgery and has resumed his daily visits
to the gym in his condominium complex, spending 40 minutes on a
treadmill before hitting the weights.
</P>
<P>
   As New York's police commissioner, Kelly had a resume drawn up
by central casting. The youngest of five children, he was raised in
a building at Columbus Avenue and 91st Street in Manhattan _ ``It's
now a McDonald's,'' he says with a sigh _ before moving to Queens
as a teen-ager. His father, a milkman, later worked for the
Internal Revenue Service. His one sister worked in the fashion
industry before retiring. Like his three brothers, Kelly joined the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to civilian life after fighting in Vietnam. While
working in the stockroom in the baby clothes department at Macy's,
Kelly saw a recruiting ad for the police. He registered at the
Police Academy, graduating first in a class of 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure as police commissioner was brief _ only 18 months _
but Kelly was praised for his performance, both for the overall
decline in the crime rate and for his sensitivity to racial
concerns. Jimmy Breslin, the newspaper columnist, described him as
``a city treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he had long wondered what else he might have
accomplished had Mayor Rudolph Giuliani not decided, shortly after
his election in November 1993, to find a new commissioner.
``Giuliani had the absolute right to pick his own police
commissioner,'' he said. ``But crime was down every day on my
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   He still sees plenty of New York, where his wife, who sells
medical equipment, lives in their apartment in Battery Park City in
Lower Manhattan. ``We have a commuting deal, and she'll come down
to Washington virtually every weekend if I don't go up,'' he said.
He is always glad to go up. ``I'm a New Yorker,'' he said. ``That's
my home.''

EDITORIAL: WATCHING FOR THE Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, historians will be fascinated by the combination
of arduous planning, breathless hype and stubborn indifference that
have gone into preparations for the computer glitch known as the
Y2K bug. By now it seems clear to experts who have followed the
saga that when the new year arrives Friday night, the most dire
predictions of crises in computer systems in this country will not
come to pass. Air travel and the banking system are expected to
continue uninterrupted, and there will probably not be widespread
power failures. Americans may need to brace for inconveniences and
localized problems, but the worst potential disasters are expected
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   As almost everyone knows, the Y2K snag is expected to occur
because some computers may shut down or misfire when their internal
clocks fail to recognize the year 2000. Many of the preparations
have been extremely impressive. American businesses and government
have spent an estimated $100 billion to get ready for Y2K problems,
and tens of thousands of Americans will be working this weekend to
cope with crises as they unfold. The federal government reports
that Medicare and Social Security payments will go out, and defense
readiness has been checked and rechecked.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts are most alarmed by the lack of preparations
abroad. Russia, China, Italy, several oil-producing states and many
more developing countries with aging computer systems could face
major disruptions. Russia is an obvious worry because of its
nuclear weapons, though Russian leaders insist they have everything
under control.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what will happen when U.S. computer systems that
have been fixed interface with systems that have gone haywire,
either in this country or elsewhere. It may take days or weeks to
determine that the globe's vast network of electronic systems is
home free.
</P>
<P>
   A second problem is that many if not most small businesses in
the United States, and many local governments, school districts and
homeowners, have simply not heeded warnings to check their systems.
Another difficulty relates to equipment with so-called embedded
computer chips. Because of all these factors, experts say, schools,
hospitals, nursing homes, transit systems and small or medium-sized
businesses face potential stoppages and delays in their vital
functions.
</P>
<P>
   At the stroke of midnight, amid fears of terrorism and computer
breakdowns, we will listen expectantly to the news, hoping for the
best. Even those of us who have not filled the bathtub with
emergency water, withdrawn extra cash from the bank and stocked up
on food will be entering the new millennium sobered by the
awareness that unknown problems of our own making are an enduring
part of existence. &QL;

IRVING RAPPER, WHO DIRECTED FILM CLASSICS, DIES AT 101  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Irving Rapper, whose 50-year directorial career reached its peak
at the Warner Brothers studio in the 1940s when he made a series of
films with Bette Davis and who frequently drew upon his early stage
experiences to adapt Broadway hits to the screen, died Dec. 20 at
the Motion Picture and Television Fund home in Woodland Hills, a
suburb northwest of Los Angeles. He was 101.
</P>
<P>
   Some directors are remembered for a distinctive voice, some for
exploring specific genres, others for long associations with a
stable of favorite actors. Rapper is best known for a single scene:
In ``Now, Voyager'' (1942), he had Paul Henreid light two
cigarettes then nonchalantly hand one to Bette Davis, a move that
struck audiences of the day as so suave and sensuous that it became
one of the most replayed and parodied moments in screen history.
</P>
<P>
   Many wondered where the inspiration for it came. Henreid once
took credit for dreaming up the move. Another actor who worked with
the director, George Brent, said he had done the same thing in an
earlier film. Rapper merely pointed out that the moment was drawn
directly from the original story upon with the film was based.
</P>
<P>
   Rapper was born in London in 1898, but moved with his family to
New York when he was 8. As a student at New York University, he
initially studied law but gradually became more interested in the
theater, first as an actor but later as a director and stage
manager. Some of his early successes on Broadway in the late 1920s
and early '30s drew the attention of the Warner Brothers studio,
which invited Rapper to move to California and begin an
apprenticeship there.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned initially to work with the director William
Dieterle and was an assistant director and dialogue coach on such
prestige productions of the period as ``The Story of Louis
Pasteur'' (1936), ``The Life of Emile Zola'' (1937) and ``Juarez''
(1939), all starring Paul Muni. The studio promoted him to director
in 1941 and his first film was ``Shining Victory,'' like many of
his works an adaptation of a stage play, in this case a romantic
drama by A.J. Cronin about a scientist and his adoring assistant.
Rapper's second film _ ``One Foot in Heaven'' (1941) _ was even
more positively received and starred Fredric March as a young
minister grappling with the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   It was the next year that Rapper began the most fruitful
artistic collaboration of his career, first directing Ms. Davis in
``Now, Voyager,'' the story of a repressed woman whose erotic and
romantic nature is reawakened through psychotherapy. Both Ms. Davis
and Gladys Cooper, who played her mother, received Academy Award
nominations for their work in the film. Rapper later worked with
Ms. Davis on ``The Corn Is Green'' (1945), ``Deception'' (1946) and
``Another Man's Poison'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a powerful actress and a powerful dame,'' Rapper told
an interviewer in 1977. ``We had our differences, but they were
always settled without interference from the front office. I think
they were afraid of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rapper was never a favorite of the critics, he
continued to draw high profile assignments _ ``The Adventures of
Mark Twain'' (1944), with Fredric March playing the author;
``Rhapsody in Blue'' (1945), with Robert Alda and Herbert Rudley
playing George and Ira Gershwin, and ``Voice of the Turtle''
(1947), an adaptation of a Broadway comedy, with Ronald Reagan and
Eleanor Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapper now let his contract with Warners expire, and while he
would work for the studio again he never reached the modest heights
he attained as their employee,'' wrote Michael Barson in ``The
Illustrated Who's Who of Hollywood Directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Rapper's later films was the 1950 film adaptation of
Tennessee Williams' ``Glass Menagerie,'' starring Jane Wyman and
Kirk Douglas, and the 1958 adaptation of ``Marjorie Morningstar,''
a Herman Wouk best seller about the romance between an aspiring
actress (Natalie Wood) and an aging stage director (Gene Kelly).
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best film he directed in this period was ``The
Brave One'' (1956), the story of a young Mexican boy who tries to
keep his pet bull out of the ring. The film is best known as the
one for which Dalton Trumbo, then still-blacklisted, was given an
Academy Award under the pseudonym of Robert Rich, an award that he
did not actually collect for almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Rapper did some work in Europe, returning to the
United States in the 70's for his two final films, neither of which
was well-received, ``The Christine Jorgensen Story'' in 1970, about
the tennis player who had a sex-change operation, and ``Born
Again'' in 1978, based on the book by the Watergate conspirator
Chuck Colson about his prison conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Rapper had been living at the fund's nursing home in Woodland
Hills since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the height of his career in the mid-40s, Rapper once
said he had few illusions about his ranking among other directors
or even his relationship with his most famous collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   He once recalled escorting the mercurial Ms. Davis to a concert
where a number of Hollywood's top directors would be in attendance.
``I said, `Bette, I'm nervous about mixing with all those guys,'
and she said, `Irving Rapper, if I didn't think you were better
than every one of them, would I be here with you in this car right
now?' And then, the next day, she would say, `Irving? Irving
who?'''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John J. Geoghegan, an editor and publisher who acquired ``The
Spy Who Came In From the Cold,'' by John le Carre, and the Pulitzer
prize-winning biography ``The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,'' by
Edmund Morris, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Walnut Creek, Ca.
</P>
<P>
   Geoghegan, 82, died of complications from a brain aneurysm, said
his wife, Carole.
</P>
<P>
   When Geoghegan resigned as chairman of Coward, McCann &AMP;
Geoghegan in 1981, it was after issuing an indictment of ``the
corporate business school mentality'' that he said was then taking
over book publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going gentle into that good night,'' Geoghegan said.
``I want to go out with my guns smoking.'' He added: ``What's
coming into publishing are finance and administration guys telling
editors what kind of products and what kind of marketing will be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoghegan thus became one of the first industry executives to
criticize publicly the dominance of sales and marketing people in
book publishing positions that had formerly been occupied by those
from the editorial ranks. What specifically rankled Geoghegan, who
spent 14 years on the road as a book salesman, was the direction
that publishing took early in the 1980s, a decade marked by
acquisitions, mergers and liquidations.
</P>
<P>
   A medium-size publishing house founded in 1927, Coward-McCann
(as it was known until Geoghegan's name was added in 1971) was
acquired by G.P. Putnam's in 1936 but continued as an independent
operation even for a few years after Putnam's was acquired in 1975
by MCA, the entertainment conglomerate. Through the years it
published authors like Thornton Wilder, Edward Albee, Jack Kerouac,
Alexander Woolcott, Muriel Spark, Kate Millett and William Golding.
</P>
<P>
   Known to friends and acquaintances as Jack, Geoghegan, who was
born in Philadelphia and served in the Army Air Corps from 1942 to
1945, joined Coward-McCann in 1959 as editor in chief. Two years
later he was named president, then chairman. After a 1981 shake-up
at the company in which a relative newcomer who had come up through
the ranks of finance and administration was installed as president,
Geoghegan (by then the longtime chairman) said, ``I'm concerned
about the fate of the independent imprint under the corporate
umbrella, and what's happened here seems to signal the death of
that kind of publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1988, Geoghegan
told of acquiring the le Carre book on his first trip to London in
search of books for his firm to publish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a hit badly,'' he wrote. ``I had not long been in
charge of my modest-sized New York firm, Coward-McCann, once well
thought of but more recently fallen on difficult times. It was my
task to turn the house around, repair its fortunes _ in short, find
some writers of talent whose books would sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later he returned to New York empty-handed. However,
the next year he receive a submission from a London literary agent
who described it as ``an interesting thriller.'' Submitting a bid
together with a plan to promote the book, Geoghegan won out over
another American publishing house and made it the company's big
book for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But the book by the unknown pseudonymous author ( le Carre's
real name is David Cornwell) failed to take off until Orville
Prescott, a book reviewer for The New York Times, wrote that it may
be the best spy story ``anybody has ever read.'' After that it
sailed onto The Times best-seller list, strengthening the fortunes
of the author and his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Maggie
Geoghegan-Bedecarre of Lafayette, Cal.; two sons, Michael and
Peter, both of Norwalk, Conn.; a stepson, Arthur E. de Cordova III,
of Westport, Conn.; and two sisters, Betty Gantz of Glenside, Pa.,
and Frances Love of Cornwall, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from what he termed ``the literary wars,''
Geoghegan became an editor at large with William Morrow &AMP; Co.,
eventually moving to Boca Grande, Fla., with his wife, where he
wrote a column of musings for The Boca Beacon. Last summer they
moved to Walnut Creek, Cal., to be near their daughter, son-in-law
and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Le Carre, speaking Wednesday from his home in Cornwall, England,
said: ``Jack was a completely self-taught literary man, and the
salesman and dreamer and romantic in him all combined. He promoted
this book brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   When le Carre yielded to Geoghegan's pleas to come to New York
to publicize ``The Spy Who Came In From the Cold,'' the author did
what he said successful young authors do when suddenly overwhelmed
by money and fame:
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into a depression,'' le Carre said. ``So Jack seized me
by the collar, took me to Grand Central Station, pointed out these
huge masses of people going home from work and said, `What you've
done is you touched the heart of these people, and that's what it's
all about.' He was right. I had the book and he had the vision. And
we shared that magic moment.''

TITO GUIZAR, MEXICO'S SINGING COWBOY OF STAGE AND SCREEN, DIES AT
91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Tito Guizar, the limpid-eyed singer and actor who
brought Mexican cowboy music to New York and opened the way for
Mexican performers in Hollywood, died on Friday in San Antonio. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Guizar was the first and most enduring of Mexico's singing
charros, as the cowboys in broad-brimmed sombreros and bolero
jackets are known. His career, which ranged from performing and
composing music for films, theater and television, spanned more
than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Arturo Guizar Tolentino, who went by his stage name,
Tito, was born on April 8, 1908, in Guadalajara. He began to train
as a singer over the objections of a stern Catholic father and soon
caught the eye of Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta, the founder of
Mexico's largest media empire. To entice him away from a competing
record company, Azcarraga sent Guizar to New York in 1929 to record
songs written by Agustin Lara, a beginning songwriter who would go
on to become one of Mexico's most prominent composers.
</P>
<P>
   Guizar lived in New York for six years, singing in private clubs
and performing on his own radio show, in Spanish, called ``Tito
Guizar y Su Guitarra'' (``Tito Guizar and His Guitar''). He studied
with several opera teachers but took greater delight in crooning
and yodeling the melancholy tunes originating in the Mexican cattle
state of Jalisco that are known as ranchera music.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 he was married in New York to Carmen Noriega, also a
Mexican singer. He later described their life together as ``an
idyll'' that ended only with his wife's death 58 years later.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1930s Guizar, a tenor, performed several times in
Carnegie Hall. Invited to sing opera, he insisted on dressing for
the second half of his show in a sombrero and tight pants with
silver buttons cascading down the sides, to sing ranchera ballads.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he returned to Mexico to play the lead in the film that
would inaugurate a new genre of singing charro movies: ``Alla en el
Rancho Grande'' (``Out There on the Big Ranch''). The film was an
immediate classic in Mexico and was also the first Mexican film to
transcend the country's borders, playing well in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After that Guizar learned English and became one of the first
Mexican actors invited to appear in Hollywood movies. He starred
alongside Roy Rogers, Dorothy Lamour, Ray Milland and Mae West.
Recently he estimated that he had made more than 50 movies in
either Mexico or the United States. In 1995 he played a grandfather
in a nighttime soap opera on Mexican television.
</P>
<P>
   Guizar is survived by a son, Tito; two daughters, Nina and
Lilia, and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorously cheerful and in strong voice until the end of his
life, Guizar is remembered for his trademark philosophy: ``The past
is dust and the future a passing breeze. If you want to be happy,
live for the moment.''

(RESENDING TO RESTORE GARBELD TYPE) 
 
JUDGE RULES TEXAS ABORTION LICENSING LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge barred Texas from enforcing a new law
that expands licensing requirements for abortion doctors, ruling it
unconstitutional on two counts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Rainey said the 1999 amendments to the
Abortion Facility Reporting and Licensing Act violate the equal
protection clause of the U.S. Constitution and are
unconstitutionally vague.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which took effect Sept. 1, requires individual doctors'
offices to be licensed if the physician performs more than 300
abortions a year. It also upgrades the criminal liability of those
who operate abortion clinics without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey granted the temporary injunction after a two-day hearing
on the new law's background and effects.
</P>
<P>
   Standards are high for granting even temporary injunctions, and
Rainey had to be convinced that:
</P>
<P>
   --The plaintiffs would likely prevail at trial.
</P>
<P>
   --The plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without the
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   --The harm to the plaintiffs exceeds potential harm to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   --The injunction would not be a disservice to the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey's order stands, pending a response from Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn. If the state appeals, a trial will likely be
held.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Texas Department of Health Commissioner
William Archer III declined comment on Rainey's order.
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for the group of physicians who filed the
lawsuit said the judge's decision removes a substantial roadblock
for Texas women seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great victory for physicians'' and their patients, said
attorney Craig Smyser. ``Come Jan. 1, 2000, they can continue to
practice medicine as they always have.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical clinics in Houston, Denton and Austin, as well as five
individual physicians, challenged the law in October, contending
that it violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution
and patients' rights to due process.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey agreed that the law is unconstitutional because it sets
physicians who perform abortions apart from those who perform other
outpatient surgeries, violating their right to equal protection
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the law contains three provisions
unconstitutionally vague, requiring physicians to:
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that patients are cared for in a manner that enhances
their dignity.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that patients receive care that maintains their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure quality care, defined as ``the degree to which care
meets or exceeds the expectations set by the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rainey took issue with the doctors' contention that the
statute deprives patients of their due process rights under the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the physicians had maintained that the legislation was
developed for the constitutionally invalid purpose of placing a
substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking abortions, Rainey
said the evidence was to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Current regulations appear to have been spawned by health
concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Sept. 1, state law provided an exemption from licensing
for physicians whose practice included less than 51 percent to
performing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The new law not only expands licensure requirements, it also
makes it a Class A misdemeanor, instead of Class C, to operate an
unlicensed abortion facility. That increases the penalty from a
$400 fine to a possible jail term of up to one year and a $4,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey said department data indicate that 12 doctors statewide
(20 percent of the abortion providers) must obtain licenses under
the new law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, more than 84,000 abortions were performed in Texas at
31 licensed abortion facilities by fewer than 30 physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed facilities must meet strict mandates on equipment,
credentialing and training of personnel, be inspected every year,
and pay a $2,500 application fee.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Vatterott, a board member of Life Advocates, said the law
is needed to protect women's health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Crepps, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive
Law &AMP; Policy, said a woman's right to an abortion is being
challenged by several states under the guise of health-facility
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which is funding the lawsuit in Texas, recently got
a similar South Carolina law struck down. It required licensure in
places that performed more than five abortions a month.
</P>
<P>
   Crepps said a federal judge in Greenville, S.C., ruled that the
law violated patient privacy laws and the equal protection clause
of the U.S. Constitution.

   Fugitive Venice banker favored poker at Las Vegas casinos
</P>
<P>
   By Margaret Ann Miille
</P>
<P>
   NYT Regional Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Jerry McWhorter was a cliche here.
</P>
<P>
   Just another drifter milling through casinos, just another
fugitive heeding the call of the cards.
</P>
<P>
   He attracted little notice as he migrated between poker rooms at
the Bellagio and Mirage casinos along the glitzy strip. Nor did he
command much attention at Binion's Horseshoe on Fremont Street, the
city's original gambling mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Few locals knew the name of the man federal agents arrested here
two weeks ago, claiming he had disappeared 10 months earlier with
$1.26 million from the Venice bank where he was chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Some players and casino dealers vaguely recalled him from two
photos. One shows him as a clean-shaven executive in a suit; the
other, taken in April when Las Vegas police cited him for driving
with a stolen Oklahoma license plate, shows him bearded, dressed in
casual clothes and a hat.
</P>
<P>
   The photos illustrate the disparate lives of Jerry Pharr
McWhorter.
</P>
<P>
   There was the trustworthy executive vice president and cashier,
the devoted husband of 25 years and father of two sons, the
unassuming man who rarely varied his routine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the man the feds say methodically bilked Guaranty
Bank &AMP; Trust through a series of wire transfers over seven years,
the solitary figure playing Texas Hold'em at the poker tables, the
fugitive they arrested Dec. 12 after he left the Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his addiction, where else would he have gone?'' said
Kevin Caudle, FBI special agent. ``Everybody ends up in Las Vegas.
I can't think of anything we haven't arrested someone for in this
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents say fugitives _ 835 were arrested here last year
_ are lured to the nation's gambling capital by the illusion of
anonymity among a transient population of 33 million annual
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Although FBI cases of white-collar crime usually involve thefts
ranging from $50,000 to $500,000, the McWhorter case falls short of
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``One point three million is significant, but it certainly isn't
the biggest case we've ever seen,'' Caudle said. ``We have cases
where several millions are missing _ they're usually some form of
investment schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of fugitives preferring Las Vegas to more obscure
towns is that gambling _ Nevada's leading industry _ is heavily
monitored by recessed cameras in casino ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get filmed everywhere you go,'' Caudle said.
</P>
<P>
   (SUBBER)Playing Texas Hold'em
</P>
<P>
   A poker room floor assistant at Binion's vividly recalled seeing
McWhorter at that casino within a week of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Harrison, who as a ``brush'' assigns players to seats,
said McWhorter had asked to be moved to another table in hopes of
changing his luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He commented that he was losing. He got buried, and he wanted
to switch tables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison chatted briefly with McWhorter while he waited for a
spot to open. He remained gracious after Harrison had forgotten
about him in the bustle of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I remember the conversation,'' he said. ``I
apologized, and he took it in stride. He's a nice guy. He treated
me really good; he's really pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said he did not know how much McWhorter had spent at
cards that day or whether he had recovered his losses. But the
stakes weren't high, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter had been playing 4-8 Texas Hold'em. After a minimum
$40 or standard $100 buy into the game, players pay $4 for the
first two bets, $8 for the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the limits they were playing, a couple of hundred is
considered a big loss,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   (SUBBER)Arrested at the Mirage
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter, 56, remains in Las Vegas at Clark County Detention
Center. He declined to be interviewed there by the Herald-Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   He awaits escort by U.S. marshals to Tampa, where he will face
felony charges of bank fraud and embezzlement. Each carries
penalties of up to 30 years in prison, $1 million in fines and five
years of supervised release.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested on a Sunday afternoon by an off-duty IRS agent
who spot ted him in the Mirage playing poker a few tables away. He
followed McWhorter onto a city bus and arrested him after he got
off a few stops later.
</P>
<P>
   While McWhorter's capture ends the hunt by IRS and FBI agents,
it also be gins the process of demystifying his brief career as a
fugitive and his transformation from a methodical businessman to a
nomadic gambler who dared stay in _ or return to _ a city after an
initial brush with police.
</P>
<P>
   His story begins in January 1992 when he made the first of 38
wire transfers that would continue through August 1998. An audit
would later reveal the bank was missing $1.26 million.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, McWhorter learned that his job was going to be
eliminated in February after the sale of Guaranty to F.N.B. Corp.
in Pennsylvania, which merged it into West Coast Bank of Sara sota,
another F.N.B. holding. The bank is now known as West Coast
Guaranty Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion of its data processing system was conducted the
same weekend McWhorter disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Rebecca, last saw him Feb. 13 leaving their Brandon
home. He told her he was going to Naples on business and would call
her later to say where he was staying. She was visiting a friend
out of town that weekend; the couple had agreed to see each other
in the evening three days later.
</P>
<P>
   She never received the call. McWhorter failed to show up at work
on Feb. 16 and was reported missing two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas authorities saw him on April 21, when they pulled him
over for driving his 1996 green Eldorado Cadillac with a stolen
license plate. He told officers he stole it so no one could track
him.
</P>
<P>
   Police cited him on a misdemeanor charge of possessing a stolen
plate. They also listed him on a national database as a missing
person _ that is no crime _ and photographed him as evidence that
he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't arrest him because they didn't know he was a
fugitive; the FBI warrant wasn't issued until nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   After FBI agents learned that local police had detained and
released McWhorter, they decided to nab him at his May 19 hearing
on the stolen plate charge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they alerted Binion's that McWhorter might attend the
30th annual World Series of Poker it was hosting from April 23 to
May 9. Texas Hold'em was the championship game; the winner takes $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is probably the first call we made,'' Caudle said.
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter apparently failed to show at the competition, which
was videotaped. He was also absent at his hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he didn't appear in court, our guys assumed he had
fled,'' Caudle said. ``We quite frankly quit looking for him.''
</P>
<P>
   (SUBBER)An elusive loner
</P>
<P>
   Agents in May checked the address McWhorter gave when police
stopped him: Park South Apartments, a small courtyard building
northeast of the strip. He had sublet a room there from a self-
proclaimed gambling instructor named Tony Tri' Marco, who bills
himself as the ``Einstein'' of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter had already left, presum ably soon after the traffic
stop. Authorities said they did not know how he knew Tri' Marco.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant apartment manager Carole Skirvin said she occasionally
saw McWhorter at a distance, standing alone outside, smoking
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to no one around here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skirvin said she did not know whether McWhorter paid Tri' Marco
for lodging. Apartment rentals there range from $450 to $550
monthly.
</P>
<P>
   When shown photographs of McWhorter, Tri' Marco said he was
unsure whether he recognized him or knew his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have seen him; I'm not really sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said it has recovered no missing funds, nor has it
impounded McWhorter's car. The IRS declined to comment on either
matter; agent Mike Hickey, who arrested McWhorter, would not say
how much cash he had on him when he was booked into jail.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also believe McWhorter was staying in another Las
Vegas home off the strip before his arrest. But he did not
necessarily remain in the city all his days as a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Several professional gamblers noted he may have been among the
many who traveled to poker championships in California and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   (SUBBER)No paper trail
</P>
<P>
   Aside from addresses he gave during encounters with the law,
authorities here say McWhorter left no typical paper trail _ bank
drafts and credit card bills _ from which they could have tracked
his activities.
</P>
<P>
   Another dead end was the credit lines casinos issue to players;
as a rule, they do not provide the same benefit to poker players.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other casino games, such as roulette and blackjack,
players in poker compete against each other and not the house;
thus, casinos have no chance to win back their loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give credit to poker players, because you only
get a rake off what they make,'' said Becky Behnen, owner of
Binion's. ``It would basically be a credit-free loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnings of $10,000 or more also require forms called CTRs, or
cash trans fer requests. But money can be kept on site in security
boxes, which many poker clubs provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he played poker, he probably had a box,'' Behnen said of
McWhorter. ``He could have been living on that box.''
</P>
<P>
   If McWhorter had aspirations of winning the World Series of
Poker, he could not have collected the purse without providing
identification. But the status of winning the most coveted title in
poker itself poses a strong lure, Behnen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Kentucky Derby, the Wimbledon for tennis and the
Masters for golf,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the granddaddy of them all.''
</P>
<P>
   (SUBBER)Call of the cards
</P>
<P>
   Professional gamblers maintain that poker has its own breed of
players, characterized by a combination of heightened intellect,
discipline and intuition corresponding to the level of stakes
played.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is evident in the stacks of money and chips left
unattended at tables. Regulars call each other by name but remain
impersonal, knowing little of one another's lives outside the realm
of poker.
</P>
<P>
   No one inquires how or where they gain the financing for bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever asks personal questions,'' Behnen said. ``They
don't get that emotionally involved with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps McWhorter fancied himself a member of this tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Some who recognized McWhorter from photos said they hadn't seen
him in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks familiar,'' said Pat ``Pops'' Callihan, a poker
player for 45 years. ``I think he played in some of the smaller
games.''
</P>
<P>
   A few gamblers said they occasionally saw McWhorter playing
above his skill level in high-stakes poker. One remembered his
breaking even after battling a sole opponent in a risky game of
heads- up that started with $75 bets.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mirage employees who were working when McWhorter was
arrested soon after leaving that casino said they only faintly
recalled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The face looks a little familiar,'' said Pam Jones, poker room
shift manager.
</P>
<P>
   Less so his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of Jerry M's,'' she said.

GREENWICH WILL BE EARLY, AND RIGHT ON TIME, FOR GLOBAL MILLENNIAL
INSTANT

<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ Long a bastion of conservatism and tradition,
this town does not usually go out of its way to grab attention or
jump on the latest thing.
</P>
<P>
   But on New Year's Eve, Greenwich will leap out of character to
become the first community in the nation to ring in the new
millennium. At 7 p.m. Friday, church bells will ring and champagne
corks will pop at a town-supported Millennium Gala at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The premature partying is an effort to capitalize on the fame of
Greenwich's namesake city in England, which at that moment will be
celebrating the official arrival of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The English Greenwich is the site of the Old Royal Observatory,
the home of world time since 1884, when delegates from 22 nations
decreed at a conference in Washington that the observatory defined
the precise position of longitude zero and named that line the
world's prime meridian. Henceforth, they declared, every day would
officially start just as midnight passed in Greenwich. (That
worldwide standard, Greenwich Mean Time, was recently changed to
Coordinated Universal Time, which is the equivalent but is
corrected by atomic clocks to account for the earth's rotation.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Hyatt here, two large television screens will allow
partygoers to watch BBC coverage of the ceremonies at the
observatory, including a mammoth fireworks display along the Thames
in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure yet, but we may get to see the queen push a
button at midnight that will herald in the new millennium,'' said
Robert Button, a former director of the Voice of America and a
member of the committee that has been planning the Connecticut
celebration for more than a year. ``And we'll probably also get to
hear Big Ben strike 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred to 700 people are expected to attend the gala here
at $75 a person, said William Rizzuto, the hotel's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   They will hear a trumpeted call to order at 5:30 p.m., then see
a procession of dignitaries that will include the British consul
general, Thomas Harris. Then they will dine on caviar, sushi, duck
confit and bubble and squeak, a British concoction of mashed
potatoes and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of linking the two Greenwich celebrations came from Ian
Kerr, a former Briton who has lived here for three decades. ``Ian
came to me about two years ago and suggested that we join with our
sister city in England to welcome in the millennium,'' said Tom
Ragland, who was the first selectman at the time but retired this
year. ``I told him I thought it was a terrific idea.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two men established a 32-member committee, which sent a
delegation to England to meet with the lord mayor of London, John
Fahy, and review his city's millennial plans, since Greenwich is
now a borough of London.
</P>
<P>
   Ragland estimated that the event would cost about $200,000, all
of it raised privately.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive and enduring part of the celebration is a
$150,000, 130-foot-wide sundial _ the world's largest, according to
its designer, Allan Shope. Created by Mark Menin, a sculptor in
Bethlehem, Conn., and installed in October in Bruce Park, close by
the Connecticut Turnpike, it has a 35-foot-tall bronze gnomon _ the
part that casts the shadow _ and 15 granite blocks, each weighing
at least two-and-a-half tons. The blocks, representing the 15
daylight hours during Greenwich summers, will be what the shadow
points to.
</P>
<P>
   The millennial celebration is to end at 7:15, and at 8:30 the
Hyatt ballroom is to open its doors for its traditional New Year's
Eve party, which costs $1,000 a couple. Some of the early birds
plan to stay and ring in the millennium a second time. But Kerr,
who conceived the idea of the early celebration, will not be among
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave at 7:15, when the first party ends, and go home
and start preparing'' for the millennial celebration in a thousand
years, he said. ``We expect it to be even better than the one this
New Year's Eve.''

AMERICANS STOCK UP CAUTIOUSLY FOR THE TURN OF THE CENTURY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Colo., Fla, Wash., Ga., Texas, N.Y.)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charlotte White knows something about surviving
the end of the world. As a girl living in England during World War
II, she weathered the German air force's constant barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 years later, she is not taking any chances a computer
glitch will accomplish what the Luftwaffe could not.
</P>
<P>
   Already stocked up on apples, crackers, bottled water and
cheese, Mrs. White, 69, and her husband, Hugh, 80, shopped this
week at a San Francisco camping store for a propane stove to use in
the event of a millennium catastrophe caused by any year 2000
computer glitch. ``If something goes wrong, at least my husband
will have hot soup,'' Mrs. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, people are approaching the computer scare
not with panic but with pragmatism and precaution. Stores report
measured buying, in particular of two basics: water and light (as
in, batteries and flashlights).
</P>
<P>
   The buying patterns, and philosophy suggest a populace preparing
for a hurricane whose force is dwindling. Many sense this man-made
disaster will pass by or never materialize, but they are stocking
up on necessities just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers say they have felt comforted by assurances from
government and corporations, banks in particular, that their
computer systems are ready for the rollover to the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problem is that some computers read dates in only
two digits _ 99 rather than 1999 _ so that at midnight on New
Year's Eve, the computers may process information as if the year is
1900 rather than 2000. Computers and networks that have not been
prepared for the changeover may crash or data may become lost or
scrambled. More dire prophecies warn of widespread power and
computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers still arnt for candles, presumably not because
people were planning romantic evenings. ``We really do think the
incremental increases are because people are getting prepared,''
said Jim Keyes, chief operating officer of 7-Eleven Inc., which has
5,800 stores in this country and is based in Dallas, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sinegal, president and chief executive of Costco Wholesale
Inc., which operates 220 stores in the United States and is based
in Issaquah, Wash., said sales for water were up 150 percent,
battery sales up slightly, but that canned goods and other
emergency supplies were selling at normal levels. The buying, he
said, ``hasn't hit anything like the panic stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some people are practicing a higher level of caution.
In Athens, Ga., John Myers, 46, a computer animation designer at
the University of Georgia Center for Continuing Education, shopped
for bottled water Wednesday at Harris Teeter, a neighborhood
grocery store, and said he also had stocked up on a water purifier
and duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to use the tape to put over the doorways in
his home ``for security reasons'' and said if things went awry, he
had plans to ``live off the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of guns appear to have risen in some regions. The Colorado
Bureau of Investigation has performed 6,000 more background checks
during December than it did in December 1998, 17,704 compared with
10,997. Dave Anver, owner of Dave's Guns in Denver, said his
business had been booming in the past six weeks. One man, he added,
bought a gun and asked if he could return it after Jan. 1. ``He
said, `What if I fire it off a couple times, and then bring it
back?''' Anver said. ``Only chap I've ever met who wanted to lease
a firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   The official position of the Red Cross of America is that people
should be stock two to three days of emergency supplies, including
a gallon of water per person per day, canned food, food for infants
and the elderly, first-aid kits, flashlights with extra batteries,
money and matches kept in waterproof containers.
</P>
<P>
   In a study released this month, PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated
that consumers would spend $14 billion stocking up for possible
problems. Some retailers say they have been surprised by heavy
sales.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany County, N.Y., Phillips Ace Hardware Stores reported
unusually strong demand for kerosene lamps, lamp oil, batteries and
flashlights. At B.J.'s Wholesale Club in the Albany, N.Y.-suburb of
Colonie, the emphasis has been on water.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Korszun, a forklife operator, pointed out that 23 pallets
of bottled water stacked in the afternoon had been whittled down to
three pallets. ``If you go down our cereal aisle, it's beat up
bad,'' Korszun said. ``Empty, empty, empty. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   At Home Depot in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, N.Y., workers
reported brisk brisk sales of flashlights, lanterns and ``Y2K
Emergency Kits,'' a $16.88 packages that include lanterns,
flashlights, radios and Red Cross checklists of what to do in case
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   One Brooklyn resident, Maryse Pearra, 37, said that in addition
to buying ``everything _ water, juice and canned food,'' she knew
precisely how she'll handle New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be home that night hiding under the blanket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But those experiences are not universal, either for businesses
or consumers. Some business owners around the country said they had
increased inventories to cater to demand but were disappointed with
the returns. The reason may be that many consumers say that while
they want to be minimally prepared for a millennium bug, they think
it will come with a whimper, not a bang.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Bode, a student at Northwood University in West Palm
Beach, Fla., spent the day after Christmas looking at Zipdisks and
rewritable CDs at CompUSA in Deerfield Beach, a few miles south. He
bought his computer three years ago but now he wants to be sure it
is protected against any year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what to believe,'' he said. ``You don't know if
it's the latest media craze or what. I hope it's just hype, but if
I hear the phrase Y2K one more time I just might lose it.''

MUSIC APPROPRIATE FOR MILLENNIAL REFLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow, the last thing I feel like doing on the eve of the new
millennium is go to some big bash of a party. This sobering event
makes me want to settle down for a bit and take stock of it all.
Those who agree might find three new CDs conducive to an
appropriately reflective millennial mode.
</P>
<P>
   `BUSONI THE VISIONARY'
</P>
<P>
   The composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni was 34 and in his
creative prime at the turn of the last century. A musician steeped
in tradition yet infused with fervor for music's future, he would
have been excellent company as the new millennium arrives.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Centaur recording, appropriately called ``Busoni the
Visionary'' (CRC 2438), presents a fascinating program of piano
works impressively played by the pianist Jeni Slotchiver. The most
unusual offering is ``Red Indian Diary: Book One, Four Studies on
Motifs of the North American Indians.'' While on a concert tour of
the United States in 1910, Busoni visited a former student, Natalie
Curtis, then a pioneering ethnomusicologist, who introduced him to
her collection of American Indian melodies.
</P>
<P>
   As a composer who ardently believed that music would some day
transcend all boundaries, Busoni was captivated by the spareness,
instinctive spirituality and haunting wistfulness of the melodies.
``Red Indian Diary'' presents melodies from several tribes,
including the Hopi, Cheyenne and Wabanakis. Busoni first states the
tunes with unadorned accompaniments, then turns each into a
mystical musical rumination.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the ``Seven Elegies'' from 1907 in her program
notes, Ms. Slotchiver writes that the ``fantastical and macabre,
the sensual and holy all combine in these works of humble
proportion.'' Filled with incandescent piano writing and music of
stunning harmonic invention, the elegies seem as fresh at the end
of this century as they were at its beginning. The program ends
with a vivid performance of Busoni's ingenious piano transcription
of the Chaconne from Bach's Partita in D minor for solo violin,
which Ms. Slotchiver plays vividly.
</P>
<P>
   `ON FAITH'
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith, the Loss of Faith, and the Return of Faith'' (Avon 022)
presents the superb pianist Stephen Drury performing, without
pause, works by Liszt, Stockhausen, Ives and Beethoven that all
share, he believes, a cosmic dimension. Though the title of the
program and the idea itself may seem grandiose, Drury's goal is
simply to reveal musical and thematic continuities between the
works, spanning some 150 years, and to liberate listeners from
preconceived notions about stylistic schools and historical
trappings. The recording provides a stimulating and deeply
spiritual musical experience, and Drury's playing is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with four of Liszt's ``Transcendental Etudes,'' which,
as the title suggests, pushed harmony, musical structure and the
piano itself into transcendental realms. For Drury the
scintillating and brilliant Etudes I and II, which open the
program, evoke ``robust and naive optimism,'' as he writes in his
liner notes. He follows them with the ephemeral, misty ``Feux
Follets'' etude, which poses questions, then segues into the raging
``cold, blackened despair,'' as he puts it, of the ``Chasse-Neige''
etude.
</P>
<P>
   As the final chord dies away, the astringently dissonant,
insistently repeated opening chords of Karlheinz Stockhausen's
``Klavierstuck IX'' begins. This work, which Drury terms a
``meditation on entropy and disintegration,'' tries to evoke
electronic music on a standard piano. And all the qualities of that
high-tech medium are eerily audible in the piano writing: reverb
effects, echoes, filtered tones, feedback. The Liszt blends into
the Stockhausen with surprising naturalness: both, after all, are
visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Coming right after Stockhausen's piano piece, Ives' wildly
experimental ``Celestial Railroad'' sounds equally modern and
exciting. The work's one quiet episode, when a hymn tune is gently
recalled, presages a return to faith and beautifully anticipates
the final offering from Beethoven's late period, the sublime Sonata
in A flat, Opus 110. Coming at the end of Drury's musical
exploration, this familiar work seems newly strange yet utterly
sublime. In the last movement, as the fugue grows increasingly
complex, it finally implodes into a triumphant coda. As performed
here, the effect is ecstatic. Drury plays the entire program with
technical command, a keen ear for color, vivid imagination and
probing intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   `SONGS WITHOUT WORDS'
</P>
<P>
   Busoni's piano transcriptions of four Chorale Preludes for organ
by Bach begin a rewarding new recording by the pianist Murray
Perahia from Sony Classical (SK 66511) called ``Songs Without
Words.'' These are pianistically challenging pieces. The organ's
bass line, played on the foot pedals, must be accounted for in the
piano transcriptions. Perahia plays them with effortless grace. In
``Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme,'' when the sturdy chorale tune
sings out above the ambling bass line and contrapuntal busyness
that goes on in the background, you would think that Perahia had a
third hand at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Perahia also offers four of Liszt's piano transcriptions of
songs by Schubert, including his terrifying and virtuosic rendition
of ``Erlkoenig.'' Best of all are 15 selected pieces from
Mendelssohns' ``Lieder Ohne Worte'' (``Songs Without Words'').
Perahia plays the music exquisitely. After grappling with Busoni's
futuristic visions and Drury's trials of faith, listen to these
inventive and charming Mendelssohn pieces as a reward for some
millennial soul-searching.

ELIAS LIFTS DEVILS INTO FIRST

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The bottom line for the New Jersey
Devils Wednesday night was the threesome that has been the top line
for them in recent games.
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Arnott as the center for Patrik Elias on the left and
Petr Sykora on the right, that line proved productive again. Elias
had two goals, including the winner 19 seconds into overtime that
gave the Devils a 5-4 triumph over the Boston Bruins at Continental
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora also had a goal and assisted on Elias' game-winner with a
precise pass from the right side to the onrushing Devils wing.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik and Scott Gomez scored the other goals for the
Devils, who posted their second victory in a row, improved their
record to 21-12-4 and leapfrogged over idle Philadelphia and into
first place in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque, Andre Savage, Dave Andreychuk and Joe Murphy had
the goals for the Bruins (13-15-9) against Martin Brodeur, who
faced 30 shots, none in the overtime, as the Devils scored the
first time they went down the ice in the extra session.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started the game stale and the Devils took advantage.
They forced the action around goalie Byron Dafoe and opened the
scoring 5 minutes 34 seconds into the game with a goal by Elias. It
was the work of Jason Arnott, however, that led to the goal. He
muscled his way around Bourque behind the net and made the pass
that enabled Elias to score easily from just off Dafoe's right.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was the sixth in the last seven games for Elias, who
has been playing with the same gusto as last season.
</P>
<P>
   Holik gave the Devils a two-goal lead with his 11th of the
season, but first in 10 games, when he beat Dafoe over the glove
from the right circle with 8:42 left in the first period. Holik
also took the first penalty in the game for the Devils and it
proved harmful for them because Bourque scored on the Boston power
play to narrow the gap. The goal, Bourque's sixth of the season,
came with 4:11 left before the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils paid again when defenseman Sheldon Souray took the
second penalty in the game, two minutes into the second period.
This time Savage scored his first goal of the season 49 seconds
into the penalty to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Savage was playing in his fifth game for the Bruins this season
after being promoted from Providence for the second time this
season two days ago. His goal came on a second effort as he reached
beyond the stick of Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils appeared confused in their zone for the most part in
the second period. They misplayed the puck on numerous occasions,
but they were bailed out by Brodeur time and again, and the teams
went into the third period with two goals each.

MEMORABLE NEW YEAR'S SHOWS YOU'LL NEVER SEE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's talk about the millennium. Sure, you're tired of hearing
about it. You just want to get it over with so you can think about
something else, like what to do with that kerosene heater you
bought. Not to mention the generator. But the fact remains that New
Year's Eve is just a day away and you have to make sure you're
doing something that will, for the rest of your life, allow you to
puff your chest with pride when answering the inevitable question,
``Where were you when the calendar changed to 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   I am sorry to report that the pop musicians of the world, the
ones whose coffers you fill with billions of dollars annually, are
not doing much to make your decision easier. I spend a lot of my
time interviewing these men, women and children, and I can tell you
this: As a general rule, they are self-obsessed and under the
delusion that they are on the verge of poverty, usually because
they just bought $5 million houses to live in during the six days
out of the year that they are not on the road.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as no surprise when most of them opted for cash over
creativity when it came to staging millennium concerts, resulting
in poor ticket sales and canceled shows. Concerts featuring Jewel
and David Bowie were nixed, the Jacob Javits Convention Center
spectacular with Sting and Aretha Franklin went belly up, and
Michael Jackson's plans to race from a midnight concert in
Australia to one in Hawaii were canceled, presumably when the
singer learned that flying backward through time zones would not
actually make him look any younger.
</P>
<P>
   The only major music group doing anything out of the ordinary in
America is Phish, which has taken a financial risk to stage a
two-day show at the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation near the
Florida Everglades for some 75,000 fans, with the indefatigable
band playing from midnight to sunup as the year changes. Before you
consider attending this, however, grab a map and examine the
terrain, particularly the road named Alligator Alley that bisects
the reservation. As the voracious reptiles party like it's 1999 and
Phish tries to figure out how to build a new fan base from scratch,
there will be one or two other interesting concerts outside of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French New Ager Jean-Michel Jarre, for example, is staging
an opera at the Pyramids of Giza, though plans to spice up the show
by planting a gold cap on top of the Great Pyramid of Cheops by
helicopter were called off when it was discovered that the capstone
could damage this Wonder of the World. As a result, the show's
producers will be missing out on the opportunity to create a new
wonder of the world _ because future generations would have
wondered how any culture could have done anything so stupid to a
4,500-year-old pyramid, especially when the gold could have been
put to better use capping the teeth of the world's population of
struggling gangsta rappers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most musicians who are playing on New Year's Eve
(avant-garde acts like Barry Manilow, Billy Joel, 'N Sync, Jimmy
Buffett and the Eagles) are giving standard concerts hardly special
enough to close the century with, which is why most of these shows
are still far from sold out. As for the guy who was Prince when he
recorded the night's unofficial anthem, he has already pretaped his
New Year's Eve pay-per-view special, which was probably wise
considering that he has a habit of arriving hours late to special
shows and the event might not have started until 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The night's slim options reflect the creative deadlock that
plagues pop music at the end of a decade in which the most
important music was made early on (specifically Nirvana's
``Nevermind'' in 1991 and Dr. Dre's ``Chronic'' in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's easy to sit around and complain about arrogant,
uncreative pop stars. That's what I get paid to do. But I am
prepared to offer solutions. Here is what should have happened this
New Year's Eve. And if anyone can make any of these exciting
concert suggestions into a reality, I am prepared to offer them
several gallons of bottled water, a box of canned goods, a kerosene
heater and a power generator, which I will put in the mail first
thing next year.
</P>
<P>
   There is one concert that would have put every other event to
shame, that would have been a historic musical event worthy of an
overinflated ticket price: a reunion of the surviving Beatles. The
eve of the millennium would have been the perfect excuse for them
to cave in to public demand just once and get together for a single
blowout. One may assume that since they didn't take advantage of
this opportunity we may never see a Beatles reunion.
</P>
<P>
   A show just as eagerly anticipated but just as unlikely to
happen on New Year's Eve would have been a bona fide farewell
concert from the Rolling Stones. With decreasing creative returns,
they seem to reunite for a tour every few years. Probably because
they keep buying $5 million houses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the themes of the '90s has been the rivalry between East
and West Coast rappers, which has just started to wane. As a
gesture of good will for the 21st century, they could meet in the
Midwest for a collaborative show that would benefit gun-control
charities. Puffy Combs, who was charged with gun possession this
week while he and Jennifer Lopez were fleeing a nightclub melee,
could discuss dating do's and don'ts. And Ol' Dirty Bastard, who
probably spent more time in court last year than in the studio,
could engage in some performance art by screaming a New Year's
resolution at the stroke of midnight about not going to jail again,
and then promptly getting arrested for disturbing the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend this year has been for musicians like Celine Dion
and Lauryn Hill to perform duets with the recorded voices of dead
singers like Bob Marley, Frank Sinatra and Patsy Cline. These
posthumous duets probably have these legends rolling in their
graves, so why not get them rocking as well with an all-star
concert featuring the greatest living pop stars singing duets with
the departed via mediums? Maybe hold the concert at a place like
the New York State Theater, where the acoustics are so bad that
nobody will be able to tell if the whole thing is a fraud or not.
Come to think of it, we may actually see a Beatles reunion on the
eve of the next century, especially considering that the band
members said they would reunite over their dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dylan could perform at the Metropolitan Opera House on Dec.
31. This way, the system of supertitles used to translate operas on
the back of each seat could be used to convert his lyrics from
mumble into English. For an opening act, the Insane Clown Posse
could perform, using supertitles to make their misanthropic lyrics
as funny to everyone else as they seem to be to the band.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are limitless. The Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync
could perform hidden behind a screen, daring fans to guess which
band is which. Garth Brooks could shock his fans by singing actual
country songs. And, for those who really want to see the government
thrown into Y2K chaos, the bands that performed at the disastrous
Woodstock '99 festival could stage a reunion with fans on the steps
of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, these ideas may be half in jest, but the intent is to show
how easy it would have been for pop stars and their managers to
cook up something besides a night in a concert hall and quintupled
ticket prices as a New Year's treat for fans, many of whom are
already shelling out for plane fare just to get there. These
performers could have at least made their concerts low-priced
benefits. No doubt our friends Phish, for example, will be doing a
benefit show on New Year's Eve 2000 for fans maimed by alligators
at their concert this year.

IT'S A MAC, MAC, MAC, MAC WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (EDS: MacWorld starts Jan. 5 in San Francisco) 
(js) 
 By BOB NORBERG   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ MacWorld is less than a week away, and
thousands of Mac faithful are expected to flock to San Francisco to
see the latest offerings by Apple and hundreds of makers of games,
software and peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first West Coast show by what many see as a more
mature Apple, a company that now has two years of profits under its
belt and a product line that matches up well against its
Windows-based competition.
</P>
<P>
   The show isn't expected to have the flash of two years ago, when
Apple used the San Francisco show to unveil its first iMac, or last
year, when it introduced its new lollipop-colored iMacs and the new
G3.
</P>
<P>
   It has been on the strength of those models that Apple has built
a resurgence _ in the 1997-98 fiscal year Apple turned a profit of
$106 million, after losing $161 million the previous year, and in
the fiscal year that ended Nov. 1, it made a profit of $111
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to do a `gee-whiz' product, they've already
done that,'' said John Batteiger, senior editor of MacWeek in San
Francisco. ``They have the iMac that is as good as any PC, they
have the G4 that is faster than any Pentium on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   What is likely this year is an upgrade of the current operating
system, a upgraded or even new Powerbook and a speed boost for the
G4 computer, and independent vendors rounding out the market with
new software, games and accessories, according to most industry
watchers.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Cupertino-based Apple isn't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a peep,'' said Martin Reynolds, an analyst with Dataquest,
a San Jose high-tech industry consulting firm. ``Apple is pretty
good at keeping things quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Apple to stand still, however, and that fuels the
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Steve Jobs will let it be a boring MacWorld,''
Reynolds said. ``We just don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   MacWorld runs Jan. 5-8 at Moscone Center, with a number of
technical sessions and seminars, a Town Hall meeting for Mac users
and exhibits from 450 manufacturers. It is expected to attract
75,000 people, both technicians and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive officer, will deliver the
keynote address at 9 a.m. Wednesday, after which the exhibit hall
will open.
</P>
<P>
   The hall, the major attraction for consumers, is open from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
on Saturday. It is the first time in MacWorld's 16-year history
that it is open on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit hall pass is $45.
</P>
<P>
   The show will host its annual National Macintosh Gaming
Championships, with the New York MacWorld champion, last year's San
Francisco MacWorld champion and other gamers squaring off in games
such as Madden 2000, Quake and more than a dozen other popular
video games for $25,000 in prizes.
</P>
<P>
   There will be several new games from major makers, including
LucasArts, which is releasing a Mac version of its pod racing game.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is a pavilion and conferences for audio and music,
said Josh Jacobs, spokesman for IDG Expo Management Group of
Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Baudin, president of Micromat in Santa Rosa, will be an
exhibitor at MacWorld, releasing its latest Mac utility program,
which diagnoses and fixes disk drives and operating systems, has
virus protection and solves system conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a 20-by-20-foot booth that costs $19,000 _ it's
expensive, but it's the one big show,'' Baudin said. ``This is the
one where Apple goes all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Poff, store manager of Executron, an Apple and Windows PC
store in Santa Rosa, expects Apple to release an upgraded Powerbook
laptop, keeping ahead of the new iBook laptop that Apple released
in October, while a new Powerbook is readied for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Poff also expects Jobs to give an indication that the new Mac
operating system, OS X, which will power the next decade of Apple
machines, is close to release.
</P>
<P>
   MacWeek's Batteiger said he expects Apple to release version 9.1
of its OS 9 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   He also expects Apple's iMovie program for iMacs, which allows
video editing, to become increasingly popular with consumers and
for software makers to offer products to complement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a real popular show, but it's not going to
have the flash, there won't be an iMac rollout,'' Batteiger said.
``I'm not dismissing the show. If people have to be entertained, if
they have to get `gee whiz' every time, that's a bit much.''
</P>
<P>
   Monish Bhatic of Mac News Network, an online Mac news site
headquartered in Washington, D.C., predicts Apple will release an
iMac with a 17-inch monitor, but doesn't think the new Powerbook,
which will have a G4 chip and have the iBook's clamshell look, is
quite ready for release.
</P>
<P>
   He said there also is speculation that Apple will retire its
``Think Different'' slogan for something way more hip, replace the
traditional five-color Apple logo with a three-dimensional design
and change its corporate name from Apple Computer Inc. to just
plain Apple.

WAITING FOR THE THRILL OF THE CHILL
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, Jan. 4)  
(js) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 c. 2000 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hope my heat-seeking friends are happy, those who start to
shiver when the calendar approaches winter, including the one who'd
rather be in Tucson than worrying about frost on her California hot
tub. And the pair who go to Hawaii each December to soak up enough
light to get past the dark months.
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of those who thrills to a cold pale pink morning when
you need to wear gloves and a hat, and the weeds on the trail are
so cold they crackle when you step on them. We winter types delight
in trees that look like big black sticks against a weak sun and
fields that are different shades of beige and gray with a dash of
rust.
</P>
<P>
   I don't even mind overcast. My pals who are sun-bunnies and I
can both appreciate a January sky when it's half gray and half
blue, but they're cheering on the blue. If we were dancing ``The
Nutcracker'' I would be one of the snow nymphs and they would be
dressed in happy colors and dancing with a man in pink.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're together going through a Northern California hot
streak, and I want to know where is the thrill of the chill on a
64-degree winter day?
</P>
<P>
   I think it's important for people to feel the cold. It's good
for the skin. It makes our cheeks red, puts a snap in our walk.
Pennsylvania mothers used to bundle up their babies and put them
out on the front porch on icy days just to get the blood moving.
They considered cold days ``invigorating'' and ``bracing.'' I panic
a little when it's warm in December. My friend Peter the German,
who expects winter to be severe and unbending, goes around these
soft days in California saying, ``This is unnatural,'' and I agree.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for cold days and long nights, say those who
follow old rituals. It is Mother Nature telling us to go inside, to
dig in and find our own warmth. Cold nights are for burrowing deep
and having thick, rich dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But how can we hibernate with the windows open?
</P>
<P>
   I like the idea of celebrating the winter solstice as a tribute
to the night. Early-winter worshipers lit fires and sang until
dawn, some say to chase the dark, but others say it was to honor
the night, whose special beauty and magic outlasted the day.
</P>
<P>
   As this solstice began, my daughters and I greeted the first
night of winter from the back deck of the ferry pulling away from
San Francisco, which posed with that big braggart moon hanging just
above the glittering Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In another homage to the night, a nearby cemetery planted
luminaries all around the grounds, creating a field of candles next
to each gravestone. It might have looked like they were chasing
ghosts, but I was hoping it would lure a few ancestors back for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother was born on the shortest day of the year, and she
was pretty adept at handling winter. Her Pennsylvania house only
had heat in the downstairs rooms. The upstairs bedrooms were like
caves, the sheets refrigerated, but before anyone went to bed she
took stones that were heated in the fireplace, wrapped them in
towels and shoved them under the bed covers.
</P>
<P>
   This was before electric mattress pads, flannel sheets and those
rice-filled pillows that you heat up in the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shivery thrill to finally get up the courage to leave
an overheated room, drowsy with food and adult talk, and bolt up
the stairs two at a time and dive into that bed, slithering down
like an otter to meet the toasty spot where grandma had planted her
foot stones. Here in coastal California we are pretty much winter
pretenders. It never gets down to dead of winter, below zero,
stuck-in-the driveway cold. While there is occasionally snow in the
nearby mountains, it looks more like a fantasy than the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   This year's favorite Christmas decoration is a string of white
lights made to resemble icicles dangling from rooftops. They are
everywhere, on houses of people who hate the cold and would pack up
and move to Lubbock if their house ever grew real icicles.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us have red woolly mittens next to the door and chenille
throws draped over the couch in anticipation of some rousing change
in the weather. I personally have a new wood stove with a glass
door that I'd planned to spend the winter weekends staring into,
but first it needs a fire inside.
</P>
<P>
   I want Jack Frost nipping at my nose, not Bahama Mama blowing me
soft kisses. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   It's the exquisite law of contrasts. How can you appreciate snug
and cozy, or for that matter, sunny and mild, if you haven't first
been cold and slightly miserable?
</P>

ISLANDERS GET NO POINTS FOR PROGRESS IN LOSS TO LEAFS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Good against the Boston Bruins and New York
Rangers is one thing. Good against the Toronto Maple Leafs is
something else.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Islanders went into Wednesday night's game against
the Eastern Conference-leading Maple Leafs with consecutive
victories for the first time this season, knowing a victory would
mean a lot in terms of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   They left with their 20th loss of the season, going down by 2-1
in a hard-fought game that, if nothing else, demonstrated how far
the Islanders have come since the last meeting between the two
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Boston and the Rangers are good teams, but ``these guys are the
elite, like a Detroit,'' Islanders coach Butch Goring said before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs, who have now won six straight and are 23-11-4,
beat up on the Islanders in their last meeting, a 5-1 blowout in
Toronto on Dec. 15. Since then, the Islanders traded away Felix
Potvin _ who was in goal for that game _ in exchange for
Vancouver's Bill Muckalt, Dave Scatchard and goalie Kevin Weekes,
retooled their special teams, refigured their defense and inserted
veteran Nicklas Andersson into the line with Tim Connolly and Brad
Isbister.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the reversal of a nine-game stretch without a
victory, a 3-1-1 mark in the first five games of this six-game
homestand and the feeling this young team could actually play with
any team in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, before 10,362 at Nassau Coliseum, the Islanders
played even with the mighty Leafs for much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs were quick to score, jumping to a 1-0 lead just 1
minute 38 seconds into the game when Igor Korolev dug the puck out
of the right corner and fed it to an uncovered Sergei Berezin, who
poked it past Weekes for his 14th goal of the season. They went up
2-0 when Jonas Hoglund scored an empty-net goal at 19:11 of the
third period. But then the Islanders finally got past Curtis Joseph
to avert the shutout when Scatchard scored at 19:33 on an assist
from Jorgen Jonsson.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were not without their chances to score, but
continually failed to finish their plays. Joseph had to turn away
only seven shots through the first period even with two power plays
that came courtesy of Tie Domi's running feuds with Eric Cairns and
Steve Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Webb came out of the penalty box for checking Mats
Sundin into the boards from behind, Domi followed Webb and
challenged him as he returned to the bench, pulling at his jersey
as he left the ice and drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct call at
10:01.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 27 seconds later, Domi was flagged for interference on
Cairns, but the Islanders managed to get off just one shot, by
Mariusz Czerkawski, on Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs, who came into the game riding a hot streak on
power-play goals (nine in 28 opportunities over the past seven
games) were turned back by the Islanders' penalty-killing unit on
their first four chances.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his Islanders debut against the Rangers, Weekes, a
Toronto native, seemed to gain confidence as the game wore on. In
the second period, he drew a roar of approval from the crowd as he
went to his knees to stop a bull's-eye on a breakaway by Nik
Antropov from eight feet out on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Weekes stopped 23 of the 24 shots he faced and went to
7-8-4 on the season (1-1 with the Islanders), while Joseph, who is
now 19-7-4, stopped 20 of 21 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The game was rough on the Islanders in several ways, not the
least of which was physically. Eric Brewer left the game midway
through the first period with a sprained wrist. He returned to the
bench but did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second period, Claude Lapointe went down to
the right of the Leafs' goal after getting hit in the face with
Hoglund's stick, an injury that required stitches. The game was
halted for a few minutes to clean up the ice.

Y2K EVEN AFFECTS AMISH _ IT BOOSTS SALES AT THEIR SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMESPORT, Mo. _ At times it appears that some residents are in
no hurry to jump into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Amish people roll down Main Street in horse-drawn buggies. Dusty
roads meander to farmhouses with no electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the New Year approaches, city folks are turning to Amish
merchants for provisions and advice about how to survive possible
Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people think that we're the best place to go, because we
know how to live without electricity and things like that,'' said
Sue Beechy, whose family owns H&AMP;M Country Store.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers, including many from Kansas City, have stocked up on
100-pound bags of pasta and beans. Beechy said it was hard to say
how much business had increased, but ``it has made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the bulk items, the shelves at H&AMP;M are filled with
homemade pastries and powdered food.
</P>
<P>
   And Beechy says shoppers also are curious about the family's
appliances. The cash register is powered by a 12-volt battery. The
refrigerator operates on kerosene. And the ventilation system is
run by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Jamesport, about 80 miles northeast of Kansas City, draws
tourists and shoppers from all over the Midwest who are eager to
visit Amish shops and browse through downtown's antique stores.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road from Beechy's shop, Tobie Ropp has been dispensing
tips for months about his field of expertise: wood-fired stoves.
</P>
<P>
   His father sold stoves for decades. And Ropp's Country Variety
remains one of the area's best sellers of the stoves.
</P>
<P>
   Business took off in fall 1998 and this spring. Many customers
have waited until this fall to hook up their stoves, however. Most
out-of-towners said they were preparing for possible Y2K power
outages, Ropp said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning back in his chair and stroking his gray beard, Ropp said
with authority, ``Nothing works like a wood-fired stove.''
</P>
<P>
   The safeguards are not cheap. A stove just for heating costs up
to $800. A dual-purpose stove, for heating and cooking, costs up to
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Ropp realizes that shoppers can buy the stoves at farm-supply
stores and other commercial centers. He figures customers feel more
at ease if they can talk with someone who entrusts their own home
to the same stoves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that come here know that's what we use, day in and day
out,'' Ropp said. ``I guess they have confidence that I can answer
any question. I've been in and around these stoves all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to some of these other stores, and they'll tell you,
`If you have a question, just read this pamphlet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even the best advice is no substitute for common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will buy a stove and only then realize that they
need a chimney, too,'' Ropp said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Amish merchants say they have enjoyed the extra business brought
on by Y2K, even if it is hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't tell you why they're buying something,''
said Anita Flory, owner of Country Acres, a general store. ``If
they buy a lot of food, you don't know if they're storing it or
eating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flory said she had noticed a slight increase in kerosene sales
but stressed she was unsure whether Y2K fears were responsible.
</P>

   Flory did say that sales in her greenhouse were up this spring,
with many shoppers citing Y2K preparation. They bought organically

   For the most part, Y2K glitches will not affect Amish residents
in Jamesport and throughout the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Amish shun the moral corruption of modern society by
swearing off involvement with it. That means a life that stresses
hard work, a devotion to God and family, and a rejection of modern
inventions.

<P>
   Some Amish merchants say the only way that Y2K might become a
problem is if the computer bug hampers a supplier or bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several merchants say they have no idea what Y2K will bring. But
they expressed hope that the glitch would not hurt too much.

   ``If the Y2K is going to create a problem for people, the
increase in sales isn't a benefit,'' Ropp said. ``It isn't worth it
to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a person doesn't know what's going to take place. No
person does. When the new year comes, I only hope it goes
smoothly.''
