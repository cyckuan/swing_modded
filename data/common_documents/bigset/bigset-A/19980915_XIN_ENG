<HEADLINE> EU Asks Candidate Countries to Improve Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Monday asked countries which are applying for EU membership to
improve their environmental protection standards.
</P>
<P>
EU Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said that the
candidate countries must prepare "tight and realistic" programs on
the environment.
</P>
<P>
A special council meeting attended by environment ministers
from all the candidate countries already in the accession talks
and the 15 member states was held in Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, according to Bjerregaard, was to bring home the
message to candidate countries that the environment issue might be
one of the obstacles hindering them in the screening phase.
</P>
<P>
Screening is part of the process before accession negotiations
which are scheduled to start on January 7 next year.
</P>
<P>
EU officials later explained that the environment programs to
be prepared by the candidate countries have to comply
legislatively, institutionally and physically with EU rules.
</P>
<P>
The EU has started accession talks with Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia are also
applying for EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Israel Conducts Tests of 'Arrow' Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel successfully
conducted an integrated test of its "Arrow" missile system Monday
afternoon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The test was conducted in a military base outside Tel Aviv and
it was the first time that all three components of the defense
system -- the missile, the radar and the fire-control system -- had
been involved, the radio quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
An 'Arrow' missile did not carry out an actual interception in
the test, which lasted 97 seconds, but it traced and destroyed a
simulated target before blasting itself up as planned over the
sea, officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the data of the simulated target were fed into the
radar and the fire-control system, which launched and guided the
missile to fly and then destroy the target. Every component of
the system operated very well, they added.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth test of the 'Arrow' defense system, but the
first time all its components were tested, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the U.S., which helps fund the
anti-missile defense system, watched the test along with Israeli
military and aircraft industry officials, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow anti-missile system is designed to track incoming
missiles and guide an anti-missile missile at a speed of two miles
(nearly three kilometers) per second to within four meters of the
target.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded several months ago that the U.S.-sponsored
program be expanded from two Arrow batteries to three. Officials
said more tests were planned and the system is expected to be
ready for initial deployment within two year, Israel Radio
reported.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian diplomat
in Lahore said Monday the killing of Iranian diplomats at the
northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif allegedly by the Taliban
militia was a condemnable act.
</P>
<P>
Aghai Pirouz Ghofrani, Iranian Consul General in Lahore, made
the remarks while talking to the mourners at a condolence meeting
held at his residence.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the Talibans did in Mazar-i-Sharif did not reflect a
fair play," he was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Consul General hoped that the relations between
Pakistan and Iran would continue to strengthen despite certain
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another APP report said that the Taliban militia
has rejected the Iranian demand to hand over the suspects in the
killing of nine Iranian diplomats to Iran, saying "it will not
turn over any suspect in the killings."
</P>
<P>
A Taliban official has called the killing as "an internal
matter", and said one of the suspects who is arrested will be
tried in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The nine Iranian diplomats were killed when the Taliban forces
stormed into the northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif early last

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Exchange Shows Increasing Activity in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Exchange
(CSE) has shown an increasing activity in many sectors in its
operation in 1997, CSE Chairman Dinos Papadopoulos said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the annual report for 1997, Papadopoulos said the
volume of transactions surpassed 170 million Cyprus pounds
(about 340 million U.S. dollars) and average daily volume was
around 700,000 pounds (about 1.4 million dollars) compared with
670,000 pounds (about 1.34 million dollars) the year before.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus Stock Exchange saw intense activity in 1997 and
achieved its initial goals as planned. We are now moving on
to fully computerize the stock exchange, hopefully by the end
of September, and attract new companies, local and foreign, as
well as foreign investors," Papadopoulos told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
However, Papadopoulos pointed out it would be unrealistic to
expect miracles because of the small size of the Cypriot
economy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to tax incentives offered to trading companies,
Papadopoulos said newcomers have reduced tax rates, offshore
companies can invest in the stock exchange without losing
their offshore status and any profit they make through the
exchange is not taxable.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on developments in 1998, he said the general
price index shows a 14 percent increase since the beginning of
the year with an average daily volume of transactions of about
1.33 million pounds (2.33 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The CSE was lunched in March 1996 after years of operating in
an unofficial capacity under the auspices of the Cyprus Chamber
of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
It has now 57 listed companies with a market capitalization
of about 1.3 billion Cyprus pounds (about 2.6 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> No CTBT Clause to Affect Pak Nuclear Program: Qadeer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's scientists Dr.
Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said here Monday that no
clause of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will affect
Pakistan's nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing for the members of the two houses of Parliament,
the two renowned scientists said there is no need to further
nuclear tests at present as Pakistan has achieved its objectives
from the tests conducted on May 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
"The CTBT cannot take away anything of us that we have achieved
as a result of nuclear blasts. WE can maintain our nuclear
capability without conducting more tests," Qadeer said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said there would be no cut in the present stock
material.
</P>
<P>
Qadeer said Pakistan maintained its nuclear capability for a
long time without conducting test. "We conducted nuclear tests on
May 28 and 30 to convey the message to the world that Pakistan has
become a nuclear power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked as to whether Pakistan would open its nuclear
installations for inspection after signing the CTBT, Qadeer said,
"there is no clause in the Treaty which allows inspection. The
Treaty only bars new tests."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Pakistan has already announced moratorium on
nuclear tests.

<P>
Belgian State Security Secretary Jan Peeters told a press

especially dangerous and machines for making sand bags had to be
ferried in from other places.
</P>
<P>
The province of Liege, the country's easternmost province
bordering Germany, is expected to encounter a worse situation in
the coming days in that the country's largest river Meuse runs
through it before entering the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Meuse also carries excess rain waters with it from France
to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Third-degree warnings are given in case of catastrophe by
Belgium's provincial authorities that are thus entitled to demand
military assistance if need arises.
</P>
<P>
Continuous rains, that started late last month and kept on and
off for most of the past fortnight, were attributed to the
unusually warmer waters in the North Sea this Summer.
</P>
<P>
When currents of cold-air masses run into hot-air masses rising
above the North Sea they combine and produce rainfalls in nearby
regions.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is now right under the influence of such a
meteorological build-up, said meteorologist Luc de Bontridder.
</P>
<P>
Local weather forecast predicted more rains for this week.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Security Council to Probe UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq demanded once
again on Monday that the Security Council of the United Nations
initiate a serious investigation of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz said initiating a probe may correct the
situation within UNSCOM and make it to be an impartial
international body.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has complained that UNSCOM is controlled by the United
States and it is the United States which decides on the
Commission's agenda and even on its working methods.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said were the UNSCOM a neutral and impartial international
body, it would have informed the Security Council long ago that
its task under Resolution 687 of 1991 had been completed.
</P>
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency has long since completed
its task under the resolution and the Council should close the
files in this area, but this has not happened because the UNSCOM
entrusted with the technical implementation of the Council's
resolution is neither neutral nor impartial, and because of the
United States of America exercises arbitrary power within the
Council and is preventing it from recognizing the facts, Aziz
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 announced to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM
until it gets restructured. Security Council on August 6 called
Iraq's decision totally unacceptable and urged it to reverse its
decision, but Iraq reiterated not to change its position. The
Council last week adopted a resolution which decided to suspend
the regular review of sanctions against Iraq until it resumes full
cooperation with UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Primakov to Take Bold Steps in Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Monday urged Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
take bold steps in economic reforms, and warned against a return
to the Soviet Union era.
</P>
<P>
"He (Primakov) and President Yeltsin face one of the great
challenges of their time," Clinton said in a speech at the Council
on Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
"Never has there been a more important moment to set a clear
direction for the future, to affirm the commitment of Russia to
democracy and to free markets, and to take decisive steps to
stabilize the economy and restore investor confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But if Russia is willing to take these steps, we must do
everything we can to provide support to them, because again I say
as long as ordinary people don't feel any benefits from this, in
the end it's going to be difficult to sustain the direction we
think the world should take," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned Primakov's new government against abandoning
market-opening reforms, saying U.S. economic support was at stake.
</P>
<P>
Some in Russia now talk of "abandoning the path of reform and
returning to policies of the past, even policies that have already
failed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"At worst, adversity in Russia could affect not only the
Russian economy and prospects for our economic cooperation -- at
worst, it could have an impact on our cooperation with Russia on
nuclear disarmament; on fighting terrorism and the spread of
weapons of mass destruction; on standing together for peace, from
the Balkans to the Middle East," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cabinda Issue, Angola's Internal Affairs: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cabinda issue is Angola's
internal affairs and it should be solved through candid and open
dialogue, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Santana Andre Pitra, Angola's Interior Minister made the
remarks here Sunday after attending the talks between the
governors of Angola's Cabinda province and the neighboring Congo
(B)'s Kouilou regional administrator, the Journal of Angola
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pitra made it clear at the talks that the Cabinda issue should
be solved on a negotiating table, not through arms.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda enclave on the Atlantic is sandwiched between Congo
(Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa). Some organizations in the
enclave have been engaging in long years of armed struggle for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Pitra said Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has met
his Congolese (B) counterpart Denis Sassou Nguesso over the
issue, and has agreed that neither should allow rebels on its
land to carry out armed activities against the other's
government.
</P>
<P>
The minister also demanded local government tighten its
security measures for security and stability, saying that "we
need stability to guarantee the free flow of personnel and goods,
and the ties of culture, sports and trade between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Alexander Honore Kapa, the Congolese (B) administrator vowed
to spare no pains to safeguard safety and cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda is rich in oil reserve, producing about 53 percent of
the total oil in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition, the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has formed alliance with Cabinda
Enclave Liberation Front and the Union for the Liberation of
Cabinda, two major oppositions in Cabinda. These forces often
conduct armed harassments in Cabinda through neighboring
countries.

LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
confirmed the outbreak of African swine fever in the country
which is said to be capable of wiping out entire pig population.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the disease was first reported in Lagos and
Ogun states a few weeks ago and officials of Nigerian Agriculture
Ministry confirmed Sunday that there had been outbreaks in
Kaduna, Benue and Osun states.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry in capital Abuja said that
the disease is now spreading fast in the West African country,
warning that meat of affected pigs is not good for human
consumption, The Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no known cure of infected pigs nor vaccine available
to protect surviving animals through vaccination," it said,
adding that the only method of control is to enforce "very strict
movement of pigs and pig products".
</P>
<P>
Usually, the virulent disease leads to high mortality rate of
between 80 and 100 percent.

WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen on Monday described as "a threat" the recent launch
of a satellite by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and said the United State would be working closely with Japan to
meet the "threat".
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan have charged that the DPRK tested
a new Taepo Dong 1 medium range missile over the Japanese
Mainland on August 31, although Pyongyang already refuted the
allegation and said what it launched was a satellite.
</P>
<P>
At a photo session with visiting members of the Japanese
Diet, Cohen said the United States and Japan "have been
disturbed by the recent test on the part of the North Koreans."
</P>
<P>
"Any threat to Japan's security is also a threat to America,
so we intend to work very closely with our strong allies in
dealing with this particular issue," Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department officials said U.S., Japanese and
South Korean officials were meeting there on Monday to discuss
security in the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Both the United States and Japan could "cooperate
on theater missile defense issues, exchange information and
perhaps cooperate in other ways."
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to continue this very strong relationship
we have with Japan and deal with security issues that affect
us," he said.

WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
seek more steps against Iraq in the U.N. Security Council if
Baghdad suspends the activities of all U.N. weapons inspectors,
the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament on Monday recommended that the Iraqi
leadership suspend all the activities of weapons inspectors
unless the U.N. Security Council annuls a decision to end a

State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters this
would "constitute yet another flagrant violation of U.N.
Security Council resolutions and a direct challenge to the

"In that event, the council would have to consider further

Rubin said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed
Iraq at the weekend with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
the foreign ministers of Russia, France, Britain and Sweden.
</P>

"They made clear they agreed with the substance of the
American position and would try to communicate the foolishness

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pilots at Air Canada voted
overwhelmingly in favor of accepting a new contract, ending a 13-day
strike at Canada's largest airline.
</P>
<P>
"Air Canada is back in business with more than 150 flights
scheduled to operate today," the airline announced in a statement
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Beginning at 13:00 EDT, the airline began phasing in
approximately one quarter of its normal operations to serve
primarily domestic and transborder destinations from its hubs across
Canada," it said.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada said its full daily schedule of 650 flights will be
phased in over the next four days.
</P>
<P>
Over 83 percent of the pilots who cast their ballots voted in
favor of the new contract, and about 94 percent of the 2,100 pilots
cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, the Air Canada Pilots Association has announced
that the strike is over," the pilots said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The strike began on September 1 when talks on a new pilots'
contract broke down over differences of wage increases and working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The pilots asked for 12 percent wage hikes over the next two
years, and the airline offered nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the new contract offered the same wage
provisions as the airline's last offer, but had improvements in
other areas such as benefits.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't go on strike for nothing," Jean-Marc Belanger,
spokesman of the pilots association, told a news briefing. "We have
achieved a lot more than at the beginning of the strike."
</P>
<P>
The strike has stranded thousands of Air Canada passengers. And it
is estimated that the airline lost up to 130 million U.S. dollars as
the result of the strike.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Keen on Improving Relation With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudan expressed its
sincerity to improve its relations with Egypt to serve the common
strategic interests and historic bonds between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister told reporters Monday that the
arrival of an Egyptian large medical team under Egyptian Health
Minister here "is a generous gesture from Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and an indication of the strong ties between the peoples
of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian aircraft arrived here Monday morning carrying an
Egyptian high-level delegation under Minister of Health as well as
a quantity of medicines.
</P>
<P>
The move, which came under instructions of Mubarak, aims at
relieving the Sudanese people in the flood-stricken provinces of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Foreign Minister said he was going to meet his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa on Thursday on the fringe of the
session of the Arab Foreign Minister Council to be held in Cairo
this week.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the upcoming Cairo meeting would result
in a new step towards normalizing relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that the Egyptian-Sudanese
rapprochement resulted from a joint Syrian-Saudi mediation during
the recent Non-aligned summit in South Africa where the Sudanese
delegation was led by President Omar Al-Bashir and Foreign
Minister Mustafa Othman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the foreign ministers of Egypt and
Sudan is expected to discuss a new political accord on improving
the relations between Cairo and Khartoum in a prelude to raising
the level of diplomatic representation, reappointing a new
Egyptian ambassador to Sudan and reopening the various Egyptian
consulates there.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday called on world economic powers "to act together to spur
global economy" as the world is facing "the biggest Challenge
in a half century".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York,
Clinton said the United States has an "inescapable obligation" to
help resolve the economic crisis affecting a growing number of
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the fact that 30 percent of the U.S. economic
growth has been made due to trade with overseas countries since he
became president in 1992, Clinton said this is why "ordinary
Americans should care if Asia or Russia or South America are on
solid footing."
</P>
<P>
"These peoples are our customers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the world's second largest economy, should remain a key
to resolving the economic crisis, Clinton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A passenger plane of the
Turkish Airlines was hijacked Monday by two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
They hijacked the Airbus 310 type "Seyhan" plane on the
Ankara-Istanbul flight soon after the plane took off from the
Ankara Esenboga Airport.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that a pilot
of the hijacked plane told the tower in the airport that the
aircraft was hijacked at 20:37 local time (17:37 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Later, the hijacked plane carrying 76 passengers and crew
members landed on the airport in Trabzon province along the Black
Sea of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish source told Xinhua that there are three Turkish
Cabinet ministers among the hijacked passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the doors of the hijacked plane
were opened and the passengers began to be set free.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has formed a "crisis table" at Ataturk Airport in
Istanbul in a bid to deal with the incident.
</P>
<P>
On February 24 this year, a hijacker hijacked RJ-100 type
passenger plane in Adana, southern Turkey and later landed in
Diyarbakir Airport in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Violence in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States strongly
condemned the use of violence in Albania, which has killed three
looters and wounded 14 others so far.
</P>
<P>
"The United States strongly condemns the use of violence for
political ends in Albania. The political leadership in the
government and the opposition will be held responsible for
resolving the current crisis," said James Rubin at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the parties in Albania to work together toward "a
peaceful solution that respects the democratic process."
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not recognize or work with a government
that comes to power through violent means. We call on the
political leadership of Albania to cooperate with the president in
working on constructive proposals that will end the current
upheaval," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of all political parties in Albania must take
responsibility for the behavior of their followers; those that do
not play a constructive role must bear the consequences," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is consulting with the European Union to
support those pursuing a peaceful resolution to the current
crisis, he declared.
</P>
<P>
"We are also committed to support actively packages -- any
package of measures, consistent with the rule of law, adopted in
the political consultations of the Albanian political
leadership," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of former President Sali Berisha seized government
buildings in the Albanian capital earlier on Monday and demanded
the government resign.
</P>
<P>
In response, government forces launched a counterattack hours
later, killing three Berisha supporters and wounding 14.
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga, who reported the
casualties, also said the parliament building and the offices of
Prime Minister Fatos Nano were back in government hands.
</P>
<P>
The shooting began in Tirana after protesters carried the
bodies of a slain politician and two others to Nano's office. The
opposition blames him for the deaths.

ANKARA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- All the passengers on a

Airport in Trabzon along the Black Sea of Turkey, the

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Surge with Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The filling of Russia's
political vacuum and a continuing rally on Wall Street fired
European markets with buying enthusiasm Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leading London shares surged on a diet of fresh takeover news,
corporate results and a strong Wall Street showing. The FTSE 100
closed up 150 points or almost 3 percent to 5,269.
</P>
<P>
Football stocks were once again in demand as takeover fever
gripped the sector. Earlier, another set of benign producer prices
figures had little impact on gilts or equities. In addition,
domestic corporate news included a stock-swap agreement between
Hardy Oil &AMP; Gas and British-Borneo and a possible merger between
the land-based defense units of GKN and Alvis.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares traded higher with investors
encouraged by Wall Street's upswing, a stronger dollar and the
re-election in Bavaria Sunday of a conservative government. The
leading Dax index closed up 159 points at 4,896.5.
</P>
<P>
The rally was "a sum of many parts," according to a
Frankfurt-based portfolio manager. "It's partly technical, partly
the result of good news."
</P>
<P>
The dollar's gains against the Dmark also brought investors
back to the bourse. The dollar hit a 16-month low last Thursday,
triggering a flight from Germany's dollar-sensitive, export-driven
stocks.
</P>
<P>
While German share prices were up across the board, the bank
sector posted steady gains. Traders said the banks are retracing
earlier losses due to the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks finished higher too with investor
confidence returning on New York's strong performance. The leading
Cac-40 index closed up 136 points at 3,715.
</P>
<P>
But traders said the rally appears stronger than it actually is
because of very low volumes.
</P>
<P>
"The rebound is in fact rather timid," a trader at ABN Amro
said. "There are plenty of buyers around but a near absence of
sellers."
</P>
<P>
After a disastrous market performance last week, French banking
shares were charging ahead.
</P>
<P>
But traders said the rally doesn't come close to countering the
heavy losses banking shares experienced last week on market fears
of heavy losses in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The banks are gaining some ground, yes, but it's nothing
compared to what they lost last week," the trader said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Release of Senior S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African
National Congress (ANC) Monday welcomed Mozambique's decision to
release Robert McBride, a suspended director of South African
Foreign Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe also thanked
Mcbride for cooperating with the Mozambican authorities in their
investigations of gun-running allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that he will continue to cooperate until the
judicial process is completed," said Masebe.
</P>
<P>
McBride was set free Monday. His release was initially planned
for last Friday, but his South African lawyer, Jose nascimento,
was quoted as saying his release could not go through last week
because of bureaucratic hitches.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to criticism that the ANC did nothing
to help secure McBride's release, he said the ANC respected the
sovereignty of Mozambique, and that it was committed to the rule
of law and the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
McBride was in charge of Asian affairs before his arrest. He
was arrested in March in a Mozambican town bordering with South
Africa. He was charged of gun-smuggling.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Mozambican security authorities also
tried to bring charges of spying against McBride, but nothing
more has been heard about this.

said Monday night that an armed hijacker of a Turkish passenger
plane surrendered at the airport in Trabzon province along the
Black Sea of Turkey after releasing all people on board.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted General Director
of the Turkish Airlines Yusuf Bolayirli that there is no any

However, he did not reveal the request of Ihsan Akyuz,
the armed hijacker of the Airbus A-310 type "Seyhan" plane,
during his press briefing at the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
But the agency reported that the gunman had hijacked the
plane in protest against the Turkish government's decision to
prevent girl students from wearing headscarves in schools and
universities.
</P>
<P>
The gunman hijacked the plane on the Ankara-Istanbul flight
at 20:37 local time (17:37 GMT) soon after the aircraft took
off from Ankara Esenboga Airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed on the Trabzon airport and later the

JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Commerce Secretary of
the United States William Daley arrived in Pretoria Monday,
kicking off his two-day visit to South Africa, the U.S. embassy
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Daley said he was expecting to meet South
African business and government leaders to discuss ways of
strengthening commercial relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, I am looking forward to meeting my South
African counterpart, Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin,
and to joining him and several of his colleagues in SADC to
discuss regional economic issues."
</P>
<P>
SADC stands for the Southern African Development Community,
which consists of 14 countries.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who last visited South Africa in March with President
Bill Clinton, said he would return again in December with a major
business delegation which would also travel to Angola, Kenya and
Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
"This trade mission will build on President Clinton's
commitment to enhancing U.S. commercial engagements with Africa
by developing a genuine partnership for trade and investment,"
Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Daley is due to leave South Africa Wednesday morning for
Tanzania and Kenya, where he will examine how the American
government can help victims of of last month's twin U.S. embassy
bombings -- in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam -- that killed more than
260 people.

HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest
timepiece event, the just closed Hong Kong Watch and Clock Fair
'98, attracted a total of 15,818 buyers from all over the world,
up 15 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in buyer attendance further strengthened Hong
Kong's position as the major supplier and distribution hub of
watches and clocks in Asia," said C.S. Lee, director of
exhibitions of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)
which was co-organizer of the fair.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas buyers attending this year's event was
5,692, up 6 percent over 1997, with visitors from Asia topping the
list, according to German-based independent audit specialists,
the Voluntary Control of Fair and Exhibition Statistics (FKM).
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Watch and Clock Fair was co-organized by the
HKTDC, the Hong Kong Watch Manufacturers Association and the
Federation of Hong Kong Watch Trades and Industries. This year a
total of 811 exhibitors from 15 countries and regions displayed
their latest timepiece products.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland has now become the top source of buyers,
followed by Japan and Taiwan. Eight Asian countries and regions
are among the top 10 of overseas buyer attendance, reaffirming the
fair as Asia's preeminent timepiece event, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's other traditional markets such as the United States
and Western Europe have also demonstrated positive growth, from 5

computing power, network tools and resources from anywhere, on or
off campus. And this would make the university at the forefront
regionally in the application of IT to pedagogy.
</P>
<P>
The students were offered substantial incentives to purchase
one of the three different features of notebooks, all equipped
with a 233 MHz processor and, amongst other features, a built-in

<HEADLINE> Franchise of Years-old HK Ferry Company To Expire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong government
announced Tuesday that the franchise granted to the Hongkong and
Yaumati Ferry Company (HYF), due to expire on March 31, 1999, will
not be extended.
</P>
<P>
The ferry company, with a history of 75 years, now operates six
 outlying islands services and six inner harbor and new town
routes.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive-in-Council has decided that the HYF routes,
 together with the Central to Hung Hom service operated by the
Star Ferry Company, should be grouped into different packages for
public tender. A license is normally granted for a period of three
years.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision of the Chief Executive-in-Council, a
government spokesman said: "Our immediate priority is to ensure
continuity of ferry services, in particular the services to the
outlying islands which have no land transport alternatives should
be maintained and further improved after HYF's current franchise
expires."
</P>
<P>
A gazette notice inviting tender submissions on six outlying
islands routes, grouped into three packages, will be published on
Friday, with tender closing on October 12. HYF and other operators
would be free to put in their bids.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 companies, including HYF, have expressed an
interest in operating ferry services in Hong Kong, the spokesman
revealed.
</P>
<P>
A separate public tender for the inner harbor and new town
routes will be conducted shortly afterwards, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Israel to Work for Comprehensive Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri Tuesday called upon the Israeli government and people
to work for materializing comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should take an
affirmative stance towards the peace process. Because peace serves
the interest of Israel in the first instance, and also the
interest of all the countries in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian prime minister made the remarks while addressing
an international economic conference organized by Euromoney, an
international financial foundation, which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The get-together is held under the title: "Promising Economies
of the Arab World -- Gold Coasts for Invest."
</P>
<P>
He told the gathering that the Middle East peace process has
been in a standstill over the past two years since Netanyahu
assumed office in Israel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri called on Netanyahu to take a positive attitude on the
peace process, stop rejecting initiatives aimed at propelling the
process and respect the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions, agreements already signed with the Palestinian sides
and the basic terms of reference agreed upon for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since
Israel began building settlements in Arab East Jerusalem in March
1997. U.S. mediation attempts have been frustrated by Netanyahu's
rejection of a 13 percent further Israeli redeployment plan.
</P>
<P>
Along with Arab ministers, more than 700 economists, investors,
bankers, brokers, representing 25 Arab and other countries, are
participating in the three-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The opening session was attended by Egyptian ministers, senior
bank officials, and chairmen of leading companies and
corporations.

times. Nevertheless, we must face the reality and be prepared to
go through an extended period of hardship."
</P>
<P>
Tung agreed with the DAB's view that Hong Kong's economy was
undergoing structural changes. He said: "We must recognize and
treasure our strengths and advantages, and develop on them. These
included development of our relationship with the mainland and the
tourist industry."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, the property market has gone through rapid
adjustment. This, together with the regulatory measures soon to
be introduced for the financial markets, will seek to improve the
competitiveness and operations of our markets," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that as external factors stabilize, there will be a
speedy recovery of Hong Kong economy.

<P>
The chief executive met with political parties in groups on
Monday and Tuesday to listen to their views on future policy
directions.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, U.S. Start Sixth Round of Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and the United States
began their sixth round of talks on a bilateral trade agreement in
Hanoi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will deal with issues involving the rights of
American firms to engage in import and export activities in
Vietnam and the degree of openness in the service market, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Trade Ministry officials said Vietnam must revise a
number of trade policies that were inconsistent with World Trade
Organization (WTO) principles if it wanted to solve the problems
in those issues.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had yet to discuss tax issues and the U.S. was concerned
about how much Vietnam would open its market to American products,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. diplomat said this round of talks was expected to last
till next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main contents of the Vietnam-U.S. trade pact were basically
the same as an agreement Vietnam will sign with WTO, but the
U.S. demands a number of higher standards for services, investment
and intellectual property, a Vietnam's official newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said because of the two countries' different
levels of development, and different legal systems and economic
management, it would take several more rounds of talks to discuss
the pact.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A new research by U.S.
and German scientists suggested that aspirin may significantly
suppress genetic mutations that lead to some type of colon cancer, the
Washington Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some previous studies had suggested that aspirin might help
prevent colon cancer, but nobody knew why it would work.
</P>
<P>
Now a team of U.S. and German researchers has examined a
severe, inherited type of colon cancer and found that in test
tubes, aspirin suppressed the genetic mutations that cause some
tumors. They said aspirin essentially pushed genetically unstable
cells to commit cellular suicide instead of reproducing.
</P>
<P>
lead researcher Richard Fishel of Thomas Jefferson University
in Philadelphia and colleagues at Germany's University of
Regensborg, reached the above conclusion after studying
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. In the United States
about 20,000 people have been struck by this cancer.

<HEADLINE> UK Cracks down on Internet Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw on Tuesday announced that Britain would crack down on racism
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Straw said
the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) would play an
important role against threatening, abusive and racist material
published on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet offers exciting opportunities for global
communication, but it is vulnerable to abuse, because Websites and
newsgroups are accessible from across international borders," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for governments across the world to work
together to remove illegal Websites and prosecute those
responsible.
</P>
<P>
An expert in the subject has warned that groups were not only
using the Internet for racism publicity but also for planning
terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
Racism was identified in a report compiled by the NCIS early
this year as one of the principal areas in which the Internet was
abused.
</P>
<P>
The NCIS has already been cooperating with other police
agencies around the world to target child pornography rings, and
intelligence reports suggest that similar co-operation will be
required to combat racism.
</P>
<P>
Net experts agree that the majority of right wing, neo-Nazi and
fascist Websites that publish racist material are concentrated in
North America, Germany and Scandinavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown said Tuesday he would present proposals by
the the Group of Seven (G7) industrial nations on how to deal with
the serious global financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Brown, due to pay a brief visit to Japan Wednesday, told
reporters that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, was a
key engine for growth in Asia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Brown, whose country is the current G7 president, is expected
to put forward some proposals on behalf of the G7 group during a
keynote speech to be delivered in Tokyo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will set out a number of proposals tomorrow. It is wrong to
say that nothing is being done," Brown said, adding the speech
would touch on the growing debate about whether some countries
should use short-term capital controls to deter speculative
currency attacks.
</P>
<P>
Brown reiterated the G7's commitment to preserve and create
conditions for sustainable domestic growth but he declined to
comment specifically on the chances of a coordinated cut in
interest rates to prop up economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The G7 agreed on the need "to be vigilant and look at the
changing balance of risks and the role of the IMF (International
Monetary Fund) and the World Bank in the situation," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Edge Up 0.2 Pct in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales rose
0.2 percent in August as compared with a 0.6 percent decline in
July caused mainly by a General Motors strike that had sharply cut
auto sales, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
August sales increased to a seasonally adjusted 224.8 billion
U.S. dollars, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
However, except the automobile category, sales of all other
retail goods rose by a relatively modest 0.3 percent in August.
That followed a 0.6 percent jump in July, better than first
reported.
</P>
<P>
Plentiful jobs and rising incomes have spurred consumer
spending in 1998. Moreover, unusually good mortgage rates have
encouraged Americans to buy houses, spurring sales of furniture
and home improvement supplies.
</P>
<P>
In August, sales of durable goods, items expected to last three
years or more, were unchanged after dropping 2.1 percent in July
due to the nearly-two-month-long GM strikes.
</P>
<P>
Furniture stores reported a strong 1.0 percent sale growth in
August, after similar jumps in the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
But sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped 0.5
percent. Auto dealers reported another 0.2 percent business drop
on top of the sharp slippery they suffered during the GM strikes.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods were up 0.3 percent in August in the
wake of a 0.6 percent increase in the previous month. Sales at
clothing and accessory shops were up 1.2 percent and department
store sales rose 0.3 percent as back-to-school shopping got
underway.
</P>
<P>
Food store sales were up 0.4 percent. Business at bars and
restaurants fell 0.2 percent in August. Drug store sales rose 1.1
percent, but continuing low fuel prices brought down sales by
another 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Drug To Treat Depression With Less Side Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists said that
they have developed a new drug called MK-869 which blocks a
brain chemical "substance P", thus being highly effective at
alleviating depression while causing fewer side effects than
existing medications.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Washington Post, in a
preliminary study, Mark S. Kramer of Merck Research Laboratories
in West Point, Pennsylvania State, and colleagues studied 213
patients with moderate to severe depression who took the new
drug MK-869, the anti-depressant Paxil or a placebo. Six weeks
later MK-869 reduced depression as effectively as Paxil, but
those taking MK-869 were much less likely to report side
effects, particularly sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
"Substance P" is a little-understood chemical messenger
concentrated in parts of the brain involved in emotion. The
researchers said that MK-869's effectiveness could provide new
insights into the chemical's function, and possibly the
underlying cause of depression.

<P>
HANGZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin and
National People's Congress (NPC) Stadning Committee Chairman Li
Peng have both written inscriptions for the founding of China's
largest university, the new Zhejiang University.
</P>
<P>
The new mega-university, founded today, consists of the former
Zhejiang University, Hangzhou University, Zhejiang Agricultural
University and Zhejiang University of Medical Sciences, all based
in this capital of east China's Zhejiang Province. It aims to be
one of the world's first-class universities in next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's inscription reads, "Run Zhejiang University well
and contribute still more to rejuvenating the country through
science and education", while Li's goes, "Carry forward the fine
school traditions and train talented people for building the
country."
</P>
<P>
The new Zhejiang University now tops all Chinese universities
in terms of academic departments, majors, number of students,
faculty and staff, campus area and computer network. It has 11
branches of learning, 145 four-year majors, 12 post-doctorate
programs, and 124 doctorate specialities as well as 192 master's
degree majors.
</P>
<P>
The new university has some 30,000 students, including 3,500
post-graduates and over 1,500 doctoral candidates. It has more
than 10,000 faculty members, including more than 800 professors,
1,600 associate professors, seven academicians of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and six academicians of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing attended today's inauguration
ceremony. He said that the founding of the new university
represents another step China has taken to reform its system of
higher learning and will certainly promote the rational
utilization of educational resources in the country.

Modeled after those of the former Soviet Union, Chinese
colleges and universities founded during the 1950s and 1960s were
all run by the state, State Council departments, industries, or
provinces or regions. This led to a surfeit of specialized
colleges, a waste of resources and low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The new Zhejiang University's president, Pan Yunhe, a member of
the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a computer expert, said
that the university will emphasize on research and encourage
creativity to make breakthroughs in major fields. He pledged to
bring the total number of graduate students in the university to
over 10,000 by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The new university will focus on establishing new disciplines,
especially in the frontier sciences, so as to enhance its
competitiveness," Pan added.
</P>
<P>
The new university, which consists of five campuses with a
total area of approximately 287 ha with 1.7 million sq m of
building space, is expected to get a total of 800 million yuan
(96.6 million US dollars) in funding from the central treasury and
the provincial government, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The university's higher education computer network, the largest
of its kind in China, offers long-distance information on
teaching, academic research, scientific programs and school
administration.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, faculty staff and students will be able to conduct
scientific cooperation through the network or consult its
electronic library, as well as conduct academic exchanges.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) announced on Tuesday that it recently seized
two tons of opium and one kilogram of heroin from the smugglers in
Torbat-e-Jam, northeastern province of Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, the narcotics were
seized during a series of armed confrontations with the
traffickers, in which 12 smugglers were killed and a large amount
of ammunition and several rifles were seized by the IRGC forces.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC launched a grand maneuver in Torbat-e-Jam on
September 1 and deployed 70,000 troops and equipment involved
in the maneuver at the border with Afghanistan following the
tension with the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Iran accused the Taliban of killing nine Iranian diplomats
and reporter in northern Afghanistan and threatened to take
revenge on the group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's anti-drug headquarters said on Monday that
drug traffickers with the collaboration of the Taliban group
recently mixed narcotic drugs with dangerous compounds such as
chemical fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that the issue was found after many
addicts died due to being affected by an unknown disease after
taking the drugs, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that medical tests have confirmed that the disease
and the subsequent death in the addicts have been caused by the
chemical substances added to the drugs.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Profits From Financial Crises Elsewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Egypt's Banks Union
Mahmoud Abdel Aziz said Tuesday local banks have made money out of
the financial crises in Asia and Russia, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Aziz, speaking on the sidelines of a conference organized
by Euromoney Organization for the rising markets in the Arab
countries here, said that the crisis in South East Asia has
affected the market by about 3 percent while the crisis in Russia
had a lesser impact because of the powerful indicators in the
Egyptian economy.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Egypt (NBE) made use of the crises and
purchased crumbling shares in the world market, selling it later
at a higher price making a profit of about two to three million
dollars on stocks in the Asian market and about two million
dollars on stocks in the Russian market, according to Abdel Aziz,
who is also NBE chairman.
</P>
<P>
NBE also bought 1.4 billion dollars worth of securities in the
London stock exchange during the crisis and earned some 100
million dollars while the Commercial International Bank (CIB)
bought some 25 million dollars worth of shares and made profits of
about 5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The NBE, one of Egypt's four largest state-run banks, is now
concentrating its activities on foreign deals.
</P>
<P>
It has purchased a foreign bank in the U.S. which became a NBE
branch that will serve North and South America and is considering
establishing branches in Montreal, Los Angeles and Argentine. It
is also studying prospects for opening small NBE branches in China.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Aziz also said that the NBE has the largest securities
portfolio in Egypt and is speculating with about 3 billion
Egypt pounds (882.4 million dollars) and makes daily deals in
about 5 million pounds (1.47 million dollars) to breathe life
in the capital market.
</P>
<P>
He said the Egyptian government was determined to proceed with
privatization and continue its march towards a free market economy
and open the doors to world markets along with injecting new
capitals to increase the stock market and banks activities.

stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint
and desist from any action that could further escalate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia's solidarity with the people of Afghanistan as a
whole remains unchanged and is not aligned to any particular
faction," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Malaysia has consistently urged all Afghan factions
to negotiate rather than prolong the fighting and continues to
urge all parties concerned to fully support the efforts of the UN
Special Envoy to search for a lasting political settlement," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also conveyed the Malaysian government's
condolence to the bereaved families and to the Iranian government
on the loss of the innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that six Iranian diplomats and a journalist
were among nine killed when the Taliban militia seized the
northern Afghan city on August 8.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rules Out Devaluation of Rupee Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Commerce Minister
Ishaq Dar Tuesday ruled out any devaluation of the Pakistani rupee
against the U.S. dollar and warned of stern action against
speculators and violators of rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"We should curb the rumors about rupee devaluation and must try
to stabilize the local currency," he said at a press briefing
here.
</P>
<P>
Dar cited a number of decisions taken by the government
recently to check the speculative moves against the rupee and said
they have started producing positive results.
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 days, the rupee has gained around seven
rupees against the greenback and according to money changers, the
dollar closed at 56.10 and 56.50 rupees for spot buying and
selling on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister dispelled rumors that the rupee will be devalued
after negotiations with the team of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) currently visiting Pakistan to discuss its financial
package for the country.
</P>
<P>
Dar made it clear that there will not be any devaluation of the
rupee even if asked by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept any IMF conditionality which is against the
economic and financial interest of Pakistan," he said, adding it
is neither required or indicated by the economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
The only problem is on the balance of payment side which is
also "engineered," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said government officials will monitor the curb market to
ensure that rules and regulations, as set by the state bank, are
being adhered to.
</P>
<P>
The government will make sincere efforts to narrow the gap
between the composite rate and the official rate, said Dar.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged to take strict actions against the
practice of over- and under-invoicing and those money changers who
attempt to speculate on devaluation of the rupee.
</P>
<P>
Dar disclosed that even some banks were found to be involved in
"irregular" practices. "We are going to implement regulations
meant for banks and money changers both licensed and un-licensed,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ruble Tumbles After Brief Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ruble slid to
12.2 to the U.S. dollar after rallying briefly on Tuesday in
electronic lot trading on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange.
</P>
<P>
By 16:00 local time (12:00 GMT), quotes for deals ready for
delivery on Thursday stood at 10 to 13 rubles to the dollar, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the ruble had traded at 8.5 to 8.7 to the
dollar at the MICEX, up from Friday's 11.5 to 12 rubles.
</P>
<P>
Exchange points in Moscow are buying the dollar at the rate of
10 rubles, up from Monday's eight to nine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Viktor Gerashchenko, the newly appointed director
of the Central Bank, told deputies in the State Duma Tuesday that
the country could not cope without printing more money.
</P>
<P>
"There is a catastrophic shortage of money in Russia, many
commercial banks are in a difficult position," Gerashchenko said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said such a move would be taken only after
the new board of directors of the central bank was formed.
</P>
<P>
Gerashchenko said that President Boris Yeltsin had given oral
consent to the nominations of eight nominees to the board of
directors and ordered his chief of staff Valentin Yumashev to
prepare a letter introducing them to the State Duma (lower house
of parliament) for approval.
</P>
<P>
While Gerashchenko urged a speedy confirmation of the
candidates, the State Duma is not expected to approve the
nominations soon.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zhukov, chairman of the Duma Budget Committee, told
his committee that the People's Power and Liberal Democratic
factions had objected to debating the nominations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Not forming the Central Bank of Russia's board of directors
is similar to not appointing a prime minister on time,"
Gerashchenko warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that the money-printing problem would be discussed
when the government and the central bank discussed policies for
the fourth quarter of the year and at talks with the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Many fear that printing more money would throw Russia into
hyperinflation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- British Sky Sports chief Vic
Wakeling has branded stories claiming that his company had gone
behind Alex Ferguson's back to attempt to sign Hidetoshi Nakata
as "fanciful".
</P>
<P>
According to The Mirror newspaper on Tuesday, an official of
Rupert Murdoch's media empire was thought to have made a 6.25
million pounds bid for Nakata last week.
</P>
<P>
But the television boss made it clear that this was not the
case.
</P>
<P>
Wakeling said: "This story is completely untrue. During the
last week there there has been a lot of speculation.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has been mischievous and some of it downright
fanciful. This story falls into that second category."
</P>
<P>
Nakata, who dyed his hair orange during the World Cup, joined
Italian club Perugia and netted two goals in a sensational Serie
A debut against Juventus at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A Perugia source was quoted in the Mirror saying: "At no time
during these negotiations was Ferguson's name touched upon,
despite the fact it was clearly on behalf of Manchester United."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Asked to Recognize UNITA Breakaway Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos has asked the United Nations Security Council to recognize
the breakaway "UNITA Renovation Committee" as "the only lawful
dialogist" in the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the U.N. General Assembly dated September 10
and publicized here Tuesday, Dos Santos said that the Angolan
government has decided to recognize the legality of the "UNITA
Renovation Committee" and at the same time to abandon its
cooperation with Jonas Savimbi, President of the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The "UNITA Renovation Committee" is a breakaway from the
UNITA. The group led by the suspended Minister of Hotel and
Tourism Jorge Valentim and other UNITA members in the Angolan
government called on the opposition movement to hold on the peace
process and dismiss Savimbi as the UNITA president.
</P>
<P>
In his message, the Angolan president also asked the U.N. to
withdraw its recognition of Savimbi, stressing that what the
UNITA leader has done demonstrates that "he has put himself as
outlaw and thus is disqualified as the only lawful dialogist in
the Angolan peace process."
</P>
<P>
At the summit of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) in Grande Baie of north Mauritius, the heads of state and
government had in one voice condemned the war crimes committed by
Savimbi and recognized the status of the "UNITA Renovation
Committee" as the only lawful dialogist in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They issued a statement saying that what Savimbi has done
proves that he can no longer lead the UNITA in the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon the U.N., the observers from the
United States, Russia and Portugal and the international
community to recognize the new leadership of the UNITA and
encourage it to cooperate with the government comprehensively in
a bid to accomplish the pending tasks written in the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Protocol.

<HEADLINE> IOC to Promote Sports Between Seoul, Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) will send a special envoy to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) next week to initiate sports
programs between Seoul and Pyongyang, said IOC President Juan
Antonio Samaranch in Seoul on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, who is in Seoul to chair the meeting of IOC's
executive board, said senior IOC official Thomas Bach will visit
Pyongyang to discuss the inter-Korean sports exchange programs
with DPRK officials.
</P>
<P>
Bach, an IOC Executive Board member from Germany, said he would
take a van donated by Daimler Benz Group as a present for the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Bach's visit will provide a good occasion to seek a
dialogue with North Korea's authorities on the IOC's proposal of
promoting inter-Korean sports activities," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Samaranch on Monday briefed President Kim
Dae-jung during a meeting at the presidential palace Chong Wa Dae.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse was at the top of the agenda in the IOC executive
board meeting and Samaranch pledged the IOC's total commitment to
the fight against athletes' drug abuses.
</P>
<P>
The IOC could no longer tolerate athletes who cheated and lied
about drug scandals and would do everything possible to eradicate
the use of drugs among athletes, Samaranch said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Planning for Second Board Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Emerging firms in China's
interior area will have chances to list and raise funds in Hong
Kong, as the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong is planning to set up a
second board market, an exchange official said here today.
</P>
<P>
No specific restrictions will be imposed on the kinds of
enterprises to be listed on the second board market and all
emerging enterprises, whether state-owned or private, have equal
chances for listing, Peng Ruchuan, executive director of the China
Development Division of the exchange, told an international
symposium.
</P>
<P>
A second board market is a securities trading market for
companies, especially emerging enterprises, that are not qualified
for listing on the main, and more standard, first board market. It
therefore gives the said companies a channel through which to
raise funds from the public, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ of the United States is a typical second board
market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, enterprises in interior China, mainly large
state-owned firms, raise funds in Hong Kong through issuing H
shares. To date, inland companies have raised more than 10 billion
US dollars through share issues in Hong Kong, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that supervision over firms listed on the second
board market will be the same as over those listed on the main
market, though listing on the second board market need not be
approved by an official committee of listed firms.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two markets is that the investment
risk at the second board market is even greater, and the amount of
funds raised at the second board market is relatively smaller,
according to Peng.
</P>
<P>
He said that, personally, he is fully confident about the
prospects of the second board market, which has the full backing
of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France Move Ahead With Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and France have reached a
plan of action to set in motion their joint initiative to rescue
the faltering Middle East peace process, Egypt's Ambassador to
France Ali Maher said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan was formulated by a working group of experts from both
governments in Paris Monday, he told the Egyptian radio Voice of
Arabs over the phone.
</P>
<P>
"The prevalent idea is to hold an international conference to
rescue peace in two phases. The first will include nations not
directly involved in negotiations and the second will involve all
the parties concerned," Maher said.
</P>
<P>
"The conference is to draw world attention to the threat of a
continued peace impasse to regional and global security," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-French group began meetings in Paris Monday to
press ahead the initiative launched by their presidents last May.
</P>
<P>
The conference as described by officials in May would take
place in two steps, starting with a larger conference, then a
smaller one including nations like Israel directly concerned with
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa paid a
visit to France to discuss with President Jacques Chirac how to
organize the new conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attempts to break the peace deadlock between the
Palestinians and Israelis have been frustrated by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to accept a U.S. peace plan
calling for Israel to pullback troops from a further 13.1 percent
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have languished for 18 months
since the Israeli government began building Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem in March 1997.

Meanwhile, Xi'an is renovating other public vehicles for the
use of natural gas. The target for the year 2000 is to adjust
1,000 vehicles to use natural gas, and that for 2010 is to have all

<HEADLINE> Mafia Boss Arrested in Palermo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mafia boss Mariano Troia was
arrested Tuesday morning in Palermo, capital of Sicily, Italian
police said.
</P>
<P>
Troia, 65, was among the 30 most wanted criminals in Italy. He
was wanted for several mob slayings including that of leading
Sicilian politician Salvo Lima in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He was unarmed when arrested. Police said he appeared
"resigned" and had put on so much weight that he "looked
completely different form the photo we've been hunting him with".
</P>
<P>
An anti-Mafia prosecutor said Troia had been hiding out in
South Africa until about a year ago when he was summoned back to
try to heal a major rift inside the Cosa Nostra.
</P>
<P>
Troia's standing had risen sharply as a result of the thinning
of the Mafia's top ranks due to recent arrests, and mobsters were
counting on his charisma to restore cohesion, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
Italian police have scored a succession of headline-grabbing
Mafia arrests since 1993, most notably Giovanni Brushca in 1996
and Pietro Aglieri in June 1997.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Makes Pratical Steps Against Superleague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- UEFA, the European soccer
ruling body, made its first practical steps on Monday in a
campaign to prevent a breakaway superleague as a newly-formed
task force completed its first meeting.
</P>
<P>
The task force, named "European Club Football 2000", discussed
proposals to remodel the existing European Champions' League into
four groups of six, with a possible expansion from 24 to 32 clubs
and the merging of the exisiting Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Representatives to the meeting include those from six top
European clubs of Liverpool, Juventus, Ajax, Porto, Lyon and
Bayern Munich.
</P>
<P>
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner denied that the task
force was a knee-jerk reaction to the threat of a breakaway
competition organised by the Milan-based marketing company Media
Partners which has proposed a pan-European league involving 36
clubs turning over billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting, generally described as useful by the
delegates of national leagues and the major clubs invited as part
of the task force, was harmonious and successful with an aim at
bringing UEFA's current competitions more up to date.
</P>
<P>
But Former German international Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who
represented Bayern Munich, said money -- crucial to the clubs

<P>
PYONGYANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday criticized Japan's "concerns"
over the DPRK'S launch of an artificial satellite, said the Korean
Central News Agency (KCNA).
</P>
<P>
The DPRK would suspend negotiations with Japan on bilateral
diplomatic relations until Japan stopped its anti-DPRK acts, said
a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Japan still regarded the satellite launch as a ballistic
missile launch and attempted to bring the issue to the UN Security
Council and impose "international pressure" upon the DPRK, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to be Examined on Savings Accounts Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto will be examined in one or two days' time or within this
week at the latest in connection with his claim that he has no
savings accounts abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We will check whether he is indeed as clean as he has claimed
to be and President Habibie has agreed to do it," Supreme Advisory
Council Chairman Baramuli told reporters after a consultation
meeting with Habibie here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Soeharto would be examined by a special team which had
already been set up by the head of state.
</P>
<P>
"So it is not true that President Habibie is hesitant about
examining former president Soeharto," Baramuli said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the channel controlled by his eldest daughter
Siti Hardijanti Rukmana on Sunday, Soeharto said: "The fact is, I
don't have even one cent of savings abroad, don't have accounts at
foreign banks.. let alone hundreds of billion of dollars."
</P>
<P>
American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto, who
stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, had a
fortune worth 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Baramuli said the government would also examine Soeharto's
family members as well as his cronies "including those involved in
corruption, collusion and nepotism."
</P>
<P>
He said President Habibie had stated he would build a clean,
respected and corruption-collusion-nepotism-free government.
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Advisory Council has conveyed its stand to
President Habibie about the need to build a clean and respected
government", Baramuli said.
</P>
<P>
Among those to examine the former president would be the
Attorney General and the Chief of the State Police, Baramuli said,
adding that based on the results of the examination further
actions would be taken.
</P>
<P>
"If he is found guilty, he will be brought to court," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Health Minister Resigns Over Corruption Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Public Health Minister
Rakkiat Sukthana resigned Tuesday under mounting pressure from the
public over a corruption scandal, the Thai Cabinet announced at
its weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry is alleged to have pressured
hospitals to buy drugs and medical supplies from specified firms
at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
The wife of the minister is also charged of having received an
18-million-baht (450,000 U.S. dollar) kick-back from
pharmaceutical distributors.
</P>
<P>
A team consisting of members from the Public Health Ministry
Committee, a House health sub-committee and the Counter Corruption
Commission has been set up to investigate the scandal.
</P>
<P>
However, the result of the investigation is yet to be released.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said after the cabinet meeting
that the investigation will not stop at Rakkiat's resignation.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Rakkiat, deputy leader of the coalition
partner Social Action Party, is believed to be a damage-limitation
exercise and is meant to alleviate the pressure on the whole
government.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that key members of the ruling Democrat Party
agreed in talks Monday that with public pressure intensifying
daily, the government would become more vulnerable if it failed to
act.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, analysts warned that the government might be heading
for a premature fall if it is unable to eradicate corruption
within the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The move against Rakkiat has been prompted by growing public
dissatisfaction, which has shown itself in a campaign by public
interest groups to invoke a constitutional provision to initiate
his ouster.
</P>
<P>
The groups are collecting 50,000 signatures of eligible voters
necessary for asking the Parliament to dismiss people holding
political posts.
</P>
<P>
Despite Rakkiat's resignation Tuesday, leaders of the groups
said they will continue collecting the signatures in a bid to show
the will of the public.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he has not decided who will be Rakkiat's successor.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Tuesday that Rakkiat's resignation may lead to a
reshuffle of the cabinet.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from a market
research group have showed that there are 575,000 Internet users
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China,
the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The typical Internet user in Hong Kong is young, affluent and
male, but spends little time shopping online. E-mail is the most
popular Internet application, used by 61 percent of users, the
local newspaper reported, citing a study by market research group
AC Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
Other popular uses of the Internet include general surfing (47
percent), product or service information search (41 percent),
online newspaper reading (34 percent), and program downloading (31
percent).
</P>
<P>
Most established regional retailers regard virtual stores as
another sales channel that could give them an edge over
competitors, Chia Hork-hwa, a senior consulting and marketing
specialist for Eastern Consulting Group was quoted by the Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Chia said that Internet shoppers might be less loyal
than those who shop at store-front businesses and that confidence
is a key issue in attracting online customers.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Host Meeting on Cooperation in Mekong Subregion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Ministers and senior officials
from six countries would gather here from September 30 to October
2 to discuss new approaches for joint projects in the greater
Mekong subregion, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the 8th Conference on Economic Cooperation in the Greater
Mekong Subregion, the delegates would discuss a new concept, the
development of "economic zones" in the area, the Manila-based bank
said.
</P>
<P>
For example, industrial estates could be built near the border
of neighboring countries, such as Thailand and Laos. Both
countries can exploit comparative advantages in capital, natural
resources and labor for mutual benefit, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
"This will assist in the diversification, development and
restructuring of both economies and the ultimate objective of the
greater Mekong subregion cooperation," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the participants would also reaffirm their
long-term commitment to economic cooperation in the face of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, although the crisis is slowing down
projects in the energy sector largely because of lower power
demand in Thailand, there is continuing progress in other sectors
such as transport, telecommunications, human resource development,
tourism and environment.
</P>
<P>
The bank said 10 infrastructure projects have been either
completed or are under implementation in the subregion. About 1
billion U.S. dollars of resources have been mobilized to finance
these projects.
</P>
<P>
A draft Work Program 1998-2000 will also be presented during
the meeting. The delegates will focus not only on projects but
also on reducing non-physical barrier to cross-border activities
such as the streamlining of customs procedures.

<HEADLINE> Fair Trade Probe into Man United Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Fair Trading
(OFT) has launched an inquiry into BSkyB's proposed 623 million
pounds (about 1.03 billion U.S. dollars) takeover of Manchester
United FC.
</P>
<P>
The Director General of Fair Trading, John Bridgeman, has
invited comments ahead of his decision on whether or not to refer
the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for contributions is September 28. Mr. Bridgeman
will also consult the boards of Manchester United and BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
He will make his recommendations to Trade Secretary Peter
Mandelson on October 12. Mr. Mandleson has the final say on
whether or not to let the deal go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The OFT will try to establish if the deal constitutes a threat
to competition, in addition to any other issues that it deems to
be in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United have already accepted the offer. The OFT is
automatically entitled to look into any deal worth more than 70m.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United Chief Executive Martin Edwards said he saw "
no obstacles" to the completion of the deal, but the performance
of the club's share price suggested that the city did not share
his optimism.
</P>
<P>
Shares opened on the London stock market on Monday at 221p and
rose steadily, but still failed to meet the BSKyB bid price of
240p, indicating that traders had doubts the deal would be
approved.
</P>
<P>
News of the inquiry came as rock drummer Roger Taylor, a
member of the band Queen, donated 10,000 pounds to the
Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association to help
fight the takeover.

<HEADLINE> New Railway in Hong Kong on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The West Rail will improve
transport services for more than one million residents in Hong
Kong's Northwest New Territories by providing a swift, convenient,
safe and reliable link with urban Kowloon, a government official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing here the authorization of the construction of the
West Rail (Phase I) by the Executive Council, Secretary for
Transport Nicholas Ng said the West Rail is expected to be
completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
He said the West Rail would provide easy access for urban
residents to the rapidly growing Northwest New Territories in just
a 30-minute trip.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the West Rail will create about
13,000 jobs in the next few years. Everything being equal,
priorities will be given to local workers "in accordance with
government policy."
</P>
<P>
In assuring the public that the environmental impact of the
railway would be kept to the minimum, Ng said it is important that
both the government and residents of affected areas should closely
monitor the performance of the contractors involved and the
government will "ensure that environmental problems are addressed
promptly and effectively."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns Murder of Iranian Diplomats in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
Tuesday condemned the cold-blooded murder of Iranian diplomats by
Afghan Taliban militia on August 8 in Mazari Sharif in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
An official press release issued here Tuesday said that "this
brutal and abhorrent crime is an unprecedented and particularly
serious violation of the immunity of diplomatic envoys."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban announced on Thursday that they found the bodies of
nine of the 11 missing Iranian diplomats. Iran later confirmed
the death of the nine diplomats and a reporter, but said that
two others escaped the Taliban's massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government would like to "add its voice to that of
the U.N. Secretary General, the European Union and all those
other governments which have called for an immediate
investigation into the crime to track down the inhuman and
callous murderers and bring them to justice," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government expressed the hope that "restraint is
exercised under the circumstances and the peaceful solution of
the problems in the region is sought on the basis of the
generally accepted principles of international law."
</P>
<P>
The press release said the Cypriot government expressed "our
sincere condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims
and to the government and people of Iran."

MACAO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- In addition to Portuguese,
Chinese has become another language used in predial papers,
bringing remarkable convenience to the majority of Macao residents
who cannot read Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
The Predial Registration Bureau of Macao Monday demonstrated a

The use of Chinese shows the equal position of the two official
languages and helps raise the transparency of administrative

the Macao government.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese has been the only language in many government
papers, though Portuguese people constitute a tiny part of Macao's
population.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary, Chinese will be gradually used
together with Portuguese in commercial, automobile and airplane
papers and other kinds of civil certificates.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Rejects Sharing Formula of Marcos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Palace stood firm in rejecting the 75-25 sharing formula of former
president Ferdinand Marcos' wealth, Presidential Spokesman Jerry
Barican said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the sharing formula was made in a compromise deal
entered into by the Presidential Commission on Good Government
(PCGG) and the Marcoses during the previous Fidel Ramos
administration.
</P>
<P>
He said the sharing plan, although in favor of the government,
was not even approved by the then president Ramos.
</P>
<P>
"The supposed 75-25 compromise agreement between the Marcoses
and the Ramos administration was entered into by the PCGG without
the consent and approval of then president Fidel Ramos," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barican made the remarks in response to a proposal of Marcos
lawyer Reynaldo Dario for the government to withdraw its objection
to approving the compromise agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dario claimed that the withdrawal of the objection would
facilitate the release of 570-million-U.S.-dollar Marcos deposits
now held in an escrow account at the Philippine National Bank.
</P>
<P>
Marcos fled to Hawaii, the United States, in a popular revolt
in 1986 and died there three years later.
</P>
<P>
His successor, Corazon Aquino, established the PCGG to seek
Marcos wealth hidden around the world. However, it was until June
this year that the PCGG retrieved from two Swiss banks the 570
million dollars, part of the wealth Marcos collected during his 20
years' rule of the country.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Senate Minority leader Thomas Daschle and House Minority
Richard Gephardt criticized the White House legal defense
strategy, calling on President Bill Clinton and his advisers to
abandon what Daschle called "hairsplitting" about his testimony
denying a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
-- The world's major industrial powers offered Russia's new
government "continuing cooperation" and "friendly advice", but
no new cash without firm evidence that Moscow will continue on a
course of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton said the economic turmoil on three
continents constituted "the biggest financial challenge facing the
world in a half-century," and he proposed a strategy to quell
the trouble before it reaches American shores.
</P>
<P>
-- The Iraqi Parliament, which diplomats often consider an
advance-warning system on Iraq's policy, threatened to stop all
remaining cooperation with a U.N. arms inspection system.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- As worries about the Clinton scandal and about the wide
spread turmoil subsided, financial markets around the world
rebounded. The Dow Jones industrials rose 1.92 percent and the
blue chip index has gained 4.3 percent in two days and is now
slightly up for the year.
</P>
<P>
-- Most of China's economic statistics rebounded sharply in
August, reflecting higher government spending and raising hopes
that, while much of Asia slips into recession, this country's
economic growth will remain strong.

<HEADLINE> Shearer "not for Sale" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United have
dismissed growing speculations that its star striker Alan Shearer
is set to leave the club.
</P>
<P>
The club's Chief Executive, Freddie Fletcher, spoke out on
Tuesday after a series of stories linked the England captain with
transfers to Premiership leaders Aston Villa, Chelsea and the
Italian giants Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the number of stories suggesting Alan Shearer
is leaving Newcastle," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He is not in talks with any other club. He is not for sale.
He is not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
"I have said it before and I repeat it again, Alan is an
integral part of Newcastle's future and that's the way its going
to stay -- and that's final."
</P>
<P>
Aston Villa in particular had been reported by several
newspapers to be stepping up their bid to try to sign Shearer.
</P>
<P>
Villa's Manager John Gregory was said to have set up talks
with the player's advisor Tony Stephens after the UEFA Cup first
round clash with Stromsgodset at Villa Park on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, some sources close to Newscastle United say that
Shearer has not dismissed the possibility of a move to Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
After raking in around 18 million pounds from the sale of
Dwight Yorke, Savo Milosevic and David Unsworth, Gregory has
ample funds at his disposal despite the 6.75 million signing of
Paul Merson.
</P>
<P>
When Gregory was asked about Shearer last week, he said: "I
would love him in my team -- he is the England number nine.
Suggestions of him being in decline after his injury are
rubbish."

<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The trade deficit in goods in
the Philippines dropped by 78.6 percent to 1.438 billion U.S.
dollars in the first seven months this year from the year-ago
level of 6.729 billion dollars, the National Statistics Office
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total trade in goods for the January-July period decreased
by 0.04 percent to 34.251 billion dollars from the year-ago level

<HEADLINE> China Fighting Year 2000 Bug (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- All of China's stock
exchanges and securities companies will enter the 21st century by
the end of this month by turning the clocks in their computers
forward to December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
They have been required to test whether their computer systems
will be affected by the so-called year 2000 bug and whether the
stock market will run as normal when the new millenium comes.
</P>
<P>
"China's securities sector is keeping up with the advanced countries
in fixing ther year 2000 bug," said an official from China Securities
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
With less than 500 days remaining until the calendar flips to
the year 2000, China, the most rapidly developing computer market
in the world, is tackling the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable released by the State Council earlier
this month, China will fix all of its computer systems by the end
of March 1999, and will complete the checking and testing of the
fixed computer systems by the end of September 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It's not difficult technically, but it's really painstaking
and time-consuming to complete the huge task. China has more than 10
million computers and large numbers of embedded chips," said
Zhang Qi, a top official in charge of the year 2000 problem in
China.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 bug, also known as Y2K, arose from the fact that
most old mainframe computers still running keep track only of the
last two digits of each year. The computer assumes the first two
digits are 1 and 9. To the computer, 1999 is just 99. That means
that the computer will interpret 00 not as 2000 but as 1900,
throwing the date calculation off by 100 years.

<P>
Specialists estimate that the year 2000 bug biting the
computers can cause losses of 300 billion to 600 billion US
dollars globally.
</P>
<P>
China started to tackle the problem back in 1996. "Although
China still lags behind the advanced countries in fixing the
problem, it has drawn close attention in China's key departments,"
said Zhang Qi, director of the Product Department of the Ministry
of the Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
At early July, the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) declared that it would solve the problem in the computer
systems for ticket-booking. So travelers need not worry about
booking tickets for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University's Founder Group Corp., one of China's
largest computer manufacturers, has promised that all of the
personal computers it has produced will be all right after
entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismology Bureau plans to replace the computers in
the seismological monitoring systems next month to avoid false
reporting of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's securities and futures sector will conduct
four overall tests in its computer systems by the end of June
1999. And those departments which fail to pass the tests will be
deprived of their licenses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese media have been reporting more on the year
2000 bug since the beginning of this year, and some newspapers run
special columns to discuss the problem and explain to the
readership whether malfunctions will be caused in hospitals and
whether they will receive repeated telephone bills.

A class aimed at training 5,000 specialists to cope with the
problem in China's ministries and departments was opened by the
Ministry of Information Industry last week.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science and Technology
and China's commercial banks have offered financial support to
tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
In addition, new computers which have not been fixed are banned
from public sale, according to Zhang Qi.
</P>
<P>
However, the problem has not drawn enough attention in some
regions or by a hots of medium- and small-sized enterprises,
warned Dr. Sun Yuning, a specialist at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, adding that some firms shut out external experts to
tackle their problems to keep business secrets.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm worrying about is that others' faults will damage our
work. China has entered the network era, and every error in the
network will affect the overall situation," said Liu Shuzhong, who
has tackled the year 2000 bug for more than two years for the Bank
of China, which plans to fix all its computer softwares by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
"People should be concerned closely with the problems caused by
high-tech development. But China's pace toward an information
society will not be reslowed by the difficulties," said Zhang Qi.
</P>
<P>
At present, China produces more than three million computers
every year, and the annual output is estimated to reach 10 million
in the year 2000, one tenth of world's total.

LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United fans'
campaign against the BSkyB takeover will hit new heights on
Tuesday evening with a protest rally in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association
(IMUSA)is hoping fans will turn out in their thousands to show
their opposition to the proposed 623.4 million pounds deal.
</P>
<P>
IMUSA's campaign received a huge boost when rock star Roger
Taylor gave 10,000 pounds towards the costs of the rally at the
Bridgewater Hall.
</P>
<P>
Now IMUSA want others to follow Taylor's lead and donate money
and office facilities.
</P>
<P>
IMUSA chairman Andy Walsh said: "We will be making an appeal
tonight for more resources.
</P>
<P>
"Roger Taylor's generosity has kicked off the campaign but we
badly need more resources, such as office space, as well as
financial resources."
</P>
<P>
Walsh claimed that IMUSA would canvas opinion at the meeting
to devise the next steps in its battle to beat the takeover.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight will be an opportunity for United fans to decide the
strategy of our campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've shown in the last seven days that football fans can
make a difference if they band together.
</P>
<P>
"What we need now is for people to come and join us in this
campaign," he added.

<HEADLINE> Viagra Gets Marketing Approval from EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
authorized on Tuesday the anti-impotence drug Viagra for sale in
the 15 European Union (EU) member states.
</P>
<P>
The authorization was signed by European Industry Commissioner
Martin Bangemann in Strasbourg to clear the way for Pfizer Limited
Britain to market the drug.
</P>
<P>
The EU received applications to market Viagra from Pfizer
Limited Britain and Roerig Farmaceutici SpA, both units of the
American company.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner got the go-ahead for authorization from the
executive arm of the EU after the drug, produced by the American
company Pfizer, had first been endorsed in June by the European
Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and in August by
an EU medicines advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
Viagra is designed to treat erectile problems and not intended
for women and must not be administered to patients under the age
of 18, according to the opinion of the European Agency for the
Evaluation of Medicinal Products.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet on the medicine, which may only be supplied on
medical prescription, gives information on correct use,
contra-indications and undesirable side-effects.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Jochen Kubosch said Tuesday that Viagra
may encounter sales obstacles in the national health services of
the member states, but the commission was not in a position to
comment on these.
</P>
<P>
The drug, which has been on the market since April this year in
the United States, may take from two weeks to several months to
reach consumers in the EU due to concerns over its side-effects
which include possible eye problems and an
uncomfortable heartbeat rate.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Large-Scale Hydropower Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China is launching a vigorous
drive to develop hydropower projects by utilizing foreign funds
totaling 4 billion US dollars, and has so far built 23 hydropower
stations with a total generating capacity topping 18.84 million kw.
</P>
<P>
"China has the richest hydroelectric power resources in the
world, with exploitable water energy resources estimated at 376
million kw, ranking first in the world," said a senior official
with the State Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower stations at the Three Gorges, Xiaolangdi and
Ertan in Sichuan province are among the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China has so far completed 13
hydropower projects, with a combined generating capacity of 5.62
million kw at a cost of 1.442 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Five others, with a total capacity of 8.1 million kw, are being
built with 1.396 billion US dollars worth of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China has been developing its hydroelectric power industry for
four decades, but especially since the reform and opening-up
drive began in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Total generating capacity and annual electricity output have
risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh, respectively, in 1949,
to today's 52.17 million kw and 186.8 billion kwh. This makes
China third in generating capacity and production in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said there is still a lot that needs to
be done to make proper use of China's enormous resources, as its
total generating capacity accounts for only 13.8 percent of the
potential.
</P>
<P>
According to its medium-and long-range development plans, China
will have a capacity of 70 million kw by 2000, and by 2010 that
will rise to 125 million kw, or 33.1 percent of the country's
exploitable hydroelectric power resources.
</P>
<P>
The official further noted that 3.5 million kw will be added
annually, on average, in the remaining years of this century, and
from 2000 to 2010, hydroelectric power capacity will increase by
five million kw annually.

<HEADLINE> Foundation Establishes Fund to Aid Disaster Relief Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China Charity Foundation
(CCF), the largest charity organization in the country, is
preparing to establish a fund to aid fighters against natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tuan, deputy director of the preparatory committee of the
fund, said funds will be used to provide aid to family members of
martyrs and individuals injured during disaster relief efforts,
including both soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that interest earned on the fund will be used to
improve living and healthcare conditions and help the
aforementioned recipients overcome difficulties.
</P>
<P>
A Shanghai enterprise has donated three million yuan (about
370,000 U.S. dollars) to the fund and the CCF expects total
donations to reach 30 million yuan (about 3.7 million
U.S. dollars) by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The CCF, Beijing Municipal Telegraph Bureau and Wisdom Science
and Technology Enterprise have jointly launched an auction website
on the Internet to raise money for the fund.
</P>
<P>
China has suffered a series of natural disasters during 1998,
with an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale hitting the
Zhangbei area of north China's Hebei Province earlier in the year
killing 47 people, causing property damage of over 2.39 billion
yuan (about 300 million U.S. dollars) and leaving over 540,000
people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Heavy summer flooding in central, southeastern and northeastern
China killed 3,004 people, caused property damage of over 166.6
billion yuan (about 20.8 billion U.S. dollars) and affected over
223 million people.

<HEADLINE> Air Fares in Asia-Pacific Rising in Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Air fares in the Asia
Pacific region continued to climb though the Asia financial crisis
has dragged many economies into a downturn, a global travel
services company said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
American Express released its latest issue of Asia-Pacific
Airfare Index Tuesday, saying that in the third quarter of 1998
air fares rose across all classes of travel. Premium and business
classes led the hike, with prices up by 4.8 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The fare increases, a continuing momentum since the second
quarter, indicate that airlines are readjusting their pricing
structure in the wake of the Asia financial turmoil, explained
Eric Meierhans, director of Purchasing Management Group of
American Express.
</P>
<P>
He said that "...airlines are trying to raise more revenue from
premium class travelers, who tend to be less sensitive to price
increases than leisure travelers."
</P>
<P>
The regional currency crisis has dealt a hard blow to leisure
travel and put heavy burdens on airlines, which now have to pay
higher U.S. dollar-denominated costs for fuel and debt.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, one of the key costs for all airlines, are now at a
record low, but Asian airlines could not benefit from the drop in
greenback-denominated oil prices because of the devaluation of
currencies in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The American Express index showed that air fares in Hong Kong
are now five percent higher than a year before.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador Accused of Meddling with Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The general secretary of the
Mozambican ruling party has accused the U.S. ambassador to Maputo
of interfering with the internal affairs of the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Manues Tome, General Secretary of the Mozambique Liberation
Front Party (Frelimo), said here Monday that U.S. Ambassador to
Maputo Brian Curran should know that it's up to the Mozambicans
to decide on the elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ambassador should give up passing the message through the
press, whatever the nature of the message is," Tome told Noticias
exclusively. "If he really wants to offer his advice or
criticism, he can do that through diplomatic channels."
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Tuesday quoted the general secretary of
the Mozambican ruling party as saying that he was disappointed at
the remarks of the U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports in Domingo weekly published in
capital Maputo Sunday, Curran said that the presidential and
legislative elections scheduled next year should be just,
democratic, transparent and serious with the participation of all
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador stated that if the Mozambican opposition
parties decide to boycott the elections, the U.S. government
would withdraw its financial support for the 1999 elections in
the African country.
</P>
<P>
"Political and financial blackmails are outdated, particularly
in an era of economic globalization when all nations should
respect each other," said Tome.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that no Mozambican ambassadors to the U.S. had
ever tried to arrogantly teach the Americans a lesson on
political or moral issues through the press.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the ruling party pointed out that the main
financial support for the Mozambican elections has come from the
European Union instead of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
An unidentified analyst in Maputo said that the U.S.
ambassador was interfering with the internal political affairs of
Mozambique by making those remarks and the U.S. always considers
itself the champion and model of democracy.
</P>
<P>
He added that no political parties could be forced to
participate in the elections, either local or general, in any
part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, transparency is not measured by how many
political parties participate in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it's meaningless for the U.S. ambassador to attempt to
teach the Mozambicans a lesson, the analyst said, adding that the
U.S. financial support will be welcomed but it should not contain
blackmail.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique held local elections in 33 towns and cities around
the country on June 30 this year, with the ruling Frelimo winning
a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo)
together with other 15 small opposition parties boycotted the
elections.
</P>
<P>
During the 16-year war between the Frelimo and the Renamo, the
U.S. had all along been supporting the Renamo.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Invest Heavily in Urban Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou Mayor Lin Shusen
recently announced that the city will spend some 60 billion yuan
for key projects over the next three years, with substantial
funding earmarked for the transportation and environmental
protection sectors.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, is one
of the most prosperous cities in China. The municipal government
is set to introduce a diversified system to attract capital for
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
"Top priority will be placed on the city's infrastructure and
environmental protection sectors." said Lin, adding that the
government plans to invest 40.1 billion yuan in 109 infrastructure
projects, including highways, and 20 billion yuan on a new airport.
</P>
<P>
Extensive efforts will also be made to control pollution and
expand the downtown greenbelt.
</P>
<P>
The local government will focus on the construction of four
highways, including the access road to the new airport. Total
investments in related projects are expected to hit 24.88 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government and railway department also plan to
build a railway linking Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The 18.48-km No. 1 Guangzhou Subway Line will be completed at a
cost 14 billion yuan and will enter operations by the end of this
year. Construction of the 21.34-km No. 2 Subway Line commenced in
July this year.
</P>
<P>
"Completion of the projects will greatly relieve existing
traffic problems," said Lin.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that the city has allocated substantial funding
for construction in recent years. However, he noted the need for
more high quality image-building projects. Exemplary projects,
including roads, landscaped public squares and social venues are
currently under construction, and plans are being made for more
cultural centers and parks.
</P>
<P>
A group of exemplary projects, including the new Guangzhou
Stadium, Guangdong Olympic Sports Center and Guangzhou Theater,
will be contracted through international bidding.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Joint Liaison Group Meets in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) began its 43rd meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The JLG, which meets alternately between Beijing, London and
Hong Kong, is meeting for the first time in Hong Kong after its
return to China on July 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the two-day meeting, Senior Chinese
Representative Wang Guisheng extended a warm welcome to the
British delegation led by Senior Representative Ambassador Alan
Paul.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the JLG's mission has been basically finished
after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the two sides still have some work to do --
to deal with the remaining issues, new issues arising from the
implementation of the past agreements reached by the two sides and
other issues which both sides deem necessary to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is adopting a positive, friendly and practical
attitude towards the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said great changes had taken place since they last met
here some 15 months ago. One of the big changes was that the seats
between the guest and the host have been swapped.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that although the issue of Asian financial turmoil is
not on the formal agenda of the current meeting, it would be
touched upon during the discussions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has displayed exceptional courage and
wisdom in dealing with the effects of the Asian financial crisis
and achieved remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Central Government resolutely
implements the principle of "one country, two systems," and will
never interfere in decisions made by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
But "we support the measures the SAR government has taken to
maintain the linked exchange rate system and stabilize the order
of its financial market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the major factors contributing to the HKSAR's success in
dealing with the impact of the Asian financial crisis -- the sound
financial system, sound economic fundamentals and the hefty
foreign exchange reserves -- one is that Hong Kong had become a
SAR of the People's Republic of China before the financial turmoil
hit the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Central Government has made the firm
decision not to devaluate the Renminbi, which constitutes a
positive contribution not only to Hong Kong but also to Asia and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Paul said that after the handover, Hong Kong has
all important aspects being allowed to exercise a high degree of
autonomy promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the
Question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The British government firmly supports the resolute
determination of the Hong Kong SAR to defend the Hong Kong dollar
peg, he said.
</P>
<P>
The British side highly values this policy which is a vital
contribution to the region and the global financial stability as
well as to Hong Kong, he said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Seek Support For Anti-drug Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 15 (Xinhua)-- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) will convene a conference attended by
international sports federations this month to seek their support
for a proposed Olympic agency to lead the worldwide anti-drug
campaign.
</P>
<P>
IOC director general Francois Carrard said Tuesday that IOC
will also meet with Olympic summer sports federations on October
27 in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The governing body had announced last month at an emergency
meeting in Lausanne, that it planned to set up a special agency
to coordinate drug-testing programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
The summit was called following the Tour de France hit by drug
scandals this summer, where riders and team officials were
implicated in cases of systematic doping.
</P>
<P>
Carrard said the IOC hopes to get final approval for the
project during the February 2-4 world anti-doping conference in
Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Carrard said the four IOC vice presidents were close to
finalizing the makeup of their working groups on the main themes
of the conference: protection of athletes, political and legal
issues, ethics and prevention, and financial questions.
</P>
<P>
Vice president Dick Pound of Canada, in charge of the
financial issues, said the IOC planned to finance the drug agency
mainly through Olympic television rights fees and sponsorship
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Carrard said the IOC would open consultations in November with
governments on getting their assistance in fighting drug use in
sports. The governments of Australia and the United States, hosts
of the next two Olympics, would be among those consulted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The government launched a
roving exhibition here Tuesday to promote the Basic Law among the
civil servants of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the exhibition at Wanchai
Tower, Sandra Lee, acting secretary for the civil service, said
that the exhibition is one of the major activities of the
government to promote the Basic Law among the civil servants.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is very important for the civil servants to
learn the Basic Law. To learn the Basic Law is also a concrete
step for the civil servants to "understand one country and realize
two systems", Lee added.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Civil Service Bureau has done much in
enhancing the understanding of the Basic Law among the civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,076 civil servants had attended training courses
and seminars on the Basic Law by the end of August and a large
number of books, pamphlets and video tapes had been distributed to
the civil servants to help them learn the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Arafat to Compromise in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu here Tuesday urged Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to make compromise in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made this call in a press conference held after
holing talks with visiting Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov.
During the talks, the two leaders discussed the issues of
bilateral economic cooperation and the situation in Central Asia
and the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to talk about in detail about the ongoing peace
talks between Israelis and Palestinians, but I can assure you that
if Arafat can make political decisions on key issues, there will
be an agreement," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks resumed last Wednesday
after U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross' return to the
region. They touched upon interim issues such as Israel's troop
redeployment in the West Bank, Gaza airport and seaport, the safe
passage linking the West Bank and Gaza and security cooperation
between Israel and Palestine. But no substantial progress was
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
On the redeployment issue, Israel blamed the Palestinian side
for its refusal of Israel's 13 percent withdrawal plan, in which 3
percent would be turned into a nature reserve with Israel's
control of security. The Palestinian side said this 3 percent must
be turned in to Area B, in which the Palestinan side should be
responsible for its civil administration.
</P>
<P>
"If you (Palestinian side) want an agreement, then you will get
one soon," Netanyahu said, adding that Arafat must take tough
measures to fight terrorism and make political decisions on the
key issues discussed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Netanyahu said he had discussed with Karimov
future economic cooperation between the two countries and the
issue of cooperation in fighting Islamic fundamentalism which
poses direct threat to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he named Iran and some other countries and
urged Russia to stop supplying missile development technology to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic cooperation is on the main agenda for
Karimov's three-day official visit to Israel which began on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Karimov worked out nine agreements during the
talks and signed them just before holding the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed included bilateral trade and economic
cooperation and cooperations in the fields of technology,
culture, agriculture, health and environment.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Karimov held talks with his Israeli counterpart
Ezer Weizman, in which Weizman expressed his worries about the
stalled peace process and asked Karimov to help break the
impasse.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday afternoon, Karimov went to Ramallah to discuss the
peace process and bilateral issues with Arafat.

<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) Tuesday approved a loan of 70 million U.S. dollars to help
Uzbekistan repair a historic railway in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that the railway, covering part
of the famed silk route from Chengeldy to Samarkand in Uzbekistan,
is in urgent need of repair.
</P>
<P>
The poor condition of the 320-kilometer railway track forces
trains to travel at a speed as low as 25 kilometers per hour
instead of the normal 80 kilometers per hour, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Railways are the main mode of transport in Uzbekistan, carrying
nearly 90 percent of all freight. The ADB said that improving this
critical route will boost trade and stimulate economic growth in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers' Way of Life Changing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Economic development has
changed the outlook in Chinese rural areas and has also changed
Chinese farmers' customs and way of life.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers used to ignore modern etiquette, but now more
and more villagers consider etiquette important in their contacts
with outside world.
</P>
<P>
Knowing little about etiquette, Zhangshi village in North
China's Hebei Province once failed to cooperate with a printing
plant in the city of Baoding in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Zhangshi village paper mill went to sign a
contract with the printing plant, but his rude style of
conversation and informal dress spoiled the negotiation atmosphere
and resulted in an unpleasant suspension of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the importance of etiquette, the village leaders
called on their people to take etiquette lessons. Now these
villagers are adapting themselves to modern habits in their daily
lives.
</P>
<P>
Chinese rural areas used to be very quiet in the evening
because farmers went to sleep early after a day's hard work, but
now the countryside is lively at night.
</P>
<P>
Karaoke and yangko (a rural folk dance) are becoming popular,
and in the evening many farmers go outdoors for fun and they have
a jolly time singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
"People are more affluent than before, so they want to enjoy
themselves in their free time," said Li Yuzhan, the head of
Muzhuang village in Hebei.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers are also changing their taste in food, as their
diet now includes more fish and meat as well as the traditional
coarse cereals.
</P>
<P>
Liu Li, deputy secretary-general of the China Food Association,
said that changes in the farmers' diet show that more of them have
come to know about a balanced diet and they are now eating in a
more healthy way.

<HEADLINE> Merger of Universities Lends New Competitive Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang University, the
largest comprehensive institute of higher learning in China, was
brought into being here today, with the ambitious goal of ranking
itself among the world's first-class universities in next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The new university is a combination of four universities
--Zhejiang University, Hangzhou University, Zhejiang Agricultural
University and Zhejiang Medical University-- in east China's
Zhejiang Province. It is now the largest university in China, with
11 branches of learning, over 10,000 faculty members and some
30,000 students.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing attended the inauguration ceremony, and
said the initiation of the new university represents another step
China has taken to reform its system of higher learning and will
certainly promote the rational utilization of educational
resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
Modeled after those of the former Soviet Union, Chinese
colleges and universities established during the 1950s and 1960s
were run by the state, State Council departments, industries, or
provinces or regions. This led to a surfeit of specialized
colleges, a waste of resources and low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The new university's president, Pan Yunhe, said the university
will put emphasis on research and encourage creativity, and make
breakthroughs in major fields. He pledged to bring the total
number of graduate students in the university to over 10,000 by
the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The new university will focus on establishing new disciplines,
especially in the frontier sciences, so as to enhance its
competitiveness, Pan said.
</P>
<P>
The new university is expected to get a total of 800 million
yuan (about one million US dollars) in funding from the central
treasury and provincial government, sources said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday encouraged foreign companies to invest
in Israel, citing the stability and potentiality of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a news conference for the coming Israeli Jubilee
Business Summit, Netanyahu said that the economic environment in
Israel is good for investment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a result of the right economic policy taken by
his government, the inflation rate in Israel went down to only 4
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said that while a lot of countries throughout
the world have suffered from the economic crises recently, Israel
had not been involved in the turbulence though its economy was
open to the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that it showed the right direction of the government's
policy and the stability of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Netanyahu said that Israel is going on with the
economic reform and will continually privatize state-owned
companies and encourage competition in the market.
</P>
<P>
Then there will be a lot of opportunities for foreign investors
to make money in Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 150 foreign companies from 28 counties will
take part in the Jubilee Business Summit, which is due to be hold
in Jerusalem in the mid-October.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Plane Ticketing Makes Debut in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China today became one of the
first countries in the world to sell electronic airplane tickets
to passengers.
</P>
<P>
China is the first place that the United States-based United
Airlines (UA) chose to start its worldwide campaign to spread the
use of the paperless E-ticket.
</P>
<P>
China's move will be followed by Singapore, Germany, Italy,
France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The electronic ticket, which will be available at UA's Beijing
office from today, is carried through the airline's computer
system instead by the traveler himself. In fact, he does not need
any ticket when boarding a UA flight. He has just to show that the
credit card that he used to buy the E-ticket matches the records
in the computer.
</P>
<P>
"We picked China as one of the first places to implement
E-ticket service because it is easiest to do it here," said
Christopher Lin, general manager of UA in China.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese authorities have had a very supportive
attitude toward UA's E-ticket service in China.
</P>
<P>
UA has already set up 11 customer representative service
offices around China. It is expected to win approval to set up
another ten offices in the country this year.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that, as a technological innovator in the world
aviation industry, UA is working on a software system to enable
its computer ticketing network to interface with various ticketing
networks around the world, including the one in China.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that UA will make E-tickets available at all its agents
around China next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, though the use of credit cards is still
not very common in China, past experience has proved that UA will
probably see a multifold increase of business in the new operation
in only a few years after introducing it to China.
</P>
<P>
UA now accounts for one-third of the air flight market from the
U.S. to China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ronghua, deputy director of the international department
of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), said that
China needs the help of UA, the world's largest airline, with
invaluable expertise, experience and technology.
</P>
<P>
This year, China will invest three billion yuan (362 million US
dollars) to update its airlines computer ticketing system and
build a commercial information network for the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
CAAC has already connected its administration computer system
with those of foreign airlines, such as Ansett of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Since it began trial service of E-tickets on domestic flights
in the U.S. in 1994, UA has achieved annual sales of 3.4 million
E-tickets worldwide in 1997. Last year, E-tickets made up over
half the total number of tickets that UA sold around the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern today praised China's efforts on human rights, saying
he has been encouraged over the past years by the important steps
China has taken in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, the first Irish prime minister to visit China since
the two countries forged diplomatic ties 19 years ago, delivered a
speech to an audience of more than 100 at the Foreign Affairs
College this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he is also encouraged by efforts
currently being made to ensure the success of the human rights
dialogue between China and the European Union. "We believe that
this dialogue has the potential to yield very positive results and
we are heartened already by evidence of transparency and sincerity
on all sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the visit to China by United Nations high
commissioner for human rights Mary Robinson, former Irish
president, has been very significant, and he voiced the hope that
it will assist and intensify constructive human-rights dialogue
between China and the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights are universal values common to all humanity, when
we discuss them, they must be as matters of collective mutual
concern, not as issues which divide us," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ahern also expressed high appreciation for China's economic
development, saying China has telescoped into one generation what
it has taken other countries centuries to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
He said he is fully confident that China will succeed in its
extraordinary voyage of change and that in so doing it will have
enriched the world. "The past two decades have seen sustained
rapid modernization unlike that in any other period in China's
long history, and the next two decades promise more of the same."

<HEADLINE> China to Build Large American Grape Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's annual imports of popular Red Globe grapes stand at 723
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the province, located along the ancient Silk
Road, to spend 800 million yuan (about 96.4 million US dollars)
over the next six-odd years to established the production base.
</P>
<P>
The Red Globe variety, which was introduced to China in the
mid-1980s, offers greater preservation qualities and ease in
transportation than most varieties of Chinese grapes.
</P>
<P>
China currently grows grapes on 166,660 ha, including 600 ha
dedicated to the production of the Red Globe variety.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, one of the nation's major fruit production bases,
ranks closely behind the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions in
terms of ideal conditions for grape production.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that soil conditions, extended periods of
sunshine and mild temperatures will enable Shaanxi to produce
over 15,000 kg of Red Globe grapes per hectare.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Rapid Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China has registered rapid
economic growth over the past 20 years, according to an official
of the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Shao Zongming, deputy director of the bureau, gave this remark
at a seminar on the publication of a book named "Splendid
Achievements Over 20 Years".
</P>
<P>
The book, compiled by the bureau, praises the splendid
achievements China has scored, analyzes in depth the problems
China's economy faces, and brings up suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Shao noted that China is now listed No. 7 in terms of economic
strength in the world, with the annual economic growth rate for
the past 20 years reaching 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1997 China's output of grain reached
494.17 million tons, while the output of many industrial products
was also listed high in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the investment in fixed assets has totalled
14,000 billion yuan, including 2,530 billion yuan in 1997 alone.
A batch of key infrastructural projects were constructed during
the period, such as the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station and the
Beijing-Kowloon railway.
</P>
<P>
With this economic development, a "buyer's market" is taking
shape in China. In 1997, the retail sales in the country reached
2,729.9 billion yuan-worth, some 20 times those in 1978.
</P>
<P>
China is now opening still wider to the outside world, as it
has set up trade relations with more than 200 countries and
regions and it has used 348.3 billion US dollars of foreign funds
in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The living standards of the Chinese people are improving as their
incomes rise. In 1997, the per capita disposable income for
urban residents reached 5,160 yuan, registering an annual growth
rate of 6.2 percent, while the per capita net income for farmers
reached 2,090 yuan, with an annual growth rate of 8.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Lower in Quiet Dealings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
drifted down to a weaker close Tuesday amid quiet dealings.
</P>
<P>
With the Japanese markets closed for a public holiday, there
was little to influence the local unit.
</P>
<P>
"There's not a great deal of volume out there. It's been pretty
thin, a pretty dull day on the currency," Glen Howard, portfolio
manager at Perpetual Funds Management, said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended here at 59.49 U.S. cents from 59.72
at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
On the day the Australian dollar traded between 59.25 and 59.63
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the currency market would continue to focus on U.S.
politics and its effect on stocks and the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"And on the other side of it, we'll still be looking at the yen
and see what's happening tomorrow -- if we hear any more about
possible banking reforms in Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local traders also believed that the key event to watch out for
will be an address to be made by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan to the U.S. House Banking Committee early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Howard said, "I think he will be watched very closely to see
whether he does give any clues on whether or not they have moved
to an easing bias or whether they are in a neutral bias."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 79.24 Japanese yen from 78.89
and 1.009 German marks from 1.0178.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Troops Disperse Protestors In Maseru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho army Tuesday
morning dispersed groups of youths from opposition parties, who
attacked civil servants, causing panic among commuters going to
work, said reports reaching here from Maseru, capital of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The protestors seized government vehicles in Maseru and forced
civil servants driving to work to abandon their cars.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been brought under control after the army
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Army trucks are patrolling the streets of Maseru and groups of
police officers were stationed at strategic points along the main
streets, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The violence took place after South African Defense Minister
Joe Modise held the second round of talks with the Lesotho
cabinet and army on problems in the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF).
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the protestors were against the
intervention of South Africa and other countries in the region in
attempt to resolve a political crisis in Lesotho arising from the
alleged rigging of results of Lesotho's general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, protesters gathered outside the residence of
South African High Commissioner to Lesotho, Japhet Ndhlovu, in
Maseru to protest against the presence of Modise and his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Raido Lesotho announced Tuesday that the talks between Modise
and the Lesotho government were fruitful, but it did not report
details.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South African Press Association quoted reliable
sources as reporting that the defense ministers of South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe are due to meet in Gabarone later Tuesday
in the latest efforts to resolve problems in the Lesotho army
which has contributed to political instability in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night of last week, LDF commander Makhula Mosakheng
reportedly made announcement of resignation on national radio at
gun point.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe make up the Southern
African Development Community's so-called troika on Lesotho,
established in 1994 to mediate a solution to then political
crisis in that country.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Foreign Exchange Infractions (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new set of regulations on foreign exchange management does
not mean that China has returned to a total and rigid foreign
exchange control, the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in China's foreign exchange
revenues and expenditures since reform of the foreign exchange
system in 1994, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
International revenues and expenditures have been balanced for
several years in a row, and foreign exchange reserves have been
increasing fast, he added.
</P>
<P>
In late 1996, China accepted Article VIII of the International
Monetary Fund Agreement and started to allow the Chinese currency
yuan become convertible under current accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
This effectively advanced the fresh growth of China's foreign
trade and the use of overseas funds, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We will value this reform achievement by continuing the
practice of letting the yuan be convertible under current
accounts, improving the management of capital accounts, and
safeguarding a balance between international revenue and
expenditure for national economic security," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations regarding control of foreign exchange
published recently are, under the prerequisite of persisting in
the RMB convertibility under current accounts, supplemental and
revised contents based on the existing rules on foreign exchange
control, he said.
</P>
<P>
This bears in mind violations discovered in the nationwide
inspections on foreign exchange to prevent loopholes in examining
validity of current accounts for the RMB convertibility and to
improve management of approving foreign exchange revenue and
expenditure of capital accounts, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he hopes the newly published regulations
will help increase more legal foreign exchange inflow, halt
illegal foreign exchange outflow, and plug loopholes in foreign
exchange dealings.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations have not only made stipulations on foreign
exchange tradings by banks, enterprises and individuals, but also
set higher standards for supervisory organizations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that improvement of the regulations is
focused on ensuring the legal flow of foreign exchange, which will
not affect the principle of RMB convertibility under current
accounts, or go back to the past practice of total and rigid
foreign exchange control.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises which need foreign exchange for current accounts
and individuals who want hard currencies for private matters can
go, as usual, to purchase foreign exchange with valid papers
stipulated by relevant regulations, the spokesman emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He added that halting the abnormal flow of foreign exchange
will better satisfy enterprise and individual normal demands for
foreign exchange in the long run.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman On U.N. Taiwan Refusal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao expressed China's sincere appreciation for
the vast majority of United Nations member states who have upheld
justice on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark here this afternoon at his regular press
conference when asked to comment on the latest refusal by the
General Committee of the U.N. General Assembly to a proposal
concerning Taiwan's so-called "representation" at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He also advised a small group of countries concerned not to
harm the sentiments of the Chinese people again.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterated that China's representation at the U.N. was
thoroughly settled when the U.N.'s 26th General Assembly passed
Resolution 2758 in 1971, and that Taiwan, a province of China,
lacks qualification for U.N. membership.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan has encouraged a small group of countries to
stage a proposal to list Taiwan's so-called "representation" on
the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly, which, of course, met
with opposition from the vast majority of U.N. member states, Zhu
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture,
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State
Bureau for Quality and Technology Supervision will jointly launch
a large-scale inspection of seed quality and sales across China.
</P>
<P>
The inspection begins today and will end on September 30, said
Lu Ming, vice-minister of agriculture, at a press conference here
today. He added that the purpose of this move is to rectify the
seed market and ensure farm production.
</P>
<P>
They intend to check seed suppliers to discover whether they
are qualified and whether or not they are engaging in any illegal
activities in their operation.
</P>
<P>
"Those found violating the law will be punished severely," Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that seeds play a key role in agricultural production
and increased income for farmers, especially at present when the
flooded areas are rebuilding and the autumn planting is about to
begin across the country.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce said the current seed market needs rectification as
sometimes fake seeds are reported to appear on the market.
</P>
<P>
China pays close attention to seed quality, and in the past has
launched about ten such seed-inspection campaigns.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Congolese Refugees Flee into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 5,000 refugees
from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have fled
into neighboring Tanzania, United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday morning, the DRC refugees who crossed Lake
Tanganyika into Tanzania to escape the battles between the rebels
and the troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila's government had
reached 4,935, said Jean Durieux, head of the UNHCR sub-office in
Kigoma, where the refugees are accommodated.
</P>
<P>
A number of Congolese people began to flee from Kalemie on the
western shore of the lake. "There has been heavy fighting in and
out of the town," Durieux told Xinhua over telephone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the refugees had mainly come from
the eastern Congolese towns of Uvira and Baraka.
</P>
<P>
The DRC is currently locked in a civil war in which the rebels
want to topple the government of President Kabila. The revolt
began on August 2 in the town of Goma in the third largest
African country.
</P>
<P>
Durieux said that most of the refugees have been in good
conditions, but there are also some who have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are currently taking shelter at the Nyarugusu
camp, some 160 kilometers northeast of Kigoma town and have
sufficient food supplies thanks to the assistance of the World
Food Program (WFP), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the
UNHCR, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the Nyarugusu camp has a capacity of accommodating as
many as 50,000 refugees, there are plans to use Lufugu camp in
the southwest of the Kigoma town in case that the Congolese
refugees increased drastically, said UNHCR senior external
relations officer Vincent Parker in Dar es Salaam Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has also requested the Tanzanian government to
provide a third camp site for the arriving Congolese refugees,
but so far the agency has not received any response, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media said that 100 soldiers of the DRC
government troops, armed with guns and ammunitions, fled the
tight fighting in the eastern part of the country and arrived in
Kigoma Sunday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials pointed out that accommodation of the
combatants is not within its scope of UNHCR services as the group
of people are non-civilians.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Promises No More Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has assured the world and Nigerians that
there would be no more election annulments, as the country has
embarked on another transition to civil rule process.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on a British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC) program "Network Africa" Monday, Abubakar implored
Nigerians not to entertain fears of any annulment under the
current transition program.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be any cause for that. We don't
have any fears. We have got an Independent Electoral Commission
(INEC) with people of honor and repute," he said.
</P>
<P>
Repeating his earlier statement that the era of military coup
is gone with the end of the cold war, Abubakar said: "Now that
there are no more cold war, any right thinking military men will
think twice before contemplating to topple any government."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, a career soldier who took office in June this year
after the sudden death of late leader General Sani Abacha,
accused the civilian society of covertly or overtly encouraging
military coup.
</P>
<P>
"The civilians encourage the soldiers and whenever there is
coup, the civilians start flying about, appealing and looking for
appointments in the same military government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that both the soldiers, civilians and
everybody in Nigeria would have learnt a lesson. Whoever is in
power should ensure good government and give amenities,
facilities, protection, health care and education to all
Nigerians and I am sure nobody will even contemplate of toppling
a government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has promised to hand power over to an elected
civilian government in May next year. Twenty-five political
groups have applied for registration by the INEC to contest in
the new transition program.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up First Minor Export Crop Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to set up the first minor export crop company at Matale in
Central Province to improve minor export crop cultivation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 acres (6,073 hectares) of land in the Matale area
have been brought under such cultivation so far under a program,
Export Department officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will give instructions and assistance to improve
this cultivation while new land will be added for this purpose,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that there is considerable demand for Sri
Lankan minor crops in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the farmers can get a good income from this
cultivation, the officials said, adding that the government has
been encouraging the farmers to engage in the cultivation by
taking several steps including giving them financial aid and other
necessary assistance.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's minor export crops include cocoa, cinnamon,

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A national forum on
pawnshops, the first since this business was resumed in China ten
years ago, wound up here September 13.
</P>
<P>
The forum, sponsored by a national pawn industry committee and
the Liaoning Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, drew over 120
scholars, financial officials and pawnbrokers from across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The participants had extensive discussions about the present
situation and prospects for the pawn business in China, and called
for increased efforts to build up a legal framework for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
China outlawed pawnshops in 1949. But in the last ten
years, about 1,300 pawnshops have sprung up across the country,
with total capital assets of about eight billion yuan (about
963 million U.S. dollars).

commissioner for human rights, has been successful.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made this comment
 at today's regular press conference when asked to comment on the

and cultural heritage of Tibet have been well protected.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that both sides have reached common ground and
Robinson has established good working relations with China.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Repatriates Five Foreigners Infected with HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has repatriated
five foreigners infected with the HIV virus in the first half of
this year, the Health and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This move has brought the total number of repatriated foreign
HIV carriers to 89 since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The virus causes the deadly disease known as the AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Under a South Korean regulation, foreign workers are required
to submit documents proving that they are HIV-negative before
entering the country while South Korean employers are required to
have their foreign workers take regular medical check-ups.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said, it is difficult to test foreigners
who entered South Korea illegally.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of June this year, a total of 811 South Koreans
were spotted infected with the virus and among them are 104
women.

<HEADLINE> S. African Teenagers Optimistic About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Sixty percent of South
African teenagers think that they will have bright future in
their homeland, according to a report by the local Research
Surveys.
</P>
<P>
In its report released Monday, Research Surveys said following
a survey last month of 800 teenagers, it had been found that 60
percent felt optimistic about their future in the country, with
24 percent feeling neither optimistic nor pessimistic, and only
16 percent feeling pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that white teenagers were less optimistic than
their black counterparts, with only 38 percent falling into the
optimistic category.
</P>
<P>
In response to three descriptions of their possible attitudes
toward staying or leaving South Africa, 71 percent of teenagers
thought of many good reasons to stay in the country and no good
reasons to leave.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two percent of teenagers felt that there were many good
reasons to stay, but that there were also many good reasons to leave.
</P>
<P>
Only seven percent of the total sample felt that there were no
good reasons to stay and many good reasons to leave South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Research Surveys said the sample, comprising boys and girls
between the ages of 13 to 20, had been scientifically weighted and
was therefore representative of black and white teenagers in terms
of age and population distribution.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been challenged by increasing unemployment
and crimes. Tens of thousands South Africans, mainly the white,
are so pessimistic about the currently crucial social problems
that many of them have immigrated to western countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archeologists Cooperating with Overseas Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists and
their overseas counterparts have cooperated recently in joint
projects which have uncovered several significant ruins and
cultural relics within the borders of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' (CASS) Institute of
Archeology together with the cultural relics office of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) unearthed an ancient
cultural site on an island near downtown Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At this site they discovered at least 20 tombs dating back to
the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age, together with a number of
building ruins and earthenware, jadeware and stone artifacts.
</P>
<P>
"All the cultural relics and ruins there from as far back as
3,500 to 5,000 years ago will provide solid material for studying
the remote history of Hong Kong and its cultural exchanges with
neighboring areas," said Miao Yajuan, a CASS research fellow.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the 20 tombs had human remains, the first such group
of remains ever found in Hong Kong, Miao said. This may allow
researchers to further their studies of physical characteristics,
average longevity and pathological features among the ancient
inhabitants of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Together with a team of archeologists from Harvard University,
the institute unearthed the ruins of an ancient temple near
Shangqiu in central Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
They found many cultural relics from all the early, middle and
late stages of the Longshan culture, including a 66-sq-m earth
foundation and a bank of house ruins.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese experts and archeologists from the
University of Minnesota surveyed ancient sites within the
Huaihe River Basin in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the institute and a Japanese cultural research
organization recently began excavations at the site of ancient
capital Chang'an, about three km northwest of present-day Xi'an,
the capital of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
After probing the layout of the Guigong Palace, they found a
huge foundation of four palaces, and they have now completed a
5,000-sq-m excavation at the No. 2 palace foundation, Miao added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank Invests $1.5M on Clearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Zambia is investing three
billion Kwacha or 1.5 million U.S. Dollars in establishing an
Electronic Clearing House (ECH) to ease banking transactions in the
country's banking sector, Times of Zambia said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chisha Mwanakatwe, the central bank's assistant
director, as saying that the ECH was expected to be operational
early next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the major gain would include reading of cheques
electronically and a subsequent decrease in the incidence of fraud and
criminality in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The house would also lower the processing error rates and
make it easier to handle large volumes of financial transactions,
according to Mwanakatwe.
</P>
<P>
He said, notwithstanding the developments in the country's banking
sector, the central bank had recognized the fact that further
innovations could still be instituted in order to streamline the
payment system.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the establishment of an clearing house, plans to build a
central depository which would be created in order to support the
financial sector so as to broaden the capital markets were also
underway.

<HEADLINE> More Embassies in Uganda Close for Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Some more foreign missions
accredited to Uganda were closed after receiving threat calls
from anonymous callers, a senior police officer told Xinhua Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of Uganda Police Force, Bob Ngobi, said security
around the foreign missions in Uganda has been beefed up and the
police will respond immediately after receiving calls for help.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who take advantage of the bombing incident
in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam to threaten people here and we have
carried out tough preventive measures for it," he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
As for the reported closing of U.S. Embassy, the British High
Commission, the Royal Danish Embassy, the World Bank Uganda Office and
the European Union office, he said he could not confirm, adding that
security should be the key reason for the move of these agencies.
</P>
<P>
The officer, however, said the United Nations Development Program
in Uganda had received at least two threat calls last week and the
U.N. agency is taking utmost precaution against the bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
Since the bombing in U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam
in early August, Kampala has been receiving more threat calls than
ever before. Kampala Police Chief Benjamin Namanya told Xinhua
more police force is deployed in and around what people
consider soft targets.
</P>
<P>
More police officers have been trained to guide people. Security
pamphlets have been distributed to educate civilians about bombs and
to give tips on what to do in an emergency.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Foreign Exchange Infractions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
stepping up its crackdown on foreign exchange infractions such as
the evasion of foreign exchange payment and illegal dealings in
foreign exchange amid a resurgence in black market activities.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reporters at a press conference, a spokesman for
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said that the growth
of such infractions is a result of the influence of the external
economic environment and has already exerted a negative impact on
China's foreign exchange balance, and thus should be firmly
combated.
</P>
<P>
Measures already taken include a general examination of the
foreign exchange settlement activities of enterprises, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In these examinations, the accounts of the enterprises are
carefully checked to see that every purchase or payment in foreign
exchange is truly connected to import dealings with adequate
imported commodities.
</P>
<P>
"Our determination is firm to fight against the illegal
activities such as breaches of exchange regulations or purchasing
foreign exchange with the help of forged documents," the spokesman
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we've asked the exchange department to enhance
internal management and strictly punish personnel who are involved
in illegal trading," he added.
</P>
<P>
In support of this fight, a series of new regulations on
exchange control were formulated and promulgated recently, and
they are expected to offset the shortcomings of existing foreign
exchange control.
</P>
<P>
According to new regulations, a financial institution found to
have broken with foreign exchange sale and payment regulations
will be suspended from foreign exchange settlement business, and
administrative or disciplinary penalties will be applied to those
persons involved in such activities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade right of enterprises found to be involved in
illegal dealings of certain amounts of money will be revoked.
Criminal penalties will be given to law-breakers and any
accomplices working with the customs, banking and exchange
departments.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told reporters that a computerized network will
be launched in the near future linking customs, banks and foreign
exchange control departments, which will ensure the synchronical
transmitting and checking of the inflow and outflow of goods and
foreign exchange. This is expected to leave less room for illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
"The above measures have already effectively reduced illegal
dealings," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Nuo Culture Museum Lacks Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Nuo culture museum in
Tongren Prefecture in southwest China's Guizhou Province is badly
in need of funds to protect its relics and photographs.
</P>
<P>
This is the only museum of its kind in the country. Nuo, a
ceremony to drive away ghosts or pestilence, originated in ancient
times with the practice of totem worship.
</P>
<P>
The museum borrowed three rooms of the Dongshan temple as
exhibit halls in March 1991, and out of 100-plus rare photos
collected by the museum, a dozen are hanging unprotected and the
rest are piled together behind the hall where they are
deteriorating from the elements, according to eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Only two people are taking care of the museum, and a large
number of photos were stolen several years ago because there are
no guards.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has the richest Nuo culture among southern Chinese
provinces, and Tongren Prefecture has 70 percent of the province's
Nuo cultural heritage. More than 5,000 artisans of different
ethnic minorities are now engaged in Nuo cultural activities in
the area, with more than 500 Nuo opera groups.

The spokesman urged people to be aware of the dangers of
illegal trading in foreign exchange in the black market for the
sake of state economic security.
</P>
<P>
He called "misleading and dangerous" the thinking that foreign
exchange settlements are only dealings between the yuan and
foreign exchanges, which cannot trigger criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called for drawing lessons from the recent
financial crisis in Southeast Asia and Russia which he believes
partly stemmed from uncontrolled foreign exchange dealings which
increased the chances for international speculators and caused the
devaluation of local currencies and the outflow of state wealth.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that smuggling, money laundering, and
profiteering are in many cases behind these illegal activities
which pose great dangers to society.
</P>
<P>
He also called the attention to those who spread rumors on the
black market, shaking investors' confidence and arousing social
turmoil.

<HEADLINE> China's Fishing Ban Ends Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The last contingent of
Chinese fishermen idled by the summer fishing ban are allowed to
resume fishing in the Yellow and East China seas at midnight
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Today is the last day of the ban which took effect in June. An
official from the Ministry of Agriculture today called this year's
ban "successful".
</P>
<P>
"China has expanded the fishing moratorium in terms of both
length and scope, with a continual decline in the number of
fishing vessels found in violation of the ban," according to
the official from the ministry's Fisheries Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium idled 90,000 Chinese fishing boats, including
some 22,000 vessels operating in the East China Sea. A recent
check revealed that only two per thousand boats in the East China
Sea violated the fishing this year's ban, compared with 3.5 per
thousand during last summer's moratorium.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the improvement to an increasing
awareness of the need for the ban and the efforts of local
governments to strengthen both management and supervision.
</P>
<P>
He substantiated the fact that falling output in the first half
of the year and the extension of moratorium period have prompted
some fishermen to ignore the ban.
</P>
<P>
Fishing with trawl nets and other "hazardous fishing equipment"
has been banned for a three month period over an area ranging from
26 degrees to 35 degrees north latitude, and for two months in
areas north of 35 degrees and from 24.5 degrees to 26 degrees.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the overall summer fishing ban in 1995. The
two month ban in effect in each of the past three years has helped
protect the natural habitat for fry. The ban has also helped
increase the size range of major fish species, such as hairtail,
and has at the same time improved offshore output figures.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has pledged to adopt a long-term ban,
and will introduce various other measure to protect marine
resources, including limiting the number of the size of fishing
fleet and controlling the intensity related activities.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British
Secretary for Trade and Industry Peter Mandelson said that a free
trade deal between South Africa and the European Union (EU) could
be reached later this week.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the EU and South Africa, which began in
1994, had "gone too slowly in our view", local daily the Star
Tuesday quoted Mandelson as reporting.
</P>
<P>
He said the pact could be reached this week because a "great
deal" had been achieved although some issues still had to be
resolved. He did not specify what problems remained unsolved
between the EU and South Africa.

It was generally believed free trade of agricultural products
between the two side has been focused in the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson's visit coincided with the start of the first
British-South African partnership week trade exhibition in

<P>
Referring to the recent flurry of unfavorable reports about
South Africa's economic policies, Mandelson expressed
disagreement over Wall Street Journal Europe's report that South
Africa was implementing "inconsistent economic policies".
</P>
<P>
"I don't accept the analysis," said Mandelson, describing the
report as "excessively pessimistic".
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had sound economic fundamentals, which
would result in economic growth.

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- All countries and various
political forces, their leaders in particular, should strengthen
dialogue and cooperation and explore ways to bring a peaceful yet
prosperous world into the 21st century, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
And this should be done in line with the principle of seeking
common ground while preserving differences, as at the turn of the
century mankind is faced with various kinds of new problems
related to peace and development, said Jiang, also General
Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here this morning at a meeting with

multi-polarization and economic globalization, and international
relations undergoing fundamental readjustments and changes.
</P>

advocate the practice of mutual respect, equal dialogue, increased
understanding and stronger cooperation."

<P>
The CPC and the Socialist International and its member parties
can surpass their ideological differences and undertake exchanges
and cooperation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the reform and open-up in 1978, the CPC has
put forward four new guiding principles for party-to-party
relations: independence and self-reliance, equality, mutual
respect and non-interference into each other's internal affairs,
and this has been well received by various political parties
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the CPC will strengthen contacts and expand
cooperation with the Socialist International on the basis of these
principles in an effort to promote world peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the guests on China's reform and open-up and
the recent flood control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Mauroy thanked the CPC for inviting his delegation to visit
China and said he was glad to visit China after a lapse of 13
years and in his new capacity as president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Socialist International treasures its ties
with the CPC and hopes to continue bilateral dialogue and
cooperation in various forms in a bid to explore ways to solve
major world problems and develop dialogue and cooperation in the
next century.

<P>
CHANGSHA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
recently approved a 10-million-yuan research grant for Yuan
Longping, the Father of Hybrid Rice, according to the State
Hybrid Rice Engineering and Research Center (SHRERC).
</P>
<P>
Yuan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, has for
many years conducted extensive research related to the cultivation
of new strains of hybrid rice. He introduced new techniques for
cultivating hybrid rice in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cultivation of high-yielding rice has been a global
priority over the years. Estimates call for China to plant seven
million ha of hybrid rice annually beginning early next century,
with the annual rice output expected to grow by some 15 billion kg
per year.
</P>
<P>
Three experimental areas using the new method yielded an
average of 13,260 kg per ha in 1997, up 3,375 kg on the output for
other high quality varieties. The quality of Yuan's hybrid rice
equaled second-level quality rice in terms of resistance to two
or more pests.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural research organizations from east China's Jiangsu
province, Liaoning Province in the north and Guangdong Province in
the south are engaged in related research and joined the center
in forming a national cooperative network.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Within Yearly Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's budget spending
exceeded revenues by 35 percent in August, keeping the country
still on track to meet its yearly target of 42 percent, the Daily
Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Finance Ministry's monthly report issued
on Monday as saying that the government collected 222.5 million
U.S. dollars last month and spent 337 million dollars, of which
103.3 million dollars went toward debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, revenues reached 1.98
billion dollars and expenditure amounted to 3.15 billion dollars,
resulting in a deficit of 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
A fall in debt servicing was the main reason behind the drop in
expenditure in August, said an official of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Interest payments fell because fewer treasury bills
accumulated and matured. That was the case in July," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has a total of 15.5 billion dollars debt at the end of
June, of which nearly 70 percent are high interest rate internal
paper.
</P>
<P>
The official did not explain how the government collected the
money last month but said that customs and income and property
taxes accounted for approximately 80 percent of public revenue.
</P>
<P>
He expected revenues to pick up by the end of the year because
some income tax payments had been rescheduled and people tended to
settle their property taxes during the last month of the year.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Sinyoura, minister of state for financial affairs, said
that although spending and revenues did not distribute evenly every
month, the budget deficit should finish the year at below 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which is recovering from a 15-year devastating civil

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Joint Liaison Group Meets in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) began its 43rd meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The JLG, which meets alternately in Beijing, London and
Hong Kong, is meeting for the first time in Hong Kong after it
returned to China on July 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the two-day meeting, Senior Chinese
Representative Wang Guisheng extended a warm welcome to the
British delegation led by Senior Representative Ambassador Alan
Paul.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the JLG's mission has been basically finished
after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the two sides still have some work to do --
to deal with the remaining issues, new issues arising from the
implementation of the past agreements reached by the two sides and
other issues which both sides deem necessary to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is adopting a positive, friendly and practical
attitude towards the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said great changes had taken place since they last met
here some 15 months ago. One of the big changes was that the seats
between the guest and the host have been swapped.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that although the issue of Asian financial turmoil is
not on the formal agenda of the current meeting, it would be
touched upon during the discussions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has displayed exceptional courage and
wisdom in dealing with the effects by the Asian financial crisis
and achieved remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Central people's government resolutely
implements the principle of "one country, two systems," and will
never interfere in decisions made by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
But "we support the measures the SAR government has taken to
maintain the linked exchange rate system and stabilize the order
of its financial market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the major factors contributing to the HKSAR's success in
dealing with the impact of the Asian financial crisis -- the sound
financial system, sound economic fundamentals and the hefty
foreign exchange reserves -- one is that Hong Kong had become a
SAR of the People's Republic of China before the financial turmoil
hit the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Central People's government has made the
firm decision not to devaluate the Renminbi, which constitutes a
positive contribution not only to Hong Kong but also to Asia and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Paul said that after the handover, Hong Kong has
all important aspects being allowed to exercise a high degree of
autonomy promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the
Question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The British government firmly supports the resolute
determination of the Hong Kong SAR to defend the Hong Kong dollar
peg, he said.
</P>
<P>
The British side highly values this policy which is a vital
contribution to the region and the global financial stability as
well as to Hong Kong, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Local Authority Workers Launch Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Most of Israel's municipal
departments, hospitals and kindergartens were closed Tuesday as
employees of local authorities began a strike demanding higher
wages.
</P>
<P>
The industrial action involved some 100,000 employees across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The walkout came as talks between the Trade Union of Local
Authorities and the Finance Ministry broke down last night as the
treasury rejected a 30 percent salary rise required by the union.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Finance Ministry said that they would agree
to a wage increase of no more than 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Leon Morozovsky, general secretary of the union, said that they
will return to work only after their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that I will allow workers to receive less than
a 30 percent increase," he said.

<HEADLINE> Deactivated Nuclear Energy Base Attracts Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's first deactivated
nuclear energy development base on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
northwest China has been transformed into a tourist attraction and
a haven for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
A recent Sino-U.S. agreement calls for the construction of a
thermal power plant at the former nuclear base in Xihai Township
located in the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai
Province. The plant will be the first overseas-funded project in
the township which developed China's first atomic and hydrogen
bombs.
</P>
<P>
Panda Energy International Inc. of the United States, the
overseas partner, will provide 90 percent of the 250 million US
dollars financing for the new thermal power plant with an annual
generating capacity of 250,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government's contribution to the project will
include the former No. 7 plant at the facility.
</P>
<P>
"Abundant coal reserves and the highly efficient government
offered by the so-called 'China Nuclear Town' greatly enhance
prospects for the thermal power plant," according to Panda Vice
President Todd Carter.
</P>
<P>
Panda has invested heavily in China, with major projects
including the gigantic Gezhouba Hydro-Electric Power Station in
central China's Hubei Province and a thermal power plant in
Tangshan of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The central government formally granted the local government
control of the deactivated facility in 1995, following an eight
year environmental cleanup program. Xihai Township was established
and named as the seat of the prefectural government.
</P>
<P>
Facilities covering 100,000 sq.m. have been transformed into
office buildings, residential areas, hotels, stores, schools and
factories. Song birds, pastures filled with cows and sheep, stands
of trees and patches of flowers can be found throughout the
township.
</P>
<P>
Both domestic and foreign investors have expressed interest in
remaining buildings with total floor space of well over 560,000
sq.m., including workshops covering 220,000 square meters. The
township features a relatively well-developed infrastructure
system which includes highway and railway networks.
</P>
<P>
The local government has introduced preferential land-use and
taxation policies to attract overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Local officials reported that negotiations for an electrolysis
aluminum project involving Japanese and Singaporean interests are
entering a crucial stage.

<HEADLINE> 100 Injured in Soccer Fans' Clash in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 100 persons including
10 policemen and five journalists were injured when rival groups
of agitated fans of two football teams clashed in southeastern
Bangladesh's Chittagong seaport on Monday, a local report said.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 vehicles were damaged in the two-hour long clash
which spread from the Chittagong M.A. Aziz Stadium from 8:30 p.m.
local time, said the English-language Independent daily newspaper
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred two minutes before the end of a match
between the Mohammedan Sporting Club and the Abhani Krjra Chakra,
two leading local soccer teams, when the Mohammedan equalized the
match from a corner kick, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The match ended with a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
The agitated fans of both the clubs used lethal weapons,
exploded crackers and exchanged brickbats indiscriminately at the
stadium and the clash later spread to other areas. The police
lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to batons to disperse the
clashing groups.
</P>
<P>
The police allegedly resorted to batons at the press box, and
three photo journalists were seriously injured in the police
attack.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the clash took place when the referee
canceled the goal scored by the Mohammedan and later restored it.
The linesman hoisted the flag for fault kick given from corner
point by a Mohammedan player.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Palestinians Allowed into Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 Palestinians
were allowed to enter Israel as of Tuesday morning as Israel eased
its closure of the West Bank and Gaza for the first time since it
killed two Palestinian fugitives last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 Palestinian laborers from the Gaza Strip and 2,000
from the West Bank were granted entry, in addition to another
3,000 merchants and businessmen, after Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai approved the easing Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The seal-off was imposed last Thursday night after Hamas
threatened to launch a series of terror attacks in retaliation
for the killing of two of its leaders - the brothers of Adel and
Imad Awadallah - by Israeli soldiers near Hebron. It was the
first full closure in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that he had not set a date for the lifting of
the closure, since the Hamas threats had not tailed off yet. Some
military sources have indicated that the closure would remain in
effect till after the Jewish holidays which begin late this month.
</P>
<P>
The closure caused a direct loss of 4 million to 5 million
U.S. dollars every day to the Palestinian economy, and indirect
damage is double that amount and long-term damage is incalculable,
Nabil Shaath, minister for planning and international cooperation
of the Palestinian National Authority, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, however, said Israel is "not interested in using
closure as a means of punishment."
</P>
<P>
The easing of the closure follows a new plan prepared by the
Israeli government to allow some Palestinians to work under
certain conditions. Some 30,000 Palestinians are registered to
participate in the plan.

<HEADLINE> China Reaffirms Stability of Renminbi Exchange Rate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said here today that China is
confident and capable of maintaining the stability of its
currency, the Renminbi (RMB) yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, especially wide fluctuations in the
Japanese yen over the past few months, have impacted China's
economic growth, said the official, adding that a series of
measures the Chinese government introduced to increase exports and
attract overseas investment have yielded good results.
</P>
<P>
China had a favorable trade balance of 31.38 billion
U.S. dollars for the first eight months of this year, according to
the official. He said the volume of direct overseas investment for
the first seven months hit 23.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves stand at more than 140
billion U.S. dollars, excluding foreign exchange held by Chinese
financial institutions, businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The volume leaves ample room for regulating demand and supply
for foreign exchange, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government recently announced a decision to issue
100 billion yuan in state treasury bonds to promote infrastructure
construction. The goal of the move centers on expanding domestic
demand to counteract declining exports and ensuring fulfillment of
the annual economic growth target of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that ensuring the stability of the yuan will not only
offset economic deterioration in Asia and the world as a whole,
but will also maintain market confidence.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Telephone Organization of
Thailand (TOT) plans to establish a high-speed fiber-optic
telecommunications network to keep up with the world's pace of
information technology development.
</P>
<P>
A source of the organization said Tuesday that the TOT board
met earlier Tuesday to discuss the future of the ambitious
project.
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Mechai Viravaidya asked the board for the
approval of an additional 3.4 billion baht (85 million U.S.
dollars) for the project because of the baht's depreciation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10.4 billion baht (260 million dollars) has already
been approved, the source said.
</P>
<P>
However, the source predicted that the Transport and
Communications Ministry may reject the request until more details

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Remove Impediments for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- All the government
departments dealing with would-be investors in Zambia's tourism
sector should remove bureaucratic impediments, urged a local
senior tourism official.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Permanent secretary Romance Sampa said this in a speech at
the start of one-day "Tourism Investor Roadmap Workshop" in Lusaka
Monday, Times of Zambia reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Time has come for all government agents registering investors
in the tourism industry to remove all unnecessary bureaucratic
procedures, Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
He noted as much as the private sector would like to abide by laws
and regulations pertaining to the country, they would also like a
simplified operating system to avoid wasting time and money.
</P>
<P>
He challenged workshop participants including those from the
Investment Center, police, civil aviation and tourism councils to
come up with solutions for the effective implementation of a
mechanism that would see the country's tourism industry grow.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary also disclosed that the National Parks and
Wildlife Services has been turned into a statutory autonomous
organization which would improve the management and conservations of
wildlife resources.
</P>
<P>
He said other legislative changes were in progress to allow for
streamlined licensing and investment procedures in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Despite the various tourist attraction areas in Zambia which
have a variety of offers, inflow of tourists has not been very
encouraging due to insufficient investment.
</P>
<P>
The country received only 340,000 foreign tourists in 1997 and
earned about 75.5 million U.S. Dollars.

BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China State Construction
Engineering Corporation will build the Rama 8 Bridge across the
Chao Phraya River running through Bangkok under a contract signed
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, a royal-initiated project, has got the approval of

800 million U.S. dollars), of which 70 percent will be subsidized
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The main structure of the bridge will be built by the Chinese
company while its attached parts are to be constructed by Thai,
Swiss, Canadian and British companies.
</P>
<P>
Bhichit Rattakul, governor of Bangkok and ambassadors from
China, Britain, Canada and Switzerland were present at the
contract signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, after completion in two years, will ease the
traffic congestion in Bangkok, provide a better look for Thailand
and create job opportunities for local communities.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was granted the name by Thailand's King Bhumibol
Adulyadej in commemoration of his elder brother King Ananda.

<HEADLINE> Political Support Urged for African Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The African insurance
industry lacks political support to match global competition,
reinsurance seminar has noted.
</P>
<P>
Bakary Kamara, Chief of the African Reinsurance Corporation,
said Africa's insurance landscape needed re-adjustment and the
adaptation of the guiding framework.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that insurance legislation must be refashioned
and adapted to the current world economic environment to which
Africa cannot afford to be just a spectator," Kamara was quoted

by Tuesday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Proper legislation by governments and the
professional initiative of insurance practitioners were important
in promoting the industry, Kamara said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said obstacles in exchange restrictions should be removed
to give commercial transactions the required latitude.
</P>
<P>
He said legislation drawn up to cover wide and diversified
areas such as communication would be incomplete without giving a
prominent place to the exigencies of reinsurances security.
</P>
<P>
"In the very near future, like certain markets of South Asia,
Africa would require that all reinsurers willing to write
business within its territories should undergo a security test
and rating conducted by a specialized independent firm," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said economic depression should not become a scapegoat
for African countries, as economic recession had affected the
whole world, yet developed countries were able to pull the
industry together.
</P>
<P>
"The continent is still standing on the quay, watching as the
train of economic development speeds past, while it wallows in
the grip of poverty, misery and diseases," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that economic non-performance had a major
impact on the African insurance industry and, consequently, on
the organizational structure of the markets.
</P>
<P>
Kamara attributed the poor performance to political instability
which, he said, affected economic productivity and growth.
</P>
<P>
Sixty senior insurance managers from more than 40 African
countries attended the five-day seminar starting Monday.

<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The sell-off of a number of ailing state-run companies
within the privatization program has made net profits of 2.4
billion pounds (about 706 million U.S. dollars), Egyptian Minister
of Public Enterprises Atef Ebeid said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Before being privatized, these companies had accumulated losses
of 42 million pounds (about 12.5 million dollars), Atef told a
seminar labeled "Companies on Privatization Program," organized by
the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The government had 314 state companies on the privatization
scheme, 113 of which were already sold. About 60 others were
currently put for sale, while the rest were in the pipeline for
1999.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanian government will pick up its talks with the
Iraqi authorities to resume a project which aims at diverting
water from Iraq to Jordan, Minister of Water and Irrigation Hani
Malki said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The water from Iraq will be used to feed the northern part of
Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides initiated the project in 1979 but later were forced
to delay it due to regional instability, he added.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- At present a total of 10,100 industrial projects are
under construction throughout Iran, local daily Tehran Times
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Statistic Department of Industries Ministry
Moqtada Rawanbakhsh said that out of the total, some 5,000
projects were at the final phase of operation and would create
190,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government will call for tenders in the
coming weeks for three dams to be constructed in the western side
of the kingdom, Minister of Water and Irrigation Hani Malki said.
</P>
<P>
The dams will be used to provide water for the eastern coast of
the Dead Sea and the industrial sites in the Jordan Valley, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China Reaffirms Stability of Renminbi Exchange Rate (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman explained China's reasons for maintaining the
stability of its currency by noting that devaluating the currency
would neither increase exports, nor boost economic growth. He
said devaluation would most likely have a negative effect.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the yuan would play a minimal role in boosting
exports sine over half of materials for exports processing with
supplied parts are imported from abroad. Secondly, devaluation of
the yuan would lead to rising prices for imported materials and in
turn increase production costs for Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The principal reason for the slowdown in China's export centers
on declining imports from Southeast Asia, Japan and the Republic
of Korea. Devaluation of the yuan would most likely fail to
stimulate imports from Asian countries, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Facts clearly show that the currencies of some southeast Asian
nations have been devalued by as much as 50 percent. However,
devaluations failed to promote export and economic growth in said
nations, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the yuan would offer no benefits to China's
economic and political development. While devaluation might
possibly stimulate exports in the short-term, it would fall far
short of raising the technical quality of products and services.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the yuan would be detrimental to the long-term
balance of revenues and expenditures and would dampen the
confidence of overseas investors or, in fact, drive some investors
away. It would also increase the debt levels of Chinese
enterprises and harm the balance of foreign exchange under current
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the yuan would also spark inflation and lead to
higher interest rates and reductions in monetary assets, as well
as drops in the disposable income of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, it is more important to maintain the stability of
the yuan and ensure a sound economic and financial environment
than it is to increase exports by devaluing the yuan. (moire)

<HEADLINE> Mary Robinson: China Visit "Broke New Ground" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations high
commissioner for human rights Mary Robinson said that her China
visit not only "accomplished pre-set goals" but also "broke new
ground" in international cooperation for human rights.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen met
with her yesterday. During her ten-day tour she also attended
academic activities on human rights in Beijing and visited
Shanghai and the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
She said the tour "opened up a channel for constructive
dialogue and cooperation" and her office and relevant Chinese
departments also "agreed on follow-up actions."
</P>
<P>
As the first U.N. human rights high commissioner ever to visit
China, she said she made the journey to "hear and listen" to the
life of the Chinese people and the efforts made by the government
to promote and protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that she got the message from Vice Premier
Qian that China will sign a covenant on civil and political rights
next month.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already signed the international
covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, and this
document is to be ratified by the National People's Congress,
China's law-making body, after examination.
</P>
<P>
Her office and China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed a
Memorandum of Intent on a technical cooperation program between
her office and the ministry. She said that the two sides will
undertake programs to train lawyers and judges and carry out human
rights education. "Some suggestions have already gotten response
from the Chinese side," she said.
</P>
<P>
On her impression of Tibet, Robinson said the autonomous region
is a "beautiful and special place," adding that the trip made her
aware of the commitment from the central government to promote
economic development and safeguard the region's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the China visit deepened her understanding of
the country and that she would like to return some day.

<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman addressed questions concerning the stability of
the Chinese currency and the country's economic prospects by
noting that the financial crisis in Asia has had some impact on
China's economic growth over the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said the impact will quite likely grow as the crisis
deteriorates and spreads to wider areas.
</P>
<P>
China's refusal to devaluate the yuan has already caused the
country to incur losses in terms of efforts to stabilize the
regional and, in fact, the global economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that China, with a population of 1.2
billion, has a vast domestic market and the economic strength to
overcome the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the steadfast decision to protect the yuan from
devaluating was made on the basis of the country's domestic
economic conditions," according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese citizens are fully confident of the
strength of country's currency, and noted that China is the only
Asian country currently able to attract large amount of long-term
overseas investment. He also noted that strict control systems
govern the use of China's over 140 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed total confidence in the continuing
stability of the yuan and the nation's ability to maintain the
momentum of rapid, healthy and sustainable growth of the national
economy.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Orders Iran's Armed Forces on Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Tuesday ordered the armed forces to be
alert to follow the developments in Afghanistan, the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary and right for the
country," Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with senior commanders of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), he said that all the military
apparatus, the security and press establishments should maintain
full readiness to protect interests of the country and fulfill
their humanitarian obligations.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's call came as tensions between Iran and Afghan
Taliban militia built up after nine Iranian diplomats were killed
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Iran has claimed that the Taliban held 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist after taking over the city
of Mazar-e-Sharif, a stronghold of the opposition forces on August
8.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which had denied knowledge of those people
missing, confirmed last Thursday that its men killed nine of the
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iran has massed a massive force near the Afghan border
following the diplomats incident for military exercises, widely
seen as warning to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia, ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani and his government in 1996 after storming into capital
Kabul and has now won control over 90 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between the Taliban and opposition Northern Alliance
led by Rabbani are continuing.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the situation in Afghanistan was highly
crucial from various aspects.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan issue is a humanitarian concern for Iranians who
feel sympathy for the Afghan people, he said, "from the Islamic
aspect, we have an obligation, from the political and national
aspect, we should also avert any danger for the nation and the
country."
</P>
<P>
The IRGC Monday night issued a statement, declaring its
readiness to "help the oppressed Afghan people" after Khamenei
called on Islamic states to prevent the Taliban from slaughtering
the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the forces under the IRGC command and
the Basij (volunteer) forces were fully prepared to follow the
order of Khamenei, who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces,
and to "help the Afghan people."

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents in Wellington Hit 10-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Both alcohol- and speed-
related traffic accidents in the Wellington region of New Zealand
hit
a 10-year low last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued here Tuesday by the Wellington
region
of the Land Transport Safety Authority of New Zealand, there were
112
drink-driving and 192 speed-related crashes in the region, the
lowest
numbers in 10 years, compared with 142 and 252 in 1996
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report said 990 people were injured or killed on the
region's
roads last year, compared with 1,068 in 1996. Wellington City
recorded the largest drop last year with 355 crashes, down 67 on
1996.
</P>
<P>
But, there were 25 road deaths in the Wellington region,
compared
with 24 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of pedestrians and motorcyclists injured in road
accidents in the Wellington region was still of concern. Of the
134
pedestrians injured last year, 65 were in Wellington City. There
were
127 motorcyclists injured in crashes last year, up from 118 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said the road crashes in the Wellington region were
estimated to cost the country 239 million NZ dollars (121 million
U.S.
dollars) last year, which included accident rehabilitation and
compensation insurance and hospital costs, emergency services and
loss of earnings for those injured.
</P>
<P>
The declining road toll was attributed to increasing public
awareness about alcohol and speed and traffic improvements.

Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- A 26-year-old Turkish man who hijacked an Airbus jet of the
Turkish Airlines Monday evening on an Ankara-Istanbul flight
released all passengers and then surrendered to the police after
the plane landed at the airport in the northeastern Turkish city
of Trabzon.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker said that he did this to protest the government's
ban on scarf wearing of women working in government offices and
girl students.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)

<P>
-- The oil giant Shell has announced that it will invest around

<HEADLINE> Scarce Baht Discourages Speculators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The relative scarcity of the
baht in offshore markets has helped reduce the ability of foreign
speculators to attack the Thai currency even when regional markets
are volatile.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Bank of Thailand said on Tuesday that
speculators would be discouraged in betting against the baht given
the high swap premiums in the offshore market.
</P>
<P>
While overnight swap rates in the local and offshore markets
traded quite closely together, there was a spread of 4 to 5
percent for longer-term maturities, Kiettisak Meecharoen,
assistant bank governor, told the press.
</P>
<P>
The baht traded at 40.77/40.84 to the U.S. dollar on Monday.
The central bank's weighted reference rate for last Friday's rate
was 40.811.
</P>
<P>
Close management of baht supply in the local money market has
also helped stabilize exchange rates. Regulators were able to
manage supply through buying and selling government bonds in the
repurchase market, Kiettisak said.
</P>
<P>
Onshore one-month swap premiums on Tuesday were quoted at 5/10
satang (100 satang equals one baht), compared with 20/26 in
offshore trade, while overnight interbank rates were quoted at 8
percent and the central bank's overnight repurchase rate was 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The last of Thailand's offshore swap obligations would be
settled by the end of this week, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Some 9 billion dollars in forward swap obligations with local
banks will be maintained by the central bank, primarily to manage
liquidity in the market.
</P>
<P>
Kiettisak said swaps with onshore counterparties would be
reduced next year, when the repurchase market and open market
operations become the main policy instrument for managing market
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank has run down total swap obligations from 18
billion dollars outstanding at the beginning of the year. By doing
so, the baht has been pulled back into the onshore market," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank took out more than 23.4 billion dollars in swap
obligations as part of its failed defense of the baht last year.
The depletion of foreign reserves ultimately forced the government
to accept assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Kiettisak said he believed U.S. interest rates would decline,
easing pressure on global rates.

JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Arrow-2 anti-ballistic missile, meant to provide the
backbone of defense against attacking missiles, passed its first
comprehensive test Monday against a simulated enemy target.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the success means the Arrow has proved it is a
fully integrated system that can track an enemy missile from
launch and destroy it.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Security problems are still blocking the talks on the safe
passage between the West Bank and Gaza, Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani said Monday after holding talks with U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
An adviser to Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat charged that the Ross mission had produced no results of
any kind.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:

<HEADLINE> Kenyans to Die Younger: U.N. Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The life expectancy of
Kenyans is expected to drop from 60 to 40 years by 2000 if the
U.N. official warns.
</P>
<P>
The poverty and deprivation levels are also set to go up if
the Kenyan government does not show the will to sort out its
economic and political problems, said Fredric Lyons, the
Kenyan representative of U.N. Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Lyons told a workshop at Kenyan coastal city Mombasa that the
1998 U.N. Human Development Index showed Kenya had dropped from
position 134 to 137, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to play a greater role in creating
more awareness on the HIV/AIDS infections.
</P>
<P>
Although the Kenyan government had done a lot in primary
health care and general development of the health sector, the
results were now being overshadowed by high level of AIDS, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS had already killed 230,000 Kenyans by the end of
1997 while more than 1.3 million are said to be HIV-positive in
the eastern African country. It is estimated that about one

million Kenyans may die of AIDS by 2000.

<HEADLINE> First Lebanon National Orchestra to Be Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon government has issued
a decree, officially approving the launch of the country's first
national orchestra, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited decree was published in the latest Official
Gazette, finally allowing the Conservatoire Superieur de la
Musique to start working to form an orchestra "in keeping with
International standards."
</P>
<P>
"The orchestra will be made up of between 75 and 90 musicians
and if things proceed as planned, it will hold its first concert
in the autumn of next year," said Walid Gholmieh, chairman of the
Conservatoire.
</P>
<P>
"We now have 35 Lebanese musicians who fit the international
criteria for symphony orchestras and the rest will be foreigners
for the time being," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we'll try to benefit from their experience and ask them to
teach at the Conservatoire until we can form a truly national
orchestra comprising of only Lebanese musicians," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gholmieh refused to disclose how much money had been allotted
by the government for the project, saying: "I don't want to hear
some people saying that setting up an orchestra isn't a priority
in Lebanon right now and criticizing spending money on this
cultural project."
</P>
<P>
The decree carried the signatures of President Elias Hrawi,
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Minister of Culture Fawzi Hobeish.
</P>
<P>
"This means the three statesmen have thrown their weight behind
the project," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"We've been calling for official support for the project for
years and years." he added.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra will focus on performing classical music works
composed by Lebanese and famous foreign composers.

<HEADLINE> SADC Underlines Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) were urged early Tuesday
morning to deal with the challenge and opportunities of
information technology to draw advantage from the process of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"As we pursue our vision of development through regional
integration, and the path of sustained growth which will enable
us to eradicate poverty, diseases and unemployment, we must act
expeditiously, lest the world leaves us behind," said South
African President Nelson Mandela, Chairman of SADC, at the
closing ceremony of the SADC summit.
</P>
<P>
A communique, issued at the end of the summit, said that it
is satisfied that member states have continued to implement
sound economic policies that augur well for long-term sustainable
development. It also praised the positive annual growth rates of
the member states in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
It said that the 1997 average gross domestic product
growth rate stood at 2.2 percent while budget deficits and
inflation rates decreased dramatically to six percent and 10
percent respectively during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The communique appealed to both local and foreign investors to
fully take advantage of the changing economic situation to
further increase intra-regional trade beyond the current 20
percent of total SADC trade.
</P>
<P>
The summit undertook to enhance efforts to coordinate and
rationalize programs of economic reconstruction, to give more
impetus to the region's emerging market of over 185 million
people with a combined GDP of more that 160 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
There was concern over the unfavorable weather conditions
which prevailed during the 1997/1998 cropping season
characterized by erratic and below normal rainfall in some
countries and excessive rains in others, resulting in a projected
overall cereal deficit of 510,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The summit undertook to ensure, through relevant institutions
and implementation of appropriate contingency plans, to address
cereal deficts, particularly in wheat, sorghum and millet, to
avoid suffering by vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
During the SADC meeting from September 7 to 14, a new
protocol on tourism was signed which aims to ensure balanced and
complemetary development of the tourism industry in the region
through collective efforts.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the 14-member regional
grouping expressed satisfaction at the progress being made in the
implementation of the African Economic Community, following the
signing of the Protocol on the relations between the African
Economic Community and other regional economic communities on
February 25 of this year in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their decision of 1995, that all the
activities and policies of SADC should be carried out in the
context of achieveing the objectives of teh African Economic
Community.
</P>
<P>
The summit committed SADC as a building bloc, to play a
catalytic and strategic role in the process of establishing the
Community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the communique noted that Nelson Mandela would
retire from office early next year before SADC's next meeting,
which has been scheduled to be held in Maputo, Mozambique next
year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Foreign Exchange Reserves Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserves rose to 1.824 billion U.S. dollars on September 10 from
1.6 billion dollars in August despite disruptions in exports
caused by the severe deluge, The Financial Express daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in foreign exchange reserves was attributed to inflow
of nearly 166 million dollars worth of aid in cash and kind from
the foreign donors for emergency relief and post-flood
rehabilitation, the report quoted central bank sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Immediate pressure on the foreign exchange reserves was
unlikely because the initial disruptions in exports following the
snapping of roads and rail links were averted through arranging a
specially chartered aircraft from the Thai Airways, they said.
</P>
<P>
The need for food imports due to crop losses caused by the
flood would not harm the balance of payments situation as half of
an estimated two million tons in flood-caused food shortage was
expected to be met from foreign assistance, they added.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program has already pledged 355,000 tons of
foodgrain for flood-hit Bangladesh in addition to the 550,000 tons
it pledged earlier to meet the country's usual annual food deficit
of two million tons, while the United States and several others
have so far pledged more than 500,000 tons of foodgrain.
</P>
<P>
Besides, both the government and private sectors were preparing
to import foods to meet the resultant deficit, which could put
some pressure on the foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
But the pressure could be minimum as the International Monetary
Fund might help Bangladesh under an emergency assistance facility
to improve its balance of payments situation, they said.
</P>
<P>
The over-two-month-long floods have so far killed more than 800
people, displaced nearly 30 million others and caused severe
damage to crops, properties and infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accuses Ten People Of Spying for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were charged in
Miami, Florida, on Monday in what prosecutors said is the largest
Cuban spy ring ever uncovered in the United States over the past
40 years.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted federal investigators as saying that the eight
men and two women tried to penetrate U.S. military bases,
infiltrate anti-Castro groups and manipulate U.S. media and
political groups.
</P>
<P>
One of the group's targets was the Miami-based U.S. Southern
Command, which runs American military operations in Latin America
and the Caribbean, said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI).
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott said, "This spy ring was cast by
the Cuban government to strike at the very heart of our national
security system and our very democratic process."
</P>
<P>
Charges against five of the suspects carry life sentences.
Charges against the other five have maximum sentences of 15 years,
reports reaching here quoted prosecutors as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two of those arrested were identified as U.S. citizens and one
as a resident alien. The citizenship of the others was not
released, but the FBI said some were agents who slipped in and out
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to an FBI affidavit filed in support of the arrests,
surveillance dating back to 1995 indicated all 10 members operated
with code names and had escape plans and alibis.
</P>
<P>
The affidavit said that the spy group was led by Manuel
Viramontes, a Cuban military captain, and used computers with
coded material on disk to communicate with each other.
</P>
<P>
Viramontes had an apartment in Miami and it was there that the
disks were found, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
The disks provided a detailed overview of spy operations
reminiscent of Cold War-era espionage, including references to
agents as comrades.
</P>
<P>
Two of those arrested were identified as U.S. citizens and one
as a resident alien. The citizenship of the others was not
released, but the FBI said some were agents who slipped in and out
of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Albanian Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- At least three supporters of
Albania's opposition leader Sali Berisha were killed and 14 others
wounded Monday when government forces launched a counterattack to
calm down an anti-government protest, police said.
</P>
<P>
The protest, prompted by the weekend assassination of the
popular opposition leader Azem Hajdari, touched off a wild day of
unrest in the capital Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets,
gathering at Skanderbeg Square in the morning to mourn for
assassinated Hajdari.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, former president Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Prime Minister Fatos Nano was responsible for
Hajdari's death. He urged Nano to step down.
</P>
<P>
Shooting broke out after mourners carried Hajdari's body to
Nano's office following the service at Skanderbeg Square.
</P>
<P>
Armed rioters shot at and bombed Nano's office. Automatic
weapons fire reportedly ripped through the city.
</P>
<P>
Rioters also seized tanks from the guards, and surrounded
national TV stations. Some expensive shops were looted. Masked
men at checkpoints stopped cars heading out of the city, robbing
drivers and occupants, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Armed vehicles and police forces were sent in to stop the
turbulence, termed by Nano as a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
Government forces soon regained control of seized key
facilities: Parliament, the state television and radio building
and Nano's office, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Rexhep Meidani condemned the chaos in a TV
speech, accusing "armed groups" of adopting violence to achieve
their purpose. He vowed to punish those behind the scene in line
with the law.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the country's largest ruling party, the
Socialist Party of Albania, was discussing solutions to the
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The president was consulting political parties in search of a
solution, including forming a new government possibly without
Nano, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
Sates and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, Berisha, despise severe criticism from international
leaders and threatened arrest by the government, has called for
another rally Tuesday at the same site where the protest was held
Monday.

NEW YORK -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday called on
world economic powers "to act together to spur global economy" as
the world is facing "the biggest Challenge in a half century".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York,
Clinton said the United States has an "inescapable obligation" to
help resolve the economic crisis affecting a growing number of
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the fact that 30 percent of the U.S. economic
growth has been made due to trade with overseas countries since he
became president in 1992, Clinton said this is why "ordinary
Americans should care if Asia or Russia or South America are on
solid footing." (Clinton-World Economy)

<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The summit of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which ended in
the early hours of Monday expressed deep concern over regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
In a 15-page communique which addresses a wide variety of
issues, the SADC summit noted with regret that the Great Lakes
region continue to pose serious security and refugees problems to
the regions of eastern, central and southern Africa,
</P>
<P>
It called on the international society to provide the
necessary diplomatic and logistical support toward efforts by
regional leaders to start a genuine process of negotiations in
the region, including Burundi and Rwanda, leading to a new
political dispensation guaranteeing liberty, democracy and
security for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed concern at the recent development in
Angola, and strongly condemned Jonas Savimbi's belligerent
non-compliance with the major provisions of the 1994 Lusaka
Protocol, which commits him to full demilitarization of his armed
forces, participation in a government of national unity and a
national defense force.
</P>
<P>
It urged member states to endure tight regulation and improved
control of airports and airspace to ensure effective
implementation of the U.N. sanctions against UNITA. The two-day
meeting undertook to adopt the necessary measures to ensure
compliance with decisions members have made through SADC, the
Organization of African Unity and U.N. resolutions on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
The communique called on the international community,
particularly countries and leaders who have an influence on
Savimbi to persuade the rebel movement to dedicate itself to the
path of peace and reconstruction in Angola as a matter of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
On the civil disturbances and loss of life following the
recent elections in Lesotho, the communique welcomed the mediation
initiative led by the South African government, which resulted in
the setting up of an SADC committee of experts to investigate the
validity or otherwise of allegations that the elections were
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the heads of state and governments expressed deep
regret at the outbreak of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo
as a result of attempts by rebels and their backers to forcefully
remove the government of President Laurent Kabila from power.
</P>
<P>
The communique welcomed initiatives by SADC and its members
intended to assist in the restoration of peace, security and
stability in Congo (K), in particular the Victoria Falls and
Pretoria initiatives.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed the 14 members' call for an immediate cessation
of hostilities and commended the governments of Angola, Namibia
and Zimbabwe for timely providing troops to assist the government
and people of Congo in defeating the illegal attempt by rebels
and their allies to capture the capital Kinshasa, and other
strategic areas.
</P>
<P>
The summit emphasized the need for all political actors in
Congo to commit themselves to orderly and peaceful transition to
multi-party democracy, primarily through constructive
consultations and negotiations involving all stakeholders.

WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Honduran man who hid
inside the landing gear of an Iberia Airlines jet survived a
two-hour flight from his country to the United States Monday, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia Capable of Chemical Warfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. intelligence
agencies Monday accused Russian firms of exporting weapons
technology and the country still being able to revive its once
massive chemical and biological warfare capability.
</P>
<P>
Russia maintains the basic building blocks of the former Soviet
Union's chemical and biological weapons capability, the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
In newly released written responses to questions from the
lawmakers, the two agencies said certain elements of the Russian
government may be seeking to circumvent arms control agreements
that limit offensive chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Key components of the former Soviet biological warfare program
remain largely intact and may support a possible future
mobilization capability for the production of biological agents
and delivery systems," the DIA reported.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, work outside the scope of legitimate biological
defense activity may be occurring now at selected facilities
within Russia," it added.
</P>
<P>
The CIA said that some biological weapons facilities in Russia
have been deactivated in recent years but that other facilities
remain able to produce biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot establish that Russia has given up this capability
and remain concerned that some of the individuals involved in the
old Soviet program may be trying to protect elements of it," the
CIA said.
</P>
<P>
The CIA also reported that private or quasi-governmental
organizations in Russia are assisting other countries in weapons
development with little oversight by law enforcement agencies
seeking to prevent illegal arms technology exports.
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, scientists from the former Soviet Union appear
to be providing their expertise and know-how to solving weapons
development problems for foreign countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the CIA, the financial position of defense
industries in the countries of the former Soviet Union continues
to be shaky, prompting many entities to seek foreign contracts to
keep operating.
</P>
<P>
"Government oversight of the activity of these firms appears to
be spotty," the CIA said, adding, law enforcement remains "a major
problem, given high levels of corruption, limited expertise and
resource shortages."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been worried that weapons of
massive destruction in Russia may be dangerous to the security of
the United States when situation there is becoming uncontrollable
with the economic crisis worsening.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian gymnasts
swept all three medals in the women's all-round competition and
won a gold and bronze in the men's competition at the Commonweal
the Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russian-born Andrei Kravtsov overcame a shoulder injury and a
persistent challenge by England's Andrew Atherton to win the
men's individual gold while Brennon Dowrick won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
In the women's events, Zeena McLaughlin took the gold with
37.917 points, Allana Slater took the silver with 37.324 and
Trudy McIntosh the bronze with 36.636.
</P>
<P>
Kravtsov, a 27-year-old Russian who moved to Australia almost
six years ago, finished with 54.675 while Atherton got the silver
with 54.025 points in what was largely a two-man race.
</P>
<P>
Dowrick, trailing in fifth place after the fifth rotation,
scored a 9.250 on the pommel horse in the sixth and final
routine, jumping to a bronze-medal finish with 52.500.
</P>
<P>
In the women's action, while McLaughlin was leading the field
from the beginning, the clutch performer turned out to be the
14-year-old McIntosh, who stood fifth after the first rotation.
She went into the final rotation needing 8.680 or more to keep
her third position from being snatched by Holly Murdoch of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But McIntosh's last event was the vault, her favorite
exercise, which earned her 9.312 points and helped seal the
win.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Faces Deficiency Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. armed forces are
facing deficiencies and the Pentagon is urging the White House and
Congress to take measures to assure that the services would have
the ability to protect the nation's interests in the next century,
said defense chief Monday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen has visited several bases
around the country in recent weeks to assess reports of problems
among the troops and planned to meet President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday and the nation's top military leaders to discuss the
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at all of the readiness issues.... We'll
continue to do so and examine ways in which whatever deficiencies
exist in our readiness can be addressed, and we'll be taking this
issue up with the president and Congress in the coming months,"
Cohen told reporters in Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of pilot and spare parts shortages,
maintenance backlogs, recruiting deficits and morale problems in
the 1.4 million force recently, particularly as deployments have
lengthened in such places as Bosnia and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Cohen admitted that the U.S. military is facing some strains,
particularly in the follow-on forces, troops who would act as a
second wave of support to front-line troops in a longer conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Navy and Air Force have recruiting shortfalls
and problems retaining more senior individuals under a booming
economy in the nation that offers attractive jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Army, he said, "has had to take money out of base
operations and infrastructure accounts to pay for readiness."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon also told reporters last week
that "the first-to-deploy forces are well trained and ready and
able to do their job. There's some growing concern about the
follow-on forces."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the military leaders are ready to ask
Clinton to increase the planned defense budgets of 250 billion
U.S. dollars by as much as 10 billion to 15 billion dollars
annually to meet the needs in modernization of weapons, support
meaningful training and bases construction.
</P>
<P>
In the last years, Pentagon officials have suggested more base
closures to save money for weapons modernization, but
Republican-led Congress opposed the idea.

<HEADLINE> Polish Foreign Exchange Reserve Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Polish foreign exchange
reserve amounted to 26.765 billion U.S. dollars in the first seven
months of this year, an increase of almost one third over the end
of 1997, the Polish Press Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increment of 6.095 billion U.S. dollars in the foreign
exchange reserve of the National Bank of Poland was attributed to
the continued rapid development of the national economy and
improvement of the investment environment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of foreign capital withdrawn from Asian
countries, including non-performing investment, have flown into
Poland since the outbreak of the Southeast Asian financial crisis
last year, the news agency quoted bank statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Poland was able to take more than 5 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign investment in the first half of this year,
in addition to the 6.6 billion U.S. dollars taken last year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to positive reasons, including the continued increase in
foreign exchange reserve, the Russian economic crisis has little
effect on the Polish economy, with its currency, zloty, stands
firm agaisnst the U.S. dollar at a rate of 3.58 to one on Monday,
0.22 higher than two weeks ago.

TIANJIN, China, Spetember 15 (Xinhua) -- Fu Mingxia, winner of
three Olympic diving gold medals, said on Tuesday that she aims
to take part in the World University Games in 1999 and 2001
instead of Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who became a students at the pretigious Qinghua
University after the Atlanta Olympic Games, resumed training last
July.
</P>
<P>
"I just returned to the pool two months ago." said Fu, who
won her first gold at the Barcelona Games in 1992 at age 14 and
two more at Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The former diving queen, who came here to watch the National
Diving Championships starting on Monday, said that she is willing
to compete in the World University Games as a representative of
Qinghua.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a students of Qinghua University. I have the respons
ibility to dive for her," the 20-year-old said. "So far, I have
not thought about the Sydney Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
The Qinghua University has a well-known diving team under the
charge of former national coach Yu Fen, who coached Fu to win the
Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
But it's an open secret that Yu and Fu had a quarrel about
prize money and it was reported that the two have not been on
very good terms since.
</P>
<P>
Yu didn't lead her new divers to compete in the national
championships, but she was believed to shine again in
international arena in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Yu has got some new divers from around the coutry this
semester. She has a lot to do helping them make adjustments,"
said Gao Bin, head of the diving team of Qinghua University. "But
I'm sure she will appear in major tournaments next year."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Travel Show to Open in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar Travel Show, aimed
at attracting more tourists from Thailand and promoting the
country's tourism industry, is due to open in Bangkok's Baiyoke
Sky Hotel Tuesday, The New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The two-day travel show, sponsored by the Myanmar Tourism
Development Committee, is participated in by 58 tourism industries
and two air services of the country with 1,186 entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
At the show, Myanmar entrepreneurs will seek means with their
Thai counterparts on increasing the number of tourists to the
country and will cooperate with Thai air services to extend
flights to Myanmar, offering special rates for package tours to
the tourist destinations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Thailand initiated an accord on cooperation in
tourism in July and the current travel show in Bangkok is the
second of its kind since the first one launched by Myanmar in
Singapore earlier that month.
</P>
<P>
Thailand plays a key role in supplying tourists to Myanmar
among its neighbors and ranks the second after Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, a total of 7,331
Thais visited Myanmar out of more than 265,000 from 24 countries
and regions, according to the official Monthly Economic
Indicators.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's investment in Myanmar's hotels and tourism sector,
second only to Singapore, amounted to 200 million U.S. dollars in
eight projects at the end of June this year, out of the total
foreign investment of some 810 million dollars in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also indicate that a total of 138,863
foreign tourists came to Myanmar in the first six months of this
year. Of them, 3,468 were Thais.
</P>
<P>
Despite the "Visit Myanmar Year" campaign launched in 1996,
Myanmar has received a smaller number of tourists in the past two
years. The country is taking measures to attract tourists in the
forthcoming open tourist season beginning October.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM: Iraq Must Be Cooperative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, chairman of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), said here Monday that Iraq
must be cooperative with it on the issue of Iraqi weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting Swedish Foreign
Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen, he said Iraq should first tell what
kind of weapons it possesses and then where they are stored.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here Monday on a two-day visit to Sweden,
currently chairman of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said inspections on Iraq's missiles and chemical weapons
could end in months if the Iraqi government provided the
commission with needed information and documents.
</P>
<P>
But if Iraq refused to do that, he said, he didn't know how
things would develop and that was a tragedy for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Security Council extended the eight-year
sanctions on Iraq indefinitely to punish it for its ban on UNSCOM
inspections of new storage sites of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has been tasked with eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction since Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, the oil embargo against Iraq can only
be lifted when UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency
certify that all Iraqi chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,
as well as long-range missiles have been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Car Makers Reject New Excise Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' car
assemblers have expressed opposition to the imposition of an
expanded excise tax on motor vehicles starting next year, the
Manila Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many assemblers have warned of serious repercussions of the
measure on sales and prices that will further hurt the already
battered auto industry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The industry is suffering from a very depressed market and if
the government will impose that (tax measure) we will suffer
more," Takeshi Fukuda, president of Toyota Motor Philippines Corp.
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fukuda warned that the Philippines might follow the way of
Thailand whose motor car industry shrank by 70 to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total industry sales of local assemblers have dropped 47
percent due to the lingering economic crisis and the credit
crunch.
</P>
<P>
Fukuda said that at present, the industry "is very thankful
that the government is not imposing that tax."
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to expand starting 1999 the coverage
of the excise tax on motor vehicles to include utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2 billion pesos (50 million dollars) in additional
revenues are expected to be raised by the government from this tax
measure. The tax is one of the nine revenue measures committed by
the Philippines to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Cuts Spending to Help Post-Flood Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region has asked all its administrative departments and
government institutions to cut their spending for the last four
months of this year, to help the reconstruction efforts in the
flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
While taking various measures to raise more flood-relief funds,
Inner Mongolia has ordered its administrative departments and
government institutions to reduce their budgets from now to the
end of the year by five percent.
</P>
<P>
The five-percent reduction will translate into an additional 10
million yuan -- which would otherwise be used to buy cars, launch
meetings and fund overseas travel -- for reconstruction in the
flood-stricken areas, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has since this summer been ravaged by the worst
flooding in the century, which has resulted in grave economic
losses and property damage.
</P>
<P>
It is a major task of the regional government to fight the
floods, resume production and rebuild homes, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Afforestation Program Benefits Helan Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China and Germany are
jointly establishing a tree shelterbelt on the eastern slopes of
the Helan Mountains in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The joint program calls for planting a shelterbelt covering
8,550 ha. by the year 2000, and enclosing 30,000 hectares of
forests in the moutains. Support projects such as irrigation
canals, technical consulting stations and roads are under
construction.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage rate will be increased by five percent
following implementation of the project which was initiated in
1994 by the Sino-German Committee on Economy and Trade.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the German partner to provide 12
million Deutsche marks, with the Chinese partner set to inject
62.19 million yuan (7.49 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Helan Mountains, located in the western section of the
Yinchuan Plain in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, block frigid
westerly winds and blowing sand from the deserts. The project will
be carried out in parts of seven counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
The massive afforestation project will not only improve the
environment, but will also provide more job opportunities for
local residents, according to local government sources.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Says Cannot Stem Rising Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Ministry of
Manpower has admitted it has little power to stem the increasing
tide of unemployment in the country because it has been forced to
postpone many of its development projects.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris told legislators in a hearing
on Monday that many of his ministry's planned development projects
had been postponed due to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will be unable to reach its target of spending 50
percent of its 1998/99 fiscal year (beginning April) budget for
development projects because of the delays, he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"How can the nation cope with unemployment if the economic
crisis and political turmoil continue to worsen?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that unemployment in Indonesia has shot up 100
percent from nine million in July last year to 18 million this
month.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Center for Research and Development Planning at
the ministry Yudo Swasono told legislators that he feared sporadic
looting and unrest would continue since the crisis had yet to show
signs of easing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post, at least three people have died
and dozens more have been injured in clashes with security forces
in recent sporadic outbreaks of rioting and looting in some areas
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday, sporadic looting has been breaking out in East
Java province. In one incident in Bondowoso, a man was shot dead
on Sunday morning when troops tried to stop a mob from pillaging
rice mills and shops selling basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, hundreds of people looted two major chicken
farms in the Pakis district of Malang, and another hundreds of
residents from the Gondanglegi area of the city looted a warehouse
where a man allegedly storing 50 tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Still in East Java, a crowd in Cerme district looted three
shrimp farms with impunity on Monday morning, and hundreds of
people stole timber from a teak plantation in Banyuwangi regency
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The looting in East Java has gone way too far," Regional
Military Commander Maj. Gen. Djoko Subroto said, adding that he
would not hesitate to issue a shoot-on-the-spot order to his men
if looters continued to defy the security forces.
</P>
<P>
In Luwu regency, 460 kilometers north of the South Sulawesi
provincial capital of Ujungpandang, a brawl between youths from
two villages erupted into full-blown rioting which killed two and
left 18 others injured.
</P>
<P>
A looting spree also took place Monday morning on a noodle
warehouse in Batanghari regency in Jambi province in Sumatra
island.
</P>
<P>
In the North Sumatra capital of Medan, a mob of 100 people took
advantage of the chaos caused by a public transport drivers'
strike to attack the city's luxurious Plaza Yuki Simpang Raya
shopping center on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the worst economic crisis in decades, the paper said,
Indonesia has borne witness to a rising incidence of social unrest
over the past year. Earlier this month, major looting sprees broke
out in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.

JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will soon form a rescue team in anticipation of major floods
predicted to hit several regions of the country in October,
Transportation Minister Giri Suseno said.
</P>
<P>
He said he will be part of the team to be formed by
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty Eradication
Haryono Suyono, the Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Suseno was speaking after opening the 12th Conference of the
Regional Association V (Southwest Pacific) of the World
Meteorology Organization (WMO) in Bali Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the regional level, he said, similar task forces set up to
handle severe floods will be headed by provincial governors.
</P>
<P>
The team will provide information and early warnings to people
before floods occur. It will also take preventive measures to
reduce the severity of the expected floods, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorology and Geophysics Agency has said Indonesia will
be affected by major floods caused by the La Nina weather
phenomenon from October to December.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Suseno said the WMO conference is
strategically important to countries in the Southwest Pacific,
particularly with respect to the exchange of data among national
meteorological agencies, so that these countries could prepare for
disasters brought about by natural phenomena occurring in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the conference's organizing committee Sri Diharto
said the main program of the WMO is "World Weather Watch", which
encourages national meteorological agencies under the organization
to coordinate their meteorological observation and data processing
functions.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day conference, which commenced Monday, is attended by
57 participants from 15 countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the main topics to be discussed is the planning and
realization of a cooperation agreement between national
meteorological agencies in the Southwest Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Budget Deficit Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
budget deficit rose sharply to 22.6 billion pesos (526 million
U.S. dollars) in the first eight months this year, nearly double
the figure registered one month earlier, the Philippine Star
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following a surplus in July, the national government's cash
position reverted back to a deficit due to a decline in the
collection of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The government, whose deficit declined to 13.6 billion pesos
(316 million dollars) at the end of July this year due to a
surplus that month, acquired a deficit of 9 billion pesos (2.1
million dollars) in August.
</P>
<P>
According to some sources, the July surplus position was
questioned by an International Monetary Fund review mission that
visited the country recently.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, is reportedly "comfortable" with the
whopping deficit for the January to August period especially since
it is expecting a 40 billion pesos (930 million dollars) deficit
for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
For next year, the Philippine government expects to incur a
cash budget shortfall of at least 30 billion pesos (698 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The IMF is urging the government to come up with more concrete
revenue measures to improve its financial situation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Leader Visits U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese military
leader arrived here Monday to discuss ways to further military
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission
of China, said at Andrews Military Air Base in a written statement
that he had come to the United States to implement the agreements
reached between Chinese and U.S. presidents, arrange further
military exchanges and promote development of bilateral
military-to-military relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States last
fall and U.S. President Bill Clinton paid a return visit to China
in late June.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to build a constructive strategic relationship
between the two countries. Closer military-to-military ties are
important part of it.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to exchange military observers to
watch the other side's military exercises and enhance cooperation
in rescue operations in addition to efforts to avoid sea accidents.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and the United States are countries that carry
considerable weight and shoulder major responsibilities in the
world. A joint commitment by China and the United States to a
constructive strategic partnership based on enhanced cooperation
not only serves the fundamental interests of our two countries,
but also contributes to peace, stability and development in the
world," Zhang said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is expected to meet U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen and other government and military leaders during his stay
until Thursday in Washington to "exchange views on issues of
mutual interest."
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to developing relations with
the United States. Since last fall, our two Presidents have
successfully exchanged visits and reached agreements on a wide

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Pushes up Animal Husbandry Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region has taken full advantage of its natural
resources and experience over the past two decades to establish
animal husbandry as a pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
An official with the regional Animal Husbandry Bureau reported
that the total 1997 output value for the industry hit two billion
yuan, accounting for 32.5 percent of the region's total
agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Figures show the output for meat hit 140,000 tons, with outputs
for eggs hitting 48,000 tons and milk 210,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has over 2.3 million hectares of grassland dedicated to
animal husbandry. The region's program to replant and improve over
200,000 hectares of grassland in recent years has resulted in a
considerable rise in grass production.
</P>
<P>
The region has spent over 100 million yuan to improve some
50-odd animal husbandry infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Fine technology has played an important role in the
process. Ningxia has applied over 80 scientific achievements
related to animal husbandry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of special breeds of livestock has also
contributed to the development of the local animal husbandry. Some
1,200 artificial breeding centers have introduced over 14 species
of animals and have recorded a total output value over 500 million
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Make Chinese People's Life More Beautiful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese people
who decorate their homes with flowers is increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
One indication is that flower-sales volume in China has has
been growing markedly over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Flowers and Potted Plant Landscape
Association, 1.9 billion flowers were sold in 1997, compared with
1.1 billion in 1996; sales volume of potted flowers was over 1
billion in 1997, more than twice the figure for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Weixian, deputy secretary of the association, said, "This
reflects the increase in Chinese people's income and the
improvement in their living conditions, as well as their stronger
sense of beautifying their living environment."
</P>
<P>
China's flower industry has been developing rapidly for over
ten years. In 1984, the total acreage of flowers in the country
was 14,000 hectares, with an output value of 600 million yuan. By
the end of last year, the acreage had expanded to over 80,000
hectares, and the output value to 9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The increase in flower-planting has caused flower prices to
drop by 50 percent in the past few years, enabling more Chinese to
buy flowers.
</P>
<P>
The per capita flower consumption in Shanghai with a population
of 13 million, for example, was nearly 30 for 1997, and in
Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, flowers are
sold at outdoor markets just like vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese flower dealers have even launched their businesses
on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Carved Jade Suit Found in Ancient Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 pieces of
carved jade believed to be from a jade burial suit have been found
in a tomb dating back some 2,000 years in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists say that such jade pieces, carved with
designs of the sun, the moon, dragons, flowers and birds, have
rarely been seen before in jade burial suits.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that the tomb, 30 meters long, 30 meters wide
and 5 meters high, probably belonged to a nobleman of the late
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD).
</P>
<P>
Jade burial suits, always made with gold or silver thread, were
usually used to adorn the bodies of royalty in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
Though apparently robbed several times, the tomb still
contained bronze weapons including a crossbow devices, and sword
and arrows, in addition to the pieces of carved jade.

<HEADLINE> Defense Should not Hide Wrongdoing, Says White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The White House, in
response on Monday to calls for President Bill Clinton to abandon
legalistic denials of perjury charges, said he had already
admitted wrongdoing in his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Clinton's admissions
should not be obscured by the work his lawyers are doing to defend
him from allegations of perjury and other misconduct in
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
"The president's lawyers have said, and many independent
observers agree, that Mr. Starr's allegations would not support a
case of perjury in a court of law," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless the president has made clear that he does not
want the work of his lawyers to get in the way of his admission
that he had an improper relationship and he misled people to keep
it private.
</P>
<P>
"No legalisms should obscure the fact that it was wrong. He
apologized for it and he's asked for forgiveness," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Leading Congressional Democrats, including Senate Democratic
Leader Tom Daschle and House Democratic Leader Representative
Richard Gephardt, earlier on Monday urged Clinton to abandon
"hair-splitting" legalistic defenses of Starr's charges.
</P>
<P>
Starr's report released last Friday accused Clinton of lying to
lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit and to Starr's
investigators in denying his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's lawyers have contended that although the president
may have made misleading statements in testimony, they did not
constitute perjury and he testified truthfully.

<HEADLINE> Malta Submits Reapplication to Join EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Maltese Foreign Minister Guido
de Marco Monday submitted Malta's reapplication for membership in
the European Union to Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, who currently heads the EU Commission of Foreign
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Malta's first application, made in July 1990, was withdrawn by
the Labor government in October 1996. After the Nationalist Party
won the elections eight days ago, Prime Minister Edward
Fenech Adami immediately announced the resumption of the
application.
</P>
<P>
De Marco told a press conference here that his country had for
years adhered to a policy of moving closer to the EU and the
two-year suspension of the application would not interfere with
its continuing the policy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the hope for Malta to be one of EU's first new
members.
</P>
<P>
However, Malta maintains its neutral status and is not
considering membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
De Marco said during the question session.
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, the Austrian foreign minister
expressed EU's welcome to Malta's application but added that
everything should be in accordance with rules and regulations
while no timetable could be fixed at present.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Labor Wins in One Poll, Loses in Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Support for the opposition
Australian Labor Party (ALP) exceeded that for the ruling
coalition in the latest poll conducted for the nation's leading
newspaper The Australian, but another poll result shows just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the latest Newspoll published in
Tuesday's Australian newspaper, the ALP broke a stalemate that had
existed throughout the campaign to move two points clear.
</P>
<P>
The support for the Labor Party rose by 2.5 percentage points
to 44 percent while support for the ruling Liberal Party and
National Party coalition was up 0.5 percentage point to 42
percent, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
But another poll, to be published this week by the nation's
weekly news magazine the Bulletin, found that 44 percent of voters
backed the Liberal Party and the National Party, and only 34
percent supported Labor.
</P>
<P>
Never before during an election campaign have the polls so
widely differed, the Australian Associated Press said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Even more confusing, both are telephone polls conducted around
the same time last weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the two polls, support for One Nation Party led by
Pauline Hanson is down in the poll average to seven points.
</P>
<P>
While the poll average shows the coalition a comfortable four
points in front, the ALP will draw comfort from the fact that the
only poll to have Labor ahead, Newspoll, is also the poll with the
best record of predicting election results.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, who set October 3 as the federal
election date on August 30, said Friday the election would be a
"tight" one.

BELGRADE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A vehicle carrying three
Canadian diplomatic observers hit a mine and overturned in western
Kosovo on Monday, leaving a woman interpreter injured.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Pristina news center said the incident
happened in the Drenica area south of the village of Likovac,
while the three-member team was heading for Donje Obrinje, a
village dominated by ethnic Albanian gunmen of the separatist
"Kosovo Liberation Army" (KLA).
</P>
<P>
"A mine exploded under the right rear wheel of our vehicle and
left a crater of about two meters wide and one meter deep," Gavin
Buchan, one of two Canadian observers told reporters.
</P>
<P>
John Sheahen, the other observer, said he was sure the weapon
was an anti-tank mine.
</P>
<P>
Serbian police reportedly came to their aid after the observers
called them for help; the Serbians were fired on by KLA gunmen,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said they heard bursts of fires for half a hour and
were eventually evacuated by a number of armored vehicles and Serb
police.

<HEADLINE> Southern Flood-Ravaged Areas Enjoy Stable Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Flood-ravaged areas in Hunan
Province and Chongqing Municipality continue to enjoy stable
prices for vegetables and other daily-use items.
</P>
<P>
Price hikes for vegetables in Hunan's Yueyang City, one of the
areas most affected by flooding around Dongting Lake, have
remained within the 10 percent range in spite of sustantial drops
in output due to the destruction of vegetable production bases
covering over 4,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attribute the ample vegetable supply to
virtually intact railway and highway networks which have ensured a
constant flow of products from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, an area hit by an extended period of heavy rain and
landslides, has also enjoyed stable prices for vegetable and goods
of daily necessities, according to a survey of ten local districts
and counties.
</P>
<P>
The achievement has been attributed to the municipality's
timely efforts to distribute supplies to disaster-stricken areas
and to strict measure preventing market speculation in the wake of
the natural disaster.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Reject Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur chairman
Alan Sugar said that he has turned down a takeover bid which
would have valued the White Hart Lane club at 80 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he had received an approach from leisure
group ENIC.
</P>
<P>
ENIC, which is backed by Bahamas based billionaire Joe Lewis
and Time Warner, the U.S. media giant, owns a host of European
clubs, has a stake in Glasgow Rangers and is known to want to
extend its interests with a move into the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sugar has been rumoured to be keen to sell his near 40%
stake in his club for some time, but was not tempted by the price
offered by ENIC.
</P>
<P>
However City analysts believe ENIC could increase its offer to
win control of the club.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Tottenham Hotspur leapt almost 17% to 84p on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spurs are the latest club to be linked with a takeover
following BSkyB's proposed 623m buy-out of Manchester United and
media giants Carlton Communications possible link with Double
winners Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The latest twist in the saga comes at the end of a dramatic
week for football.
</P>
<P>
Since news of the likely BSkyB takeover broke, intense
speculation has surrounded the future of several top teams.
</P>
<P>
Millions of pounds were added to the value of clubs like Aston
Villa and Newcastle United on the London Stock Exchange on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sheffield United, has also revealed it is in preliminary talks
with a number of individuals, which might be interested in taking
a substantial stake in the club.

WASHINGTON -- The United States, backing away from its initial
assessment, concluded Monday that the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) launched a satellite two weeks ago, but not a
missile.
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that North Korea did attempt to orbit a very
small satellite," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters. "We also have concluded the satellite failed to
achieve orbit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The August 31 rocket firing was first described by
U.S. officials as a multi-stage Taepo Dong-1 missile that has a
range of more than 1,930 km and has been viewed as threatening,
especially by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the United States has tended to ignore official DPRK
statement that the Aug. 31 launch involved a satellite, although
South Korea's foreign minister said in Washington last Friday that
based on talks with U.S. experts it appeared that a satellite
launch was most probable. (US-DPRK-Satellite)

UNITED NATIONS -- Iraq demanded once again on Monday that the

investigation of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

In a letter to the Security Council, Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz said initiating a probe may correct the
situation within UNSCOM and make it to be an impartial
international body.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has complained that UNSCOM is controlled by the United
States and it is the United States which decides on the
Commission's agenda and even on its working methods.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Resume Consultations on Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council is expected to resume closed-door consultations on the
situation in the war-torn Angola before its ending with a
resolution on whether to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA).

the southern African country have made substantial progress in
full compliance with the 1994 Lusaka Protocol.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Ends with Condemnation of UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The two-day summit of
heads of states and government of the Southern African African
Community (SADC) ended here well after midnight with all members
condemning Angola's opposition UNITA.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, the current chairman
of the SADC, said in his closing speech that the regional
grouping condemned strongly the "flagrant non-compliance with the
major provisions of the Lusaka Protocol" in 1994 by the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The heads of the 14 SADC members concluded that "the behavior
of Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the former rebel UNITA movement, is
that of a war criminal" which thus "renders him objectively
incapable of leading his party onto the road to peace in Angola,"
said a SADC summit statement on Angola read by Kaire Mbuende,
executive secretary of the SADC.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the southern African countries expressed their
full support to the movement of renewal within UNITA launched by
its cadres and political leaders of that party, and recognize in
them sufficient competence to act as capable and valid
negotiators with the government of Angola in the search for a
just solution aimed at ending the peace process and strengthening
democracy in Angola, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders appeal to the United Nations, the
troika of observers and the entire international community to
recognize the new leadership of UNITA, assist and encourage it to
cooperate fully with the Angolan government in accomplishing the
Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The tireless efforts by the Angolan government in bringing
about peace in the country are also praised by the SADC heads.
</P>
<P>
They urged the international community to fully support the
government to facilitate the social integration of demobilized
soldiers and the involvement of all Angolan citizens.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the summit noted that it will be ensured that
decisions taken by the member states through the SADC, the
Organization of African Unity and the U.N. are complied with and
that international community would intensify pressure on UNITA to
demilitarize as required so that the people of Angola can start
rebuilding the country.
</P>
<P>
On the Lesotho issue, SADC is ready to continue its efforts to
facilitate an end of the problems that have arisen there
concerning the results of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state are confident that leaders of Lesotho will
find a satisfactory solution as the mediation initiative will be
taken by four SADC members consisting of Botswana, Mozambique,
Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional grouping also expressed its commitment to
giving all necessary support to the efforts to restore peace,
security and stability to the Democratic Republic of Congo on the
basis of the Victoria Falls and Pretoria initiatives, as the
start of a peaceful transition to democracy.

<HEADLINE> WHO Projects 228 Million People with Diabetes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- There will be 228 million
people with diabetes mellitus in developing countries by the year
2025, said the World Health Organization (WHO) in a press release
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number will be 170 percent more than that in 1995 when
there were 84 million with diabetes in the developing world, said
the WHO. In the same period, the developed world will see a 41
percent increase, from 51 to 72 million.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, a 122 percent growth is projected, from the total of
135 to 300 million. More than twofold global increase will occur
because of population aging and growth, as well as from obesity,
unhealthy diets and a sedentary lifestyle, with the later factors
closely associated with urbanization and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
"These estimates and projections will undoubtedly become a
powerful tool for planning evidence-based health care and public
health interventions in our member states," commented WHO's
Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
"They are yet another scientific testimony of a transition the
world is experiencing at the moment, the transition from
communicable to noncommunicable diseases," she said. "In the 21st
century, the impact of this transition on the public health and
economic sectors will be especially noticeable in developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
She said that her organization is currently developing a
strategy, which could help reduce the toll of premature morbidity
and mortality from major noncommunicable diseases, including
diabetes, and prepare developing countries for such a transition.
