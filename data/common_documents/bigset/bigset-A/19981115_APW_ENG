<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Top officials from Pacific Rim
countries forged ahead with trade negotiations Sunday, despite the
cancellation of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   Clinton had been scheduled to leave late Saturday for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but decided to send Vice
President Al Gore in his place so the president could deal with the
Iraq crisis at home.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he regretted
Clinton would not attend the APEC summit, telling reporters he
would have liked the American president to see for himself that the
streets of the capital were calm.
	   Some 3,000 protesters held a demonstration late Saturday
demanding an end to Mahathir's 17-year rule and chanting, as they
marched toward the hotel where the U.S. delegation is staying,
``Clinton, save us from Mahathir!''
	   Several undercover policemen fired shots in the air, and
protesters set fire to a motorcycle near the hotel, but no serious
injuries were reported.
	   Protesters have been calling for Mahathir's ouster since he
fired and later jailed his one-time protege, Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim. Some 300 activists held a rally near the same hotel
Sunday morning, waving banners demanding freedom for Anwar.
	   Mahathir, addressing a meeting of international business leaders
attending a meeting on the sidelines of the APEC forum, took aim at
Clinton over the standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I'd always hoped we could settle such problems with
negotiations,'' Mahathir said. ``Iraq is not an easy country, but
lobbing bombs and grenades will not do anything to solve this
problem.''
	   Some other top officials said they hoped the U.S.-Iraq showdown
would not overshadow the summit.
	   ``The situation in Iraq could take ... focus away from the
attention that we have on the resolution of the economic crisis in
the region,'' said Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
``Resources could be diverted there, so it affects everybody.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived in
Malaysia late Saturday to attend the APEC summit, told officials
from China and other countries Sunday that American forces were
prepared to attack Iraq, after the United States rejected its
proposal to resume U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We are poised to act and we see no need for further
warnings,'' her spokesman, James P. Rubin, told reporters.
	   Rubin said Clinton regretted he could not attend the summit, but
that the president felt Albright's attendance would show the
importance the United States places on the forum.
	   ``It's a very clear symbol of the importance that we attach to
this kind of meeting,'' Rubin said.
	   Mahathir has had to face many setbacks surrounding the economic
summit that was supposed to showcase his leadership and the
enormous economic progress in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have said they
would refuse the customary courtesy calls on the host of the APEC
summit, angered by the treatment given Anwar.
	   Anwar was sacked and jailed after he led anti-government
protests. He currently is on trial on corruption and sexual
misconduct charges, which he denies and calls politically
motivated.
	   Foreign officials, including Albright, have said they plan to
meet with Anwar's wife to discuss the case.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy invited Anwar's wife to
lunch on Saturday.
	   Also Saturday, officials finishing a statement to be issued by
APEC's leaders hewed closely to a package of proposals from the
United States rather than endorsing Mahathir's calls for currency
controls.
	   The draft of a final communique for the leaders of the 21-member
APEC supported Clinton's proposals to increase social programs to
help millions of Asians plunged into poverty by the steep economic
downturn.
	   It also endorsed Clinton's call for new ways to get financial
assistance to debt-strapped corporations and banks in
crisis-affected countries.
	   Mahathir has blamed Asia's troubles on foreign currency
speculators and the policies of the International Monetary Fund. In
September, he banned trading of the Malaysian currency outside the
country and imposed controls on foreigners trying to pull money out
of Malaysia.
	   The draft APEC statement, however, praised the IMF's handling of
the financial crisis, although the statement conceded that APEC
leaders had not accurately foreseen the severity of the turmoil.
	   ``The challenge before us is to support an early and sustained
recovery of the region, to contain the risks of contagion and
prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, to be issued at the conclusion of the leaders' talks on
Wednesday.
	   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
only section of the document where serious disagreement remained
was the portion dealing with free trade.
	   Foreign and trade ministers of APEC countries hoped to wrap up
discussions in this area on Sunday with a deal slashing tariffs in
nine key industries covering dlrs 1.5 trillion of global trade. But
Japan remained adamant that it could not lower barriers in the
politically sensitive areas of fish and forestry products.

McGuire wins women's Australian Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand's Marnie McGuire was
true to her word Sunday when she won the women's Australian Open
after leading through every round.
	   McGuire expressed confidence in her ability to protect a lead
after each stage and she was in great form down the stretch to hold
off No.3-ranked Kelly Robbins of the United States.
	   ``This is my sixth professional win but this is my first outside
of Japan,'' McGuire, 29, said. ``It's great to win on another
continent.''
	   McGuire started the day one ahead of Robbins, who won the
Tournament of Champions last month, and closed with a 67 to finish
with a 12-under 280 at the par-73 Yarra Yarra course. Robbins
finished four back after a 70.
	   McGuire started with four birdies, had just one bogey, at the
par-5 8th, and put the title beyond doubt at the 16th. She narrowly
missed a putt for eagle but went three ahead as Robbins played into
a greenside bunker and settled for par.
	   McGuire set up her victory with a strong driving performance.
	   ``All week it's been straight and I've never been in trouble,''
McGuire said.
	   Robbins missed an eagle putt at the 18th and missed again with a
short attempt for birdie before holing out for a par-5.
	   Robbins had an equal course record 65 Saturday and said she felt
she could match the performance again Sunday.
	   ``You know there's one day to play and it could happen again,''
Robbins said. ``I just went out there and tried to put as much
pressure on Marnie as possible but she just played great.''
	   Local favorite Karrie Webb started the final round five shots
behind McGuire after a dismal opening round 78. Webb closed with a
71 to finish 4th, behind compatriot Jane Crafter who had a 67.
	   Sweden's Liselotte Neumann labored to a 74 to be 2-under in 5th.
	   McGuire's purse in the Australian dlrs 350,000 (U.S. dlrs
222,250) event was Australian dlrs 52,500 (U.S. dlrs 33,335).

Opposition party supports deal for new Cambodian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's third-biggest political
party, set to become the sole opposition force in Parliament, on
Sunday cautiously welcomed an agreement that will place strongman
Hun Sen at the head of a new coalition government.
	   The opposition party led by former finance minister Sam Rainsy,
which placed a distant third in a July election, applauded King
Norodom Sihanouk's efforts to end a three-month-long political
stalemate by brokering a deal Friday between its opposition ally
FUNCINPEC and Hun Sen's ruling party.
	   But the Sam Rainsy Party remained cautious, noting that many of
the details of the new deal had yet to be ironed out in the deal,
including the makeup of Hun Sen's coalition government and the
exact role of a new Senate in the Cambodian legislature.
	   ``The Sam Rainsy Party welcomes the progress made by FUNCINPEC
and the Cambodian People's Party...toward the formation of a legal
government in Cambodia,'' the party said in a statement. ``However,
there is still much to be done. Many more issues must be decided
before Cambodia can move forward in a democratic direction.''
	   Hun Sen's CPP narrowly won the election, but the party needs
support from Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party to gain the
two-thirds vote in the National Assembly required for approval of a
new government.
	   The ruling party agreed to give Ranariddh the presidency of the
National Assembly in Friday's deal, despite its majority in the
legislature.
	   Key to the compromise was an agreement for a constitutional
amendment creating a new Senate to be led by the president of Hun
Sen's ruling party, Chea Sim. The king will initially appoint the
Senate's members.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party did not attend the two-day summit at the
king's palace that hatched the deal, and now looks to become the
sole opposition party in parliament when it meets again on Nov. 25.
	   Sam Rainsy, who is being investigated by a Phnom Penh court for
his role in antigovernment demonstrations after the election, has
remained outside Cambodia since a ceremonial opening of Parliament
in September.
	   The party announced Sam Rainsy would return from Paris within a
week. It also called for the next government to endorse a political
platform of broad political, legal and economic reforms.
	   ``The progress made in the past few days creates an opening for
such reform,'' the party stated. ``As long as this opening exists,
the SRP will be pleased to participate either in opposition or in a
government.''

Albright uses APEC meetings to criticize Iraq's position
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE Albright's comment on Iraq breaking its
promises, explanation of why she will meet with Anwar's wife &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told officials from China and other countries Sunday that
American forces are poised to attack Iraq, after rejecting its
proposal to resume weapons inspections.
	   Albright, who arrived in Malaysia late Saturday to attend a
summit meeting on Asia's economic crisis, spent the night
discussing the U.S.-Iraq standoff on the telephone with top
American and U.N. officials, said her spokesman, James P. Rubin.
	   On Sunday, she began a series of meetings with top officials at
the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to explain
the U.S. position.
	   ``We are poised to act and we see no need for further
warnings,'' Rubin said at a news conference. ``She will say that
time and time again, Iraq has promised to come into compliance with
U.N. resolutions and broken that promise.''
	   During the first of her bilateral meetings, Albright told her
Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, that Iraq must back down, Rubin
said. Tang agreed that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is responsible
for the current crisis, said Rubin. But he did not say whether the
Chinese would support air strikes.
	   Albright will use her meetings with APEC officials to emphasize
that Saddam's offer to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume
their inspections contained too many conditions, Rubin said.
	   An Iraqi letter, addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
linked a resumption of inspections with ``a further chance to
achieve justice by lifting sanctions'' that the world imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Rubin called the letter ``a demand we regard as unacceptable.''
	   Albright also will use her visit to Malaysia to discuss the
Asian economic crisis and meet with the wife of former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired, then jailed and put on trial
after launching a reform movement opposing the leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Rubin said.
	   ``I think the Malaysian government will understand the
significance of her (Albright) choosing that meeting,'' Rubin said,
adding that the secretary of state was not expected to hold any
private meetings with the Malaysian government.
	   ``We are here to discuss issues that APEC brought to Malaysia,
not the specifics of relations with Malaysia,'' Rubin said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who canceled his plan to travel to
the APEC summit because of the Iraq crisis, had not planned to meet
with Mahathir in Kuala Lumpur either because of U.S. concerns over
Malaysia's treatment of Anwar. He claims he was severely beaten by
officials when he was jailed before his trial.
	   Albright's plan to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, drew
strong rebukes Saturday from her Malaysian counterpart, Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi, who said Albright ``should not interfere in
Malaysia's affairs.''
	   The secretary of state's meeting with Azizah was intended to
express concern about ``the treatment of Anwar, the mistreatment in
prison and the importance we attach to due process during the
trial,'' Rubin said. He declined to say when the meeting would take
place. Albright was scheduled to leave Kuala Lumpur Tuesday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
called on Pacific Rim leaders Sunday to impose checks on currency
traders and not be ``fanatical'' about free trade.
	   Mahathir said the industrial powers should take a more active
role in stabilizing volatile exchange rates.
	   ``Governments of powerful countries just cannot abdicate their
roles in determining the exchange-rate mechanism,'' Mahathir told
some 1,000 chiefs of the world's largest corporations. ``They owe
it to their peoples and their countries to accept the
responsibility for determining the exchange rate.''
	   The comments signaled that host Malaysia was trying to steer the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Tuesday and Wednesday
toward discussions of the global financial system.
	   Trade ministers Sunday remained deadlocked in talks over the
extent to which markets should be opened for products in nine
sectors. The United States accuses Japan of resisting the
free-market tide, but some Asian nations have argued that each
economy should determine when they're ready to lift tariffs.
	   Mahathir warned that globalization of the financial markets
should not be pursued too zealously.
	   ``We must not be tied down by fanatical beliefs,'' Mahathir told
the business leaders attending a summit on the sidelines of the
APEC forum.
	   Mahathir said that if the United States could file a suit
against Bill Gate's Microsoft for monopolizing the computer
software industry, then there should be a mechanism to prosecute
hedge-funds operators.
	   ``In currency trading the hedge funds are the Bill Gates of the
international financial market,'' he said.
	   Later, Mahathir told reporters he hoped Gates, whom he described
as a friend, would not take offense over the comparison.
	   Gates is part of a team of international experts Malaysia has
invited to help create its own version of Silicon Valley, called
the Multimedia Super Corridor.
	   Mahathir estimates that his small Southeast Asian nation has
lost dlrs 150 billion in market capitalization in the past 20
months. He cites speculators as the leading cause of the currency
turmoil that began in Asia last year and is now affecting the
industrialized nations.
	   ``Currency speculation and the rapid flow of investment capital
in and out of countries may be compatible with globalization,''
Mahathir said. ``But we have seen how much harm they can do to the
economies of the developing countries.''
	   Mahathir has long demanded that currency traders register
themselves with local governments and explain how they operate.
	   Most Western nations, including the United States, have refused
to heed his prescription. Currency traders are an integral part of
the free-market system, they argue.
	   ``The excuse they give that currency trading cannot be made
transparent is ridiculous,'' Mahathir said.
	   Malaysia moved in September to keep out currency traders by
imposing selective capital controls and fixing the exchange rate of
the ringgit. The ringgit has lost more than 30 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar in one year, a fall Mahathir blames on
speculative attacks.

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further Iraqi clarifications, debate over Iraqi
letter and press statement &QL;

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Security Council members were divided
Saturday over Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors, which has been rejected by the United States
but welcomed by France, Russia and China.
	   After meeting for nearly five hours, the council suspended its
discussion on Iraq until Sunday afternoon. British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock said the 15 members were looking for consensus
and ``were beginning to inch in the right direction.''
	   Russia's Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Iraq's announcement that
it was rescinding its ban on weapons inspections, and
clarifications provided by Baghdad's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon
complied with Security Council demands.
	   But Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh referred to the U.S.
rejection of Iraq's announcement, which was stated ``clearly,
forcefully'' by National Security adviser Sandy Berger. He said he
would be consulting with Washington on Hamdoon's clarifications and
statements from other council members.
	   What raised serious questions in the United States and Britain
was a two-page annex to the letter from Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz announcing the resumption of cooperation with
the weapons inspectors.
	   The annex reiterated Iraq's previous terms for a comprehensive
review, many of which have already been rejected by the United
States. The Clinton administration, in rejecting Baghdad's offer,
said Iraq was attaching conditions.
	   ``The Iraqi letter is neither unequivocal nor unconditional. ...
It is unacceptable,'' Berger said. He derided Aziz's letter, and
especially the annex, as having ``more holes than Swiss cheese.''
	   As the council debated whether to take note of Iraq's ``positive
response,'' Hamdoon sent in three letters of clarification in an
attempt to assure the Americans and British that their decision was
unconditional.
	   Lavrov said council members wanted answers to three questions
which he said Iraq had provided.
	   Had it's Aug. 5 decision to curtail weapons inspections and its
Oct. 31 ban on all dealings with the U.N Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, been rescinded? Lavrov said Iraq replied ``yes.''
	   Were there any conditions? Lavrov said Iraq replied ``no.''
Would UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed
to operate ``in full?'' Lavrov said the answer was ``yes.''
	   After the council adjourned for the night, Hamdoon said, ``the
majority of council members do appreciate Iraq's cooperation and
	   appreciate the Iraqi flexibility in trying to find a way out of
this crisis.''
	   He expressed hope that the council would adopt a statement
Sunday ``that could help out in the process of trying to reach out
to a peaceful solution to the current situation.''
	   Russia has proposed a draft press statement from the council
which notes Hamdoon's clarifying statement that there are ``no
conditions'' to the full resumption of inspections. It also takes
note of a letter to the council from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan saying that he received ``a positive response'' from Aziz to
his appeal to Iraq to rescind its ban on inspections.
	   Diplomats said the United States and Britain had opposed any
acknowledgement of Iraq's positive response. They indicated that
Washington wanted a statement from a higher ranking Iraqi offical
than Hamdoon making crystal clear Iraq's unconditional compliance.
	   But there were also indications that Washington and London were
in no hurry to give a thumbs up to Iraq's announcement, which would
mean lifting the threat of airstrikes.
	   When Lavrov asked Burleigh whether the United States still
intended to bomb Iraq, the U.S. envoy simply referred to Berger's
statement Saturday afternoon, diplomats said. ``We were poised to
take military action, and we remain poised to take military
action,'' Berger said.
	   A U.S. official said the larger issue that the United States
needed to assess was how serious the letters were.
	   Advisers to President Clinton said they would wait to see the
written statement before making any judgment on whether it altered
the crisis situation.
	   The United States was the only Security Council member to
totally reject the Iraqi offer when the council meeting got under
way Saturday evening. Britain said it remained skeptical and was
keeping its options open.
	   Greenstock said it wasn't surprising that council members needed
to consult their governments because ``there are serious issues at
stake.''
	   But most of the council, along with the secretary-general,
reacted positively to Iraq's announcement.
	   ``I think at least they've made a step in the right direction
... it's a positive development,'' Annan said.
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet insisted that the annex did not
impose any conditions.
	   And China's Ambassador Qin Huasun welcomed Iraq's decision
saying ``it is proved once again that only diplomatic effort could
achieve the best results.''
	   ``We believe UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors should resume their work
in Iraq immediately,'' Qin said.
	   When Lavrov was asked if the secretary-general should leave for
Baghdad on Saturday to mediate, he replied, ``UNSCOM should go to
Baghdad. This is not a crisis any more.''

South Korean Cruise ship arrives in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A chartered South Korean cruise ship
arrived in North Korea Sunday on a test run for sightseeing tours
of the reclusive communist country's scenic east coast, tour
organizers said.
	   The 28,700-ton Hyundai Kumkang arrived at Jang Jon Port near
Diamond Mountain on the North's eastern coast, 12 hours after
leaving South Korea's Donghae port, said Seoul's Hyundai group,
which is organizing the tours.
	   Instead of taking a four-hour coastal route, the ship took a
longer route, sailing out to open sea and then moving north and
back into North Korean waters.
	   The route was planned in deference to North Korea's concerns
about sensitive military facilities located along the coast near
the border with South Korea, Hyundai officials said.
	   The ship was carrying some 400 South Korean tour guides and
Hyundai officials on a two-day rehearsal tour. They were scheduled
to return home Monday.
	   Although the trip was just a test run, it marks the largest
single group of South Koreans to visit rival North Korea since the
two countries fought a bloody war in the early 1950s.
	   The same ship will carry 980 tourists and 600 crewmen Wednesday
for a five-day tour, the centerpiece of which is a hike to scenic
Diamond Mountain. It will be South Korea's first commercial
sightseeing tour to the reclusive communist country.
	   Hyundai hopes that up to 2,000 tourists per week will
participate. It has agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 906 million over
the next six years for the right to operate the tour.
	   The two Koreas were separated into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war after
the 1950-53 Korean War ended without a permanent peace treaty.

South Korean relief group ships 96 more milk cows to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean ship left Sunday with
95 milk cows to be donated to hunger-stricken North Korea, a
Seoul-based relief group said.
	   The Good Neighbors, a group which already had donated 104 milk
cows to the North in September, said its second relief ship left
Inchon port west of Seoul early Sunday and would arrive in the
North's Nampo port later that same day.
	   Earlier this year, South Korea's largest conglomerate, Hyundai,
donated 1,001 head of cattle to North Korea.
	   So far, South Korea has given its rival North Korea dlrs 315
million in food aid since the communist country turned to the
international community to feed its 22 million people in 1995.
	   North Korea has suffered dire food shortages after three years
of disastrous weather that aggravated problems caused by
inefficient farming techniques.

Questions raised over whether Iraq's offer is unconditional
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from third clarifying letter from Hamdoon &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Security Council members were divided
Saturday over Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors, which has been rejected by the United States
but welcomed by France, Russia and China.
	   After meeting for nearly five hours, the council suspended its
discussion on Iraq until Sunday afternoon. British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock said the 15 members were looking for consensus
and ``were beginning to inch in the right direction.''
	   Russia's Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Iraq's announcement that
it was rescinding its ban on weapons inspections, and
clarifications provided by Baghdad's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon
complied with Security Council demands.
	   But Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh referred to the U.S.
rejection of Iraq's announcement, which was stated ``clearly,
forcefully'' by National Security adviser Sandy Berger. He said he
would be consulting with Washington on Hamdoon's clarifications and
statements from other council members.
	   What raised serious questions in the United States and Britain
was a two-page annex to the letter from Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz announcing the resumption of cooperation with
the weapons inspectors.
	   The annex reiterated Iraq's previous terms for a comprehensive
review, many of which have already been rejected by the United
States. The Clinton administration, in rejecting Baghdad's offer,
said Iraq was attaching conditions.
	   ``The Iraqi letter is neither unequivocal nor unconditional. ...
It is unacceptable,'' Berger said. He derided Aziz's letter, and
especially the annex, as having ``more holes than Swiss cheese.''
	   As the council debated whether to take note of Iraq's ``positive
response,'' Hamdoon sent in three letters of clarification in an
attempt to assure the Americans and British that Iraq's decision
was unconditional.
	   The third letter of clarification said Iraq's resumption of
cooperation with the weapons inspectors was not linked to the
annex, which contained only ``the views and preferences'' of the
Iraqi government about a comprehensive review.
	   The letter also stated that the U.N. Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, and the International Atomic Energy Agency ``can
immediately resume all their activities.''
	   Lavrov said council members wanted answers to three questions
which he said Iraq had provided.
	   Had Iraq rescinded its Aug. 5 decision to curtail weapons
inspections and its Oct. 31 ban on all dealings with UNSCOM? Iraq
replied ``yes,'' he said. Were there any conditions? Iraq replied
``no,'' he said. Would UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy
Agency be allowed to operate ``in full?'' Iraq said ``yes,'' he
said.
	   After the council adjourned for the night, Hamdoon said, ``the
majority of council members do appreciate Iraq's cooperation and
	   appreciate the Iraqi flexibility in trying to find a way out of
this crisis.''
	   He expressed hope that the council would adopt a statement
Sunday ``that could help out in the process of trying to reach out
to a peaceful solution to the current situation.''
	   Russia has proposed a draft press statement from the council
which notes Hamdoon's clarifying statement that there are ``no
conditions'' to the full resumption of inspections. It also takes
note of a letter to the council from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan saying that he received ``a positive response'' from Aziz to
his appeal to Iraq to rescind its ban on inspections.
	   Diplomats said the United States and Britain had opposed any
acknowledgement of Iraq's positive response. They indicated that
Washington wanted a statement from a higher ranking Iraqi offical
than Hamdoon making crystal clear Iraq's unconditional compliance.
	   But there were also indications that Washington and London were
in no hurry to give a thumbs up to Iraq's announcement, which would
mean lifting the threat of airstrikes.
	   When Lavrov asked Burleigh whether the United States still
intended to bomb Iraq, the U.S. envoy simply referred to Berger's
statement Saturday afternoon, diplomats said. ``We were poised to
take military action, and we remain poised to take military
action,'' Berger said.
	   A U.S. official said the larger issue that the United States
needed to assess was how serious the letters were.
	   Advisers to President Clinton said they would wait to see the
written statement before making any judgment on whether it altered
the crisis situation.
	   The United States was the only Security Council member to
totally reject the Iraqi offer when the council meeting got under
way Saturday evening. Britain said it remained skeptical and was
keeping its options open.
	   Greenstock said it wasn't surprising that council members needed
to consult their governments because ``there are serious issues at
stake.''
	   But most of the council, along with the secretary-general,
reacted positively to Iraq's announcement.
	   ``I think at least they've made a step in the right direction
... it's a positive development,'' Annan said.
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet insisted that the annex did not
impose any conditions.
	   And China's Ambassador Qin Huasun welcomed Iraq's decision
saying ``it is proved once again that only diplomatic effort could
achieve the best results.''
	   ``We believe UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors should resume their work
in Iraq immediately,'' Qin said.
	   When Lavrov was asked if the secretary-general should leave for
Baghdad on Saturday to mediate, he replied, ``UNSCOM should go to
Baghdad. This is not a crisis any more.''

Washington Capitals win 5-3 over New York Islanders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Andrei Nikolishin and James Black
scored goals 2:16 apart early in the second period during a
four-goal spurt to give the Washington Capitals a 5-3 victory over
the New York Islanders on Saturday night.
	   Ken Klee, Brian Bellows and Adam Oates also scored for the
Capitals, who are unbeaten in their last eight games against New
York (7-0-1) since a 2-0 home loss on Mar. 2, 1997.
	   Trevor Linden had two goals, one on the power play, and Kenny
Jonsson added a power-play goal for the Islanders.
	   Washington goaltender Olaf Kolzig won for only the fourth time
this season as he stopped 21 shots. Tommy Salo started for the
Islanders and gave up four goals on 28 shots. Wade Flaherty
relieved Salo and made five more saves.
 &UR; Stars 3, Bruins 1
	   In Boston, Brett Hull broke a tie with his second goal of the
game with 4:26 left, then got his 1,000th career point on an assist
as the Dallas Stars ended the Boston Bruins' four-game unbeaten
streak.
	   Mike Modano started the winning play when he got the puck away
from Ray Bourque at the left point and passed to a wide-open Hull
skating up the slot. Hull lifted the puck over Dafoe for his sixth
goal, giving the Stars their second road win in as many nights.
They had been 1-2-1 away from home before Friday.
	   Hull, who began the season in 54th place with 987 points,
reached 1,000 with an assist on Jere Lehtinen's empty-net goal with
34 seconds remaining. Hull and his father, Bobby, are the only
father-son duo in NHL history to each collect 1,000 points. They
are already the only father-son pair to have 500 goals apiece.

UNIONDALE, New York: goals apiece.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Sabres 6, Blackhawks 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Buffalo, New York, Michal Grosek scored twice as the Buffalo
Sabres extended their league-best unbeaten streak to eight games
with a win over the slumping Chicago Blackhawks.
	   Brian Holzinger, Alexei Zhitnik, Geoff Sanderson and Miroslav
Satan also scored for the Sabres. Buffalo has won five of its last
eight with three ties.
	   The Blackhawks, who have gone nine straight games without a win
(0-8-1), managed just 15 shots through two periods on Buffalo
goalie Dominik Hasek. Tony Amonte scored in the second period for
the Blackhawks, who have more losses through 16 games (4-10-2) than
any team in the NHL.
 &UR; Oilers 4, Canadiens 1
	   In Montreal, Bill Guerin scored his 11th and 12th goals of the
season and Rem Murray also had two goals to lift the Edmonton
Oilers over the Montreal Canadiens.
	   Murray's second goal of the game broke a 1-1 tie 62 seconds into
the third period. Just 53 seconds later, Guerin took a cross-ice
pass, beat defenseman Patrice Brisebois and sent a shot through
Montreal goaltender Jose Theodore's legs. Guerin added his second
of the game on a power play at 5:48.
	   Boris Mironov had an assist on the goal to extend his points
streak to seven games. Patrick Poulin scored for Montreal.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 2, Senators 1
	   In Toronto, Kris King scored shorthanded early in the third
period to lead the Maple Leafs over the Ottawa Senators, only
Toronto's second victory against the Eastern Conference this
season.
	   Steve Thomas also scored for the Maple Leafs, who are 9-6-2
overall but only 2-5-1 in the East this season.
	   It also marked Toronto's first victory against Ottawa since Dec.
5, 1995 _ a stretch of five games (0-4-1).
	   Magnus Arvedson scored for the Senators (6-6-2), who lost for
only the second time in 12 road games dating back to last season.
 &UR; Penguins 4, Panthers 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Tom Barrasso stopped 23 shots and became the
third Pittsburgh goaltender to register a shutout in three weeks as
the Penguins beat the Florida Panthers.
	   Barrasso was making his second appearance since missing 10 games
with a groin pull. Friday's 4-3 loss in New Jersey was Barrasso's
first action since the injury forced him out of a game on Oct. 17.
	   Peter Skudra made 27 saves to beat Toronto 2-0 on Oct. 26 and
rookie Jean-Sebastian Aubin stopped 18 shots in a scoreless tie
against Boston on Nov. 7.
 &UR; Flyers 6, Devils 1
	   In Philadelphia, Eric Lindros had two goals and a three assists
as the Philadelphia Flyers scored five third-period goals to defeat
the New Jersey Devils.
	   The victory enabled Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall to tie Bernie
Parent for first place on the Flyers' all-time career list with 232
victories.
	   John LeClair added a pair of goals and an assist for the Flyers,
who had been winless in their last seven games (0-5-2). The Flyers,
who outshot the Devils 40-18 _ including 17-2 in the third period _
also snapped a two-game losing streak and a six-game winless streak
(0-5-1) against the Devils.

Cambodian genocide researcher says enough evidence exists for
</HEADLINE>
trial &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A researcher gathering evidence
against the Khmer Rouge said Sunday he believes enough
documentation exists to convict the communist guerrilla group's
leadership for war crimes and genocide committed during its brutal
four-year rule of Cambodia.
	   Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia,
said his center has selected 53 Khmer Rouge documents out of an
archive of more than 3,000 to be presented to a visiting team of
U.N. experts assessing the possibility of an international tribunal
against the Khmer Rouge.
	   ``We have plenty of information and have selected specifics
bearing the names of the leadership,'' Youk Chhang said.
	   ``I am not a lawyer, but as a survivor of the Khmer Rouge
genocide, I think it is enough,'' he said. ``But let the experts
and lawyers decide.''
	   Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia, and
American Stephen Ratner, an authority on international law and war
crimes, arrived in Phnom Penh on Saturday for a week-long visit.
	   The third member of the team, Rajsoomer Lallah, former chief
justice of Mauritius, is due in Phnom Penh on Monday.
	   The trio were appointed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in
July to assess existing evidence against top Khmer Rouge leaders,
held responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people by
execution, starvation and disease.
	   Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, co-prime ministers at the
time, wrote Kofi Annan in June 1997 requesting assistance in
bringing the Khmer Rouge to justice.
	   Supreme Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot escaped prosecution when he
died of an apparent heart attack in April, but many top members of
the guerrilla group are still alive and at large.
	   Former Khmer Rouge deputy prime minister Ieng Sary received
amnesty from the Cambodian government in 1996 after leading a
massive defection of rebel forces that crippled the movement. The
amnesty, however, did not cover indictments by an international
court.
	   One-legged Khmer Rouge army chief Ta Mok and ideological chief
Nuon Chea continue to lead a dwindling band of supporters against
the government in the mountainous jungles of the Thai-Cambodian
border. The group's nominal leader Khieu Samphan is with them, but
apparently against his will.
	   The reintegration of several top Khmer Rouge into the government
is seen as a potential stumbling block to a tribunal, but
government leaders have repeatedly insisted they are in favor of a
trial.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized control of Cambodia in 1975 as the
Vietnam War drew to a close. The Maoist rebels further devastated
their war-torn nation by forcing people out of cities and into
massive rural work camps in a failed attempt to create an agrarian
utopia.
	   An invading Vietnamese army ousted the Khmer Rouge from Phnom
Penh in 1979. Thousands of documents left behind by the fleeing
Khmer Rouge make up the bulk of evidence against the guerrillas.
	   Youk Chhang said some of the documents he has set aside for the
U.N. team connect both Ieng Sary and Nuon Chea to a gruesome
torture center set up in a Phnom Penh high school, Tuol Sleng.
	   Between 16,000 and 20,000 political prisoners are estimated to
have been tortured at Tuol Sleng and then killed. The prison was
turned into a museum after the Vietnamese invasion as a reminder of
the atrocities the Khmer Rouge committed against its own people.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A short time ago, Indonesia's armed
forces chief Gen. Wiranto was being hailed as a white knight for
promising to clean up the military's bad human rights record and
for supporting democratic change.
	   But after days of bloody student protests and outbreaks of
rioting in Jakarta, many on Sunday demanded that he quit.
	   At least 16 people have died during the past week of unrest,
including half a dozen students shot dead by troops and police when
thousands tried to march on Parliament against a special government
assembly. One of their key demands: get the military out of
politics.
	   The worst rioting erupted Friday night when security personnel
fired volleys of shots, as well as tear gas and water cannons, at
students over many hours.
	   Army and police chiefs insist their personnel had no live
ammunition and fired off only plastic bullets.
	   Nevertheless, this proved lethal at short range and the death
toll has angered many despite protestations from the authorities
that they were merely upholding the law.
	   ``Hang Wiranto!'' chanted students after they buried their dead.
	   ``Shock, grief, anger,'' was the headline in Sunday's Jakarta
Post newspaper.
	   ``As the highest person in the (armed forces) hierarchy, Wiranto
should take the blame for the violence. He must resign
immediately,'' said Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim leader and
opposition figure who plans to run for the presidency.
	   ``The security policy pursued by Gen. Wiranto was totally
irresponsible and has endangered the life of the nation,'' a group
of pro-democracy activists said in a statement.
	   Wiranto restored order to the streets of the capital of 11
million people on Sunday.
	   Armored personnel carriers and small tanks were stationed near
the state palace and thousands of troops stood guard at the
Parliament building and elsewhere across the city.
	   President B.J. Habibie has ordered Wiranto, who is also defense
minister, to take stern action against troublemakers who he says
tried to overthrow his 6-month-old government.
	   Wiranto's troops moved within a few hours to end the rioting on
Saturday - much quicker and more decisively than they did six
months ago during riots that resulted in 1,200 deaths and helped
force Habibie's authoritarian predecessor, former President
Suharto, to step down.
	   A government report into those riots was released last month. It
castigated the military's leadership and accused some army
personnel of doing nothing to stop the violence or even of
encouraging mobs to loot and burn. Other soldiers had demanded to
be paid to protect lives and property.
	   Wiranto shrugged off those allegations, but has yet to comment
on the latest wave of criticism.
	   Until now the 51-year-old career soldier looked unassailable.
	   Well educated and not tainted by corruption scandals like some
other senior generals, Wiranto has until recently enjoyed warm
reviews from Indonesia's media and among foreign diplomats. He has
even been touted as a possible future president.
	   Although a former military aide to Suharto, he is credited with
playing a pivotal role in convincing the old autocrat to quit after
May's riots.
	   Soon after that, he dismissed a son-in-law general of the
ex-president who has been blamed for abducting anti-government
activists in the dying months of Suharto's regime. He has
apologized for past human rights abuses.
	   As troops battled with students on Friday night, the People's
Consultative Assembly passed a decree that entrenches the
military's role in the 500-member Parliament, although reducing its
presence from 75 to 55 seats.
	   Even with his record tarnished by this week's carnage, the
survival of Habibie's government appears to depend largely on
Wiranto's support.

Japan: Anwar trial should be conducted with `due process'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan told Malaysia Sunday that it
expects the trial of fired Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim to be conducted with ``due process,'' a Japanese official
said.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told his Malaysian
counterpart, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, that Japan does not intend to
interfere in Malaysian internal politics but is interested in
Anwar's trial, according to a ministry official.
	   The official quoted Komura as saying Japan expects that due
process will be followed.
	   Abdullah responded that Malaysia intends to achieve a peaceful
and stable political situation in the country, said the official,
who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.
	   On Saturday night, police fired several shots in the air to
disperse about 3,000 people who were demonstrating in Kuala Lumpur,
demanding that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resign.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as deputy prime minister in early
September. Anwar was later arrested after he began calling for
Mahathir to step down. He currently is on trial on corruption and
sexual misconduct charges, allegations he denies and calls
politically motivated.
	   Abdullah and Komura are in Kuala Lumpur to attend meetings of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Albright uses APEC meetings to criticize Iraq's position
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with China opposing use of force
against Iraq. Pickup 7th graf pvs, `Albright will ...'
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told officials from China and other countries Sunday that
American forces are poised to attack Iraq, after rejecting its
proposal to resume weapons inspections.
	   However, China refused to support U.S. military action, and said
it was only willing to urge Iraq to reconsider its actions and
cooperate with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Albright, who arrived in Malaysia late Saturday to attend a
summit meeting on Asia's economic crisis, spent the night
discussing the U.S.-Iraq standoff on the telephone with top
American and U.N. officials, said her spokesman, James P. Rubin.
	   On Sunday, she began a series of meetings with top officials at
the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to explain
the U.S. position.
	   ``We are poised to act and we see no need for further
warnings,'' Rubin said at a news conference. ``She will say that
time and time again, Iraq has promised to come into compliance with
U.N. resolutions and broken that promise.''
	   During the first of her bilateral meetings, Albright told her
Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, that Iraq must back down, Rubin
said. Tang agreed that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is responsible
for the current crisis, said Rubin.
	   However, Tang told reporters afterward that China would not
support the use of force against Iraq.
	   ``The Chinese government is absolutely against the use of
force,'' he said. ``This is a very clear stand on this issue. It is
pointless to use force to resolve the current situation. The use of
force only results in making things complicated, and will make
things worse.''
	   Tang said his government had sent a letter to Iraq urging its
government to ``think carefully'' and restart talks immediately
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Albright will use her meetings with APEC officials to emphasize
that Saddam's offer to allow the inspectors to resume their
inspections contained too many conditions, Rubin said.
	   An Iraqi letter, addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
linked a resumption of inspections with ``a further chance to
achieve justice by lifting sanctions'' that the world imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Rubin called the letter ``a demand we regard as unacceptable.''
	   He said Albright also will use her visit to Malaysia to discuss
the Asian economic crisis and to meet with the wife of former
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired, then jailed and
put on trial after launching a reform movement opposing the
leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``I think the Malaysian government will understand the
significance of her (Albright) choosing that meeting,'' Rubin said,
adding that the secretary of state was not expected to hold any
private meetings with the Malaysian government.
	   ``We are here to discuss issues that APEC brought to Malaysia,
not the specifics of relations with Malaysia,'' Rubin said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who canceled his plan to travel to
the APEC summit because of the Iraq crisis, had not planned to meet
with Mahathir either because of U.S. concerns over Malaysia's
treatment of Anwar. The former official claims he was severely
beaten by prison guards when he was incarcerated before his trial.
	   Albright's plan to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, drew
strong rebukes Saturday from her Malaysian counterpart, Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi, who said Albright ``should not interfere in
Malaysia's affairs.''
	   The secretary of state's meeting with Azizah was intended to
express concern about ``the treatment of Anwar, the mistreatment in
prison and the importance we attach to due process during the
trial,'' Rubin said. He declined to say when the meeting would take
place. Albright was scheduled to leave Kuala Lumpur Tuesday.

Stewart fails again as England in trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart fell for
his third duck in four innings Sunday as the Ashes tourists
stumbled to a precarious position against Queensland.
	   While the team leader failed again, former captain Michael
Atherton was unable to field and did not open the innings because
of a stiff back.
	   After a good performance with the ball, England was left a
target of 142 to win the game. At stumps with one day to play it
was 74 for five wickets after Australian test aspirant Michael
Kasprowicz tore through the batting.
	   Stewart scored a half-century in England's first innings
following a pair of ducks in the draw against South Australia last
week. He missed the opening match against Western Australia.
	   The Cazaly Oval pitch was playing low and batting was difficult
_ 17 wickets fell for 208 runs Sunday _ giving England an uphill
task to make the further 68 needed. Mark Ramprakash is four and
Dean Headley is yet to score.
	   Queensland wrapped up England's first innings for 192 early
Sunday with limited-overs international player Adam Dale claiming
his best first class figures of 7-33 from 23 overs.
	   The hosts were then dismissed for 124 in their second innings as
opener Jimmy Maher scored 56.
	   Batting conditions did not improve in England's second innings
as Mark Butcher (0), Nasser Hussain (24), Stewart (0) and John
Crawley (4) were victims of the deliveries that barely rose above
shin height.
	   Stewart was one of four players out to lbw decisions while
Dominic Cork was bowled.
	   Cork opened the innings with Atherton, who has a history of back
trouble, on the sideline. Team manager David Lloyd said Atherton's
absence was ``only a precaution.''
	   Kasprowicz, who is hoping for a test recall when the Australian
team for Friday's opening match is named Monday, had 3-14 off seven
overs including all three wickets in the space of five balls.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ China said Sunday it is
``absolutely against'' using force against Iraq in a standoff over
its refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan announced his government's
opposition after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who said American forces were poised to attack Iraq.
	   Tang said China had sent a letter to Iraq urging its government
to ``think carefully'' and restart talks with U.N. officials.
	   However, he added, ``The Chinese government is absolutely
against the use of force. This is a very clear stand on this issue.
It is pointless to use force to resolve the current situation. The
use of force only results in making things complicated, and will
make things worse.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A short time ago, Indonesia's armed
forces chief Gen. Wiranto was being hailed as a white knight for
promising to clean up the military's bad human rights record and
for supporting democratic change.
	   But after days of bloody student protests and outbreaks of
rioting in Jakarta, many on Sunday demanded that he quit.
	   At least 16 people have died in the past week of unrest,
including half a dozen students shot by troops and police when
thousands tried to march on Parliament against a special government
assembly. One of their key demands: get the military out of
politics.
	   The worst rioting erupted Friday night when security personnel
fired volleys of shots, as well as tear gas and water cannons, at
students over many hours.
	   Army and police chiefs insist their personnel had no live
ammunition and fired only plastic bullets.
	   Nevertheless, this proved lethal at short range and the death
toll has angered many despite protestations from the authorities
that they were merely upholding the law.
	   ``Hang Wiranto!'' chanted students after they buried their dead.
	   ``Shock, grief, anger,'' was the headline in Sunday's Jakarta
Post newspaper.
	   ``As the highest person in the (armed forces) hierarchy, Wiranto
should take the blame for the violence. He must resign
immediately,'' said Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim leader and
opposition figure who plans to run for president.
	   ``The security policy pursued by Gen. Wiranto was totally
irresponsible and has endangered the life of the nation,'' a group
of pro-democracy activists said in a statement.
	   Wiranto restored order to the streets of the capital of 11
million people Sunday.
	   Armored personnel carriers and small tanks were stationed near
the state palace and thousands of troops stood guard at the
Parliament building and elsewhere across the city.
	   President B.J. Habibie has ordered Wiranto, who is also defense
minister, to take stern action against troublemakers who he says
tried to overthrow his 6-month-old government.
	   Wiranto's troops moved within a few hours to end the rioting
Saturday - much more quickly and decisively than they did six
months ago during riots that resulted in 1,200 deaths and helped
force Habibie's authoritarian predecessor, President Suharto, to
step down.
	   A government report into those riots was released last month. It
castigated the military's leadership and accused some army
personnel of doing nothing to stop the violence or even of
encouraging mobs to loot and burn. Other soldiers had demanded to
be paid to protect lives and property.
	   Wiranto shrugged off those allegations, but has yet to comment
on the latest wave of criticism.
	   Until now, the 51-year-old career soldier looked unassailable.
	   Well educated and not tainted by corruption scandals like some
other senior generals, Wiranto until recently has enjoyed warm
reviews from Indonesia's media and among foreign diplomats. He has
even been touted as a possible future president.
	   Although a former military aide to Suharto, he is credited with
playing a pivotal role in convincing the old autocrat to quit after
May's riots.
	   Soon after that, he dismissed a son-in-law general of the
ex-president who has been blamed for abducting anti-government
activists in the dying months of Suharto's regime. He has
apologized for past human rights abuses.
	   As troops battled with students Friday night, the People's
Consultative Assembly passed a decree that entrenches the
military's role in the 500-member Parliament, although reducing its
presence from 75 to 55 seats.
	   Even with his record tarnished by this week's carnage, the
survival of Habibie's government appears to depend largely on
Wiranto's support.
	   ``There's been a kind of understanding between the Habibie and
Wiranto. They both need each other,'' said Harold Crouch, an
Indonesian affairs expert at the Australian National University in
Canberra.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Cabinet ministers from Pacific Rim
countries feverishly tried to reach consensus Sunday on a trade
pact to lift tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in goods.
	   Japan and the United States remained deeply divided, however,
over a key provision of the pact.
	   Trade and foreign ministers from the 21-member Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meeting over the weekend in the Malaysia
capital hoped to conclude the pact for leaders of the APEC member
nations to sign during their summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Some diplomats said they expected a compromise by the end of the
day that would allow them to send the trade pact on to the World
Trade Organization in an effort to sell the tariff agreement to
more countries.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020. But that was before
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies,
began arguing over some provisions.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and
fish _ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

APEC ministers call for restraint in Indonesian unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Cabinet officials attending
meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum voiced
concern Sunday over protests in Indonesia that have left at least
16 people dead and called for restraint.
	   ``Of course, what happens in Indonesia will affect all of us,''
said Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon.
	   ``The number of casualties is growing and we certainly hope that
the Indonesian government can control the situation and maintain
stability,'' he said.
	   At least 16 people have died during a week of unrest in
Indonesia, including half a dozen students shot dead by troops and
police when thousands tried to march on Parliament against a
special government assembly.
	   Critics hold the military chief, Gen. Wiranto, responsible for
the student deaths.
	   ``We hope that everybody in Indonesia will work with appropriate
restraint,'' said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
	   ``It's clear that there's great concern about some people in the
military not acting with appropriate restraint yesterday, and that
has obviously exacerbated the political problem in Indonesia,'' he
said.
	   ``But we very much hope that the situation will claim down and
Jakarta can get back to normal,'' he added.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie still plans to attend the APEC
meetings in Kuala Lumpur later this week despite the riots, the
government said Saturday.
	   The APEC meetings are focusing on trade liberalization and on
ways to deal with the financial crisis that has hit countries in
the region including Indonesia.
	   Indonesia on Sunday signed a new letter of intent with the
International Monetary Fund which paves the way for the release of
around dlrs 1 billion of its assistance package for the country.
	   Overall, the IMF has pledged to assist Indonesia with about dlrs
11.3 billion to help it overcome its financial crisis. The IMF has
about dlrs 3.3 billion left of the total to disburse.
	   Downer said there were no formal discussions about Indonesia
Sunday morning at a meeting of APEC trade and foreign ministers,
but that he had discussed the situation in talks with other
officials.

Politics Taiwanese-style: Pressing the flesh as bottle rockets fly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) _ Smacking of a Las Vegas revue, smoke
machines and stirring orchestral music provide the sizzle while
opposition leader Lin Yi-hsiung works the stage.
	   One last time, his scratchy voice rising, he urges the audience
to send his candidates to the national legislature.
	   In sync, a soundman jerks the volume of the background music up.
The crowd roars in response _ ``Victory! Vote them in!'' _ drowning
out the sound of bottle rockets whizzing into the night sky.
	   This is politics, Taiwanese-style, and as the politicians push
toward Dec. 5 national elections, they reveal a young but robust
democracy where candidates still emphasize personal contact and
theatrics over television and print advertising.
	   Taiwan is still new at the game of electoral politics, and what
is evolving is a campaign culture that manages to combine modern
pizzazz with local tradition.
	   The elections will be just the third for the legislature and
second for the mayors of the capital, Taipei, and the big southern
city of Kaohsiung since the end of martial law in 1987.
	   This time, the voters could really make a difference if they
deny the ruling Nationalist Party a majority, forcing it to share
power with Lin's Democratic Progressive Party or other groups for
the first time.
	   The legislature is being expanded to 225 seats from 164, making
the campaign more intense and varied than ever.
	   Candidates drop to their knees to literally beg for votes at
mass rallies and outdoor banquets. A faction of Lin's party has
converted a campaign van to look like the Titanic, hoping to
capitalize on the movie's runaway success in Taiwan.
	   In a key race, Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, a member of Lin's
party, is locked in a nasty fight with Nationalist challenger Ma
Ying-jeou, nicknamed ``Sonny boy Ma'' for his youthful looks and
squeaky-clean image. Allegations of graft, whore-mongering and
treason have drowned out initial good government appeals from both
sides.
	   The outcome of the Taipei mayor's race could have broader
implications 16 months later, when Taiwan chooses a successor to
President Lee Teng-hui. Whichever party wins Taipei could carry a
strong advantage into the presidential race.
	   Politics take on a more populist hue in mostly semi-rural
southern Taiwan, the scene of a 1979 democracy protest and
dissident trial that forged a generation of opposition politicians.
Personal ties and political machines built around powerful families
trump party loyalty for many voters.
	   ``People down south are more emotional about politics, more
polarized, and supporters are more committed,'' says Joe Wu, a
political science professor at National Chengchi University.
``Politics there is more personal.''
	   The Democratic Progressive Party has shown growing strength
throughout the south, except for one key part _ Kaohsiung. That's
why Lin recently brought his roadshow to push five local
legislative candidates.
	   The rally resembled a country fair with food stalls, game booths
and families who brought their kids aboard scooters.
	   But on stage Lin was deadly serious, ditching Mandarin Chinese
for the earthy Taiwanese dialect.
	   Taiwanese nationalism always swells during elections, when many
candidates cast themselves as defenders of the native majority
against China and the Chinese who fled the mainland with Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists in 1949.
	   Political patronage has kept the Nationalists ensconced in
Kaohsiung despite the opposition's steady rise elsewhere. But with
public sentiment going against perceived corruption in the
Nationalist Party, the opposition hopes to do better.
	   One day after the Kaohsiung rally, Lin was stumping under a hot
sun at a county park in southernmost Pingtung. More candidates were
opening campaign offices, and the pungent smell of fireworks mixed
with the scent of fried noodles being dished up for supporters.
	   ``There's no better way to show sincerity than to be with the
voters,'' Lin said.

Myanmar foreign minister replaced in Cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
replaced the foreign minister and appointed a new deputy prime
minister in a Cabinet reshuffle, an official statement said Sunday.
	   The junta also gave five Supreme Court justices ``permission to
retire from duties,'' and appointed four new justices.
	   The changes came almost exactly a year after a major
restructuring of the country's administration, in which the junta
also changed its name from the State Law and Order Restoration
Council to the State Peace and Development Council.
	   In the new changes, effective Saturday, Foreign Minister Ohn
Gyaw was replaced by Win Aung, Myanmar's ambassador in London.
	   Ohn Gyaw, a career diplomat, had been appointed foreign minister
in September 1989. The official announcement said he was permitted
to retire from his duties. He is 68.
	   Meanwhile, the minister for military affairs, Lt. Gen. Tin Hla,
took on the additional post of deputy prime minister.
	   Transport Minister Lt. Gen. Tin Ngwe became a minister of the
Prime Minister's Office, and the transport portfolio went to
Minister for Industry-2 Maj. Gen. Hla Myint Swe. His former post
went to Tourism Minister Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin.
	   The shifts in the Supreme Court did not include the chief
justice, Aung Toe, who retains his post along with the chairmanship
of the National Convention Convening Work Committee, assigned to
guide the drafting of a new constitution.
	   There were also some changes among deputy ministers and members
of the civil services training board.
	   On Nov. 15, 1997, the 19-member State Peace and Development
Council was formed to replace the State Law and Order Restoration
Council and major changes were made in the Cabinet, a move that
seems to have been made to make it easier to purge ministers
suspected of corruption.
	   A major shift of high-ranking military personnel was carried out
at the same time.
	   The government said in a recent report on the country's
political situation that last year's changes indicated the military
regime regards itself as a transitional or a caretaker government
during a step-by-step transformation to democracy. The military has
ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962, and the present
junta seized power in 1988.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed to
reach an agreement on a massive trade pact to cut tariffs in nine
key industries, an official said Sunday.
	   Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum would now submit the trade proposal to
the World Trade Organization for resolution. The pact would lift
tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   Trade and foreign ministers from the 21-member APEC forum
meeting over the weekend in the Malaysia capital had hoped to
conclude the pact for APEC leaders to sign during their summit
Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``I think the financial crisis has had a chilling effect on the
package that we put together last year,'' said Marchi.
	   ``There's not enough of a critical mass here. So the package
essentially goes to the WTO, and ultimately to New Zealand,'' where
APEC leaders will meet next year, Marchi said.
	   APEC leaders in Vancouver, Canada, last year agreed to reduce
tariffs in nine sectors by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate
goal of free trade in the Pacific by 2020.
	   But that was before Japan and the United States, the world's two
largest economies, began arguing over some provisions.
	   Japan has refused to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas --
forestry products and fish -- at a time when its economy is in
recession.
	   The United States believes Japan had to be on board in all nine
sectors to give the pact weight. Washington has argued that it
would send a strong signal that Asia was not turning protectionist,
despite its worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   ``If Japan does not participate in those two sectors, then the
ministerial and heads-of-state meeting would be viewed as a failure
and Japan would be responsible for that failure,'' Deputy U.S.
Trade Representative Richard Fisher said in Washington two weeks
ago.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Guerrillas attack Israeli positions near border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars Sunday at Israeli border positions in southern Lebanon,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   A statement by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas said the
morning attacks were in response to daily Israeli air attacks on
South Lebanon for the past week.
	   It said the guerrillas targeted nine Israeli outposts in the
central and western sectors of an Israeli-occupied enclave in South
Lebanon, including military positions at Blatt and Abbad, both of
which are about 500 meters (yards) north of the border and inside
Lebanon.
	   It was not immediately clear of any shells overshot the border,
said the security officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Israel's army radio said explosions presumed to be mortar shells
were heard along Israel's northern border.
	   The Hezbollah statement said the attacks were ``in response to
recent Israeli aggression in the form of air raids on positions of
the Islamic resistance.''
	   Israeli planes have raided suspected Hezbollah positions on a
daily basis since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in casualties.
	   On Saturday, Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of
Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
occupied enclave.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and their
Lebanese militia allies from the enclave that Israel carved out in
in 1985 to protect against cross-border guerrilla raids.

China signs satellite launch agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Chinese state-run company has signed an
agreement to launch a communications satellite for Hong Kong's Asia
Satellite Telecommunication Co. Ltd., a Hong Kong newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   The Hong Kong Standard quoted Wang Liheng, vice president of
China Great Wall Industry Corp., as saying his company's agreement
with AsiaSat was signed Saturday.
	   The agreement provides for ``the reservation of a launch
opportunity for the launch of an AsiaSat satellite'' on a Long
March 3-B rocket from the Xichang Launch Center in southwestern
Sichuan province, Wang was quoted as saying.
	   The paper said Wang made the remarks while attending an
international aviation exhibition in the southern Chinese city of
Zhuhai.
	   The report did not give any date for the launching.
	   In China's first successful launch of a European-made satellite,
SinoSat-1 was placed into orbit in July by a Long March 3-B.
	   AsiaSat earns most of its revenue leasing satellite capacity to
broadcasters and other telecommunications providers in Asia.
AsiaSat's major shareholders include Britain's Cable and Wireless
and China International Trust and Investment Corp.

Three soldiers flee post, kill police officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three soldiers who escaped from a jail in
northwest Russia and allegedly killed a police officer were
recaptured Sunday, a news report said.
	   The three soldiers in the Sortavala region, 750 kilometers (465
miles) northwest of Moscow, disarmed their guard and sped away in a
stolen car Saturday evening, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   A manhunt for the deserters ensued, during which a section
commander with the local police department was fatally wounded,
ITAR-Tass said, without providing any other details about the
death.
	   The search party eventually surrounded the three soldiers and
detained them early Sunday morning.
	   Desertions and killings are relatively frequent in Russia's
army, where conditions are miserable, food is scarce, and younger
conscripts are subject to brutal hazing by officers and older
soldiers.
	   According to official figures, 50 soldiers were killed by their
fellow servicemen last year, and about 500 committed suicide.

Streets of Indonesian capital quiet after riots and protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Habibie comments &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie pledged tough
action against troublemakers, and troops ringed his palace and
Parliament Sunday after rioting and anti-government protests that
left at least 16 people dead.
	   Facing student demands for his ouster, Habibie said protesters
had been misinformed about his commitment to a democratic
transition in Indonesia. He also condemned mobs who looted, burned
buildings and cars and attacked police Saturday.
	   ``Demonstration must not mean burning houses or shops, killing
other people. That is not the aim of any kind of democracy,''
Habibie said in a television interview with Cable News Network that
was broadcast Sunday.
	   He said he had ordered military chief Gen. Wiranto ``to take
firm measures against whoever is doing things against the
constitution or doing criminal acts.''
	   On Sunday, civilians patrolled neighborhoods, some of them
closed off with barricades of trash carts and barbed wire, in fear
of an escalation of the violence that tore through parts of
Jakarta.
	   The unrest was the worst in the Indonesian capital since May,
when much heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat former
President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   There were no fresh reports Sunday of mob rioting, which erupted
after two days of deadly clashes between security forces and
students protesting for swifter democratic change. Student violence
so far has been largely confined to stone-throwing at riot
officers.
	   Shopkeepers swept up broken glass from smashed windows that had
been repaired recently in the wake of the May riots. The doors to
shopping malls were boarded up, but some street markets were open.
	   Warning of the possibility of more unrest, Australia urged its
citizens not to travel to Indonesia. Many foreign embassies told
their citizens to stay off the streets.
	   Students planned to resume protests Monday against Habibie, a
one-time protege of Suharto who is promising democratic reforms but
is suspected by opponents of maneuvering to stay in power.
	   In the CNN interview, Habibie praised the students as
Indonesia's ``future'' but said they had been fed ``garbage from an
information system that is doing things that are irresponsible.''
	   ``We have to be more pro-active in giving the students more
inside information and be patient,'' he said. ``The only thing to
control people is control them by convincing them.''
	   Students had confronted security forces during a meeting of the
nation's highest legislative body, which agreed to hold
parliamentary elections next year and take other steps to undo
Suharto's authoritarian legacy.
	   The 1,000-member assembly is expected to choose a new president
in December 1999, but Habibie said he was willing to step down
earlier if the assembly so decided after the general election.
	   ``They can have my chair,'' he said, laughing.
	   At its meeting last week, the People's Consultative Assembly
decided to gradually reduce the military's role in politics, rather
than ban it altogether as students demand. The armed forces have 75
seats in the 500-member Parliament.
	   After riot officers shot and killed students with plastic
bullets Friday, mobs and protesters vented their fury at the
military, shouting taunts and hurling stones at military vehicles.
Three security personnel were among the dead.
	   However, a presidential aide ruled out the possibility that
Habibie would ask for the resignation of Wiranto to appease
students who want the general's ouster.
	   ``It is unlikely that the president will fire Gen. Wiranto
because it is not his style,'' said the aide, Dewi Fortuna Anwar.
	   The riots were likely to further diminish investor confidence in
the world's fourth-most populous nation, which was hit hard by
Asia's financial meltdown and is still fighting its worst economic
crisis in decades.

Stewart fails again as England in trouble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS quotes, details; EDITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Former England captain Michael Atherton
is in doubt for the first test against Australia starting Friday,
while current leader Alec Stewart's horror run continued Sunday in
the final warm-up match.
	   Stewart fell for his third duck in four innings as the tourists
stumbled to a precarious position against Queensland.
	   While the team leader failed again, veteran opener Atherton was
unable to field and did not open the innings because of a stiff
back.
	   Team manager David Lloyd admitted Atherton was no certainty to
take his place in the first test against Australia starting Friday.
	   ``Getting close to the test match we will have to be fully aware
of monitoring him on a daily basis,'' Lloyd said.
	   After a good performance with the ball, England was left a
target of 142 to win the game. At stumps with one day to play it
was 74 for five wickets after Australian test aspirant Michael
Kasprowicz tore through the batting.
	   Stewart scored a half-century in England's first innings
following a pair of ducks in the draw against South Australia last
week. He missed the opening match against Western Australia.
	   The Cazaly Oval pitch was playing low and batting was difficult
_ 17 wickets fell for 208 runs Sunday _ giving England an uphill
task to make the further 68 needed. Mark Ramprakash is four and
Dean Headley is yet to score.
	   Queensland wrapped up England's first innings for 192 early
Sunday with limited-overs international player Adam Dale claiming
his best first class figures of 7-33 from 23 overs.
	   The hosts were then dismissed for 124 in their second innings as
opener Jimmy Maher scored 56.
	   Batting conditions did not improve in England's second innings
as Mark Butcher (0), Nasser Hussain (24), Stewart (0) and John
Crawley (4) were victims of the deliveries that barely rose above
shin height.
	   Stewart was one of four players out to lbw decisions while
Dominic Cork was bowled.
	   Cork opened the innings with Atherton, who has a history of back
trouble, on the sideline.
	   Kasprowicz, who is hoping for a test recall when the Australian
team for Friday's opening match is named Monday, had 3-14 off seven
overs including all three wickets in the space of five balls.
	   Lloyd said Butcher would likely open the innings in the first
test despite a horror run on tour of just nine runs from five
innings.
	   ``He's not scoring runs, we've had three preparation matches and
he has not featured in any of them but that's not to say he won't
feature in the test match _ he's got a rock solid, cast-iron
temperament,'' LLoyd said.

Iraq says a U.S. attack would be ``naked aggression''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms
inspectors means any attack carried out now by the United States
would amount to ``naked aggression'' without legal grounds, an
Iraqi official said Sunday.
	   The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the government of President Saddam Hussein was
reversing decisions taken in August and October to halt cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   U.S. President Clinton's National Security adviser, Sandy
Berger, described it as failing to meet American conditions by
being ``neither unequivocal nor unconditional'' and said a
punishing military strike remained an option.
	   The U.N. Security Council adjourned after five hours of
inconclusive discussion on Iraq's decision and scheduled a further
session on Sunday.
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting director of external information and
editor of the state-run Baghdad Observer, told AP Television News
that Iraq's letter ``deprived the United States of any pretext to
commit its aggression.''
	   He added: ``If they want to launch an aggression, it would be a
naked aggression without any political or legal justification.''
	   The United States apparently was concerned that a two-page
``annex'' to the letter, written by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, amounted to placing conditions on the return of the
inspectors. The Security Council had insisted they be allowed to
return unconditionally.
	   After the fuss arose, the Iraqi ambassador to the United
Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, wrote another letter saying the annex only
presents Iraq's views which ``are not linked to the clear and
unconditional decision'' by Iraq to welcome back the inspectors.
	   The annex outlined Iraq's expectations that a promised U.N.
Security Council review of its cooperation with the council's
resolutions would lead to easing or lifting trade sanctions imposed
to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit the sale of oil and other trade
dealings, have devastated the Iraqi economy and made the country's
22 million people dependent on U.N. relief.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until the
U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency
certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 sharply limited the work of the
inspection teams, but now has agreed to allow them to return ``to
perform their normal duties.''
	   Editorials Sunday in state-run newspapers said the United States
was seeking any opportunity to attack Iraq.
	   All front pages carried the text of the letter to Annan, along
with photos of Saddam meeting with his Revolutionary Command
Council and the leadership of the ruling Baath party, which
approved the letter.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper published by the Baath party, said
``the leadership's decision pulled the carpet out from under the
American administration, which continues to present misleading
information about Iraq ... and hunts continuously for opportunities
to start an aggression.''
	   It accused the United States of attempting to ``destabilize
security and safety in the region'' and ``blackmail'' Arab
countries to support its threats.
	   Babil, which is published by Saddam's son Odai, said the
American threats of a military strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a
cruel joke.''
	   The U.N. sanctions, the paper said, had made Iraqis ``a daily
target'' of the United States ``which made them suffer more than a
military attack.''

Indonesian marines cool fury of student protesters and street mobs

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ When a squad of navy marines in red
berets rolled up in a truck at Parliament, thousands of student
protesters reacted with clapping and cries of welcome, not
derision.
	   ``Long live the marines,'' they shouted, and hours later the
demonstrators dispersed, unwilling to confront the soldiers as they
filed in front of the iron gates to the legislature.
	   In several days of deadly unrest, a beloved division of
Indonesia's navy has emerged as a soothing influence in the jittery
capital, at times acting as a buffer between mobs and reviled army
and police units.
	   The green-uniformed marines, highly visible in the quiet streets
of Jakarta Sunday, defused much of the tension after mobs burned
cars and buildings and attacked police stations a day earlier.
	   Rioting erupted after security forces firing plastic bullets
killed at least five pro-democracy student activists Friday on
Jakarta's main boulevard.
	   The popularity of the navy dates from its loyalty decades ago to
Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, a nostalgic figure for many
people who loathe Suharto, the authoritarian former army general
who shunted him out of power in the 1960s.
	   In the tumult after Sukarno's ouster, marines and army units
battled in the streets of Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city
and home to the main naval base.
	   A suspicious Suharto kept a tight rein on navy commanders and
diminished their clout. As a result, the navy has been seen as less
cruel and corrupt than other military units handed the key job of
suppressing dissent during the Suharto era.
	   Suharto quit in May after riots far bigger than those that hit
Jakarta on Saturday. His successor, President B.J. Habibie, is
equally unpopular among pro-democracy students who want faster
reform than that promised by the government.
	   Today, there is no evidence of a split between the navy and
other military branches.
	   Marines, the navy's elite force, make up about half of the
100,000-strong military branch. The armed forces total 450,000,
including police.
	   The same rioters who chanted ``Killers'' and hurled rocks at
police trucks turned docile whenever navy marines arrived to hand
out water and mingle with the mobs.
	   In one area, marines joined with students to fend off angry
youths surging toward police and army officers. They let a mob
stone a shopping center, but stopped it from ransacking the
building. One squad invited neighborhood kids to clamber on to a
military truck.
	   At a protest early Saturday, a policeman accidentally shot and
wounded a marine in the leg.
	   ``Soldiers and police are corrupt killers. But the marines never
make mistakes,'' said Syamsudin, one of thousands of protesters who
tried in vain to advance on a police station.

Russia's military cannot endure conventional arms attack, says
</HEADLINE>
Lebed

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's armed forces can not fight a large-scale
war with conventional weapons and the country must maintain its
nuclear forces at all costs, presidential hopeful Alexander Lebed
said Sunday.
	   Lebed, a retired general who helped forge a peace deal in
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya, said cuts have robbed the
armed forces of much of their combat capability.
	   ``A dangerous critical mass is being accumulated, which is
inadmissible for any normal country,'' he told the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia's military, crippled by a chronic shortage of cash, has
fallen on hard times since the collapse of the Soviet Union. There
is little money to repair equipment, train soldiers, or modernize
aging technology.
	   Lebed, a presidential front runner who has decried the neglected
state of the military often in the past, said Russia must
concentrate on maintaining its nuclear stockpiles if it cannot
modernize other weapons.
	   ``The only thing for which Russia is respected in the world and
which makes us worthy partners in any talks is our strategic rocket
forces,'' Lebed said, according to the Interfax news agency. ``And
this asset must be preserved.''
	   Lebed's call echoed a recent statement by Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov, who said Russia must sink most of its military
funding in the construction of new nuclear missiles because it
doesn't have money for anything else.

Taiwan to push bailout packages at APEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Despite a lack of U.S. backing, Taiwan
will continue to push a bond proposal to help its Asian neighbors
at this week's meeting of Pacific Rim leaders in Kuala Lumpur, the
government's top economic planner said Sunday.
	   The support of only a few nations is needed for the adoption of
a plan to back bonds issued by countries badly affected by the
Asian economic crisis, Chiang Pin-kung told reporters prior to his
departure for the Malaysian capital.
	   The bailout plan would draw funds from well-off countries,
private investors and lending institutions to collateralize and
repackage bonds already issued by ailing countries, allowing them
to raise more on the international bond market.
	   Taiwan is willing to invest up to U.S. dlrs 250 million, or
one-quarter of the total amount to be raised for the task, Chiang
said.
	   Taiwan's proposal has reportedly already met with criticism from
the United States, which is pushing its own plan to guarantee bonds
issued by stricken countries that is similar to a proposal made by
Taiwan earlier this year.
	   But Chiang said Malaysia has already expressed strong interest
in receiving aid under the latest Taiwanese proposal, and more
nations could follow. To make it work though, Taiwan needs the
support of countries such as the United States and Japan, which
have money to invest.
	   Taiwan has been pushing efforts to aid stricken countries as a
means of strengthening ties with Southeast Asia.
	   Chiang is attending the APEC leaders conference in place of
President Lee Teng-hui because, although Taiwan is one of the
forum's 21 members, China objects to its head of state attending
the summits. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must
be isolated internationally.
	   In addition to the leaders meeting on Nov. 17-18, Chiang has
also arranged for one-on-one sessions with the heads of government
of Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore.
	   Buoyed by a healthy banking system, more than U.S. dlrs 80
billion in foreign currency reserves and virtually no government
debt, Taiwan has survived the regional collapse in markets and
currencies better than most. A drastic drop in exports, though, has
created cash flow problems for many companies.

APEC officials fail to approve trade pact

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After four days of negotiations,
Pacific Rim nations failed Sunday to overcome Japanese objections
to a landmark agreement designed to further open world markets in
the midst of Asia's worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   Japan's refusal to cut tariffs in two sensitive areas of its
economy, fishing and forestry, derailed the talks, placing Tokyo at
odds with the United States, the key advocate of the proposed
free-trade agreement, officials said.
	   In other developments Sunday, the 21-nation Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit was nearly sidelined by America's
efforts to gain widespread support for a possible military attack
on Iraq for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   And demonstrators hit the streets for the second day running,
demanding the resignation of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and siding with Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir fired his deputy and finance minister, then had him
jailed after Anwar led a reform movement.
	   Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said the APEC forum had
failed to reach an agreement slashing tariffs in nine key
industries worth dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   Instead of having the 21 leaders approve the pact during their
summit Tuesday and Wednesday, they will now submit the trade
proposal to the World Trade Organization for resolution, he said.
	   ``I think the financial crisis has had a chilling effect on the
package that we put together last year,'' said Marchi.
	   ``There's not enough of a critical mass here. So the package
essentially goes to the WTO, and ultimately to New Zealand,'' where
APEC leaders will meet next year, he said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had been scheduled to leave
Washington late Saturday for the APEC summit. He decided to send
Vice President Al Gore in his place so the president could deal
with the Iraq crisis at home.
	   Clinton regretted the decision because he ``has taken a personal
interest in the Asian financial crisis and has pushed all around
him to be imaginative and to look for a solution and new ideas,''
said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived in
Kuala Lumpur late Saturday night.
	   Mahathir said he regretted Clinton would not attend the APEC
summit, saying he would have liked the American president to see
for himself that the streets of the capital were calm.
	   But another protest erupted in the city soon after the speech by
Mahathir, who has become famous for the capital controls he has
used to stabilize Malaysia's markets.
	   Riot police sprayed water cannons to break up a noisy protest by
200 people demanding Mahathir's resignation. On Saturday night,
3,000 people demonstrated in another area of the city, and marched
toward the hotel where the U.S. delegation is staying, screaming
``Clinton, save us from Mahathir!'' Several undercover policemen
fired shots in the air, but no serious injuries were reported.
	   Protesters have been calling for Mahathir's ouster since he
fired and later jailed Anwar, his one-time protege.
	   In a speech Sunday to international business leaders attending a
meeting on the sidelines of the APEC forum, Mahathir took aim at
Clinton over the standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I'd always hoped we could settle such problems with
negotiations,'' Mahathir said. ``Iraq is not an easy country, but
lobbing bombs and grenades will not do anything to solve this
problem.''
	   China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, also refused to support
U.S. military action, saying China was only willing to urge Iraq to
reconsider its actions and cooperate with the U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Other top APEC officials said they hoped the U.S.-Iraq showdown
would not overshadow the summit.
	   ``The situation in Iraq could take ... focus away from the
attention that we have on the resolution of the economic crisis in
the region,'' said Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
``Resources could be diverted there, so it affects everybody.''
	   Mahathir has had to face many setbacks surrounding the economic
summit that was supposed to showcase his leadership and the
enormous economic progress in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have said they
would refuse the customary courtesy calls on the host of the APEC
summit, angered by the treatment given Anwar
	   Anwar is currently on trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges, which he denies and calls politically motivated.
	   Foreign officials, including Albright, have said they plan to
meet with Anwar's wife to discuss the case, particularly his
apparent beating while in jail.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy invited Anwar's wife to
lunch on Saturday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police on Sunday sprayed
water cannons to break up a noisy protest by 200 people in front of
the world's tallest buildings.
	   The protesters were demanding the resignation of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Many of the protesters ran for shelter into areas around Kuala
Lumpur's Petronas Towers, the twin skyscrapers symbolizing
Malaysia's once-booming economy. Police arrested at least a
half-dozen people.
	   A day earlier, more than 3,000 Mahathir opponents marched
against his 17-year leadership. Asia's longest-serving ruler has
been coming under increasing pressure at home.
	   He has defiantly resisted demands for change, and has become
increasingly outspoken before a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum a Pacific Rim summit meeting on Tuesday and
Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Before police moved in Sunday afternoon, the anti-government
protesters held up banners demanding freedom for Anwar Ibrahim, the
former Malaysian deputy prime minister who is now in jail while
standing trial on abuse of power and sexual misconduct charges.
	   They also unfurled banners that read, ``Down with Mahathir,''
and shouted ``Long live Anwar!''
	   Police then fired water laced with a yellow dye at the
demonstrators, breaking up the protest. Plainclothes policemen
rushed into a nearby building looking for protesters stained
yellow.
	   Earlier Sunday, in a separate protest also near the Twin Towers,
about 400 activists closed their People's Summit with a peaceful
rally aimed at promoting social issues.
	   The activists want the government leaders at the summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group to include those
items on their agenda.
	   ``The people united will never be defeated,'' the demonstrators
chanted.
	   Some of the activists held up banners demanding an end to
``military aggression'' in neighboring riot-torn Indonesia.
	   Cars driving past, on one of Kuala Lumpur's main boulevards,
honked their horns to show support.
	   The People's Summit drew more than 600 participants from 30
countries.

Iraq says a U.S. attack would be ``naked aggression''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms
inspectors means any attack carried out by the United States would
amount to ``naked aggression'' without legal grounds, an Iraqi
official said Sunday.
	   The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the government of President Saddam Hussein was
reversing decisions taken in August and October to halt cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   President Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser, Sandy
Berger, described it as failing to meet American conditions by
being ``neither unequivocal nor unconditional'' and said a
punishing military strike remained an option.
	   The U.N. Security Council adjourned late Saturday after five
hours of inconclusive discussion and scheduled a further session on
Sunday.
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting director of external information and
editor of the state-run Baghdad Observer, told Associated Press
Television News that Iraq's letter ``deprived the United States of
any pretext to commit its aggression.''
	   ``If they want to launch an aggression, it would be a naked
aggression without any political or legal justification,'' he said.
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded neighboring
Kuwait in 1990, sparking war in the Persian Gulf. They limit the
sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated the Iraqi
economy.
	   The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be lifted
until the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Editorials Sunday in state-run newspapers said the United States
was seeking any opportunity to attack Iraq.
	   All front pages carried the text of the letter to Annan, along
with photos of Saddam meeting with his Revolutionary Command
Council and the leadership of the ruling Baath party, which
approved the letter.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper published by the Baath party, said
``the leadership's decision pulled the carpet out from under the
American administration, which continues to present misleading
information about Iraq ... and hunts continuously for opportunities
to start an aggression.''
	   It accused the United States of attempting to ``destabilize
security and safety in the region'' and ``blackmail'' Arab
countries to support its threats.
	   Babil, which is published by Saddam's son Odai, said the
American threats of a military strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a
cruel joke.''

Sosa homer helps major leaguers rebound for 9-8 victory

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa and Jason Giambi hit back-to-back home
runs in the fifth inning Sunday, helping a team of Major League
stars rebound from a 7-2 deficit and beat their Japanese
counterparts 9-8.
	   With the victory, the Major League team ended a seven-game
series against the Japanese stars with a 5-2 record.
	   ``I wish we could play a couple of more games,'' said Sosa, who
hit 66 homers during the regular season, breaking Roger Maris'
single-season record of 61 but trailing the 70 of Mark McGwire.
	   He said he was getting to feel comfortable in the all-stars
group, and ``I want to give the Japanese people a good show.''
	   The Chicago Cubs outfielder hit a homer in his first at-bat in
Japan, a warm-up against Tokyo's Yomiuri Giants, but then did not
hit another until a three-run shot that helped the major leaguers
win 9-0 Saturday.
	   Still, he was named most valuable player of the series.
	   After the homers by Sosa and Oakland Athletics shortstop Giambi
off starter Satoru Komiyama of the Chiba Lotte Marines narrowed
Japan's lead to 7-5, Atlanta Braves catcher Javier Lopez singled
home the go-ahead run in the seventh.
	   The major leaguers went ahead 9-7 when Toronto first baseman
Carlos Delgado scored from third on a fielder's choice in the
eighth.
	   Japan narrowed the gap to 9-8 in the bottom of the eighth when
Kazuo Matsui of the Seibu Lions reached second on a throwing error
and scored from third on Orix BlueWave outfielder Ichiro Suzuki's
grounder to second.
	   Brett Tomko of the Cincinnati Reds, who relieved the New York
Mets' Al Leiter in the fourth, was the winning pitcher. The
Japanese had 10 hits, against 13 by the visitors.
	   ``I'm very satisfied with the performance of our team,'' said
U.S. manager Mike Hargrove of the Cleveland Indians. ``After this
series I have a deeper appreciation of Japanese baseball.''

Musashimaru suffers second defeat, Kotonishiki leading with 8-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru
suffered his second defeat, and lower-ranked Kotonishiki remained
the only undefeated wrestler Sunday, eighth day of the 15-day
Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Trailing No. 12 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kotonishiki at 7-1
were yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana and No. 9 maegashira
Tosanoumi.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, was propelled around, then
tripped at the ring's edge as he struggled for a hold on No. 2
maegashira Kaiho's belt. It was Kaiho's his first victory after
seven losses.
	   Musashimaru is now tied at 6-2 with yokozuna Takanohana, ozeki
Takanonami and komusubi (junior champion second class) Musoyama.
	   Wakanohana, seeking his sixth tournament title, grabbed
Musoyama's belt and threw him off the elevated ring.
	   Kotonishiki bulldozed out No. 15 maegashira Oikari (3-5), and
Tosanoumi did the same to No. 11 maegashira Kotoryu (4-4).
	   Takanohana, who has won 20 tournaments, shoved out No. 4
maegashira Toki (3-5).
	   Takanonami tossed down No. 4 maegashira Tamakasuga (5-3) with an
overarm throw.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan (3-5), or Mongolian Batbayar
Davaa, pulled No. 10 maegashira Asanosho (2-6) off his feet.
	   Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, who is No. 2-ranked
in juryo, just below the senior division of makuuchi, was pushed
out by No. 14 maegashira Mitoizumi (4-4).
	   Kyokutenho, who is now 3-5, is among the top-ranked wrestlers in
the 26-member juryo division assigned to wrestle in makuuchi
because of yokozuna Akebono's absence. The Hawaiian-born yokozuna,
or Chad Rowan, is sitting out the tournament with a leg injury.
	   In a regular juryo bout, No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine
Imach Marcelo Salomon, was pushed out by No. 13-ranked
Hokutohikari, leaving both at 4-4.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 11-ranked Wakaazuma,
or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, was slapped down by No. 13-ranked
Tochinofuji for his second defeat against two victories. No.
56-ranked Kyokutenzan (2-2), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, shoved
out No. 54-ranked Gokokuyama.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 47-ranked
Azumakaze, or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, pushed out No.
45-ranked Hamaarashi. Azumakaze is also 2-2.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Jailed rebel leaders suggests U.N. send peacekeepers to East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Imprisoned East Timorese guerrilla
leader Xanana Gusmao has suggested that the United Nations send
peacekeepers to the trouble half-island territory as part of
program for independence, a report said Sunday.
	   In an interview published in The Jakarta Post newspaper, Gusmao
outlined a 3 1/2- to 4 1/2-year timetable for self-determination
for East Timor, a former Portuguese colony invaded in 1975 by
Indonesia, which annexed it the following year.
	   Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence in a Jakarta prison for
fighting Indonesian troops.
	   He said six to 18 months would be needed for the withdrawal of
Indonesian troops and East Timorese guerrilla forces and the
disarmament of various paramilitary groups.
	   During that time, an East Timorese police should be set up as
part of ``a possible deployment of peacekeeping forces,'' he said.
	   A second period of three years would be needed for ``national
reconciliation.'' During this time, the public should be given
political education, East Timor's administration should be rebuilt
and a national census conducted, he said.
	   East Timor has been wracked by two decades of guerrilla warfare
and human rights abuses.
	   The U.N. is currently sponsoring talks on East Timor's future
between Indonesia and Portugal.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant a form of autonomy to East Timor,
but has ruled out full independence. It also has rejected demands
by separatists that a referendum be conducted on its future.
	   Xanana, however, was adamant that East Timorese should be
allowed to vote.
	   ``Isn't it wise to ask a servant if he or she wants freedom?''
he asked in the interview.
	   He rejected claims by the Indonesian government that a
referendum would open deep divisions among East Timorese who are
pro- and anti-independence.

Israel denounces Arafat's renewed threat to declare a state in May
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday
appealed for Israelis to accept a Palestinian state as a ``bridge
of love and peace,'' but an Israeli official denounced the renewed
calls for declaring a state next May.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, warned that a move to establish a state without
negotiation next May would prompt Israel to annex areas of the West
Bank it now holds.
	   ``We are supposed to continue negotiating until we reach an
agreement about what we call the final status between the two
peoples. If the negotiations do not continue, and if an arbitrary,
unilateral action is taken by the Palestinians, it will render
these agreements null and void,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   In such an event, Bar-Illan said Israel would incorporate areas
under its control.
	   The wrangling over Palestinian statehood came as U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross tried to get both sides to implement the Wye River
memorandum, which calls for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank in exchange for stepped up Palestinian security
measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on
Sunday, and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were scheduled to
confer later in the day.
	   Under pressure from the United States and Israel to soft-peddle
calls for statehood, Arafat renewed his calls with a twist - an
attempt to sell the idea to Israelis as an avenue to trade and
normalization.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   ``I want to repeat for them that the coming Palestinian state is
going to work to strengthen more and more the peace and will be the
bridge of love and cooperation between the nations which live in
this area,'' Arafat said.
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Arafat made a similar threat to establish a Palestinian state at
a rally in the West Bank town of Nablus on Saturday, the tenth
anniversary of his declaration of independence for Palestinians.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, the time table for implementing
the land-for-security accord has been delayed.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu called Arafat and told him there would
be a delay because of what has happened since the Wye summit last
month and the need for approval by the Israeli Knesset, which opens
a two-day debate on Monday.
	   ``There will be a few days delay in the withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from these areas,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated
Press.
	   He added that the first group of Palestinian prisoners would be
set free about the time Israel carries out a withdrawal from two
percent of the West Bank.
	   Jewish settlers were scheduled to get their first look at
official maps of the planned withdrawal on Sunday in a meeting with
the four-member Cabinet team overseeing the drafting of the maps.

Indonesia signs new letter of intent with IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has signed a new letter of
intent with the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for the
release of another dlrs 1 billion in aid, the government said
Sunday.
	   IMF officials said Indonesia has made progress in overcoming its
economic crisis but needs to move ahead rapidly with bank
restructuring and boosting development spending.
	   The agreement was prepared before a wave of deadly protests and
riots in the streets of Jakarta late last week. In the deal, the
IMF and Indonesia said they expected deflation in November and
December and that inflation for 1998 could fall below a previous
estimate of 80 percent.
	   In 1999, the government and the IMF, said they expect inflation
to fall toward 10 percent.
	   Overall, the IMF has pledged dlrs 11.3 billion to help Indonesia
overcome its financial crisis, as long as Indonesia continues to
make progress on economic and structural reforms.
	   The IMF has about dlrs 3.3 billion left of the total amount to
disburse, and other international donors and nations are funneling
in billions of dollars more.
	   The IMF agreement reiterated that the economy would contract 15
percent this year and anticipated ``modest growth during
1999-2000.''

APEC ministers fail to reach agreement on trade pact

 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with APEC ministers' final statement
forwarding the tariff pack to the World Trade Organization. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed on
Sunday to reach an agreement on the terms a massive trade pact to
cut tariffs in nine key industries.
	   The 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
said they would now submit the trade proposal to the World Trade
Organization for resolution. The pact would lift tariffs on dlrs
1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   Trade and foreign ministers from the APEC meeting over the
weekend in the Malaysia capital had hoped to conclude the pact for
APEC leaders to sign during their summit meeting Tuesday and
Wednesday. But the leaders will now be requested to approve a
ministers' statement asking the WTO to try to do that instead.
	   ``I think the financial crisis has had a chilling effect on the
package that we put together last year,'' said Canadian Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi.
	   ``There's not enough of a critical mass here. So the package
essentially goes to the WTO, and ultimately to New Zealand,'' where
APEC leaders will meet next year, Marchi said.
	   APEC leaders in Vancouver, Canada, last year agreed to reduce
tariffs in nine sectors by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate
goal of free trade in the Pacific by 2020.
	   But that was before Japan and the United States, the world's two
largest economies, began arguing over some provisions.
	   Japan has refused to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _
forestry products and fish _ at a time when its economy is in its
worst recession since World War II.
	   The United States believed that Japan had to be on board in all
nine sectors to give the pact weight. Washington had argued that it
would send a strong signal that Asia was not turning protectionist,
despite its worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   ``If Japan does not participate in those two sectors, then the
ministerial and heads-of-state meeting would be viewed as a failure
and Japan would be responsible for that failure,'' Deputy U.S.
Trade Representative Richard Fisher had said in Washington two
weeks ago.
	   Nevertheless, the Philippines foreign minister, Domingo Siazon,
said it was unfair to characterize the lack of an agreement as a
failure. ``What you cannot finalize here, you pass onto the WTO,''
Siazon said.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan also refused to call the
trade pact a setback because Japan was not fully on board.
	   ``In the spirit of realism, APEC has reached a decision that
everybody can live with,'' he said. ``We will have to count on it
as another success that we can build on at the next APEC meeting.''
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Guerrillas attack Israeli positions near border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli army comment, Hezbollah claiming more
attacks

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars Sunday at Israeli positions in southern Lebanon along the
border with the Jewish state, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A statement by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas said the
morning attacks were in response to daily Israeli air attacks on
South Lebanon for the past week.
	   It said the guerrillas targeted 11 outposts belonging to Israeli
troops and their South Lebanon Army militia allies in the central
and western sectors of an Israeli-occupied enclave in South
Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah and the security officials, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said the targets included military
positions in the Lebanese village of Blatt and Abbad, both about
500 meters (yards) north of the Israeli border.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the guerrilla
shelling damaged an Israeli post in the western sector of the
enclave but that none of the shells overshot the border.
	   ``Following a survey of the area, no remains of shells were
found in Israeli areas,'' the spokesman said.
	   Israel's army radio said explosions presumed to be mortar shells
were heard along Israel's northern border.
	   The Hezbollah statement said the attacks were ``in response to
recent Israeli aggression in the form of air raids on positions of
the Islamic resistance.''
	   Israeli planes have raided suspected Hezbollah positions on a
daily basis since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in casualties.
	   On Saturday, Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of
Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
occupied enclave.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and their SLA
militia allies from the enclave that Israel carved out in in 1985
to protect against cross-border guerrilla raids.

Malaysia's crackdown against illegal immigrants begins Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia planned to start a
crackdown Monday against illegal immigrants, after the Sunday
midnight end of an amnesty allowing them to go home voluntarily.
	   The two-month amnesty was to have ended Oct. 31, but was
extended until Nov. 15 because of congestion at ports where
thousands of illegal immigrants converged to board ferries for
Indonesia.
	   A majority of the illegal aliens in the country are Indonesians.
	   Aseh Che Mat, director general of immigration, said his
department would focus its enforcement raids on employers who still
hire illegal immigrants after the end of the amnesty.
	   From Aug. 31 to Oct. 31, a total of 141,806 illegal immigrants
had returned to their native countries.
	   Of that number, 123,548 were from Indonesia, 8,937 from
Bangladesh, 3,191 from India, 2,662 from the Philippines and 1,049
from Myanmar.
	   Most of the illegal immigrants worked in the plantation and
construction sectors.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli said on Oct. 31 that more than
400,000 immigrants were still in the country, both legally and
illegally.
	   Those without work permits face arrest and deportation.
	   But before they are deported they will be fined 3,000 ringgit
(dlrs 750).
	   During Asia's boom years, Malaysia invited millions of foreign
workers to build its modern cityscapes. Now, with rising
unemployment and a plunging economy, they are no longer welcome.
	   At the height of Malaysia's economic prosperity and construction
boom, 700 Indonesian workers illegally sneaked into the country
every day.

Expressway named for Syrian President Assad opened in Beirut

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Sunday
opened a highway in Beirut named after Syrian President Hafez
Assad, saying it was a token of appreciation to the Syrian leader.
	   ``Lebanon will not forget President Assad,'' Hariri said at an
official ceremony to inaugurate the four-kilometer (2.5-mile) Hafez
Assad Avenue running from the city to near Beirut International
Airport and designed to ease traffic to the airport.
	   ``The avenue we are inaugurating today crowned with the name of
President Assad is a symbol of the appreciation, gratitude and
loyalty that Lebanon, all of Lebanon, holds to he who stood by its
side during hardships,'' Hariri said.
	   Assad, whose army maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon, is
regarded as the guarantor of the agreement that ended Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war. However, many Lebanese resent Assad's virtual
control over political decision-making in the country.
	   Beirut media put the cost of the Assad highway at dlrs 38
million, which was financed by the agency rebuilding the country
after the civil war. Final touches, including sidewalks, lighting
and traffic signs, were completed last week.

Thai banker predicts 5.2 percent economic growth next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A prominent Thai banker has forecast
that Thailand's economy will expand by 5.2 percent in 1999,
rebounding from a contraction of 7.4 percent projected this year.
	   The forecast by Olarn Chaipravat, president of Siam Commercial
Bank, is one of the most optimistic since Thailand began showing
signs recently of pulling out of its economic slump, the Bangkok
Post reported Sunday.
	   Olarn, citing a report from his bank's research department, said
the growth would be driven by a stable baht, lower inflation and
government measures to stimulate the economy, it added.
	   Thailand's economy plummeted after a business downturn triggered
a meltdown of the financial sector last year, due to a mountain of
bad debt.
	   Generally, economists have been predicting economic growth of
about 1 percent for Thailand in 1999.
	   Olarn forecast that the economy would contract 3.8 percent for
the first quarter of next year, then show growth in the final three
quarters of 1.2 percent, 9.6 percent and 14.6 percent.
	   He said he expected inflation next year to be close to zero,
after a projected rate of 8.1 percent this year.
	   The forecast also hinges on increased deficit spending by the
government, he indicated.

Israel denounces Arafat's renewed threat to declare a state in May
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday
appealed for Israelis to accept a Palestinian state as a ``bridge
of love and peace,'' but an Israeli official denounced the renewed
calls for declaring a state next May.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, warned that a move to establish a state without
negotiation next May would prompt Israel to annex areas of the West
Bank it now holds.
	   ``We are supposed to continue negotiating until we reach an
agreement about what we call the final status between the two
peoples. If the negotiations do not continue, and if an arbitrary,
unilateral action is taken by the Palestinians, it will render
these agreements null and void,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   In such an event, Bar-Illan said Israel would incorporate areas
under its control.
	   The wrangling over Palestinian statehood came as U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross tried to get both sides to implement the Wye River
memorandum, which calls for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank in exchange for stepped up Palestinian security
measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on
Sunday, and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were scheduled to
confer later in the day.
	   Under pressure from the United States and Israel to soft-peddle
calls for statehood, Arafat renewed his calls with a twist - an
attempt to sell the idea to Israelis as an avenue to trade and
normalization.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   ``I want to repeat for them that the coming Palestinian state is
going to work to strengthen more and more the peace and will be the
bridge of love and cooperation between the nations which live in
this area,'' Arafat said.
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Arafat made a similar threat to establish a Palestinian state at
a rally in the West Bank town of Nablus on Saturday, the tenth
anniversary of his declaration of independence for Palestinians.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, the time table for implementing
the land-for-security accord has been delayed.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu called Arafat and told him there would
be a delay because of what has happened since the Wye summit last
month and the need for approval by the Israeli Knesset, which opens
a two-day debate on Monday.
	   ``There will be a few days delay in the withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from these areas,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated
Press.
	   He added that the first group of Palestinian prisoners would be
set free about the time Israel carries out a withdrawal from two
percent of the West Bank.
	   Jewish settlers were scheduled to get their first look at
official maps of the planned withdrawal on Sunday in a meeting with
the four-member Cabinet team overseeing the drafting of the maps.

Study: Taiwanese turning increasingly to foreign brides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese farmers and fishermen are
increasingly looking abroad to find spouses, changing the
complexion of many of the island's rural communities, an academic
study reported Sunday.
	   Numbers of foreign brides, almost all from Southeast Asia, have
exploded over the past four years and now surpass 40,000, said Hsia
Shao-chuan, a professor at Shih Hsin University.
	   Brides from Indonesia number more than 10,000, followed by
another 30,000 from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and the
Philippines, the newspaper United Evening News quoted Hsia as
saying.
	   Many of the Indonesian brides are overseas Chinese of the Hakka
minority, and settle easily into Hakka communities in Taiwan, she
said. Other couples experience greater cultural and language
problems, though little study has been done into those issues, she
added.
	   Spurned by Taiwanese women who prefer to marry later and live in
Taiwan's cities, farmers and fishermen say finding an overseas
bride anxious to live in relatively affluent Taiwan is often their
only option for marriage. Some fishing communities in southern
Pingtung County have streets where virtually every household
includes a bride from abroad, Hsia said.
	   Signs of their presence can be seen in growing church
communities and specialty stores that offer foods, books, music and
magazines from home.

Guerrillas attack Israeli positions near border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli army comment, Hezbollah claiming more
attacks

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars Sunday at Israeli positions in southern Lebanon along the
border with the Jewish state, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A statement by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas said the
morning attacks were in response to daily Israeli air attacks on
South Lebanon for the past week.
	   It said the guerrillas targeted 11 outposts belonging to Israeli
troops and their South Lebanon Army militia allies in the central
and western sectors of an Israeli-occupied enclave in South
Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah and the security officials, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said the targets included military
positions in the Lebanese village of Blatt and Abbad, both about
500 meters (yards) north of the Israeli border.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the guerrilla
shelling damaged an Israeli post in the western sector of the
enclave but that none of the shells overshot the border.
	   ``Following a survey of the area, no remains of shells were
found in Israeli areas,'' the spokesman said.
	   Israel's army radio said explosions presumed to be mortar shells
were heard along Israel's northern border.
	   The Hezbollah statement said the attacks were ``in response to
recent Israeli aggression in the form of air raids on positions of
the Islamic resistance.''
	   Israeli planes have raided suspected Hezbollah positions on a
daily basis since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in casualties.
	   On Saturday, Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of
Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
occupied enclave.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and their SLA
militia allies from the enclave that Israel carved out in in 1985
to protect against cross-border guerrilla raids.

U.N. delays return of relief workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has delayed returning
its relief workers to Baghdad because of continuing debate in the
U.N. Security Council over the weapons inspection crisis, a U.N.
official said Sunday.
	   There had been reports from New York on Saturday that the 150
U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated last week to the Jordanian
capital Amman would begin moving back here on Sunday.
	   But the Security Council was unable to conclude its discussions
on Iraq's offer to renew cooperation with the weapons inspectors,
and a further session was scheduled Sunday.
	   ``Because of the extended deliberations in the Security Council,
it has been decided that the staff should remain in Amman for the
time being,'' U.N. spokesman Eric Falt told reporters. ``Of course,
we are anxious to have them return as soon as possible and to
return to full operations as soon as possible.''
	   The evacuations last Wednesday and Thursday reduced the U.N.
relief staff in Baghdad to about 55 people. An additional 230 U.N.
humanitarian workers remain in the north supervising aid to Iraqi
Kurds.
	   They monitor the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program. It is an
exception from U.N. sanctions that allows Iraq to sell limited
amounts of crude oil to buy needed food and medicine.
	   The food is distributed as monthly rations to Iraq's 22 million
people.
	   The program also was set back with the British-headquartered
Lloyds Register evacuated its workers. Lloyds must certify incoming
shipments at border points or suppliers don't get paid.
	   ``The United Nations is concerned by the implications of the
absence of personnel at the four border points, and we are in touch
with our parties to find a solution either through Lloyds or
through other venues,'' Falt said.
	   He said lines of trucks were forming at the Zakho border entry
point from Turkey.
	   More than half of food shipments come in at Iraq's southern port
of Umm Kasr, Falt said. They also enter at Trabil on the Jordanian
border and Al-Waleed on the Syrian border, he said.
	   He said there were no signs of shortages and that food
distribution was continuing smoothly. U.N. food stocks are ``fairly
satisfactory,'' he added.

Iraq says a U.S. attack would be ``naked aggression''

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms
inspectors means any attack carried out by the United States would
amount to ``naked aggression'' without legal grounds, an Iraqi
official said Sunday.
	   The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the government of President Saddam Hussein was
reversing decisions taken in August and October to halt cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   President Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser, Sandy
Berger, described it as failing to meet American conditions by
being ``neither unequivocal nor unconditional'' and said a
punishing military strike remained an option.
	   The U.N. Security Council adjourned late Saturday after five
hours of inconclusive discussion and scheduled a further session on
Sunday.
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting director of external information and
editor of the state-run Baghdad Observer, told Associated Press
Television News that Iraq's letter ``deprived the United States of
any pretext to commit its aggression.''
	   ``If they want to launch an aggression, it would be a naked
aggression without any political or legal justification,'' he said.
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded neighboring
Kuwait in 1990, sparking war in the Persian Gulf. They limit the
sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated the Iraqi
economy.
	   The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be lifted
until the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Editorials Sunday in state-run newspapers said the United States
was seeking any opportunity to attack Iraq.
	   All front pages carried the text of the letter to Annan, along
with photos of Saddam meeting with his Revolutionary Command
Council and the leadership of the ruling Baath party, which
approved the letter.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper published by the Baath party, said
``the leadership's decision pulled the carpet out from under the
American administration, which continues to present misleading
information about Iraq ... and hunts continuously for opportunities
to start an aggression.''
	   It accused the United States of attempting to ``destabilize
security and safety in the region'' and ``blackmail'' Arab
countries to support its threats.
	   Babil, which is published by Saddam's son Odai, said the
American threats of a military strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a
cruel joke.''
	   Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will cut short
her visit to the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Malaysia, State Department officials said Sunday.
	   Albright was to head back to Washington Sunday night to deal
with the situation with Iraq.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Israel is trying to identity genes carried only by
Arabs that could be used to develop a biological weapon that would
harm Arabs but not Jews, the Sunday Times reported.
	   In Israel, David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected the report, saying such stories only
proved ``that there is no limit to human gullibility and also no

Associated Press, ``this is the kind of story that does not deserve
denial.''
	   The Sunday Times attributed its report to unidentified Israeli
military and Western intelligence sources. It said Israeli

Iraq says a U.S. attack would be ``naked aggression''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms
inspectors means any attack carried out now by the United States
would amount to ``naked aggression'' without legal grounds, an
Iraqi official said Sunday.
	   The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the government of President Saddam Hussein was
reversing decisions taken in August and October to halt cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   U.S. President Clinton's National Security adviser, Sandy

being ``neither unequivocal nor unconditional'' and said a
punishing military strike remained an option.
	   The U.N. Security Council adjourned after five hours of
inconclusive discussion on Iraq's decision and scheduled a further
session on Sunday.
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting director of external information and
editor of the state-run Baghdad Observer, told AP Television News
that Iraq's letter ``deprived the United States of any pretext to
commit its aggression.''
	   He added: ``If they want to launch an aggression, it would be a
naked aggression without any political or legal justification.''
	   The United States apparently was concerned that a two-page
``annex'' to the letter, written by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, amounted to placing conditions on the return of the
inspectors. The Security Council had insisted they be allowed to
return unconditionally.
	   After the fuss arose, the Iraqi ambassador to the United
Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, wrote another letter saying the annex only
presents Iraq's views which ``are not linked to the clear and
unconditional decision'' by Iraq to welcome back the inspectors.
	   The annex outlined Iraq's expectations that a promised U.N.
Security Council review of its cooperation with the council's
resolutions would lead to easing or lifting trade sanctions imposed
to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit the sale of oil and other trade
dealings, have devastated the Iraqi economy and made the country's
22 million people dependent on U.N. relief.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until the
U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency
certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 sharply limited the work of the
inspection teams, but now has agreed to allow them to return ``to
perform their normal duties.''
	   Editorials Sunday in state-run newspapers said the United States
was seeking any opportunity to attack Iraq.
	   All front pages carried the text of the letter to Annan, along
with photos of Saddam meeting with his Revolutionary Command
Council and the leadership of the ruling Baath party, which
approved the letter.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper published by the Baath party, said
``the leadership's decision pulled the carpet out from under the

	   Babil, which is published by Saddam's son Odai, said the
American threats of a military strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a
cruel joke.''
	   The U.N. sanctions, the paper said, had made Iraqis ``a daily
target'' of the United States ``which made them suffer more than a
military attack.''
	   A U.N. spokesman in Baghdad said, meanwhile, that a decision was
reversed to send back to Iraq about 150 U.N. humanitarian workers
pulled out last week for fear of a U.S. attack.
	   Their return was announced Friday in New York after initial
reports about Iraq's letter. But spokesman Eric Falt said the
workers _ who help run food distribution to the Iraqi people _
would stay out ``because of the extended deliberations in the
Security Council.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket fired by the northern-based
opposition slammed into the Afghan capital on Sunday, but there
were no immediate report of casualties, witnesses said.
	   The rocket landed near the combined military and civilian
airport.
	   This was the first rocket attack on Kabul since a cease fire
between the Afghan warring factions ended last week.
	   In recent days there has been fierce fighting between the
Taliban fighters and the opposition forces loyal to Ahmed Shah
Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami in northern Takhar and Baghlan provinces.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and are
mostly Pashtun _ the majority ethnic group of Afghanistan. The
Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of the country, including the
capital.
	   The opposition comprise mainly of religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.

Iraq says a U.S. attack would be ``naked aggression''

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms
inspectors means any attack carried out now by the United States
would amount to ``naked aggression'' without legal grounds, an
Iraqi official said Sunday.
	   The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the government of President Saddam Hussein was
reversing decisions taken in August and October to halt cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   U.S. President Clinton's National Security adviser, Sandy
Berger, described it as failing to meet American conditions by
being ``neither unequivocal nor unconditional'' and said a
punishing military strike remained an option.
	   The U.N. Security Council adjourned after five hours of
inconclusive discussion on Iraq's decision and scheduled a further
session on Sunday.
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting director of external information and
editor of the state-run Baghdad Observer, told AP Television News
that Iraq's letter ``deprived the United States of any pretext to
commit its aggression.''
	   He added: ``If they want to launch an aggression, it would be a
naked aggression without any political or legal justification.''
	   The United States apparently was concerned that a two-page
``annex'' to the letter, written by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, amounted to placing conditions on the return of the
inspectors. The Security Council had insisted they be allowed to
return unconditionally.
	   After the fuss arose, the Iraqi ambassador to the United
Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, wrote another letter saying the annex only
presents Iraq's views which ``are not linked to the clear and
unconditional decision'' by Iraq to welcome back the inspectors.
	   The annex outlined Iraq's expectations that a promised U.N.
Security Council review of its cooperation with the council's
resolutions would lead to easing or lifting trade sanctions imposed
to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit the sale of oil and other trade
dealings, have devastated the Iraqi economy and made the country's
22 million people dependent on U.N. relief.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until the
U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency
certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 sharply limited the work of the
inspection teams, but now has agreed to allow them to return ``to
perform their normal duties.''
	   Editorials Sunday in state-run newspapers said the United States
was seeking any opportunity to attack Iraq.
	   All front pages carried the text of the letter to Annan, along
with photos of Saddam meeting with his Revolutionary Command
Council and the leadership of the ruling Baath party, which
approved the letter.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper published by the Baath party, said
``the leadership's decision pulled the carpet out from under the
American administration, which continues to present misleading
information about Iraq ... and hunts continuously for opportunities
to start an aggression.''
	   It accused the United States of attempting to ``destabilize
security and safety in the region'' and ``blackmail'' Arab
countries to support its threats.
	   Babil, which is published by Saddam's son Odai, said the
American threats of a military strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a
cruel joke.''
	   The U.N. sanctions, the paper said, had made Iraqis ``a daily
target'' of the United States ``which made them suffer more than a
military attack.''
	   A U.N. spokesman in Baghdad said, meanwhile, that a decision was
reversed to send back to Iraq about 150 U.N. humanitarian workers
pulled out last week for fear of a U.S. attack.
	   Their return was announced Friday in New York after initial
reports about Iraq's letter. But spokesman Eric Falt said the
workers _ who help run food distribution to the Iraqi people _
would stay out ``because of the extended deliberations in the
Security Council.''

Lebanese president discharged from hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has been
discharged from a hospital after successfully undergoing heart
treatment but will spend his last week as president recuperating at
home.
	   ``The president has recovered from a ballooning procedure to
clear a blocked artery and is now ready to leave the hospital,'' a
statement issued late Saturday by the Sacre Coeur Hospital said.
	   Hrawi was discharged shortly afterwards and headed straight to
his home in Yarze at Beirut's southeastern outskirts, where doctors
said he must rest for one week.
	   Hrawi, 73, was admitted to hospital Tuesday after a mild heart
attack. He is due to step down as president on Nov. 24 at the end
of an extended nine-year term. His successor is Emile Lahoud, who
had bee commander of Lebanon's military.
	   Hrawi is scheduled to chair the last Cabinet meeting of his term
on Saturday. It was not clear if the president would attend or
whether he will take part in Independence Day celebrations Nov. 22.

Westwood wins third straight Taiheiyo Masters title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEMBA, Japan (AP) _ Lee Westwood shot a 3-under-par 69 Sunday
and became the first golfer in the tournament's 27-year history to
win three consecutive Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters titles.
	   The Englishman rebounded from bogeys on the first two holes. He
sank a 33-foot (10-meter) birdie putt on the third and went on to
score five more birdies against another bogey, finishing with a
13-under 275 total.
	   Japan's superstar Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki shot the day's best
round, a 67, and finished at 277. Colombia's Eduardo Herrera turned
in a 71 and was alone in third at 278.
	   Overnight leader Frankie Minoza of the Philippines struggled to
a 74 and finished fourth at 279.
	   Westwood, 25, now has won six times worldwide this year and has
12 career victories in the past three years. On the European Tour
alone, he won four times and finished third on the money list
behind Colin Montgomerie and Darren Clarke.
	   The victory Sunday was worth 21 million yen (dlrs 168,000).
	   ``I got off to a slow start but I kept my composure,'' said
Westwood. ``I knew I had to dig in there and play a little better.
I've shown a lot of material the last two days.
	   ``This course obviously suits me. I look forward to coming back
next year and the year after that and the year after that,'' he
said of the 7,072-yard (6,436-meter), par-72 Taiheiyo Masters
Gotemba course, near snow-capped Mount Fuji.
	   Westwood knew somebody was making a late charge but did not know
it was Jumbo Ozaki, who was seeking his fourth title this year and
110th overall.
	   ``All the scoreboards are in Japanese,'' he said. ``Jumbo is a
good player and you expect him to make a charge on the last day,
like he did last year.''
	   Last year, Jumbo and one of his two younger brothers, Joe, tied
for second at 273, just one shot behind Westwood's 272.
	   Playing ahead of Westwood this time, Ozaki birdied the par-5
18th and set the score to beat. When Westwood left himself with a
7-foot (2-meter) putt to save par at the 17th, a playoff became a
real possibility.
	   However, Westwood sank the putt, keeping a one-stroke lead, and
then easily birdied the last after finding the green with his
second shot.

Albright uses APEC meetings to criticize Iraq's position

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright indicated Sunday that there have been some positive
developments in the U.S. standoff with Iraq.
	   The United States has stood poised for several days to attack
Iraq, after rejecting a letter from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in
which he agreed to resume U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We consider the first letter as unacceptable,'' she told
reporters at the end of a meeting with Cabinet ministers from the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``Since this, there have been additional statements and some
discussion of significance,'' she said. ``All options remain on the
table, but we are very carefully assessing some recent new
developments.'' She refused to be more specific.
	   She met Sunday with Chinese, Japanese and Canadian officials to
discuss the events in Iraq. Tokyo said it supported the U.S.
position, but was hoping for a peaceful resolution.
	   China, however, refused to back U.S. military action, and said
it was only willing to urge Iraq to reconsider its actions and
cooperate with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Igor Ivanov, the Russian minister of foreign affairs, said
Moscow did not support ``unilateral action.''
	   ``There's a good prospect that there is a political way out of
this situation,'' Ivanov said. ``We should continue to work in a
coordinated way.''
	   Albright, who arrived in Malaysia late Saturday to attend a
summit meeting on Asia's economic crisis, spent the night
discussing the U.S.-Iraq standoff on the telephone with top
American, U.N. and European officials.
	   State Department officials said she would cut her scheduled
three-day visit short and head back to Washington Sunday night.
	   ``Time and again, Iraq has promised to come into compliance and
then broken that promise,'' Albright said in a speech to the APEC
trade and foreign ministers.
	   During the first of her bilateral meetings, Albright told her
Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, that Iraq must back down. Tang
agreed that Saddam was responsible for the current crisis,
according to State Department spokesman James P. Rubin.
	   However, Tang told reporters afterward that China would not
support the use of force against Iraq.
	   ``The Chinese government is absolutely against the use of
force,'' he said. ``This is a very clear stand on this issue. It is
pointless to use force to resolve the current situation. The use of
force only results in making things complicated, and will make
things worse.''
	   Tang said his government had sent a letter to Iraq urging its
government to ``think carefully'' and restart talks immediately
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Albright used her meetings with APEC officials to emphasize that
Saddam's offer to allow the inspectors to resume their inspections
contained too many conditions, said Rubin.
	   An Iraqi letter, addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
linked a resumption of inspections with ``a further chance to
achieve justice by lifting sanctions'' that the world imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Rubin said Albright also would use her visit to Malaysia to
discuss the Asian economic crisis and to meet with the wife of
former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired, then
jailed and put on trial after launching a reform movement opposing
the leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``I think the Malaysian government will understand the
significance of her (Albright) choosing that meeting,'' Rubin said,
adding that the secretary of state was not expected to hold any
private meetings with the Malaysian government.
	   ``We are here to discuss issues that APEC brought to Malaysia,
not the specifics of relations with Malaysia,'' Rubin said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who canceled his plan to travel to
the APEC summit because of the Iraq crisis, had not planned to meet
with Mahathir either because of U.S. concerns over Malaysia's
treatment of Anwar. The former official claims he was severely
beaten by prison guards when he was incarcerated before his trial.
	   Albright's plan to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, drew
strong rebukes Saturday from her Malaysian counterpart, Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi, who said Albright ``should not interfere in
Malaysia's affairs.''
	   The secretary of state's meeting with Azizah was intended to
express concern about ``the treatment of Anwar, the mistreatment in
prison and the importance we attach to due process during the
trial,'' Rubin said.

Macedonian voting could strengthen new government

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The conservative coalition that already
is assured of leading Macedonia's next government sought to
strengthen its mandate in elections deciding a final handful of
parliament seats Sunday.
	   Balloting was repeated in seven constituencies where minor
irregularities occurred in the previous two rounds.
	   The center-right coalition that clinched at least 58 of the 120
seats in previous voting was hoping to gain an outright majority
from the latest results, which will be known on Monday.
	   The incumbent ruling party of ex-communists can count on having
only 25 deputies in the next parliament based on earlier results.
	   A coalition of ethnic Albanian parties has won 23 seats, and
another six went to three smaller parties.
	   Even with seven seats still undetermined, the parties have been
negotiating intensely on alliances under the next government, which
will be led by the coalition of VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic
Alternative.
	   Ljupco Georgijevski, the leader of VMRO-DPNE, is the likely
future premier. Even if his coalition holds a parliamentary
majority, it would seek to include some ethnic Albanians in the
cabinet because of sensitive ethnic issues.
	   Ethnic Albanians form nearly a quarter of the country's 2.2
million people. The armed struggle for independence by ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, in neighboring Serbia, has heightened
tensions. There are fears that Macedonia's ethnic Albanians could
also press for autonomy.
	   Part of the NATO monitoring mission for Kosovo _ aircraft for
surveillance and accompanying personnel _ is being formed in
Macedonia, and there are plans to station a rapid reaction force
here as backup security for ground monitors in Kosovo.
	   Both the outgoing and incoming governments place importance on
having good relations with NATO and with Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic _ a delicate balancing act considering Western
condemnation of Serbia's harsh crackdown on its ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   The new Macedonian parliament is to be formed after the mandate
of the existing one expires on Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed Sunday
to overcome Japanese objections to slash tariffs in two key
industries, but claimed a partial success by keeping the
negotiations alive for at least another year.
	   While Japan did not relent in its refusal to agree to a schedule
for cutting tariffs on forestry and fish products, it did accept
language in the final communique that would allow negotiations to
continue in all nine sectors of the proposed accord covering dlrs
1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   Even though Japan, the world's second largest economy, could
still refuse to make any actual tariff cuts, other nations
portrayed the vague wording of the final communique of the
21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum as the
achievement of at least a partial success.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky called the accord
a ``very significant outcome,'' even though she has repeatedly said
Japan's objections represent a significant failure of the group's
goal to promote free trade in the face of the worst economic crisis
to hit Asia in 50 years.
	   Under the outline of the agreement, APEC nations, which
represent half of total global trade, will take their tariff
cutting proposals to the World Trade Organization in Geneva. There,
they hope to attract countries outside the Asia-Pacific region to
make similar offers to lower barriers in sectors ranging from
chemicals to medical equipment.
	   They also agreed to set a new deadline for next year's APEC
summit in New Zealand to see if they can finally overcome Japan's
objections to lifting tariffs in fish and forestry products.
	   On Tuesday and Wednesday, leaders of the 21 APEC members will
meet in Kuala Lumpur to approve the ministers' communique on the
tariff proposal and a wide range of other issues regarding the Asia
financial crisis and its effects on the rest of the world.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton canceled his visit to the APEC
summit to remain in Washington and deal with the Iraqi crisis. He
will be represented by Vice President Al Gore.
	   The APEC meetings were nearly sidelined Sunday by America's
efforts to gain widespread support for a possible military attack
on Iraq for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In another development, demonstrators hit the streets for the
second day running, demanding the resignation of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and siding with Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, his deputy and finance minister, then had
him jailed after Anwar led a reform movement.
	   Mahathir said he regretted Clinton would not attend the APEC
summit, saying he would have liked the American president to see
for himself that the streets of the capital were calm.
	   But soon after Mahathir's speech, riot police sprayed water
cannons to break up a noisy protest by 200 people demanding
Mahathir's resignation. On Saturday night, 3,000 people
demonstrated and marched toward the hotel where the U.S. delegation
is staying, screaming ``Clinton, save us from Mahathir!''
	   Several undercover policemen fired shots in the air, but no
serious injuries were reported.
	   Protesters have been calling for Mahathir's ouster since he
fired Anwar, his one-time protege who is standing trial on charges
of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   In a speech to international business leaders attending a
meeting on the sidelines of the APEC forum, Mahathir took aim at
Clinton over the standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I'd always hoped we could settle such problems with
negotiations,'' Mahathir said. ``Iraq is not an easy country, but
lobbing bombs and grenades will not do anything to solve this
problem.''
	   China and Russia also refused to condone air strikes against
Iraq as the only acceptable response to Saddam's refusal to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Mahathir has had to face many setbacks surrounding the economic
summit that was supposed to showcase his leadership and the
enormous economic progress in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have said they
would refuse the customary courtesy calls on the host of the APEC
summit, angered by the treatment given Anwar
	   Foreign officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, have said they plan to meet with Anwar's wife to discuss
the case, particularly his apparent beating while in jail.

Japan pledges to help Philippines solve school shortage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Japan has pledged to help build
school buildings in the Philippines, which is suffering from a
serious shortage, officials said Sunday.
	   In some rural areas, public elementary and high school teachers
now hold classes in the shade of trees or in churches. The
government projects that the country would lack more than 21,500
classrooms this year, up from last year's 14,615 rooms, officials
said.
	   The Japan International Cooperation Agency has committed to fund
the construction of 89 of the 630 school buildings the government
plans to build nationwide in the next six years, a government
statement said. JICA oversees foreign projects funded by the Japan.
	   Construction of the 89 schools is to begin in March.
	   Despite its economic woes, Japan has continued to provide grants
to the Philippines, an important Asian trading partner.

14 hostages freed from Chechnya in last week, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fourteen hostages have been freed from captivity
in Chechnya in the last week, a news report said Sunday.
	   Among the 14 captives freed were Russia's presidential envoy to
Chechnya, Russian soldiers, and a teenage girl, the Interfax news
agency said, citing Chechnya's Deputy Minister for State Security
Nasrudi Bazhiyev.
	   Police detained 20 people in the same period and also seized a
large amount of guns and ammunition, Bazhiyev said.
	   He said the government's campaign against kidnapping, dubbed
Operation Sword of Justice, will continue ``until a radical turn in
the campaign to combat kidnapping is ensured,'' Interfax reported.
	   Chechnya, a breakaway region in Russia's southwest, fought a
bloody independence war in 1994-96. Since then, the area has seen
an explosion in crime and kidnappings.
	   Government officials say that over 700 people, including Russian
soldiers, local civilians, and a number of foreigners, are still
being held in the region.

Rwanda to resettle thousands of war-weary people into new villages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos expected.
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUCACA, Rwanda (AP) _ In a first public indication of what they
plan to do with 650,000 war-displaced people, officials in
northwestern Rwanda said they will build new villages to provide
security for those fleeing attacks by Hutu rebels.
	   The policy of resettling mainly Hutus from scattered hillside
plots into concentrated villages where they would be easier to
protect _ and control _ has long been favored by the government.
	   The plan gained momentum this year when tens of thousands of
them grew tired of giving portions of their own scarce food,
shelter and money to the rebels. They knew they would be killed if
they refused, so the Hutu villagers left their homes and sought
protection from the army.
	   But similar government-drafted schemes to resettlieng the Hutus
in villages have failed before, leaving thousands of
donor-constructed rectangular houses standing empty in rows along
roads.
	   Foreign donors, who are expected to finance most of this
project, have been reluctant to respond for fears the resettlement
may not be voluntary. Crowding people into villages also raises
questions about changing cultural and social habits of Rwandans who
have been living a different life for centuries.
	   ``The plan is to take these people to their sectors once we are
assured about their security. Following discussions with the
communities, they will be put into groups of houses where it is
safer for them to be,'' said Alphonse Sharamanzi, a local official.
	   Sharamanzi, who on Saturday briefed aid workers and U.S.
diplomats on the project, said officials from the Ministry of
Transport and Communications had already begun to train some of the
farmers on how to carve up the land and allocate properties for
housing and farmland.
	   He said those Rwandans living in army-protected camps will
eventually move to the new villages. Their original houses most of
them built with mud bricks, will be dismantled and moved to the new
locations.
	   It is not clear, however, how long the project will last or when
the first villages will be erected. But even traditional farmers
acknowledge they have little alternative.
	   ``For many of us it is a choice of being killed by the rebels in
your field, or look for safety elsewhere,'' said 38-year-old
Appolinaire Abukuli.
	   Along with 45,000 others who left their family plots for this
squalid, makeshift camp overlooking the dark green Lake Ruhondo on
the volcanic slopes, Abukuli, a Hutu, said attacks and harassment
by Hutu rebels had driven most people away from their homes and
food.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for a 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus. The killing ended when the Tutsi-led
fighters won power in July 1994 and promised a national
reconciliation.
	   ``The rebels lied to people. They promised they would come back
to power, but they couldn't do it,'' Abukuli said.
	   For the moment, the donors and the U.N. Development Program in
Rwanda have agreed to finance with dlrs 50 million only the
distribution of food and water for an estimated 650,000 displaced
people sheltered in dozens of camps throughout the mountainous
region.
	   Apart from security, Rwandan authorities say the grouping of
people would ease the pressure of a rapidly growing population on
increasingly scarce land.
	   In northwestern Rwanda, the population density of 800 people per
square kilometer (mile) is double the national average, which is
already the highest in Africa.
	   An average size of a family plot dropped from 1.8 hectares (0.7
acres) in 1950s to 0.6 hectares (0.2 acres) thirty years later.

Russia begins withdrawing women and children from Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fearing possible Western air strikes against Iraq,
Moscow began withdrawing some Russian personnel from Baghdad on
Sunday, a government spokesman said.
	   More than 100 people, mostly employees of the Russian embassy in
Iraq and some of their family members, left for the city of
Kermanshah in Iran by bus, the duty officer at the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   The ministry sent two planes to Kermanshah to pick up the
Russian citizens, who were expected to arrive in Moscow late Sunday
or Monday.
	   Despite the evacuation, Russia thinks that the standoff with
Iraq will be resolved without air strikes.
	   ``There are good prospects for a political settlement of the
crisis,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein halted United Nations' monitoring of
weapons sites Oct. 31. But the latest crisis has been building
since Aug. 5 when Iraq prohibited field inspections for nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.
	   Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. Saturday saying arms inspectors
could return, but the United States has said it fails to meet
American conditions to resume checks.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations
with the West.

Russia's debt payment moratorium ends Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 90-day moratorium on Russia's foreign debt
repayments expired Sunday, but the government and the country's
troubled commercial banks may not be able to resume payments.
	   The Russian government decided Aug. 17 to impose the 90-day
moratorium on repayments of foreign commercial debt when it
devalued the ruble. A number of foreign creditors threatened to
seize Russian assets overseas as a result, but little action came
as a result.
	   Some of the country's larger banks will be able to pay their
debts, but many will face law suits and see their foreign assets
seized, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russian banks' debt on forward contracts to foreign banks totals
about dlrs 6 billion, but the banks will probably be able to pay
off no more than dlrs 2 billion, Interfax said.
	   And as the banks scramble for dollars to pay off the debts, the
ruble rate is likely to fall hard, Interfax said, citing an
unidentified source.
	   The Central Bank will ``help our banks keep the negotiations
with Western creditors going'' and try to head off any law suits,
said Central Bank Vice Chairman Andrei Kozlov, according to
Interfax.
	   But Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said the body
would only support those banks that can insure debt settlements and
retain ``the skeleton of the banking system,'' according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.

Funeral all set, but man turns up alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A grieving wife got the shock of
her life when the husband she thought was dead called her from the
hospital, news reports said Sunday.
	   Housewife Han Lau Loke, 47, was making preparations for her
husband's funeral in Kuantan, 260 kilometers (150 miles) east of
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Her 48-year-old husband, Lee Ching Poon, had been missing since
Nov. 2. Police found a decomposed body near her husband's car.
	   ``Thinking that the body was that of my husband, I began
finalizing funeral arrangements yesterday,'' the new Sunday Times
quoted her as saying.
	   According to the Sunday Star, Lee had been admitted to the state
hospital in Kuantan, and due to a miscommunication, the wife was
not informed.
	   The decomposed body was kept in the morgue of the same hospital.
The news reports did not say whose body it was.
	   Relatives who were on their way to attend the funeral from all
parts of the country were quickly informed of the mistake.

Two killed in clash between rebels and police in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stray bullets killed two villagers
during a gunfight between separatist rebels and police in the
northernmost Indonesian region of Aceh on Sunday, witnesses said.
	   A woman and a child died during the clash at Kandang village,
about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lhokseumawe, the
capital of North Aceh province, said Yacob Hamzah, a lawyer at the
local legal aid office.
	   Police and military officials were not available for comment.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a strongly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting
Indonesian forces for the past eight years in a bid to declare an
independent Islamic state.
	   It is one of three Indonesian provinces hit by separatist
conflicts.
	   The other two are Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony on western
New Guinea, and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.

Defense will not contest facts in murder case against Sheinbein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American teen-ager appealing an extradition
order will not contest the facts of the case if he stands trial for
murder in Israel instead of returning to Maryland, a defense
attorney told Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday.
	   David Libai, attorney for Samuel Sheinbein, said the defense
case would focus on the mental condition of the 18-year-old from
Silver Spring, Md., and would not involve the high cost of bringing
witnesses from the United States.
	   ``It will not be necessary to bring a single witness from
abroad,'' Libai told the court. ``We will admit to all the facts in
the case. Our contention will be the mental condition of the
defendant.''
	   However, Libai told The Associated Press during a break in the
hearing that he would not describe the plea that would be entered
or whether it would be innocent or guilty.
	   ``It could be insanity, or something like that, I don't know,''
Libai said.
	   The Sheinbein case caused an uproar in Israel and the United
States and threatened relations between the two allies. Members of
the U.S. Congress called for delaying Israeli aid packages if
Sheinbein was not returned. But the United States backed down when
Israel's Justice Ministry rejected Sheinbein's citizenship claims.
	   State attornies led by Irit Kohn sought to reopen the issue of
Sheinbein's citizenship, but the five-judge Supreme Court panel
refused to deal with the question.
	   In September, Jerusalem District Judge Moshe Ravid upheld
Sheinbein's claim to Israeli citizenship but said that his ties to
the country were not strong enough to shield him from prosecution
abroad. Israeli law allows for citizens to be tried in Israel
instead of being extradited.
	   The summary of the 39-page appeal argues that the lower court
decision clearing the way for extradition ``reflects only the
desire of the judge to arrive at a certain conclusion which is not
anchored in the language of the law, and the language of the law
cannot support it.''
	   Shmuel Sheinbein, who was sitting between two policemen, wore a
gray shirt and conferred briefly with one of his attorneys before
the appeal hearing began. His parents were sitting at the end of
the first row.
	   Sheinbein's father Sol, who watched the proceedings Sunday with
trembling lip and sweat streaking his face, told reporters he
wanted his son tried in Israel because he believed his life would
be in danger if he served time in a U.S. prison.
	   ``In the United States, his situation will be very difficult,
and it is possible that he could be killed in prison there. I am
very concerned for him,'' said Sol Sheinbein.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of Tello was discovered in the garage of an empty
house near the Sheinbein home. Shortly after arriving, he was
picked up by police and hospitalized briefly, suffering from a drug
overdose.
	   Aaron Needle, a second suspect, hanged himself in April on the
eve of his murder trial was in Montgomery County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine which was under British rule before the
Jewish state was founded in 1948.

Britain says Iraq has backed down but warplanes ready to strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After a stream of urgent calls between Washington
and London, Britain said Sunday that Iraq has backed down in the
latest confrontation over weapons inspections but British warplanes
are prepared to strike without warning unless the inspections
resume.
	   ``We will not accept a compromise. What we need from (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein is a clear and unconditional agreement to
allow the inspectors to get back to work,'' Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke at least eight times with
President Bill Clinton and other top U.S. officials through
Saturday and the early hours Sunday, said a spokesman at his
Downing Street office.
	   Iraq in its latest communication over nine points it raised
appeared to have stopped trying to make lifting of U.N. sanctions a
condition of allowing weapons inspections, added the spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain have demanded there is no linkage.
	   ``In letters to the U.N. Security Council, these assurances now
seem to have been given by Iraq,'' said Blair's spokesman.
``However, it is still not over ... the slightest indication of any
breach and we are ready to strike without further warning.''
	   Britain, America's most hawkish ally over Iraq, has sent 12
Tornado fighter-bombers to Kuwait, and has two antisubmarine
frigates, HMS Cumberland and HMS Grafton in the Gulf region. HMS
Grafton carries Sea Wolf and Harpoon missiles.
	   ``The basis of a decision is going to be, does Saddam mean
this?'' said Cook. ``Can we be convinced on the basis of what he
says that we have a ground not to strike him?''
	   Cook added that Saddam was the loser because he had to accept
the return of U.N. weapons inspectors, the continuation of
sanctions and that if he breaks his word this time ``there will be
a solidarity of support for international action.''
	   ``If he does attempt to break this agreement, we have got the
force there. Action will be swift and it will be heavy,'' added
Cook.

chimney to keep warm was burned alive after he felt ill and fell

	   Jean Pautier, 63, lived alone and there was no one to help him

Government willing to talk peace with rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ President Chandrika Kumaratunga has
told Tamil politicians she is willing to talk peace with
secessionist Tamil Tiger rebels, but a cease fire would depend on
how the talks progress, the state run ``Sunday Observer'' newspaper
said.
	   The government has been cautious in holding peace negotiation
with the rebels after earlier efforts in 1995 broke down when the
rebels destroyed two naval boats in eastern Sri Lanka.
	   ``Our government believes in a negotiated political settlement
for the ethnic crisis. But we cannot rush to talks with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,'' she was quoted as having told a
moderate Tamil political party.
	   The main opposition United National Party and Tamil political
parties are urging the government to resume talks with the rebels
to end the 15-year-old civil war that has claimed more than 54,000
lives.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   The government has proposed resolving the ethnic conflict by
changing the country's constitution to give nine provinces,
including a Tamil dominated one, more power in handling their own
affairs.
	   Earlier, the government had insisted that the rebels lay down
arms and drop its call for a separate Tamil homeland if talks were
to be held.

Former Khmer Rouge leader supports deal for new Cambodian
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A former senior member of the Khmer
Rouge on Sunday welcomed the agreement that will make the dying
guerrilla group's archenemy Hun Sen sole prime minister of a new
government.
	   Ieng Sary, who led a massive 1996 defection of rebel fighters
that crippled the Khmer Rouge, congratulated King Norodom Sihanouk
for brokering the deal Friday that ended a three-month political
stalemate.
	   ``The solution through the king's clear-sighted guidance is a
hopeful light leading us to achieve national reconciliation and an
end to the war,'' Ieng Sary said in a statement issued at the
former rebel stronghold of Pailin, 355 kilometers (220 miles)
northwest of Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen, whose party won a narrow majority in a July election,
allowed his rival Prince Norodom Ranariddh to take the presidency
of the National Assembly in exchange for his royalist party's
support in parliament for a new coalition government.
	   Ieng Sary, a deputy prime minister when the Khmer Rouge held
power in the late 1970s, said in his statement that Pailin
``wholeheartedly supports the agreement.'' He urged the
international community to resume aid to Cambodia that was halted
after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a coup
last year.
	   In exchange for pledging his loyalty to the government, Ieng
Sary was given an amnesty for his role as a senior official in Pol
Pot's brutal Khmer Rouge regime, and Pailin became the center of a
semi-autonomous zone controlled by the former rebels.
	   The Khmer Rouge leadership is held responsible for the deaths of
as many as 2 million people by execution, starvation and disease
during the Maoist group's 1975-79 rule.
	   An invading Vietnamese army ousted the Khmer Rouge from Phnom
Penh in 1979 and set up a client regime that later came to be led
by Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander who defected to Hanoi in
1977.
	   Hun Sen became the chief target of vitriolic verbal attacks by
the Khmer Rouge from its clandestine radio station as it fought a
guerrilla struggle against the Vietnamese-backed regime. That faded
after a 1993 U.N.-sponsored election. Only a few remnants of the
group remain in the jungles of northern Cambodia.
	   A team of U.N. experts is visiting Cambodia to review evidence
that has been gathered against the Khmer Rouge and assess the
possibility of an international tribunal.
	   Supreme Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot escaped prosecution when he
died of an apparent heart attack in April, but many top members of
the guerrilla group are still at large.
	   The director of a research center said Sunday he has gathered
more than 3,000 Khmer Rouge documents he believes provide enough
evidence to convict the communist guerrilla group's leadership for
war crimes and genocide.
	   Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, said
some of the 59 documents he will show the U.N. team connect Ieng
Sary and others to a torture center set up in a Phnom Penh high
school, Tuol Sleng.
	   Between 16,000 and 20,000 political prisoners are estimated to
have been tortured at Tuol Sleng and then killed. The prison was
turned into a museum after the Vietnamese invasion as a reminder of
the atrocities the Khmer Rouge committed against its own people.
	   Although Ieng Sary was given an amnesty by Sihanouk as part of
the defection deal, the king has said that it does not cover any
indictments by an international court.

Czech opposition party says too early to proclaim parliamentary
</HEADLINE>
victory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite a strong showing in the
first round of Czech Senate elections, leaders of the main
opposition party cautioned Sunday that they weren't assured of
increasing their strength in Parliament.
	   The Civic Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced
the most candidates to the second round of any party competing in
the Friday and Saturday elections. Updated results early Sunday
showed they had qualified for runoffs in 22 of 27 districts.
	   The governing Social Democrats are next with 15 candidates in
next weekend's runoffs, a showing they called disappointing
Saturday. A grouping of four opposition parties led by the
Christian Democrats and Freedom Union finished third with 14
candidates, while Communist candidates made it in three districts.
	   But no one received the majority needed to win outright victory,
and Civic Democratic Party officials cautioned that the results
were inconclusive.
	   ``The final result is very hard to estimate,'' the news agency
CTK quoted the party's deputy chairman Miroslav Macek as saying
Sunday. ``We made it to the runoffs in most of the districts last
time too, and the final result was completely different.''
	   A third of the seats in the 81-member are at stake. The top two
vote-getters in each district will face each other in the runoffs
next Friday and Saturday.
	   Turnout was 42 percent, 7 percent higher than in the first
Senate elections in 1996.
	   The Civic Democratic Party currently controls 29 seats in the
Senate, 12 of them up for grabs in the vote. The Social Democrats
have 26 senators, with six up for re-election.
	   The rest of the seats are held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and Communists.
	   The Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic. It can pass laws, should the 200-seat
lower house be dissolved.
	   Preliminary results from local elections, which also took place
Friday and Saturday, indicated that independent candidates were
doing well in small villages while the Civic Democratic Party was
leading in big towns.
	   More than 60,000 local posts are at stake. Final results are
expected Monday.

Congolese army executes 13 soldiers, officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Thirteen soldiers and officers were put
to death after a military tribunal found them guilty of treason,
state-run television reported Sunday.
	   The report did not say how the executions were carried out, but
the use of a firing squad is common practice in Congo.
	   The group were all accused of deserting their posts and leaving
their weapons to enemy forces, Congolese television said.
	   ``These traitors were sentenced to death for betraying the
fatherland,'' the television announcer said.
	   The troops and officers apparently left their positions during
fighting with rebel forces on a key road near the eastern Congolese
town of Kalemie.
	   ``The executions show that there will be no place for laxity in
our army and that any soldier who goes against the rules and does
not respect military laws and regulations will suffer the same
fate,'' the report said.
	   It was unclear where the executions took place.
	   President Laurent Kabila's army, along with support from Angola,
Zimbabawe, Namibia and Chad, has been battling a rebel movement
that in August threatened to capture the capital, Kinshasa.
	   The rebels have since been pushed back to eastern Congo. Many
rebels fighting to topple Kabila, are former soldiers in the
president's army or were his allies during his own rebel campaign
that ultimately ousted former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   Kabila's troops defected in large numbers to the rebel side in
July and August.

West Indies' Lara scores 87 for 133 at lunch with Griqualand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara
scored an unbeaten 87 (not out) to take his side to lunch on 133
for two wickets Sunday, the second day of their four-day match
against the provincial Griqualand West.
	   Griqualand West were dismissed for 271 in their first innings on
Saturday.
	   With the first Test upcoming on Nov. 26, the 29-year-old batting
maestro was in threatening form. In just over two hours at the
crease, Lara flayed the ball to all corners and conserved energy on
yet another scorching day by collecting 72 runs via the boundary
ropes.
	   Lara cracked 15 fours and two sixes in all, with his 50 coming
off just 75 deliveries.
	   Offspinner Pat Symcox went to lunch with a respectable 1-25 from
11 overs, first claiming Philo Wallace's wicket before duelling
with Lara.
	   Umpire Cyril Mitchley turned down a leg-before appeal from
Symcox when Lara had 46.
	   Lara responded by dancing down the wicket and cracking the ball
to the mid-wicket fence. He followed that with a searing six over
mid-off.
	   The other wicket to fall was that of opening bat Clayton
Lambert, who was caught behind off the bowling of paceman Deon
Kruis for 11 in the third over.
	   West Indies' top bowler Courtney Walsh, who limped off the field
on Saturday, had no serious injures from a sprained ankle, the
South African Press Association reported. It was not known if he
would play on Sunday.
	   Two other West Indies players are out of action _ Curtly Ambrose
with a toenail removal and Jimmy Adams with severed finger tendons.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh had hoped to break
the record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcom Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test
wickets.
	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's play against a
Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play after the
team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed Sunday
to overcome Japanese objections to slash tariffs in two key
industries, but claimed a partial success by keeping the
negotiations alive for at least another year.
	   While Japan did not relent in its refusal to agree to a schedule
for cutting tariffs on forestry and fish products, it did accept
language in the final communique that would allow negotiations to
continue in all nine sectors of the proposed accord covering dlrs
1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   Even though Japan, the world's second largest economy, could
still refuse to make any actual tariff cuts, other nations
portrayed the vague wording of the final communique of the
21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum as the
achievement of at least a partial success.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky called the accord
a ``very significant outcome,'' even though she has repeatedly said
Japan's objections represent a significant failure of the group's
goal to promote free trade in the face of the worst economic crisis
to hit Asia in 50 years.
	   Under the outline of the agreement, APEC nations, which
represent half of total global trade, will take their tariff
cutting proposals to the World Trade Organization in Geneva. There,
they hope to attract countries outside the Asia-Pacific region to
make similar offers to lower barriers in sectors ranging from
chemicals to medical equipment.
	   They also agreed to set a new deadline for next year's APEC
summit in New Zealand to see if they can finally overcome Japan's
objections to lifting tariffs in fish and forestry products.
	   ``It is not the best way forward, but it is a way forward _ to
move all nine sectors to the WTO,'' Australian Trade Minister Tim
Fischer told a news conference.
	   On Tuesday and Wednesday, leaders of the 21 APEC members will
meet in Kuala Lumpur to approve the ministers' communique on the
tariff proposal and a wide range of other issues regarding the Asia
financial crisis and its effects on the rest of the world.
	   The communique contains no new initiatives on how to defuse the
crisis, but stresses ``the critical role of open markets in
underpinning economic recovery.''
	   It contains no references to calls by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad for increased regulation of currency traders and
credit-rating agencies. Malaysia introduced sweeping capital
controls in September and pegged its own currency to 3.80 ringgit
to the U.S. dollar.
	   The ministers agree to create ``stable, safe and efficient
capital markets,'' but they don't say how that will be done.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton canceled his visit to the APEC
summit to remain in Washington and deal with the Iraqi crisis. He
will be represented by Vice President Al Gore.
	   The APEC meetings were nearly sidelined Sunday by America's
efforts to gain widespread support for a possible military attack
on Iraq for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In another development, Malaysian demonstrators hit the streets
for the second day running, demanding the resignation of Mahathir
and siding with Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, his deputy and finance minister, then had
him jailed after Anwar led a reform movement.
	   Mahathir said he regretted Clinton would not attend the APEC
summit, saying he would have liked the American president to see
for himself that the streets of the capital were calm.
	   But soon after Mahathir's speech, riot police sprayed water
cannons to break up a noisy protest by 200 people demanding his
resignation. On Saturday night, 3,000 people demonstrated and
marched toward the hotel where the U.S. delegation is staying,
screaming ``Clinton, save us from Mahathir!''
	   Several undercover policemen fired shots in the air, but no
serious injuries were reported.
	   Protesters have been calling for Mahathir's ouster since he
fired Anwar, his one-time protege who is standing trial on charges
of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   In a speech to international business leaders attending a
meeting on the sidelines of the APEC forum, Mahathir took aim at
Clinton over the standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I'd always hoped we could settle such problems with
negotiations,'' Mahathir said. ``Iraq is not an easy country, but
lobbing bombs and grenades will not do anything to solve this
problem.''
	   China and Russia also refused to condone air strikes against
Iraq as the only acceptable response to Saddam's refusal to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Mahathir has had to face many setbacks surrounding the economic
summit that was supposed to showcase his leadership and enormous
economic progress in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have said they
would refuse the customary courtesy calls on the host of the APEC
summit, angered by the treatment given Anwar.
	   Foreign officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, met with Anwar's wife to discuss the case, particularly
his apparent beating while in jail.

Iran suspends pilgrimages to Iraq because of crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has suspended visits by Muslim pilgrims
to Iraq because of the possibility of U.S. military strikes there,
Akhbar newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The government has decided to stop all Iranian pilgrims going to
Iraq, said the paper quoting an unnamed Iranian official.
	   The official said the decision, made last week, was based on
safety concerns and was indefinite.
	   ``The time to restart the trips will depend on the political and
military conditions in the region,'' the paper quoted the official
as saying.
	   Iran and Iraq agreed in July to allow 12,000 Iranians a month to
visit the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq.
	   Mosques in the cities are the most sacred sites to Iran's
majority Shiite Muslims after those in Saudi Arabia.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq every year
until 1980, when the two countries went to war and Iraq stopped
giving visas. The war ended in 1988 but not the visa restrictions.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ His palace under heavy guard following
riots and protests, President B.J. Habibie on Sunday stood by his
military chief despite outrage over the shooting deaths of at least
five students in clashes with riot officers.
	   Police, meanwhile, took an outspoken retired army general from
his home for questioning after Habibie ordered the military to get
tough on those he has accused of trying to overthrow his
6-month-old government.
	   Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris is head of the National Front, a group of
intellectuals and former military officers that has campaigned to
replace Habibie with a transitional government led by a presidium
of community leaders.
	   Several pro-democracy activists were questioned Saturday.
	   The streets of Jakarta were quiet Sunday after rampaging mobs
burned buildings and cars and attacked police during riots a day
earlier that were triggered by the killings of the students.
	   Several security personnel, pro-government civilian guards and
others were also killed, bringing the death toll to at least 16
since Thursday.
	   The unrest was the worst in the Indonesian capital since May,
when much heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat
authoritarian leader Suharto after three decades in power.
	   Mobs vented their fury at the military, shouting taunts and
hurling stones at police vehicles. At Parliament, thousands of
student protesters shouted slogans against Gen. Wiranto, head of an
armed forces tainted by human rights abuses.
	   ``Hang Wiranto!'' they chanted before dispersing Saturday night.
	   Civic leaders urged the resignation of Wiranto, a former
adjutant to Suharto who has been struggling to clean up the
military's image. The student killings were a blow to his efforts.
	   ``It is unlikely that the president will fire Gen. Wiranto
because it is not his style,'' a presidential aide, Dewi Fortuna
Anwar, said Sunday.
	   Habibie relies heavily on the support of the politically
powerful military.
	   In a meeting with local journalists Sunday, Wiranto expressed
regret for the shootings of the students and promised to take
action against officers involved.
	   Backed by armored personnel carriers and small tanks, Wiranto's
troops ringed the presidential palace and Parliament. One
stick-wielding mob roamed as close as a few blocks from the palace.
	   Students planned to resume protests Monday against Habibie, a
one-time protege of Suharto who is promising democratic reforms but
is suspected by opponents of maneuvering to stay in power.
	   Students timed their demonstrations to coincide with a meeting
last week of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, which agreed to hold parliamentary elections
in May or June and make other political reforms.
	   Yet the assembly, filled with holdovers from the Suharto era,
lacks credibility among students.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network, Habibie suggested that
students had been manipulated by his opponents. He said the
students had been given ``garbage from an information system that
is doing things that are irresponsible.''
	   He also said the mob unrest, much of it carried out by youths
with no apparent political agenda, would only impede democratic
change. Student violence has been largely confined to
stone-throwing at troops.
	   ``Demonstration must not mean burning houses or shops, killing
other people. That is not the aim of any kind of democracy,''
Habibie said in the interview broadcast Sunday.
	   Warning of the possibility of more unrest, Australia urged its
citizens not to travel to Indonesia. Many foreign embassies told
their citizens to stay off the streets.
	   On Sunday, about 20 students wearing black armbands laid
wreathes at the site of a clash where their friends died.
	   Civilians patrolled neighborhoods, some of them closed off with
barricades of trash carts and barbed wire. Shopkeepers swept up
broken glass from smashed windows that had been repaired recently
in the wake of the May riots.
	   Also Sunday, witnesses said two villagers were killed by stray
bullets during a gunfight between separatist rebels and police in
the northernmost Indonesian province of Aceh. The military has been
accused of widespread abuses in the region.

Pope asks world to pray toward peaceful end to Iraq crisis

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II asked the world Sunday to
pray for the key figures in the Iraq crisis, asking God to
``illuminate their minds and hearts'' so that they ended the crisis
peacefully.
	   The pope spoke on Iraq in a shorter-than-usual Sunday morning
address, his voice weak as he spoke to the faithful gathered below
his window. He said his thoughts in recent days had turned ``with
more intensity'' to the Middle East, especially to Iraq.
	   ``I hope in my heart that a peaceful and just solution can be
reached,'' John Paul said. ``Above all, I hope that an already
hard-tested population is spared further suffering and sorrow.''
	   ``I invite all to pray to the Lord to illuminate the minds and
hearts of those responsible, so that they continue to use
diplomatic means and dialogue to resolve the grave crisis.''
	   The pope repeatedly has opposed the U.N. sanctions against
Saddam Hussein's regime on the grounds of the hardships they pose
to the Iraqi people.
	   Earlier Sunday, John Paul made a parish visit to a church on the
outskirts of Rome, St. Mateo. That appearance, too, ended more
quickly than usual. At times during his later address, the
78-year-old pontiff appeared to pause in his speech to catch his
breath.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An Angolan man suffered a fatal gunshot
wound Sunday in an altercation with a group of gypsies in Lisbon,
police said.
	   Witnesses told police that around a dozen gypsies attacked the
29-year-old man around 1 a.m. (0100gmt). The man was shot, and died
later in a hospital. The attackers fled before police arrived.
	   The motive of the attack was not immediately clear, a police
official said. ``It might have been a payback,'' he said.
	   However, it was not clear whether the victim, whose identity was
not disclosed, knew the people who attacked him, the spokesman
said.

Voters turn out in Burkina Faso elections despite boycott call

final results by Nov. 29. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Voters flocked to the polls in
Burkina Faso on Sunday to participate in the West African country's
first presidential elections in seven years.
	   Despite a boycott by opposition parties and a campaign urging
people to abstain from voting, polling stations shortly after
opening in the morning were filled with voters.
	   ``I'm confident in the ongoing democratic process,'' said
incumbent, President Blaise Compaore after casting his ballot.
	   Opposition leaders, however, say the elections are flawed and
not transparent. Anticipating such accusations, Compaore invited
observers from the European Union and the Organization of African
Unity to monitor the voting.
	   As a result of the boycott, the incumbent faces competition only
from two other candidates, both of whom, it is widely believed, are
actually Compaore supporters.
	   The head of state since he helped to depose Capt. Thomas
Sankara's military leadership, Compaore transformed his own
military rule into a civilian administration with 1991 presidential
elections.
	   Opposition parties working together boycotted those polls and
mounted a campaign to keep people from voting. Only 26 percent of
eligible voters took part in those elections.
	   This time around, a coalition of oppositions parties mounted a
similarly visible election campaign, posting notices saying ``Do
not vote'' or ``I boycott.''
	   The boycott strategy is partially in response to poor showings
in previous elections that opposition parties have participated in.
	   In National Assembly elections earlier this year, opposition
candidates won only 9 of 111 seats.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms
inspectors means any attack carried out now by the United States
would amount to ``naked aggression'' without legal grounds, an
Iraqi official said Sunday. The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said the government of President
Saddam Hussein was reversing decisions taken in August and October
to halt cooperation with the inspectors. U.S. President Bill
Clinton's National Security adviser, Sandy Berger, described it as
failing to meet American conditions by being ``neither unequivocal
nor unconditional'' and said a punishing military strike remained
an option. The U.N. Security Council adjourned after five hours of
inconclusive discussion on Iraq's decision and scheduled a further
session on Sunday. (IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday
appealed for Israelis to accept a Palestinian state as a ``bridge
of love and peace,'' but an Israeli official denounced the renewed
calls for declaring a state next May. David Bar-Illan, a top aide
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warned that a move to
establish a state without negotiation next May would prompt Israel
to annex areas of the West Bank it now holds. ``We are supposed to
continue negotiating until we reach an agreement about what we call
the final status between the two peoples. If the negotiations do
not continue, and if an arbitrary, unilateral action is taken by
the Palestinians, it will render these agreements null and void,''
Bar-Illan said. In such an event, Bar-Illan said Israel would
incorporate areas under its control. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed Sunday
to overcome Japanese objections to slash tariffs in two key
industries, but claimed a partial success by keeping the
negotiations alive for at least another year. While Japan did not
relent in its refusal to agree to a schedule for cutting tariffs on
forestry and fish products, it did accept language in the final
communique that would allow negotiations to continue in all nine
sectors of the proposed accord covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global
trade. Even though Japan, the world's second largest economy, could
still refuse to make any actual tariff cuts, other nations
portrayed the vague wording of the final communique of the
21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum as the
achievement of at least a partial success. (APEC)
	   MUCACA, Rwanda (AP) _ In a first public indication of what they
plan to do with 650,000 war-displaced people, officials in
northwestern Rwanda said they will build new villages to provide
security for those fleeing attacks by Hutu rebels. The policy of
resettling mainly Hutus from scattered hillside plots into
concentrated villages where they would be easier to protect _ and
control _ has long been favored by the government. The plan gained
momentum this year when tens of thousands of them grew tired of
giving portions of their own scarce food, shelter and money to the
rebels. They knew they would be killed if they refused, so the Hutu
villagers left their homes and sought protection from the army.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An Angolan man suffered a fatal gunshot
wound Sunday in an altercation with a group of Roma in Lisbon,
police said.
	   Witnesses told police that around a dozen Roma, also known
Gypsies, attacked the 29-year-old man around 1 a.m. The man was
shot, and died later in a hospital. The attackers fled before
police arrived.
	   The motive of the attack was not immediately clear, a police
official said. ``It might have been a payback,'' he said.
	   It was also not clear whether the victim, whose identity was not
disclosed, knew the people who attacked him, the spokesman said.

Southern rebels kill more than 30 northern merchants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A rebel group has attacked a convoy of
commercial trucks, killing 34 northern Sudanese merchants in a
southern town, a pro-government newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The daily Alwan quoted government sources in the Upper Nile
state as saying the attack took place last week in the Khor
Donglawi area near the town of Renk, 450 kilometers (miles 280)
south of Khartoum.
	   The area is one the main trade centers where northern Sudanese
merchants sell their products and buy southern goods.
	   The daily quoted the sources as saying the incident was the
worst of its kind since the outbreak of the rebellion in 1983.
	   It said the attackers also burned a truck belonging to the
government-owned National Development Foundation and killed some
employees. It did not say how many.
	   Officials in southern Sudan confirmed the incident. Speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, they told The Associate Press
that rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army also attacked a
camp of the government's Popular Defense Forces in the area,
killing and wounding an unspecified number of soldiers.
	   The SPLA has been waging an insurrection since 1983, demanding
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the fighting and consequent famines. mo-my-ggl

Izetbegovic says he'll resign if Serbs get Brcko
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ President Alija Izetbegovic
warned again that he will resign if international officials award
control of the disputed town of Brcko to Bosnian Serbs, newspaper
reports said Sunday.
	   International arbitrators have three times postponed a decision
on the strategic northern town for fear of wrecking Bosnia's tense
stability. Both sides have threatened to resume fighting if control
goes to the other half.
	   No date is scheduled for a decision, but in the wake of Bosnia's
September elections it is now expected late this year or early next
year.
	   Izetbegovic, Muslim wartime leader and chairman of the
three-member joint national presidency, reiterated Saturday that
giving the town to Serbs would violate the Bosnian peace agreement
and he would quit.
	   ``The same day, I will withdraw from the position of the member
of the presidency in case the decision of the arbitrators turns out
to be to have Brcko be given to Republika Srpska,'' Izetbegovic
said on Bosnian television news.
	   ``I would do this in protest and say very clearly to the people
and the world ... that it represented a bloody injustice ... and
would call upon the young generation never to accept such a
decision,'' he said.
	   Brcko, currently supervised by American Robert Farrand, is the
only territorial question left undecided by the 1995 Dayton
agreement.
	   The port town on the River Sava, dominated by Muslims before the
war, is so crucial to both Bosnian substates, the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Bosnian Serbs' republic, that it could not be
settled during talks in Dayton, Ohio.

Striking museum workers shut Orsay for sixth straight day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking workers kept the Orsay Museum of 19th
century art shut Sunday for the sixth straight day, again blocking
visitors from entering one of the city's most popular attractions.
	   The strikers want the museum to improve their working conditions
and are demanding a bonus of 1,600 francs (dlrs 290) for extra work
due to the very popular ``Millet-Van Gogh'' exhibition.
	   Museum employees say the large and often impatient crowds that
line up daily for the exhibit at times abuse them. The strikers
also say the museum must improve its security system.
	   The Orsay Museum is a renovated train station on the Left Bank
of the Seine River. It is home to impressionist paintings as well
as special exhibitions like the ``Millet-Van Gogh'' show.
	   The strike is just the latest in a wave of walkouts which have
closed major Paris attractions this fall, including the Eiffel
Tower and the National Library.

Rwanda to resettle thousands of war-weary people into new villages

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore feature indicator to slug &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MUCACA, Rwanda (AP) _ In a first public indication of what they
plan to do with 650,000 war-displaced people, officials in
northwestern Rwanda said they will build new villages to provide
security for those fleeing attacks by Hutu rebels.
	   The policy of resettling mainly Hutus from scattered hillside
plots into concentrated villages where they would be easier to
protect _ and control _ has long been favored by the government.
	   The plan gained momentum this year when tens of thousands of
them grew tired of giving portions of their own scarce food,
shelter and money to the rebels. They knew they would be killed if
they refused, so the Hutu villagers left their homes and sought
protection from the army.
	   But similar government-drafted schemes to resettling the Hutus
in villages have failed before, leaving thousands of
donor-constructed rectangular houses standing empty in rows along
roads.
	   Foreign donors, who are expected to finance most of this
project, have been reluctant to respond for fears the resettlement
may not be voluntary. Crowding people into villages also raises
questions about changing cultural and social habits of Rwandans who
have been living a different life for centuries.
	   ``The plan is to take these people to their sectors once we are
assured about their security. Following discussions with the
communities, they will be put into groups of houses where it is
safer for them to be,'' said Alphonse Sharamanzi, a local official.
	   Sharamanzi, who on Saturday briefed aid workers and U.S.
diplomats on the project, said officials from the Ministry of
Transport and Communications had already begun to train some of the
farmers on how to carve up the land and allocate properties for
housing and farmland.
	   He said those Rwandans living in army-protected camps will
eventually move to the new villages. Their original houses most of
them built with mud bricks, will be dismantled and moved to the new
locations.
	   It is not clear, however, how long the project will last or when
the first villages will be erected. But even traditional farmers
acknowledge they have little alternative.
	   ``For many of us it is a choice of being killed by the rebels in
your field, or look for safety elsewhere,'' said 38-year-old
Appolinaire Abukuli.
	   Along with 45,000 others who left their family plots for this
squalid, makeshift camp overlooking the dark green Lake Ruhondo on
the volcanic slopes, Abukuli, a Hutu, said attacks and harassment
by Hutu rebels had driven most people away from their homes and
food.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for a 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus. The killing ended when the Tutsi-led
fighters won power in July 1994 and promised a national
reconciliation.
	   ``The rebels lied to people. They promised they would come back
to power, but they couldn't do it,'' Abukuli said.
	   For the moment, the donors and the U.N. Development Program in
Rwanda have agreed to finance with dlrs 50 million only the
distribution of food and water for an estimated 650,000 displaced
people sheltered in dozens of camps throughout the mountainous
region.
	   Apart from security, Rwandan authorities say the grouping of
people would ease the pressure of a rapidly growing population on
increasingly scarce land.
	   In northwestern Rwanda, the population density of 800 people per
square kilometer (mile) is double the national average, which is
already the highest in Africa.
	   An average size of a family plot dropped from 1.8 hectares (0.7
acres) in 1950s to 0.6 hectares (0.2 acres) thirty years later.

Bomb explodes in Bulgarian lawmaker's yard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A bomb exploded outside the home of a
Bulgarian lawmaker who has accused police and customs authorities
of involvement in smuggling cigarettes from Greece, police said
Sunday.
	   No one was reported injured in the blast late Saturday in the
yard of Georgi Shishkov, whose provincial home is located in the
southeastern town of Svilengrad, near the Greek border.
	   State radio reported that Shishkov, of the ruling Union of
Democratic Forces, was home at the time.
	   Five police and customs officials in Svilengrad were arrested in
July when Bulgarian police seized three truckloads of cigarettes
which were imported from Greece without the payment of customs
duties.
	   One of the detainees, a customs officer, confessed he had been
promised dlrs 5,000 per truckload of cigarettes to let in the
import duty-free.
	   Shishkov, who is involved in official investigations has alleged
that the smuggling channel existed for long time and former senior
and local police officials are involved.

agreed to release priest to them; rains hampering release

letter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ A Muslim rebel leader said Sunday
the kidnappers of an Italian priest in the southern Philippines
have agreed to release him to a rebel commander.
	   The rebels then would turn the Rev. Luciano Benedetti over to
government officials in Cotabato City, said Al Haj Murad, vice
chairman for military affairs of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
	   He said the kidnappers had agreed to turn Benedetti over to an
MILF local commander in Zamboanga province later Sunday or Monday,
but heavy rains in a thickly forested area of Zamboanga have
hampered progress.
	   ``Our troops have seen Father Benedetti. He's well,'' Murad told
The Associated Press by telephone from a camp in southern
Maguindanao province. He said they were in contact by two-way radio
with the MILF forces trying to secure custody of the priest.
	   Benedetti, 54, from Treviso, was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected
Muslim rebels in Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province and his
kidnappers have demanded a ransom of 10 million pesos (dlrs
250,000), officials and rebel leaders said.
	   Several other people remain in the hands of different kidnapping
groups, including the family of a Taiwanese businessman and a group
of two Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian, all kidnapped in the
southern Mindanao region.
	   Murad said MILF troops surrounded the area where Benedetti was
being kept and pressured the kidnappers to give Benedetti up
without ransom.
	   Ghazali Jaafar, the MILF vice chairman for political affairs,
said the group had received a letter from the kidnappers Oct. 29
stressing they would not free Benedetti unless ransom was paid.
	   The kidnappers also asked the MILF to pass on a letter from
Benedetti addressed to President Joseph Estrada, Jaafar said.
	   ``I'm writing to you for your help so that I can come out alive
from this kidnapping,'' Benedetti wrote. ``It will be very bad for
the image of the country if as a foreigner I will lose my life
during this ordeal.''
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling
the central government in an attempt to establish a separate
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   It is involved in on and off peace negotiations with Manila and
has promised to help the government combat rampant kidnappings in
Mindanao, although the military says the rebels might be involved
in some abductions.
	   Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign against kidnappings
and scored a major victory last month with the rescue of several
victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors in Manila.
	   He promised upon taking office in June to end the kidnappings
within six months.

U.S. Secretary of State Albright meets Anwar's wife

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ignoring warnings not to meddle in
Malaysian affairs, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Sunday with the wife of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim and called
him a ``highly respected leader.''
	   For 30 minutes, Albright met in her hotel room with Azizah
Ismail, who has sought international criticism for the way her
husband, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, has been treated
since he was arrested and put on trial.
	   Dressed in a turquoise Muslim scarf, Azizah appeared nervous
while entering and leaving the meeting, which drew huge crowds of
reporters and photographers from around the world.
	   ``I'm very happy with the meeting. We had a lot of support from
Secretary of State Albright,'' Azizah said, before being whisked
away by police escorts.
	   Albright, who arrived in Kuala Lumpur Saturday night for a
meeting of Pacific Rim nations, cut short her visit because of U.S.
tensions with Iraq. But she insisted on seeing Azizah before
meeting with Russian officials and returning to Washington on
Sunday night.
	   Azizah sat next to Albright and the two spoke quietly. U.S.
Ambassador John Mallott was also present.
	   ``She's very nice, very supportive and warm,'' Azizah told The
Associated Press by cellphone as she was being driven away from the
luxury hotel in the center of Kuala Lumpur. ``I can't say more, or
else I would,'' she said apologetically.
	   Earlier in the day, Albright expressed U.S. concern about the
Anwar case, specifically his alleged beating by police while being
jailed before his trial began two weeks ago on corruption and
sexual misconduct charges that he vehemently denies.
	   The government has adjourned the sensational trial during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which have drawn top
officials from 20 nations and Hong Kong to the Malaysian capital.
	   ``The U.S. has made clear a number of times that Anwar Ibrahim
is a highly respected leader,'' Albright said earlier Sunday.
	   ``The reporting on the trial of Anwar Ibrahim gives us great
concern. We hope very much he will receive due process and a fair
trial,'' Albright told reporters.
	   The secretary of state had said it should be ``perfectly
appropriate to meet with her,'' but Malaysia's objections were
clear in a sharp exchange that she had during a large ministerial
news conference with the country's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz.
	   ``Maybe if I go to the United States, I would like to meet Ken
Starr,'' she said, referring to a prosecutor in the Clinton sex
scandal. ``Maybe with others, too,'' Rafidah said.
	   Albright, who was glowering, sniped, ``He is not in prison.''
	   Rafidah then added: ``To find out what is happening. I am
curious.''
	   Standing at the back of the auditorium where the news conference
was held, James Rubin, Albright's spokesman, told reporters: ``We
regard that as a pathetic comparison that shows more about them
than anything else.''
	   Amnesty International welcomed the meeting because it
highlighted the issue of human rights in Malaysia.
	   ``It draws attention to the issue of detention for the
expression of political opinion,'' said John Kellock, the regional
representative for the London-based group, told the AP.
	   On Saturday, two top Canadian officials at the APEC forum also
met with Azizah. Other officials attending the summit also have
expressed the desire to meet with her, including the presidents of
Indonesia and the Philippines.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A British-flagged yacht caught fire Sunday
while anchored off an island near Athens. All seven passengers
escaped unharmed and swam about 500 meters (yards) before being
picked up by local fishing boats, news reports said.
	   The 13-meter Didimi was gutted by the fire. The cause of the
blaze was not immediately known. News reports said no distress
signal had been issued.
	   Three of the passengers were Greek, one was from the
Netherlands, two from the Philippines and one from Egypt, the
reports said.
	   The incident occurred off the south coast of Aegina, an island
about 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Athens.
	   A passing navy frigate spotted the fire but did not need to
intervene.

Cyclone threatens southern Indian state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ As many as 5,000 people were evacuated
from India's southeastern coastal districts Sunday and rescue
workers put on high alert after weather officials warned a cyclone
was likely to hit parts of Andhra Pradesh state in a few hours.
	   Already gales reaching a speed of 135 kilometers ( 80 miles) per
hour and heavy rains were lashing the coast, uprooting trees,
damaging buildings and inundating low-lying areas, local officials
said.
	   Officials of the meteorological department in the state capital
Hyderabad said the cyclone, currently over west central Bay of
Bengal, was almost touching the coast near the port city
Vishakhapatnam, 800 kilometers (480 miles) northeast of Hyderabad.
	   Power supply in Vishakhapatnam been shut off and communication
systems has been disrupted. Bus service to the north coastal
districts has been canceled.
	   Officials have warned the cyclone can cause heavy damages,
including destruction of electric and telecommunication
installations in the region.
	   Meanwhile, top officials in Andhra Pradesh have asked the air
force and navy to provide naval boats and helicopters for the
relief operations.
	   After floods in September, this is second time in less than two
months natural calamities have hit the state. Andhra Pradesh is
buffeted by cyclones every year. In 1996, a fierce cyclone killed
more than 2,000 people.

Arafat warns: ``our weapons are ready'' to pray in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite U.S. efforts to jump start the Wye
accord, rhetoric escalated Sunday with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat renewing threats to declare a state next May and warning
``our weapons are ready.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu countered that
Arafat's threats to bypass negotiations and declare as state cast a
``very dark shadow'' over the peace process.
	   In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a
group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning
work to pave a bypass road for Jewish settlers for which 40 acres
of Arab land were confiscated in the West Bank village of
al-Khader.
	   Some 30 soldiers beat back about 20 of the protesters who
responded with a hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets
and tear gas canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were
treated for tear gas inhalation including Palestinian lawmaker
Salah Tamari.
	   The sharpening rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross tried to
get both sides to implement the Wye River memorandum, which calls
for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange
for stepped up Palestinian security measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on
Sunday, and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were scheduled to
confer later in the day.
	   Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's sharpened language came
in response to Israeli threats to annex parts of the West Bank and
as a result of the delay in implementing the West Bank withdrawal
agreement. The first pullback had been slated for Monday, but
Israel said it would be delayed for a matter of ``days.''
	   Speaking to members of his Fatah faction in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Arafat was quoted by Palestinian reporters as saying:
``Our weapons are ready, and we are ready to use them if they ban
us from praying in Jerusalem.''
	   Defying Israel and the United States which have urged him to
drop the demand, Arafat said, ``we will declare our state on the
4th of May next year. This is our right....''
	   Arafat spoke to a group of Fatah officials from Jerusalem who
had been barred from holding a meeting earlier in the day in that
city by Israeli police.
	   Noting Arafat's renewed threats to declare a state, Netanyahu
told reporters that a final settlement should be reached in
negotiations, and Arafat's threats were undermining the Wye
agreement.
	   ``This endangers the entire Oslo agreement and casts a very dark
shadow over the Wye agreement, as well,'' he said. ``I suggest the
Palestinian Authority and its leadership refrain from these kind of
statements in order to facilitate the movement of the peace
process.''
	   Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said Israel would incorporate
areas under its control, such as Jewish settlements and army bases,
in response to any attempts to declare statehood unilaterally.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Arafat made a similar threat to establish a Palestinian state at
a rally in the West Bank town of Nablus on Saturday, the tenth
anniversary of his declaration of independence for Palestinians.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, the time table for implementing
the land-for-security accord has been delayed.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu called Arafat and told him there would
be a delay because of what has happened since the Wye summit last
month and the need for approval by the Israeli Knesset, which opens
a two-day debate on Monday.
	   ``There will be a few days delay in the withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from these areas,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated
Press.
	   He added that the first group of Palestinian prisoners would be
set free about the time Israel carries out a withdrawal from two
percent of the West Bank.
	   Jewish settlers got their first look at official maps of the
planned withdrawal on Sunday in a meeting with the four-member
Cabinet team overseeing the drafting of the maps.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ignoring warnings not to meddle in
Malaysian affairs, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Sunday with the wife of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim and called
him a ``highly respected leader.''
	   For 30 minutes, Albright met in her hotel room with Azizah
Ismail, who has sought international criticism for the way her
husband, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, has been treated
since he was arrested and put on trial.
	   Dressed in a turquoise Muslim scarf, Azizah appeared nervous
while entering and leaving the meeting, which drew huge crowds of
reporters and photographers from around the world.
	   ``I'm very happy with the meeting. We had a lot of support from
Secretary of State Albright,'' Azizah said, before being whisked
away by police escorts.
	   Albright, who arrived in Kuala Lumpur Saturday night for a
meeting of Pacific Rim nations, cut short her visit because of U.S.
tensions with Iraq. But she insisted on seeing Azizah before
meeting with Russian officials and returning to Washington on
Sunday night.
	   Azizah sat next to Albright and the two spoke quietly. U.S.
Ambassador John Mallott was also present.
	   ``She's very nice, very supportive and warm,'' Azizah told The
Associated Press by cellphone as she was being driven away from the
luxury hotel in the center of Kuala Lumpur. ``I can't say more, or
else I would,'' she said apologetically.
	   Earlier in the day, Albright expressed U.S. concern about the
Anwar case, specifically his alleged beating by police while being
jailed before his trial began two weeks ago on corruption and
sexual misconduct charges that he vehemently denies.
	   The government has adjourned the sensational trial during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which have drawn top
officials from 20 nations and Hong Kong to the Malaysian capital.
	   ``The U.S. has made clear a number of times that Anwar Ibrahim
is a highly respected leader,'' Albright said earlier Sunday.
	   ``The reporting on the trial of Anwar Ibrahim gives us great
concern. We hope very much he will receive due process and a fair
trial,'' Albright told reporters.
	   The secretary of state had said it should be ``perfectly
appropriate to meet with her,'' but Malaysia's objections were
clear in a sharp exchange that she had during a large ministerial
news conference with the country's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz.
	   ``Maybe if I go to the United States, I would like to meet Ken
Starr,'' she said, referring to the special prosecutor in the
Clinton sex scandal. ``Maybe with others, too,'' Rafidah said.
	   Albright, who was glowering, sniped, ``He is not in prison.''
	   Rafidah then added: ``To find out what is happening. I am
curious.''
	   She also assured Albright, somewhat sarcastically, that she
could ``sleep tight tonight'' knowing that Anwar will receive a
fair trial.
	   Standing at the back of the auditorium where the news conference
was held, James Rubin, Albright's spokesman, told reporters: ``We
regard that as a pathetic comparison that shows more about them
than anything else.''
	   Amnesty International welcomed the meeting because it

Hattori wins Itoen Ladies with record 19-under total
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHONAN, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori finished off a sizzling
65-66-66 run Sunday and won the Itoen Ladies with a 19-under-par
197, a record low for a 54-hole event in Japan.
	   ``I'm surprised too. I can't tell exactly what kept me in the
game throughout,'' said Hattori, who shot eight birdies and two
bogeys in Sunday's round. ``Anyway, I hit the ball straight and
close, and that set up easier putting lines.''
	   She finished 11 shots ahead of Kaori Higo and South Korean Ku
Ok-hee, who were 8 under at 208. Higo shot 70 and Ku 74 Sunday on
the 6,364-yard (5,791-meter), par-72 Great Island Club course.
	   Hattori's round of 197 beat the record of 199 set by Laura
Davies of England when she won the same tournament at the same
course in 1996.
	   Hattori, winner of the 1984 Japan Women's Amateur and the 1985
U.S. Women's Amateur Championships, started the final round with a
three-shot lead.
	   For her fifth title of the season, she received 10.8 million yen
(dlrs 86,400) from a purse of 60 million yen (dlrs 491,800).
	   The 30-year-old Hattori, who has won 12 tournaments in seven
years on the Japan Tour, is bidding for her first money earnings
title.
	   She leads this season's earnings with 78.68 million yen (dlrs
629,400), followed by Higo's 62.13 million yen (dlrs 497,000).
	   South Korean rookie Han Hee-won shot 69 for a share of fourth at
210 with Yuri Fudo, Fumiko Muraguchi and Kaori Harada.

Suspected Israeli spies detention extended by five days

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - Two Israelis arrested on suspicion of
spying had been telephoning an intelligence institute in Tel Aviv
just before being seized, a police prosecutor said in court Sunday.
	   The court ordered the two held for another five days after the
prosecutor, Andreas Naum, said he needed the time to complete
investigating ``a very serious case of spying.''
	   He added that investigations have already established that
shortly before their arrest just after midnight on Nov. 6 the two
men had been telephoning ``a specific inteligence institute whose
headquarters is in Tel Aviv.''
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Thursday that the two men
are agents of Mossad, the Israeli inteligence agency, and that they
were part of an inteligence operation near the small fishing port
of Ziyi.
	   Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents. Israel's
Foreign Ministry said only that rumors that the two were spying on
behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true. A ministry
statement added that the two were not acting against Cyprus, but
gave no further explanation.
	   Naum said the two men had been placed under surveillance on Nov.
6 a few hours after their arrival from Israel, ``following reports
of suspicious movements by Israelis in the Ziyi area.''
	   ``On the night of their arrest there was a very important
military operation in the area which had to be kept secret,'' he
added.
	   Naum added that the two men had refused to answer any questions
or otherwise cooperate with the investigation.
	   Lawyer Andis Triantafyllides said his clients, Udi Hargov, 27,
and Igal Damary, 47, deny they are spies.
	   ``They have no objection to being held for another five days,
particularly since the police have been acting speedily,'' he said.
	   Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the
island, are interested in gaining information on the planned
deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey has warned it prevent the deployment. Israel is
reportedly interested because the missiles' radar can monitor
aircraft movements throughout the eastern Mediterranean.
	   The two Israelis were brought to court in two separate police
vans. Coming out of the vans with their hands handcuffed behind
their backs both men bowed low to make it difficult for
photographers to see their faces.
	   Naum said a search of the apartment hired by the two men found
illegal radio scanners which were used to record police radio
traffic. It also found computers, tape recorders and maps of Cyprus
``with several localities marked in ink'' _ all military
installations.
	   The arrest has caused a strain in Cyprus-Israel relations, newly
repaired by last week's visit to the island by Ezer Weizman, the
first ever by an Israeli president.

Arafat renewing threats to declare a state next May and warning
``our weapons are ready.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu countered that
Arafat's threats to bypass negotiations and declare as state cast a
``very dark shadow'' over the peace process.
	   In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a
group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning
work to pave a bypass road for Jewish settlers for which 40 acres
of Arab land were confiscated in the West Bank village of
al-Khader.
	   Some 30 soldiers beat back about 20 of the protesters who
responded with a hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets
and tear gas canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were
treated for tear gas inhalation including Palestinian lawmaker
Salah Tamari.
	   The sharpening rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross tried to
get both sides to implement the Wye River memorandum, which calls
for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange
for stepped up Palestinian security measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on
Sunday, and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were scheduled to
confer later in the day.
	   Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's sharpened language came
in response to Israeli threats to annex parts of the West Bank and
as a result of the delay in implementing the West Bank withdrawal
agreement. The first pullback had been slated for Monday, but
Israel said it would be delayed for a matter of ``days.''
	   Speaking to members of his Fatah faction in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Arafat was quoted by Palestinian reporters as saying:
``Our weapons are ready, and we are ready to use them if they ban
us from praying in Jerusalem.''
	   Defying Israel and the United States which have urged him to
drop the demand, Arafat said, ``we will declare our state on the
4th of May next year. This is our right....''
	   Arafat spoke to a group of Fatah officials from Jerusalem who
had been barred from holding a meeting earlier in the day in that
city by Israeli police.
	   Noting Arafat's renewed threats to declare a state, Netanyahu
told reporters that a final settlement should be reached in
negotiations, and Arafat's threats were undermining the Wye
agreement.
	   ``This endangers the entire Oslo agreement and casts a very dark
shadow over the Wye agreement, as well,'' he said. ``I suggest the
Palestinian Authority and its leadership refrain from these kind of
statements in order to facilitate the movement of the peace
process.''
	   Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said Israel would incorporate
areas under its control, such as Jewish settlements and army bases,
in response to any attempts to declare statehood unilaterally.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Arafat made a similar threat to establish a Palestinian state at
a rally in the West Bank town of Nablus on Saturday, the tenth
anniversary of his declaration of independence for Palestinians.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, the time table for implementing
the land-for-security accord has been delayed.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu called Arafat and told him there would
be a delay because of what has happened since the Wye summit last
month and the need for approval by the Israeli Knesset, which opens
a two-day debate on Monday.
	   ``There will be a few days delay in the withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from these areas,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated
Press.
	   He added that the first group of Palestinian prisoners would be
set free about the time Israel carries out a withdrawal from two
percent of the West Bank.
	   Jewish settlers got their first look at official maps of the
planned withdrawal on Sunday in a meeting with the four-member
Cabinet team overseeing the drafting of the maps.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Spanish dancing takes Pilar Rioja all over the
world. But there's one place she keeps coming back to: The
Repertorio Espanol's 203-seat Gramercy Arts Theater.
	   This is her 26th year in New York. It also is the 100th
anniversary of the birth of Federico Garcia Lorca, the
poet-playwright to whom Ms. Rioja dedicates her work. Through an
interpreter, she repeats the word ``duende,'' or spirit, which he
used in an essay.
	   ``When you're very involved in what you're doing personally and,
at the same time able to communicate it to the audience, it's
'duende,''' she says.
	   More than that, she says, it is the inspiration that boils up in
a performer who takes chances on stage, instead of performing by
rote. ``It can only come if you can really fall flat on your
face,'' she says. ``Without that possibility of having a disaster,
it is not going to come around.''
	   Ms. Rioja would rather make a misstep than to mistake the mood.
``On stage,'' she says, ``you have to forget about technique and
feel the emotion.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean ship left Sunday with
96 milk cows to be donated to hunger-stricken North Korea, a
Seoul-based relief group said.
	   The Good Neighbors, a group that already had donated 104 milk
cows to the North in September, said its second relief ship left
Inchon port west of Seoul early Sunday and would arrive in the
North's Nampo port later in the day.
	   Earlier this year, South Korea's largest conglomerate, Hyundai,
donated 1,001 head of cattle to North Korea.
	   So far, South Korea has given its rival North Korea dlrs 315
million in food aid since the communist country turned to the
international community to feed its 22 million people in 1995.
	   North Korea has suffered dire food shortages after three years
of disastrous weather that aggravated problems caused by
inefficient farming techniques.

Albright meets wife of jailed politician in Malaysia

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ignoring warnings not to meddle in
Malaysian affairs, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Sunday with the wife of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim and called
him a ``highly respected leader.''
	   For 30 minutes, Albright met in her hotel room with Azizah
Ismail, who has sought international criticism for the way her
husband, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, has been treated
since he was arrested and put on trial.
	   Dressed in a turquoise Muslim scarf, Azizah appeared nervous
while entering and leaving the meeting, which drew huge crowds of
reporters and photographers from around the world.
	   ``I'm very happy with the meeting. We had a lot of support from
Secretary of State Albright,'' Azizah said, before being whisked
away by police escorts.
	   Albright, who arrived in Kuala Lumpur Saturday night for a
meeting of Pacific Rim nations, cut short her visit because of U.S.
tensions with Iraq. But she insisted on seeing Azizah before
meeting with Russian officials and returning to Washington on
Sunday night.
	   Azizah sat next to Albright and the two spoke quietly. U.S.
Ambassador John Mallott was also present.
	   ``She's very nice, very supportive and warm,'' Azizah told The
Associated Press by cellphone as she was being driven away from the
luxury hotel in the center of Kuala Lumpur. ``I can't say more, or
else I would,'' she said apologetically.
	   Azizah told Albright her main concern was that ``her husband
wants to be assured that this case remains before the court of
world opinion,'' said a U.S. official, who briefed reporters on the
meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier in the day, Albright expressed U.S. concern about the
Anwar case, specifically his alleged beating by police while being
jailed before his trial began two weeks ago on corruption and
sexual misconduct charges that he vehemently denies.
	   The government has adjourned the sensational trial during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which have drawn top
officials from 20 nations and Hong Kong to the Malaysian capital.
	   ``The U.S. has made clear a number of times that Anwar Ibrahim
is a highly respected leader,'' Albright said earlier Sunday.
	   ``The reporting on the trial of Anwar Ibrahim gives us great
concern. We hope very much he will receive due process and a fair
trial,'' Albright told reporters.
	   The secretary of state had said it should be ``perfectly
appropriate to meet with her,'' but Malaysia's objections were
clear in a sharp exchange that she had during a large ministerial
news conference with the country's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz.
	   ``Maybe if I go to the United States, I would like to meet Ken
Starr,'' she said, referring to the special prosecutor in the
Clinton sex scandal. ``Maybe with others, too,'' Rafidah said.
	   Albright, who was glowering, sniped, ``He is not in prison.''
	   Rafidah then added: ``To find out what is happening. I am
curious.''
	   She also assured Albright, somewhat sarcastically, that she
could ``sleep tight tonight'' knowing that Anwar will receive a
fair trial.
	   Standing at the back of the auditorium where the news conference
was held, James Rubin, Albright's spokesman, told reporters: ``We
regard that as a pathetic comparison that shows more about them
than anything else.''
	   Amnesty International welcomed the meeting because it
highlighted the issue of human rights in Malaysia.
	   ``It draws attention to the issue of detention for the
expression of political opinion,'' said John Kellock, the regional
representative for the London-based group, told the AP.
	   On Saturday, two top Canadian officials at the APEC forum also
met with Azizah. Other officials attending the summit have
expressed the desire to meet with her, including the presidents of
Indonesia and the Philippines.

U.S. military facility key issue in Japanese gubernatorial
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with polls closed, results not expected until after
1500 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters on a southern Japanese island began casting
ballots Sunday in a closely watched gubernatorial race pitting an
incumbent opposed to the U.S. military presence in Okinawa against
a challenger who is more flexible on the issue.
	   Governor Masahide Ota, supported by Japan's largest opposition
party, hopes to win a third four-year term. Main challenger Keiichi
Inamine is the candidate of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Polls closed at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT). Results were expected after
midnight (1500 GMT).
	   The central issue of the campaign involves the implementation of
a 1996 U.S.-Japan agreement to move a U.S. Marine Corps facility
from a crowded Okinawan city to a more remote location.
	   Aimed at easing the American military burden on Okinawa, the
centerpiece of the accord calls for the closure of Futenma Air
Station in five to seven years as long as a suitable replacement is
built elsewhere.
	   The government has proposed building a floating heliport off the
coast of Nago, a central Okinawan city north of the capital of
Naha. But Ota, 73, wants the facility moved to another part of
Japan or outside the country entirely.
	   The 65-year-old Inamine backs a plan calling for the military
heliport to be incorporated into a new airport in northern Okinawa
that would also be open to civilian air traffic.
	   In February, a supporter of plans to build the floating heliport
narrowly won a mayoral election in Nago.
	   Two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are concentrated
on Okinawa, which accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's total
land area. Longstanding opposition to the military presence in
Japan exploded in 1995 when three U.S. servicemen raped a
12-year-old Okinawan girl.

Turkey warns against granting asylum to Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy
for the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan,
warning Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening
doors to terrorism.''
	   In Rome, Kurds demonstrated by the hundreds outside the military
hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held. Kurds arrived from
Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and a
Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike.
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday in Rome as soon as he stepped off a
plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently
fleeing his hideout in Syria.
	   He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has
been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since
1984. The conflict has killed nearly 37,000 people.
	   Turkey considers him its most-wanted criminal.
	   ``If Western European nations open their arms (to the rebels)
they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' Deputy
Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
	   ``If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday
it will be opening its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added,
referring to Italy's handling of brawls that broke out among the
Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on Saturday.
	   Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has
heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there
have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has
consistently refused to extradite anyone if there were even a risk
of capital punishment.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a
meeting of European defense and foreign ministers. He criticized an
Italian Justice Ministry official, who reportedly said Turkey's
extradition request would be refused.
	   ``To announce the results of an extradition trial that has not
yet even begun, does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told
reporters before his departure. He said he would tell Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini ``that we expect a serious and fair
approach.''
	   Ocalan, a political science dropout from Ankara university,
founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group
toward armed struggle in 1984, finding fertile ground among poor
Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ignoring warnings not to meddle in
Malaysian affairs, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Sunday with the wife of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim and called
him a ``highly respected leader.''
	   For 30 minutes, Albright met in her hotel room with Azizah
Ismail, who has sought international criticism for the way her
husband, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, has been treated
since he was arrested and put on trial.
	   Dressed in a turquoise Muslim scarf, Azizah appeared nervous
while entering and leaving the meeting, which drew huge crowds of
reporters and photographers from around the world.
	   ``I'm very happy with the meeting. We had a lot of support from
Secretary of State Albright,'' Azizah said, before being whisked
away by police escorts.
	   Albright, who arrived in Kuala Lumpur Saturday night for a
meeting of Pacific Rim nations, cut short her visit because of U.S.
tensions with Iraq. But she insisted on seeing Azizah before
meeting with Russian officials and returning to Washington on
Sunday night.
	   Azizah sat next to Albright and the two spoke quietly. U.S.
Ambassador John Mallott was also present.
	   ``She's very nice, very supportive and warm,'' Azizah told The
Associated Press by cellphone as she was being driven away from the
luxury hotel in the center of Kuala Lumpur. ``I can't say more, or
else I would,'' she said apologetically.
	   Azizah told Albright her main concern was that ``her husband
wants to be assured that this case remains before the court of
world opinion,'' said a U.S. official, who briefed reporters on the
meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier in the day, Albright expressed U.S. concern about the
Anwar case, specifically his alleged beating by police while being
jailed before his trial began two weeks ago on corruption and
sexual misconduct charges that he vehemently denies.
	   The government has adjourned the sensational trial during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which have drawn top
officials from 20 nations and Hong Kong to the Malaysian capital.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told the
national news agency Sunday that Albright should not interfere with
the country's affairs by meeting with Azizah.
	   ``The U.S. has made clear a number of times that Anwar Ibrahim
is a highly respected leader,'' Albright said earlier Sunday.
	   ``The reporting on the trial of Anwar Ibrahim gives us great
concern. We hope very much he will receive due process and a fair
trial,'' Albright told reporters.
	   The secretary of state had said it should be ``perfectly
appropriate to meet with her,'' but Malaysia's objections were
clear in a sharp exchange that she had during a large ministerial
news conference with the country's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz.
	   ``Maybe if I go to the United States, I would like to meet Ken
Starr,'' she said, referring to the special prosecutor in the
Clinton sex scandal. ``Maybe with others, too,'' Rafidah said.
	   Albright, who was glowering, sniped, ``He is not in prison.''
	   Rafidah then added: ``To find out what is happening. I am
curious.''
	   She also assured Albright, somewhat sarcastically, that she
could ``sleep tight tonight'' knowing that Anwar will receive a
fair trial.
	   Standing at the back of the auditorium where the news conference
was held, James Rubin, Albright's spokesman, told reporters: ``We
regard that as a pathetic comparison that shows more about them
than anything else.''
	   Amnesty International welcomed the meeting because it
highlighted the issue of human rights in Malaysia.
	   ``It draws attention to the issue of detention for the
expression of political opinion,'' said John Kellock, the regional
representative for the London-based group, told the AP.
	   On Saturday, two top Canadian officials at the APEC forum also
met with Azizah. Other officials attending the summit have
expressed the desire to meet with her, including the presidents of
Indonesia and the Philippines.

Train workers strike in southern France, bus drivers in the west

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking train workers in Marseille held talks with
management Sunday, but service was seriously disrupted in parts of
southern France on the fifth day of a rail strike in the port city.
	   Only one out of five regional lines was running Sunday. Traffic
on long-distance routes was normal, although some delays were
reported.
	   The striking workers want the national rail company to hire 30
extra train conductors by the end of the year. A majority of train
conductors in Marseille support the walkout.
	   Talks between workers and management have been tense. On
Saturday, strikers sequestered six railway officials for several
hours before letting them go.
	   Meanwhile, in nearby Avignon, train conductors said they would
stage a one-day walkout on Tuesday.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ His palace under heavy guard following
riots and protests, President B.J. Habibie on Sunday stood by his
military chief despite outrage over the shooting deaths of at least
five students in clashes with riot officers.
	   Police, meanwhile, took two opposition figures from their homes
for questioning after Habibie ordered the military to get tough on
those he has accused of trying to overthrow his 6-month-old
government.
	   The activists are former political prisoner and politician Sri
Bintang Pamungkas and retired Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris, who has
campaigned to replace Habibie with a transitional government led by
a presidium of community leaders.
	   Two other pro-democracy activists were questioned Saturday and
later released.
	   The streets of Jakarta were quiet Sunday after rampaging mobs
burned buildings and cars and attacked police during riots a day
earlier that were triggered by the killings of the students.
	   Several security personnel, pro-government civilian guards and
others were also killed, bringing the death toll to at least 16
since Thursday.
	   The unrest was the worst in the Indonesian capital since May,
when much heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat
authoritarian leader Suharto after three decades in power.
	   Mobs vented their fury at the military, shouting taunts and
hurling stones at police vehicles. At Parliament, thousands of
student protesters shouted slogans against Gen. Wiranto, head of an
armed forces tainted by human rights abuses.
	   ``Hang Wiranto!'' they chanted before dispersing Saturday night.
	   Civic leaders urged the resignation of Wiranto, a former
adjutant to Suharto who has been struggling to clean up the
military's image. The student killings were a blow to his efforts.
	   ``It is unlikely that the president will fire Gen. Wiranto
because it is not his style,'' a presidential aide, Dewi Fortuna
Anwar, said Sunday.
	   Habibie relies heavily on the support of the politically
powerful military.
	   In a meeting with local journalists Sunday, Wiranto expressed
regret for the shootings of the students and promised to take
action against officers involved.
	   Backed by armored personnel carriers and small tanks, Wiranto's
troops ringed the presidential palace and Parliament. One
stick-wielding mob roamed as close as a few blocks from the palace.
	   Students planned to resume protests Monday against Habibie, a
one-time protege of Suharto who is promising democratic reforms but
is suspected by opponents of maneuvering to stay in power.
	   Students timed their demonstrations to coincide with a meeting
last week of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, which agreed to hold parliamentary elections
in May or June and make other political reforms.
	   Yet the assembly, filled with holdovers from the Suharto era,
lacks credibility among students.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network, Habibie suggested that
students had been manipulated by his opponents. He said the
students had been given ``garbage from an information system that
is doing things that are irresponsible.''
	   He also said the mob unrest, much of it carried out by youths
with no apparent political agenda, would only impede democratic
change. Student violence has been largely confined to
stone-throwing at troops.
	   ``Demonstration must not mean burning houses or shops, killing
other people. That is not the aim of any kind of democracy,''
Habibie said in the interview broadcast Sunday.
	   Warning of the possibility of more unrest, Australia urged its
citizens not to travel to Indonesia. Many foreign embassies told
their citizens to stay off the streets.
	   On Sunday, about 20 students wearing black armbands laid
wreathes at the site of a clash where their friends died.
	   Civilians patrolled neighborhoods, some of them closed off with
barricades of trash carts and barbed wire. Shopkeepers swept up
broken glass from smashed windows that had been repaired recently
in the wake of the May riots.
	   Also Sunday, witnesses said two villagers were killed by stray
bullets during a gunfight between separatist rebels and police in
the northernmost Indonesian province of Aceh. The military has been
accused of widespread abuses in the region.

Kuwaitis not interested in another rerun of the old Saddam movie

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Iraqi defiance leads to a U.S. military buildup,
then to a last-minute diplomatic solution. Saddam Hussein's small
neighbor has repeatedly lived this scenario _ and feared its
consequences _ since the Gulf War.
	   But this time around, very few seem to be alarmed or even
bothered.
	   ``People are sick of this song and dance,'' said Masouma
al-Mubarak, political science teacher at Kuwait University. ``They
want a solution, an end to this situation with Saddam as a source
of tension in the area.''
	   In February, during the last crisis between Iraq and the United
Nations, Kuwaitis stocked up on food and water. Some sealed rooms
against a possible retaliatory Iraqi attack with chemical or
biological weapons. Others even bought gas masks.
	   ``We got used to this,'' Jamal al-Naki, a 40-year-old Kuwaiti,
explained at he selected fresh vegetables at a supermarket. He was
not buying anything extra.
	   But al-Naki and some newspapers also expressed bitterness at
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over his army's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
	   ``This time they will get him. He will be their target,''
al-Naki told the Associated Press.
	   And columnist Fouad al-Hashem, anticipating an attack, wrote in
the Sunday edition of the daily Al-Watan: ``Saddam, his family, his
cronies and his Baath Party will have dug their own graves. We will
shovel dirt on them and their history.''
	   For the past week, however, most Kuwaitis have been more
concerned about winning the Gulf soccer cup _ which they did.
	   As more American soldiers prepared to deploy in the region,
Friday, young Kuwaitis danced in the streets and waved flags to
greet the returning champions.
	   Around 2,000 U.S. soldiers are in Kuwait training in the desert
or maintaining equipment prepositioned to protect the country.
	   On Sunday, the Cabinet was informed of contingency plans should
there be air strikes on Iraq, but the plans were not made public.
The country's tiny military is on alert, but a Defense Ministry
spokesman told the AP the measure was ``precautionary.''
	   Officials have urged Iraq to rescind its decision to halt
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors but have made it a point to
stay out of any confrontation. Defense Minister Sheik Salem
al-Sabah said last week that Kuwait was ``not a party'' to the
tensions.
	   Some U.S. Embassy families have made plans to depart, but there
are no signs of widespread panic among Kuwait's 8,000 American
residents, who were advised to consider leaving by the State
Department.
	   Still, the Kuwaitis' public nonchalance has brought one warning
_ from a columnist for a pro-government daily.
	   ``This repeated heating and cooling should not become like the
famous `cry wolf' story,'' wrote Sami al-Nisf. ``We should not take
it easy because nothing has happened in the past, only to be caught
unprepared.''

China hoping for Indonesian stability: official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is concerned over the unrest that has
rocked Indonesia in recent days, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said in a statement Sunday.
	   ``As a close friendly neighbor of Indonesia, China sincerely
hopes that Indonesia will be able to maintain political and social
stability, and that its people of all ethnic groups will live in
peace and work in contentment,'' Tang said in the statement
reported on state-run television and other official media.
	   China has repeatedly appealed for an end to the strife in
Indonesia that has led to attacks on ethnic Chinese, who are
resented for their economic success.
	   The latest Chinese statement was in reaction to riots triggered
by the killings of five students involved in protests against the
6-month-old government of President B.J. Habibie.

Suspected Israeli spies detention extended by five days

	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - Two Israelis arrested on suspicion of
spying had been telephoning an intelligence institute in Tel Aviv
just before being seized, a police prosecutor said in court Sunday.
	   The court ordered the two held for another five days after the
prosecutor, Andreas Naum, said he needed the time to complete
investigating ``a very serious case of spying.''
	   He added that investigations have already established that
shortly before their arrest just after midnight on Nov. 6 the two
men had been telephoning ``a specific inteligence institute whose
headquarters is in Tel Aviv.''
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Thursday that the two men
are agents of Mossad, the Israeli inteligence agency, and that they
were part of an inteligence operation near the small fishing port
of Ziyi.
	   Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents. Israel's
Foreign Ministry said only that rumors that the two were spying on
behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true. A ministry
statement added that the two were not acting against Cyprus, but
gave no further explanation.
	   Naum said the two men had been placed under surveillance on Nov.
6 a few hours after their arrival from Israel, ``following reports
of suspicious movements by Israelis in the Ziyi area.''
	   ``On the night of their arrest there was a very important
military operation in the area which had to be kept secret,'' he
added.
	   Naum added that the two men had refused to answer any questions
or otherwise cooperate with the investigation.
	   Lawyer Andis Triantafyllides said his clients, Udi Hargov, 27,
and Igal Damary, 47, deny they are spies.
	   ``They have no objection to being held for another five days,
particularly since the police have been acting speedily,'' he said.
	   Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the
island, are interested in gaining information on the planned
deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey has warned it prevent the deployment. Israel is
reportedly interested because the missiles' radar can monitor
aircraft movements throughout the eastern Mediterranean.
	   The two Israelis were brought to court in two separate police
vans. Coming out of the vans with their hands handcuffed behind
their backs both men bowed low to make it difficult for
photographers to see their faces.
	   Naum said a search of the apartment hired by the two men found
illegal radio scanners which were used to record police radio
traffic. It also found computers, tape recorders and maps of Cyprus
``with several localities marked in ink'' _ all military
installations.
	   The arrest has caused a strain in Cyprus-Israel relations, newly
repaired by last week's visit to the island by Ezer Weizman, the
first ever by an Israeli president.

Arafat warns: ``our weapons are ready'' to pray in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat threats to use arms, Netanyahu quotes, and
clash &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite U.S. efforts to jump start the new
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, rhetoric escalated
Sunday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat renewing threats to
declare a state next May and warning ``our weapons are ready.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu countered that
Arafat's threats to bypass negotiations and declare a state cast a
``very dark shadow'' over the peace process.
	   In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a
group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning
work to pave a road for Jewish settlers. Israel had confiscated 40
acres (16 hectares) of Arab land in the West Bank village of
al-Khader for the road.
	   Some 30 soldiers beat back about 20 of the protesters, who
responded with a hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets
and tear gas canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were
treated for tear gas inhalation including Palestinian lawmaker
Salah Tamari.
	   The sharpening rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross tried to
get both sides to implement the Wye River memorandum, which calls
for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange
for stepped up Palestinian security measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on
Sunday, and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were scheduled to
confer later in the day.
	   Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's sharpened language came
in response to Israeli threats to annex parts of the West Bank and
as a result of the delay in implementing the West Bank withdrawal
agreement. The first pullback had been slated for Monday, but
Israel said it would be delayed for a matter of ``days.''
	   Speaking to members of his Fatah faction in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Arafat was quoted by Palestinian reporters as saying:
``Our weapons are ready, and we are ready to use them if they ban
us from praying in Jerusalem.''
	   Defying Israel and the United States which have urged him to
drop the demand, Arafat said, ``we will declare our state on the
4th of May next year. This is our right....''
	   Arafat spoke to a group of Fatah officials from Jerusalem who
had been barred from holding a meeting earlier in the day in that
city by Israeli police.
	   Noting Arafat's renewed threats to declare a state, Netanyahu
told reporters that a final settlement should be reached in
negotiations, and Arafat's threats were undermining the Wye
agreement.
	   ``This endangers the entire Oslo agreement and casts a very dark
shadow over the Wye agreement, as well,'' he said. ``I suggest the
Palestinian Authority and its leadership refrain from these kind of
statements in order to facilitate the movement of the peace
process.''
	   Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said Israel would incorporate
areas under its control, such as Jewish settlements and army bases,
in response to any attempts to declare statehood unilaterally.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, the time table for implementing
the land-for-security accord has been delayed.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu called Arafat and told him there would
be a delay because of what has happened since the Wye summit last
month and the need for approval by the Israeli Knesset, which opens
a two-day debate on Monday.
	   He added that the first group of Palestinian prisoners would be
set free about the time Israel carries out a withdrawal from two
percent of the West Bank.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed Sunday
to achieve a landmark agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5
trillion in global trade, but did manage to keep the effort from
totally collapsing.
	   The fight now goes to the World Trade Organization where the
hope is to eventually overcome stiff Japanese resistance to cutting
tariffs in two sectors its considers politically sensitive _ wood
and fish products.
	   The United States, which had pushed the hardest to force Japan
to agree to slash tariffs in all nine sectors of the proposed
agreement, reluctantly accepted the outcome as the best Washington
could get at the moment.
	   Seeking to put the best face on the failure to achieve a
breakthrough, U.S. officials insisted that it was at least a
partial victory that the whole effort did not collapse.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said that other
nations could have easily decided, without Japan's participation in
wood and fish, that they would pull their own tariff cuts off the
table, causing the deal to unravel.
	   ``Two days ago, we felt there was a high probability that the
whole initiative would collapse,'' Barshefsky told reporters.
``From our point of view, moving forward is the key.''
	   The trade ministers negotiating for the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum agreed to take their latest offers to the
Geneva-based WTO, in hope of attracting other countries outside the
region to the effort to slash tariffs in products ranging from
chemicals to medical equipment.
	   The hope also is that Japan will eventually agreed to reduce
their wood and paper barriers. But the Japanese did not signal any
immediate willingness to compromise.
	   ``We managed to protect the two sectors,'' a Japanese official
told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But we will
likely continue to face pressure during the WTO process.''
	   ``It is not the best way forward, but it is a way forward _ to
move all nine sectors to the WTO,'' Australian Trade Minister Tim
Fischer told a news conference.
	   The hope of APEC is that the nine sectors will serve as an early
down payment to the ultimate goal of achieving a total free trade
zone in the region by 2020. This year's interim target was seen as
crucial to provide confidence to financial markets that Asian
countries are not turning inward and becoming protectionist,
despite being buffeted by the worst economic crisis to hit the
region in 50 years.
	   On Tuesday and Wednesday, leaders of the 21 APEC members will
meet in Kuala Lumpur to endorse the work done on the trade
initiative, plus review an action plan being put together to deal
with reforms intended to halt the current financial turmoil and
prevent it from occurring in the future.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton canceled his visit to the APEC
summit to remain in Washington and deal with the Iraqi crisis. He
will be represented by Vice President Al Gore.
	   The APEC meetings were nearly sidelined Sunday by America's
efforts to gain widespread support for a possible military attack
on Iraq for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In another development, Malaysian demonstrators hit the streets
for the second day running, demanding the resignation of Mahathir
and siding with Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, his deputy and finance minister, then had
him jailed after Anwar led a reform movement.
	   Ignoring objections from the Malaysian government, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Sunday with Anwar's wife,
Azizah Ismail, and called him a ``highly respected leader.''
	   Azizah, who is seeking international criticism for the way her
husband was allegedly beaten by his guards in prison, praised the
meeting as highly beneficial to her cause.
	   Mahathir said he regretted Clinton would not attend the APEC
summit, saying he would have liked the American president to see
for himself that the streets of the capital were calm.
	   But soon after Mahathir's speech, riot police sprayed water
cannons to break up a noisy protest by 200 people demanding his
resignation. On Saturday night, 3,000 people demonstrated and
marched toward the hotel where the U.S. delegation is staying,
screaming ``Clinton, save us from Mahathir!''
	   Several undercover policemen fired shots in the air, but no
serious injuries were reported.
	   Protesters have been calling for Mahathir's ouster since he
fired Anwar, his one-time protege who is standing trial on charges
of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   In a speech to international business leaders attending a
meeting on the sidelines of the APEC forum, Mahathir took aim at
Clinton over the standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I'd always hoped we could settle such problems with
negotiations,'' Mahathir said. ``Iraq is not an easy country, but
lobbing bombs and grenades will not do anything to solve this
problem.''
	   China and Russia also refused to condone air strikes against
Iraq as the only acceptable response to Saddam's refusal to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Mahathir has had to face many setbacks surrounding the economic
summit that was supposed to showcase his leadership and enormous
economic progress in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have said they
would refuse the customary courtesy calls on the host of the APEC
summit, angered by the treatment given Anwar.

Suspected Israeli spies detention extended by five days

	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis arrested on suspicion of
spying had been telephoning an intelligence institute in Tel Aviv
just before being seized, a police prosecutor said in court Sunday.
	   The court ordered the two held for another five days after the
prosecutor, Andreas Naum, said he needed the time to complete
investigating ``a very serious case of spying.''
	   He added that investigations have already established that
shortly before their arrest just after midnight on Nov. 6 the two
men had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose
headquarters is in Tel Aviv.''
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Thursday that the two men are
agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they
were part of an intelligence operation near the small fishing port
of Ziyi.
	   Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents. Israel's
Foreign Ministry said only that rumors that the two were spying on
behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true. A ministry
statement added that the two were not acting against Cyprus, but
gave no further explanation.
	   Naum said the two men had been placed under surveillance Nov. 6
a few hours after their arrival from Israel, ``following reports of
suspicious movements by Israelis in the Ziyi area.''
	   ``On the night of their arrest there was a very important
military operation in the area which had to be kept secret,'' he
added.
	   Naum added that the two men had refused to answer any questions
or otherwise cooperate with the investigation.
	   Lawyer Andis Triantafyllides said his clients, Udi Hargov, 27,
and Igal Damary, 47, deny they are spies.
	   Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the
island, are interested in gaining information on the planned
deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.

Deported Turkish juvenile delinquent placed in Istanbul youth home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A German-born Turkish juvenile delinquent
deported to Istanbul, Turkey, over the weekend was placed in a
youth home after German diplomats failed to contact his relatives.
	   Muhlis Ari _ known in the German media as ``Mehmet'' _ was flown
to Istanbul from Munich on Saturday, one day after Germany's
highest court upheld Bavarian state officials in revoking the boy's
residency permit for his long history of vandalism, fights and
petty thefts.
	   The controversial deportation followed months of debate and
legal wrangling over whether the state had the right to deport the
14-year-old, who feels himself to be German but is not a citizen. A
1913 law bases citizenship on German blood ties and not place of
birth.
	   Seeking to better integrate the foreigners who make up one-tenth
of Germany's 75 million people, the newly elected government
recently agreed to ease the law to allow dual citizenship.
	   ``Mehmet had had double citizenship, he would have been treated
like any other German youth,'' said a member of German parliament,
Cem Ozdemir, who is of Turkish decent.
	   The new law has yet to be drafted and approved, but Ozdemir said
many of Germany's 2 million Turks _ such as Ari's parents, who have
lived and worked for 30 years in Germany _ are eager to take
advantage of it.
	   The legal expert for the ruling Social Democrats, however, said
the new law could not be applied retroactively to help Ari's case.
	   Prosecutors questioned Ari briefly on arrival in Istanbul and
released him after determining he had committed no crimes in
Turkey, police at Istanbul Ataturk said Sunday.
	   He was put in a juvenile home until relatives, believed to be
living in Tekirdag, Turkey, about 130 kilometers (78 miles) from
Istanbul, come to claim him.

Blair says he gave order to attack Iraq _ and still ready
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Blair speaking at Downing Street;
alters overline to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday he gave
orders to British warplanes to attack Iraq on Saturday, but the
strike was called off when Iraq promised to allow U.N. weapons
inspections unconditionally.
	   ``This is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance
is guaranteed and delivered,'' said Blair, speaking outside his
Downing Street office after a stream of phone calls into the early
hours with U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.N. officials.
	   Blair said that unless Iraq delivered he would not hesitate to
order strikes again.
	   ``There will be no warning whatsoever,'' said Blair.
	   In Washington, the U.S. Administration said Saturday that waves
of American bombers had also headed toward the Gulf to strike.
	   Blair's aides said British warplanes would have provided
one-fifth of the air power for an allied attack on Saturday.
	   Britain, America's most hawkish ally over Iraq, has sent 12
Tornado fighter-bombers to Kuwait, and has two antisubmarine
frigates, HMS Cumberland and HMS Grafton in the Gulf region. HMS
Grafton carries Sea Wolf and Harpoon missiles.
	   ``This thing is not over yet, until we have every single bit of
this bolted down and in place. We remain ready, willing and able to
strike at any point in time,'' said Blair. ``The inspectors have
got to carry out their work without any hindrance ... we know from
our long experience that Saddam Hussein is not a person we can
trust.''
	   Blair denied that Britain and the United States were out of step
with other members of the U.N. Security Council _ less dismissive
of an initial Iraqi letter which seemed to link the resumption of
weapons inspections to ending U.N. sanctions.
	   ``Without our preparedness to use force, Saddam Hussein would
not be climbing down at all,'' said Blair. ``... There is no way we
can allow him to develop these weapons of mass destruction.''
	   Blair spoke nine times with President Bill Clinton and other top
U.S. officials through Saturday and the early hours Sunday, said a
spokesman at his Downing Street office.
	   Earlier, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that the ``basis of a
decision is going to be, does Saddam mean this?''
	   Cook added that Saddam was the loser because he had to accept
the return of U.N. weapons inspectors, the continuation of
sanctions and know that if he breaks his word this time ``there
will be a solidarity of support for international action.''

Russia begins withdrawing women and children from Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS defense minister quote in new 6th graf.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fearing Western air strikes against Iraq, Moscow
began withdrawing some Russian personnel from Baghdad on Sunday, a
government spokesman said.
	   More than 100 people, mostly employees of the Russian embassy in
Iraq and some of their family members, left for the city of
Kermanshah in Iran by bus, the duty officer at the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   The ministry sent two planes to Kermanshah to pick up the
Russian citizens, who were expected to arrive in Moscow late Sunday
or Monday.
	   Despite the evacuation, Russia thinks that the standoff with
Iraq will be resolved without air strikes.
	   ``There are good prospects for a political settlement of the
crisis,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, on a visit to Syria,
also condemned the idea of air strikes, saying they ``will be
counterproductive,'' Interfax reported.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein halted United Nations' monitoring of
weapons sites Oct. 31. But the latest crisis has been building
since Aug. 5 when Iraq prohibited field inspections for nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.
	   Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. Saturday saying arms inspectors
could return, but the United States has said it fails to meet
American conditions to resume checks.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations
with the West.

Russia's space station could stay in orbit until 2000, official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Mir space station will stay in orbit
until the end of 1999 or the start of 2000, and possibly longer, an
official said Sunday.
	   Earlier government estimates said the aging Mir, which has been
in orbit for more than ten years, would be decommissioned in the
middle of next year. Russian space officials insist it could stay
up for another two years.
	   Presidential aide Yevgeny Shaposhnikov said Mir's life
expectancy depends on scheduling for the launch of a Russian
service module for an international space station project, set for
mid-summer, 1999. Mir would stay in orbit for a few months after.
	   The United States and other countries want Russia to dedicate
all its resources to the International Space Station, which has
been delayed by funding shortages on the Russian side.
	   NASA is paying the Russian Space Agency up to $60 million to
make sure it completes a service module, scheduled for launch in
the middle of next year, on time.
	   Astronauts and cosmonauts cannot live on the space station until
the service module and its life-support systems are in orbit.
	   It costs Russia about 225 million rubles (dlrs 13.6 million)
each year to keep the Mir in orbit. But Russia's sentimental
attachment to the Mir has made it tough to let go of the
accident-prone station.
	   Meanwhile, Sunday was the 10th anniversary of the launch of the
Buran spaceship, one of the last efforts in the space race between
the Soviet Union and the United States.
	   Russia sunk millions of rubles (millions of dollars) in the
Buran ships, modeled after U.S. space shuttles. An unmanned Buran
circled the earth twice in a test flight in 1988, but the project
was scrapped without any further launches because of lack of funds.

Fiji's Vijay Singh wins Super Tour tournament by two strokes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHENZHEN, China (AP) _ Fiji's Vijay Singh tied the course record
with a 10-under-par 62 Sunday for a two-stroke victory over last
year's champion, Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, in a golf tournament
played in four different countries.
	   Singh finished the Johnnie Walker Super Tour at 19-under 269
after earlier rounds of 70 at the Palm Resort and Country Club in
Malaysia, 66 at the Thai Country Club in Bangkok and 71 at the Ta
Shee course in Taipei, Taiwan.
	   His 62 on the 6,970-yard course at the Mission Hills Golf Club
in Shenzhen, southern China, tied the course record set by Japan's
Hisayui Sasaki at the 1995 World Cup of Golf.
	   He collected dlrs 100,000 from a purse of dlrs 350,000.
	   Parnevik, who led Singh by two strokes after the third round,
shot a 6-under 66 in Shenzhen and finished at 271, good for dlrs
60,000.
	   ``I started really well and I am delighted to win this
tournament,'' said Singh, who won the PGA Championship earlier this
season and the Sprint International a week later.
	   South African Ernie Els shot a 69 and finished third at 278, one
stroke ahead of Brian Watts. The American also shot a 69 Sunday.
	   Felix Casas of the Philippines had a 71, finishing fifth at 282.
Thailand's Prayad Marksaeng was sixth at 285 after slipping to a 74
Sunday.
	   Taiwan's Michael Chang shot a 75 for 286, and Malaysia's
Marimuthu Ramayah had a 76 for 291.
	   Britain's Laura Davies, the only woman in the tournament, had a
disastrous 78 for a four-round 308.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed on
Sunday to reach an agreement on the terms a massive trade pact to
cut tariffs in nine key industries.
	   The 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
said they would now submit the trade proposal to the World Trade
Organization for resolution. The pact would lift tariffs on dlrs
1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   Trade and foreign ministers from the APEC meeting over the
weekend in the Malaysia capital had hoped to conclude the pact for
APEC leaders to sign during their summit meeting Tuesday and
Wednesday. But the leaders will now be requested to approve a
ministers' statement asking the WTO to try to do that instead.
	   ``I think the financial crisis has had a chilling effect on the
package that we put together last year,'' said Canadian Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi.
	   ``There's not enough of a critical mass here. So the package
essentially goes to the WTO, and ultimately to New Zealand,'' where
APEC leaders will meet next year, Marchi said.
	   APEC leaders in Vancouver, Canada, last year agreed to reduce
tariffs in nine sectors by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate
goal of free trade in the Pacific by 2020.
	   But that was before Japan and the United States, the world's two
largest economies, began arguing over some provisions.
	   Japan has refused to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _
forestry products and fish _ at a time when its economy is in its
worst recession since World War II.
	   The United States believed that Japan had to be on board in all
nine sectors to give the pact weight. Washington had argued that it
would send a strong signal that Asia was not turning protectionist,
despite its worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   ``The basis for the choice was that every APEC economy gains
something, every APEC economy would have to give something. But
overall those nine sectors provided APEC as a whole significant
balance,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told a
news conference.
	   ``Obviously the United States would have wished that Japan, as
all of the other countries, had agreed to cut tariffs now on fish
and forestry,'' she said.
	   Japan emphasized that APEC ground rules say the trade-pact was
``voluntary'' and said it believed each country was free to pick
and choose the parts of the accord it would go along with.
	   Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Masahiko Komura said
Sunday's decision adhered to the ``principles of volunteerism'' and
would ``further advance global trade liberalization.''
	   But at a briefing for Tokyo press, a Japanese government
official expressed relief.
	   ``We managed to protect the two sectors,'' said the official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said Japan doesn't regard the ``WTO process'' to be
implemented next year as ``actual negotiations,'' suggesting that
the country won't be bound by any pact until the next round of WTO
negotiations start in 2000.
	   Nevertheless, the Philippines foreign minister, Domingo Siazon,
said it was unfair to characterize the lack of an agreement as a
failure. ``What you cannot finalize here, you pass onto the WTO,''
Siazon said.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan also refused to call the
trade pact a setback because Japan was not fully on board.
	   ``In the spirit of realism, APEC has reached a decision that
everybody can live with,'' he said. ``We will have to count on it
as another success that we can build on at the next APEC meeting.''
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Turkey warns against granting asylum to Kurdish rebel leader

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy
for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to
``opening doors to terrorism.''
	   In Rome, 1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstrations
outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held.
Kurds arrived from Germany and France to show solidarity with the
rebel leader and a Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched
a hunger strike.
	   If Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, ``he'll be
tortured for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter
among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital.
``And very possibly he'll be killed.''
	   Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday as soon as
he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum
after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria.
	   He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has
been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since
1984. The conflict has killed nearly 37,000 people. Turkey
considers Ocalan a terrorist and its most-wanted criminal.
	   ``If Western European nations open their arms (to the rebels)
they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' Deputy
Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
	   ``If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday
it will be opening its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added,
referring to Italy's handling of brawls that broke out among the
Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on Saturday. The protests were
peaceful Sunday.
	   Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has
heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there
have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has
consistently refused to extradite anyone if there were even a risk
of capital punishment.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a
meeting of European defense and foreign ministers. Before leaving,
he criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who reportedly
said Turkey's extradition request would be refused.
	   ``To announce the results of an extradition trial that has not
yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told
reporters. He said he would tell Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini ``that we expect a serious and fair approach.''
	   Ocalan, a political science dropout from Ankara University,
founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group
toward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among poor
Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims to have all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey but the rebels have havens in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the
fighting continues.

Kuwaitis not interested in another rerun of the old Saddam movie

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Iraqi defiance leads to a U.S. military buildup,
then to a last-minute diplomatic solution. Saddam Hussein's small
neighbor has repeatedly lived this scenario _ and feared its
consequences _ since the Gulf War.
	   But this time around, very few seem to be alarmed or even
bothered.
	   ``People are sick of this song and dance,'' said Masouma
al-Mubarak, political science teacher at Kuwait University. ``They
want a solution, an end to this situation with Saddam as a source
of tension in the area.''
	   In February, during the last crisis between Iraq and the United
Nations, Kuwaitis stocked up on food and water. Some sealed rooms
against a possible retaliatory Iraqi attack with chemical or
biological weapons. Others even bought gas masks.
	   ``We got used to this,'' Jamal al-Naki, a 40-year-old Kuwaiti,
explained at he selected fresh vegetables at a supermarket. He was
not buying anything extra.
	   But al-Naki and some newspapers also expressed bitterness at
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over his army's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
	   ``This time they will get him. He will be their target,''
al-Naki told the Associated Press.
	   And columnist Fouad al-Hashem, anticipating an attack, wrote in
the Sunday edition of the daily Al-Watan: ``Saddam, his family, his
cronies and his Baath Party will have dug their own graves. We will
shovel dirt on them and their history.''
	   For the past week, however, most Kuwaitis have been more
concerned about winning the Gulf soccer cup _ which they did.
	   As more American soldiers prepared to deploy in the region,
Friday, young Kuwaitis danced in the streets and waved flags to
greet the returning champions.
	   Around 1,500 U.S. soldiers are in Kuwait training in the desert
or maintaining equipment prepositioned to protect the country.
	   On Sunday, the Cabinet was informed of contingency plans should
there be air strikes on Iraq, but the plans were not made public.
The country's tiny military is on alert, but a Defense Ministry
spokesman told the AP the measure was ``precautionary.''
	   Officials have urged Iraq to rescind its decision to halt
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors but have made it a point to
stay out of any confrontation. Defense Minister Sheik Salem
al-Sabah said last week that Kuwait was ``not a party'' to the
tensions.
	   Some U.S. Embassy families have made plans to depart, but there
are no signs of widespread panic among Kuwait's 8,000 American
residents, who were advised to consider leaving by the State
Department.
	   Still, the Kuwaitis' public nonchalance has brought one warning
_ from a columnist for a pro-government daily.
	   ``This repeated heating and cooling should not become like the
famous `cry wolf' story,'' wrote Sami al-Nisf. ``We should not take
it easy because nothing has happened in the past, only to be caught
unprepared.''

Blair says he gave order to attack Iraq _ and still ready

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday he gave
orders to British warplanes to attack Iraq on Saturday, but the
strike was called off when Iraq promised to allow U.N. weapons
inspections unconditionally.
	   ``This is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance
is guaranteed and delivered,'' said Blair, speaking outside his
Downing Street office after a stream of phone calls into the early
hours with U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.N. officials.
	   Blair said that unless Iraq delivered he would not hesitate to
order strikes again.
	   ``There will be no warning whatsoever,'' said Blair.
	   In Washington, the U.S. Administration said Saturday that waves
of American bombers had also headed toward the Gulf to strike.
	   Blair's aides said British warplanes would have provided
one-fifth of the air power for an allied attack on Saturday.
	   Britain, America's most hawkish ally over Iraq, has sent 12
Tornado fighter-bombers to Kuwait, and has two antisubmarine
frigates, HMS Cumberland and HMS Grafton in the Gulf region. HMS
Grafton carries Sea Wolf and Harpoon missiles.
	   Blair gave the formal authority to attack at 10 a.m. (1000 GMT)
Saturday, and spoke two hours later by phone to the commander of
the Tornado squadron in Kuwait, Squadron Ldr. Alan Vincent,
officials said. The strikes were called off at 2 p.m. (1400 GMT)
after the new Iraqi letter arrived.

Serbs invite Kosovo Albanians to talks; KLA calls for funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb authorities have invited Kosovo
Albanians to hold face-to-face talks on a political settlement for
the restive province, state media reported Sunday.
	   There was no immediate response by ethnic Albanian leaders to
the offer by Serbian President Milan Milutinovic.
	   The Albanians have rejected several such invitations in the
past, but the latest comes amid a flurry of U.S.-led diplomacy and
could signal that the Serbs and Albanians are closer to long-sought
direct talks.
	   ``There are all conditions for a direct meeting and discussion
on finding a political solution for Kosovo problems,'' said the
statement issued by the Serbian president's office.
	   Milutinovic is prepared to lead the talks Wednesday, it said.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. envoy for Kosovo, met with both
Milutinovic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova in
the previous two days as part of efforts to mediate a lasting
settlement for the province, where the ethnic Albanian-dominated
population favors independence.
	   Scattered violence has continued in Kosovo despite an Oct. 12
agreement in which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to
halt his months-long offensive against separatist rebels and start
talks aimed at restoring Kosovo's autonomy.
	   Milosevic's potential involvement in talks with the Albanians is
not clear.
	   The Yugoslav leader is scheduled to meet on Monday, however,
with U.S. diplomat William Walker, head of the still-forming
international monitoring team that is to verify the status of
Milosevic's pledges in Kosovo.
	   Walker was heading to Belgrade from Pristina on Sunday for the
talks, said a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is organizing the verification
mission.
	   OSCE Chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister,
requested the meeting ``to raise concerns about the levels of
violence in Kosovo and the tit-for-tat nature it appears to be
taking,'' spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   In an indication ethnic Albanian rebels have no intention of
scaling down their fight for independence, the Kosovo Liberation
Army on Sunday demanded financial donations.
	   The KLA said in a statement published in the Albanian-language
newspaper Koha Ditore that ethnic Albanians ``are obliged to help
the KLA fund inside the country because by helping the war, they
help freedom, independence and democracy in Kosovo.''
	   ``We ask from our citizens wherever they are in the world
without hesitation to help and to join our just war of
liberation,'' the statement said.
	   The KLA receives financial help from ethnic Albanians living
abroad, mainly in Switzerland and Germany.
	   The rebel force opposes any political settlement that does not
entail full independence for Kosovo.

Government says Suharto has dlrs 2.6 million in accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government said Sunday that former
President Suharto has total bank deposits of 21 billion rupiah
(dlrs 2.6 million) _ but not the trillions (billions of dollars)
reported by the media.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said the Attorney General's Office
had already inquired at some 70 banks in the country in
investigations of the autocratic former leader's wealth.
	   Many Indonesians believe that during his 32-year rule, Suharto
and his children amassed riches through government contracts and
siphoned off wealth from projects and state-owned corporations
including oil company Pertamina.
	   The U.S. magazine Forbes estimates the former president's wealth
at dlrs 4 billion.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May amid riots and protests fueled by
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in three decades. He has denied
corruption or stashing cash overseas, but his denials have been
greeted with disbelief by many Indonesians.
	   ``Attorney General (Andi M. Ghalib) has received an official
report on the accounts of former President Suharto that the amount
of ex-President Suharto's accounts is 21 billion rupiahs, and not
trillions as reported by the media,'' Tanjung said after
accompanying President B.J. Habibie in a meeting with the National
Commission on Human Rights.
	   During the meeting at Habibie's residence, the commission asked
the government to expedite investigations of Suharto's wealth as
required by a new decree issued by a special convention of the
People's Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative
body.
	   The 1,000-member assembly, made up mostly of holdovers from the
Suharto era, passed a decree Friday on clean government that also
named Suharto and his family as targets of a wealth investigation.
	   Demands for an immediate trial of Suharto and rejection of the
assembly's decision to reserve special seats for the military in
parliament have led to student protests this week that claimed at
least 16 lives in the capital.

West Indies team tighter after standoff, Lara says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The pay dispute that
threatened to scrap the West Indies cricket tour to South Africa
had its up side, Captain Brian Lara told local newspapers on
Sunday.
	   ``What we've gained ... is a tighter team unit,'' Lara was
quoted as saying by the Sunday Independent in Johannesburg. ``Those
five or six days in London made us a very close team unit. That is
an area where we have to improve to beat South Africa.''
	   Lara led a confrontation over pay with team management that
dismissed him as captain but later reinstated him. The negotiations
took place last week in London, where the team interrupted its trip
to South Africa until the crisis was settled.
	   Lara on Sunday was making up for the team's delayed arrival,
batting 101 of the team's 213 first innings tea-time score.
	   In interviews with the Independent and Johannesburg's Sunday
Times, Lara conceded that he made mistakes in handling superstar
status. In 1994, he smashed two world records, claiming the
individual test batting record (375 against England) and the
highest score in a first-class match (501 against Durham).
	   ``I never really thought of breaking records ... and the sort of
attention that people focused on myself was almost impossible to
deal with,'' Lara was quoted as saying.
	   With cash shortages, lagging team performance and rival sports
threatening cricket in the Caribbean, Lara said the South African
tour was crucial to reviving the sport's image back home.
	   ``We need to put the pride back in West Indies cricket,'' Lara
was quoted as saying. ``Life in the Caribbean is based around
cricket.''
	   Lara said he hopes his team can emulate the unity of the South
Africans who play ``as a team with a lot of spirit.''
	   The Test starts on Nov. 26, after the current match and another
four-day match against Free State provincial, and should decide the
No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

Marathon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese veteran Junko Asari spurted past Ari
Ichihashi just before the finish line Sunday, winning a
neck-and-neck duel that lasted the last five kilometers (three
miles) of the Tokyo International Women's Marathon.
	   Asari, 29, won her second Tokyo marathon in 2 hours, 28 minutes,
29 seconds. Japanese compatriot Ichihashi was clocked in the same
time.
	   Asari fell behind her 20-year-old rival with just 100 meters
left, but overtook her again in the final 50 meters.
	   ``I'm so happy, because I wanted to win so badly,'' Asari said.
She said she never lost her composure, because she believed in her
finishing kick.
	   For the 1993 world champion, the victory marked a comeback from
her unimpressive 17th-place finish at the 1996 Olympics.
	   Japan's Azumi Miyazaki finished third in 2:30:06 in her marathon
debut.
	   Germany's Katrin Dorre-Heinig, a three-time winner of the event,
finished fifth in 2:31:44, and 1996 Olympic gold medalist Fatuma
Roba of Ethiopia ended eighth in 2:36:22 after slowing down late in
the race because of abdominal pains.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite U.S. efforts to jump start the Wye
peace accord, rhetoric escalated Sunday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat renewing threats to declare a state in May and
warning ``our rifle is ready.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu countered that
Arafat's threats to bypass negotiations and declare statehood cast
a ``very dark shadow'' over the peace process.
	   In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a
group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning
work on a bypass road for Jewish settlers for which 40 acres of
Arab land were confiscated in al-Khader near Bethlehem.
	   About 30 soldiers beat back 20 protesters who responded with a
hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets and tear gas
canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were treated for tear
gas inhalation, including Palestinian lawmaker Salah Tamari, and
one Israeli soldier was injured from a chunk of rock.
	   The sharpening rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross tried to
get both sides to implement the Wye River memorandum, which calls
for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange
for stepped up Palestinian security measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli officials Sunday and negotiators were
scheduled to confer later in the day. He urged moving the debate
off the air waves and to the negotiating table.
	   ``One thing that is key: it is always better for the two sides
to talk to each other instead of at each other,'' Ross told
reporters after meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   Sharon said Arafat's comments made it ``difficult to conduct
negotiations'' and reiterated that Israel would ``annex'' the areas
of the West Bank it holds if Arafat announced a state.
	   Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's strong language came in
response to Israeli annexation threats and as a result of the delay
in implementing the withdrawal agreement. The first pullback had
been slated for Monday, but Israel said it would be delayed for a
matter of ``days.''
	   Speaking to members of his Fatah faction in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Arafat said: ``Our rifle is ready, and we are ready to
use it if they try to delay us from praying at al-Aqsa,'' the
holiest mosque in Jerusalem.
	   Defying Israel and the United States which have urged him to
drop the demand, Arafat said, ``we will declare our state on the
4th of May next year. This is our right....''
	   Netanyahu told reporters that Arafat's threats were undermining
the agreement.
	   ``This endangers the entire Oslo agreement and casts a very dark
shadow over the Wye agreement, as well,'' he said.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, Netanyahu delayed the time table
for implementing the land-for-security accord.
	   Sunday, Bar-Illan said Netanyahu informed Arafat in a telephone
call there would be a further delay due to recent events and
pending approval for the accord in the Israeli Knesset, expected
Tuesday.
	   ``There will be a few days delay in the withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from these areas,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated
Press.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb authorities have invited Kosovo
Albanians to hold face-to-face talks in an effort to reach a
political settlement for the restive province, state media reported
Sunday.
	   There was no immediate response by ethnic Albanian leaders to
the offer by Serbian President Milan Milutinovic.
	   The Albanians have rejected several such invitations in the
past, but the latest comes amid a flurry of U.S.-led diplomacy and
could signal that the Serbs and ethnic Albanians are closer to
long-sought direct talks.
	   ``All conditions are in place for a direct meeting and for a
discussion to find a political solution for Kosovo problems,'' said
the statement issued by the Serbian president's office.
	   Milutinovic is prepared to lead the talks Wednesday, it said.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. envoy for Kosovo, met with both
Milutinovic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova in
the previous two days as part of efforts to mediate a lasting
settlement for the province, where the ethnic Albanian-dominated
population favors independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Scattered violence has continued in Kosovo despite an Oct. 12
agreement in which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to
halt his months-long offensive against separatist rebels and to
start talks aimed at restoring Kosovo's autonomy.
	   Milosevic's potential involvement in talks with the ethnic
Albanians is not clear.
	   The Yugoslav leader is scheduled to meet on Monday with U.S.
diplomat William Walker, head of the still-forming international
monitoring team that is to verify the status of Milosevic's pledges
in Kosovo.
	   Walker was heading to Belgrade from Pristina on Sunday for the
talks, said a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is organizing the verification
mission.
	   OSCE Chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister,
requested the meeting ``to raise concerns about the levels of
violence in Kosovo and the tit-for-tat nature it appears to be
taking,'' spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   In an indication ethnic Albanian rebels have no intention of
scaling down their fight for independence, the Kosovo Liberation
Army on Sunday demanded financial donations.
	   The KLA said in a statement published in the Albanian-language
newspaper Koha Ditore that ethnic Albanians ``are obliged to help
the KLA fund inside the country because by helping the war, they
help freedom, independence and democracy in Kosovo.''
	   ``We ask from our citizens wherever they are in the world
without hesitation to help and to join our just war of
liberation,'' the statement said.
	   The KLA opposes any political settlement that does not entail
full independence for Kosovo.

Press freedom advocate welcomes Cuba's approval of AP news bureau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) _ A champion of press freedoms
welcomed Cuba's decision allowing The Associated Press to reopen
its bureau in Havana.
	   Danilo Arbilla, chairman of the Inter American Press
Association's Committee on Freedom of the Press and Information,
called the Cuban government's action a ``positive development'' in
press relations on Saturday.
	   Arbilla, of the Uruguayan newsweekly Busqueda, has pressed for
greater press liberties within Cuba as head of the key committee of
the IAPA, which is composed of more than 1,300 publishers and
editors from 30 countries.
	   He called the decision another apparent ``sign of opening'' by
Cuban President Fidel Castro's government.
	   After 29 years, The Associated Press will reopen its bureau in
Cuba. Approval came from the Cuban Foreign Ministry on Thursday
during a visit to Havana by a delegation of senior AP officials.
	   The office will be the news agency's 95th international bureau
and its 240th overall, including bureaus in the United States.

Wedding brawl ends with three shooting deaths

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A drunken guest shot and killed his
ex-girlfriend and her parents at a wedding party in eastern Serbia
following a bitter quarrel, the Beta news agency reported Sunday.
	   Bojan Andjelkovic, 22, used a shotgun to kill Slavomir and
Slavica Aleksic and their 18-year-old daughter in the town of Bor
on Saturday, the report said.
	   Andjelkovic got into an argument with the family over his
earlier affair with Marija, the report said, and was beaten up by
Marija's brother Milan. He returned with the shotgun and killed the
parents in a parking lot and Marija inside.
	   Other guests restrained him when he tried to reload the shotgun
to kill Milan, according to Beta. Andjelkovic was then arrested.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Religious marriages will carry legal
weight in Poland under a law starting Sunday that eliminates the
communist-era necessity for an additional service before a state
registrar.
	   The decision follows a treaty between Poland and the Vatican
that, among other provisions, called for legal status for religious
marriages.
	   Under the new law, a priest, pastor or rabbi must inform local
registrars of a wedding within five days after the ceremony.
Couples still need registrar certificates that they are free to
marry and are at least 18, the legal age.

	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara
hit 101 to take his side to tea on 213 for five wickets Sunday, the
second day of their four-day match against the provincial
Griqualand West.
	   Griqualand West were dismissed for 271 in their first innings on
Saturday.
	   With the first Test upcoming on Nov. 26, the 29-year-old batting
maestro was in threatening form. In 161 minutes at the crease, Lara
flayed the ball to all corners and conserved energy on yet another
scorching day by collecting 76 runs via the boundary ropes.
	   Lara cracked 16 fours and two sixes in all, with his 100 coming
off 140 deliveries.
	   Offspinner Pat Symcox yielded his duel with Lara to part-time
spinner Martyn Gidley, who eventually cut Lara down. Andre Botha
held onto a hesitant drive with a good catch in the covers. For
Botha, who had taken some stick from Lara _ his fourth over yielded
23 runs _ it was a catch to be savored.
	   Gidley and Symcox managed to pull a rampant run rate back to a
trickle. The most successful bowler was left-arm quickie Adri
Swanepoel, who despite conceding 23 runs from two overs, got rid of
Shivnarine Chanderpaul (42) and Stuart Williams in his second spell
to finish with 2-44 from 14 overs.
	   Chanderpaul, who batted for 138 minutes, put on 107 with Lara
for the third wicket, with Lara contributing 75.
	   The other wicket to fall was that of opening bat Clayton
Lambert, who was caught behind off the bowling of paceman Deon
Kruis for 11 in the third over.
	   West Indies' top bowler Courtney Walsh, who limped off the field
on Saturday, had no serious injures from a sprained ankle, the
South African Press Association reported. It was not known if he
would play on Sunday.
	   Two other West Indies players are out of action _ Curtly Ambrose
with a toenail removal and Jimmy Adams with severed finger tendons.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh had hoped to break
the record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcom Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test
wickets.
	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's play against a
Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play after the
team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

After the party, tabloids make Camilla a queen _ almost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles danced
the night away to celebrate his 50th birthday, and although his
mother may have disapproved, Britain's tabloid newspapers on Sunday
hailed his longtime love as _ well, almost as _ a queen.
	   ``Camilla: Queen for the Night,'' declared the mass circulation
Sunday Mirror. Britain's biggest selling tabloid, News of the
World, carried its report about Saturday night's bash under the
headline ``The Look of Love.''
	   For Mrs. Parker Bowles, 51, blamed by the late Princess Diana
for the breakup of her marriage to Charles, it was a public
relations breakthrough. In the past the British press has often
lambasted her _ alongside unflattering pictures _ as a mistress the
heir to the throne can never marry.
	   Newspapers splashed pictures of Mrs. Parker Bowles _ sporting in
the words of one a glamorous new ``Royal Heir-Do'' _ arriving for
the party at Charles' country mansion, Highgrove. She was
accompanied by her sister, Annabel Elliott.
	   The limousine slowed down for photographers to get good shots of
her smiling broadly, wearing a fabulous diamond, turquoise and
sapphire necklace and green velvet gown.
	   The Express newspaper said the necklace had belonged to another
royal mistress, Mrs. Parker Bowles' great-grandmother Alice Keppel
who reputedly had a 12-year affair with King Edward VII, beginning
when Edward was heir to the throne.
	   The Highgrove party, with a guest-list dominated by a bevy of
European royals and members of Charles' inner circle of rich,
blue-blood friends, followed a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth
II for him at Buckingham Palace on Friday night, the eve of his
birthday.
	   His sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 14, were at the
Highgrove party. So, too, according to news reports, were Mrs.
Parker Bowles two grown-up children, Tom and Laura, and her
ex-husband, Andrew.
	   But the queen stayed away, underlining reports that she
disapproves of the relationship. On Friday, Mrs. Parker Bowles was
not at the Buckingham Palace party.
	   The queen on Saturday attended a 21st birthday party that her
daughter, Princess Anne, gave for her grandson Peter Phillips.

Deported Turkish juvenile delinquent placed in Istanbul youth home

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A German-born Turkish juvenile delinquent
deported to Istanbul, Turkey, over the weekend was placed in a
youth home after German diplomats failed to contact his relatives.
	   Muhlis Ari _ known in the German media as ``Mehmet'' _ was flown
to Istanbul from Munich on Saturday, one day after Germany's
highest court upheld Bavarian state officials in revoking the boy's
residency permit for his long history of vandalism, fights and
petty thefts.
	   The controversial deportation followed months of debate and
legal wrangling over whether the state had the right to deport the
14-year-old, who feels himself to be German but is not a citizen. A
1913 law bases citizenship on German blood ties, not place of
birth.
	   Seeking to better integrate the foreigners who make up one-tenth
of Germany's 75 million people, the newly elected government
recently agreed to ease the law to allow dual citizenship.
	   ``If Mehmet had had double citizenship, he would have been
treated like any other German youth,'' said a member of German
parliament, Cem Ozdemir, who is of Turkish decent.
	   The new law has yet to be drafted, but Ozdemir said many of
Germany's 2 million Turks _ such as Ari's parents, who have lived
and worked for 30 years in Germany _ are eager to take advantage of
it.
	   The legal expert for the ruling Social Democrats, however, said
the new law could not be applied retroactively to help Ari's case.
	   Prosecutors questioned Ari briefly on arrival in Istanbul and
released him after determining he had committed no crimes in
Turkey, police at Istanbul Ataturk airport said Sunday.
	   He was put in a juvenile home until relatives, believed to be
living in Tekirdag, about 130 kilometers (78 miles) from Istanbul,
come to claim him.

Mercy killing of sick lion put off as doctor offers hope
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ The mercy killing of a sick lion in a zoo
in northern India has been put off for two weeks after a doctor of
alternative medicine said he may be able to cure his debilitating
spinal injury, zoo officials said Sunday.
	   D.N. Upadhyay is treating 11-year-old Sonu with homeopathic
medicines and is confident the lion will soon be well.
	   ``We are happy to give the ailing lion a chance to recover,''
Uttar Pradesh state chief wildlife warden R.L. Singh said. Sonu was
to have been put to sleep with an overdose of tranquilizers earlier
this week.
	   Sonu was seized in March from a traveling zoo where he had been
kept cramped in a cage so small it resulted in painful injuries to
his backbone and hind legs. Six months of treatment in Lucknow's
public Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens proved futile, and zoo
officials were considering euthanizing him to relieve him of
misery.
	   Until Upadhyaya, a homeopath in the central Indian town of
Bhopal, heard about Sonu and offered to help treat him. Sonu's
treatment started Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, prayers are being offered at a temple in Lucknow for
Sonu's recovery and several animal lovers have written to zoo
authorities requesting they let the lion live, Singh said.

Iraqis believe America's real target is Saddam Hussein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Many Iraqis believe that if the United
States goes ahead with a military strike on Iraq, it won't be over
U.N. weapons inspections. They think the target is President Saddam
Hussein.
	   ``Saddam backed down from his decision. What they seem to want
now is to kill him,'' Samir Abdel-Hussein, a 37-year-old carpenter
told The Associated Press on Sunday.
	   The comment was repeated over and over by Iraqis interviewed in
Baghdad. Some said they went to bed thinking Iraq's letter Saturday
promising a renewal of U.N. army inspections had solved the crisis,
then awakened to find American air strikes were still threatened.
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers delivered the message that the
United States was for aggression, no matter what. The daily Babil,
published by Saddam's son Odai, said American threats of a military
strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a cruel joke.''
	   Shoppers in Baghdad's Karada neighborhood, which was crowded
with families buying food, also complained about the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed eight years ago to punish Iraq for its invasion
of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and other trade
dealings, can't be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Bushra Noori al-Mousawi, 32, a teacher, said he was amazed to
learn this morning that Washington had turned down Iraq's offer to
let the inspectors return and was still planning an attack.
	   ``They want to humiliate the president because they do not like
him, but they are doing it in the wrong way _ they are humiliating
the Iraqi people,'' al-Mousawi said.
	   ``The question is, who are they after?'' said Usama Hussein
Mousa, 57, a retired university instructor. ``If they are after
Saddam, why are they going after him over the bodies of over a
million Iraqis?''
	   It was a reference to Iraq's repeated assertion that shortages
of food and medicine under the sanctions regime have taken the
lives of more than 1.5 million people, many of them children.
	   Mousa complained that he couldn't afford the food he needed..
	   ``I have tasted meat or vegetables only a few times this year
because of the sanctions and the high prices,'' he said.
	   Ayad Mohammed Ali, 28, a candidate for a master's degree in
psychology at Baghdad University, said he was angry at the American
stance.
	   ``They (the Americans) wanted Iraq to reverse its decision, and
Iraq has done so,'' Ali said. ``Then today I have found out that
America is planning to kill me and other Iraqis.''
	   He added: ``We must unite to fight this.''
	   Muna Jameel Rohi, 45, a homemaker, said she had other concerns.
	   ``Yes, I fear war,'' she said. ``This does not mean I am a
coward. But I have children and a home to care for that could be
bombed by mistake.''

Hattori wins Itoen Ladies with record 19-under total
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS second-place money winner to Kaori Harada,

<TEXT>
	   CHONAN, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori finished off a sizzling
65-66-66 run Sunday and won the Itoen Ladies with a 19-under-par
197, a record low for a 54-hole event in Japan.
	   ``I'm surprised too. I can't tell exactly what kept me in the
game throughout,'' said Hattori, who shot eight birdies and two
bogeys in Sunday's round. ``Anyway, I hit the ball straight and
close, and that set up easier putting lines.''
	   She finished 11 shots ahead of Kaori Higo and South Korean Ku
Ok-hee, who were 8 under at 208. Higo shot 70 and Ku 74 Sunday on
the 6,364-yard (5,791-meter), par-72 Great Island Club course.
	   Hattori's round of 197 beat the record of 199 set by Laura
Davies of England when she won the same tournament at the same
course in 1996.
	   Hattori, winner of the 1984 Japan Women's Amateur and the 1985
U.S. Women's Amateur Championships, started the final round with a
three-shot lead.
	   For her fifth title of the season, she received 10.8 million yen
(dlrs 86,400) from a purse of 60 million yen (dlrs 491,800).
	   The 30-year-old Hattori, who has won 12 tournaments in seven
years on the Japan Tour, is bidding for her first money earnings
title.
	   She leads this season's earnings with 78.68 million yen (dlrs
629,400), followed by Kaori Harada's 62.13 million yen (dlrs
497,000).
	   South Korean rookie Han Hee-won shot 69 for a share of fourth at
210 with Yuri Fudo, Fumiko Muraguchi and Harada.

Kitten delays British Airways takeoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A British Airways flight was forced to delay
its takeoff from Cairo for 75 minutes Sunday after a kitten was
heard frantically meowing in the passenger cabin, airport officials
said.
	   Stewardesses searched the cabin and discovered the kitten in a
Romanian passenger's handbag, the officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Animals are banned in the passenger cabin of British Airways
flights.
	   The passenger said he found the kitten while on his way to the
airport and did not have time to make appropriate travel
arrangements.
	   He also said that the kitten was of an Egyptian breed that was
unavailable abroad.
	   Rather than give up his furry companion, the passenger left the
flight for a later airplane.
	   The flight later continued on to London.

Defense will not contest facts in murder case against Sheinbein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hearing adjourned, prosecution comments, details
of next step; ADDS photo tag &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American teen-ager appealing an extradition
order will not contest the facts of the case if he stands trial for
murder in Israel instead of returning to Maryland, a defense
attorney told Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday.
	   A five-judge panel of justices heard two hours of oral arguments
in the extradition battle over Samuel Sheinbein and did not
announce when the court would hand down its ruling.
	   David Libai, Sheinbein's attorney, said the defense case would
focus on the mental condition of the 18-year-old from Silver
Spring, Md., and would not involve the high cost of bringing
witnesses from the United States.
	   ``It will not be necessary to bring a single witness from
abroad,'' Libai told the court. ``We will admit to all the facts in
the case. Our contention will be the mental condition of the
defendant.''
	   However, Libai told The Associated Press during a break in the
hearing that he would not describe the plea that would be entered
or whether it would be innocent or guilty.
	   ``It could be insanity, or something like that, I don't know,''
Libai said.
	   But state prosecutor Irit Kohn argued that extradition back to
the United States would ``send a message that Israel will not be a
shelter for ... criminals abroad.''
	   The Sheinbein case caused an uproar in Israel and the United
States and threatened relations between the two allies. Members of
the U.S. Congress called for delaying Israeli aid packages if
Sheinbein was not returned. But the United States backed down when
Israel's Justice Ministry rejected Sheinbein's citizenship claims.
	   In September, a Jerusalem district court upheld Sheinbein's
claim to Israeli citizenship but said that his ties to the country
were not strong enough to shield him from prosecution abroad.
Israeli law allows for citizens to be tried in Israel instead of
being extradited.
	   On Sunday, Supreme Court Chief Justice, Aharon Barak, observed
that it would be difficult for his court to endorse a concept he
called ``citizenship minus,'' despite the lower court ruling.
	   State attorneys led by Kohn sought to reopen the issue of
Sheinbein's citizenship, but the Supreme Court refused to deal with
the question. She said after Sunday's session that her case now
hinges on a change to the wording of Israel's citizenship law to
read that only those with ``ties,'' to the country will be granted
protection under its laws.
	   The summary of the 39-page defense appeal argues that the lower
court decision clearing the way for extradition ``reflects only the
desire of the judge to arrive at a certain conclusion which is not
anchored in the language of the law, and the language of the law
cannot support it.''
	   Shmuel Sheinbein, who was sitting between two policemen, wore a
gray shirt and conferred briefly with one of his attorneys before
the appeal hearing began. His parents were sitting at the end of
the first row.
	   Sheinbein's father Sol, who watched the proceedings Sunday with
trembling lip and sweat streaking his face, told reporters he
wanted his son tried in Israel because he believed his life would
be in danger if he served time in a U.S. prison.
	   ``In the United States, his situation will be very difficult,
and it is possible that he could be killed in prison there. I am
very concerned for him,'' said Sol Sheinbein.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of Alfredo Tello was discovered in the garage of an
empty house near the Sheinbein home. Shortly after arriving, he was
picked up by police and hospitalized briefly, suffering from a drug
overdose.
	   Aaron Needle, a second suspect, hanged himself in April on the
eve of his murder trial in Montgomery County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine which was under British rule before the
Jewish state was founded in 1948.

 &UR; U.S. commerce secretary urges Israeli-Arab cooperation &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The U.S. Secretary of Commerce met on Sunday
with counterparts from Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians and
encouraged the three parties to increase trade ties between their
areas.
	   ``It seems to me that there should be synergies,'' said William
Daley in a speech to Israeli and Arab officials in Jerusalem.
	   ``Israel exports to Western markets but can't break in here
while the Palestinians bring to the table access to all the Arab
world,'' he said. ``One has high tech; one has infant industries,
and it seems the combination would make you more competitive.''
	   Daley said less than seven percent of Mideast trade was among
states of the region and added it made no sense that it was easier
for Jordan to export to France than to the West Bank.
	   In a statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon called on
Jordan to implement a planned free-trade zone between the two
countries and urged Jordanian business leaders to visit Israel.
	   Sharon also promised to raise the issue of a desalination
project at a meeting of international donors supporting the
Palestinian Authority. They are to meet in Washington at the end of
the month.
	   Daley said he would look into the possibility of bringing a
business delegation to tour the area next year.
	   Daley, who is on a two-day visit to Israel, also met with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday and Israel's trade
minister. Monday, he meets with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and will tour an Israeli-Palestinian industrial park in the Gaza
Strip.

	   Mousa complained that he couldn't afford the food he needed..
	   ``I have tasted meat or vegetables only a few times this year
because of the sanctions and the high prices,'' he said.
	   Ayad Mohammed Ali, 28, a candidate for a master's degree in
psychology at Baghdad University, said he was angry at the American
stance.
	   ``They (the Americans) wanted Iraq to reverse its decision, and
Iraq has done so,'' Ali said. ``Then today I have found out that
America is planning to kill me and other Iraqis.''
	   He added: ``We must unite to fight this.''
	   Muna Jameel Rohi, 45, a homemaker, feared for her safety.
	   ``I have children and a home to care for that could be bombed by
mistake,'' she said.

U.N. delays return of relief workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final 4 grafs to ADD details on food supplies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has delayed returning
its relief workers to Baghdad because of continuing debate in the
U.N. Security Council over the weapons inspection crisis, a U.N.
official said Sunday.
	   There had been reports from New York on Saturday that the 150
U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated last week to the Jordanian
capital Amman would begin moving back here on Sunday.
	   But the Security Council was unable to conclude its discussions
on Iraq's offer to renew cooperation with the weapons inspectors,
and a further session was scheduled Sunday.
	   ``Because of the extended deliberations in the Security Council,
it has been decided that the staff should remain in Amman for the
time being,'' U.N. spokesman Eric Falt told reporters. ``Of course,
we are anxious to have them return as soon as possible and to
return to full operations as soon as possible.''
	   The evacuations last Wednesday and Thursday reduced the U.N.
relief staff in Baghdad to about 55 people. An additional 230 U.N.
humanitarian workers remain in the north supervising aid to Iraqi
Kurds.
	   They monitor the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program. It is an
exception from U.N. sanctions that allows Iraq to sell limited
amounts of crude oil to buy needed food and medicine.
	   The food is distributed as monthly rations to Iraq's 22 million
people.
	   The program also was set back when the British-headquartered
Lloyds Register evacuated its workers. Lloyds must certify incoming
shipments at border points or suppliers don't get paid.
	   ``The United Nations is concerned by the implications of the
absence of personnel at the four border points, and we are in touch
with our parties to find a solution either through Lloyds or
through other venues,'' Falt said.
	   He said lines of trucks were forming at the Zakho border entry
point from Turkey.
	   More than half of food shipments come in at Iraq's southern port
of Umm Kasr, Falt said. They also enter at Trabil on the Jordanian
border and Al-Waleed on the Syrian border, he said.
	   He said there were no signs of shortages and that food
distribution was continuing smoothly.
	   Falt said that there was enough food in the country for all
Iraqis to collect their full November ration.
	   Full rations in upcoming months look problematic, he added. Some
186,000 tons of wheat are in the country, or about a 23-day supply,
while there are 23,500 tons of rice, or a 12-day supply. On the
other hand, the baby milk supply was put at 5,500 tons, enough for
108 days.
	   Falt later told reporters that food supplies were backing up at
entry points to the country because of the absence of Lloyds staff
to check them in.
	   He said that about 75 trucks carry wheat were backed up at
Al-Waleed, 59 trucks at Zakho and a shipment of 14,000 tons of rice
at Umm Kasr.

Kitten delays British Airways takeoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A British Airways flight was forced to delay
its takeoff from Cairo for 75 minutes Sunday after a kitten was
heard frantically meowing in the passenger cabin, airport officials
said.
	   Stewardesses searched the cabin and discovered the kitten in a
Romanian passenger's handbag, the officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Animals are banned in the passenger cabin of British Airways
flights.
	   The passenger said he found the kitten while on his way to the
airport and did not have time to make appropriate travel
arrangements.
	   He also said that the kitten was of an Egyptian breed that was
unavailable abroad.
	   Rather than give up his furry companion, the passenger left the
flight for a later airplane.
	   The flight later continued on to London.

 &UR; U.S. commerce secretary urges Israeli-Arab cooperation
 &UR; By ANN KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The U.S. Secretary of Commerce met on Sunday
with counterparts from Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians and
encouraged the three parties to increase trade ties between their
areas.
	   ``It seems to me that there should be synergies,'' said William
Daley in a speech to Israeli and Arab officials in Jerusalem.
	   ``Israel exports to Western markets but can't break in here
while the Palestinians bring to the table access to all the Arab
world,'' he said. ``One has high tech; one has infant industries,
and it seems the combination would make you more competitive.''
	   Daley said less than seven percent of Mideast trade was among
states of the region and added it made no sense that it was easier
for Jordan to export to France than to the West Bank.
	   In a statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon called on
Jordan to implement a planned free-trade zone between the two
countries and urged Jordanian business leaders to visit Israel.
	   Sharon also promised to raise the issue of a desalination
project at a meeting of international donors supporting the
Palestinian Authority. They are to meet in Washington at the end of
the month.
	   Daley said he would look into the possibility of bringing a
business delegation to tour the area next year.
	   Daley, who is on a two-day visit to Israel, also met with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday and Israel's trade
minister. Monday, he meets with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and will tour an Israeli-Palestinian industrial park in the Gaza
Strip.

Czech opposition says too early to proclaim parliamentary victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Klaus quote, preliminary local election results;
ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite a strong showing in the
first round of Czech Senate elections, leaders of the main
opposition party cautioned Sunday that they weren't assured of
increasing their strength in Parliament.
	   The Civic Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced
the most candidates to the second round of any party competing in
the Friday and Saturday elections. Updated results early Sunday
showed they had qualified for runoffs in 22 of 27 districts.
	   The governing Social Democrats are next with 15 candidates in
next weekend's runoffs, a showing they called disappointing
Saturday. A grouping of four opposition parties led by the
Christian Democrats and Freedom Union finished third with 14
candidates, while Communist candidates made it in three districts.
	   But no one received the majority needed to win outright victory,
and Civic Democratic Party officials cautioned that the results
were inconclusive and could be reversed in the next round, as in
1996.
	   ``It was just the semifinals,'' Klaus said on Czech television.
``Nobody should rejoice too much.''
	   He said, however, that the first round meant a ``good signal for
the future'' as it did not confirm an anticipated turn to the left.
	   A third of the seats in the 81-member Senate are at stake. The
top two vote-getters in each district will face each other in the
runoffs next Friday and Saturday.
	   Turnout was 42 percent, 7 percent higher than in the first
Senate elections in 1996.
	   The Civic Democratic Party currently controls 29 seats in the
Senate, 12 of them up for grabs in the vote. The Social Democrats
have 26 senators, with six up for re-election.
	   The rest of the seats are held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and Communists.
	   The Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted
by the lower chamber.
	   Preliminary results from local elections, which also took place
Friday and Saturday, indicated that independent candidates fared
well in small villages while the Civic Democratic Party led in big
towns.
	   Nationwide, independent candidates were leading with 57.2
percent, followed by the Christian Democrats with 11.8 percent and
the Civic Democratic Party with 9.5 percent.
	   In the country's 13 biggest towns, the Civic Democratic Party
was leading with 30.6 percent followed by the Social Democrats with
22.5 percent, according to preliminary results.
	   The turnout for local elections was 46 percent.
	   More than 60,000 local posts were at stake. Final results were
expected by Monday.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Rival sides of the war-divided island of
Cyprus commemorated the 15th anniversary of the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot republic on Sunday, with solemn protests among Greek
Cypriots and flag-waving celebrations among Turkish Cypriots.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash marked the anniversary with competing appeals
to the international community _ Clerides asking for help
reunifying the island, Denktash demanding long-denied recognition
of his republic.
	   ``The clocks will not be turned back. We will not step back,''
Denktash declared amid rallies that had thousands of Turkish
Cypriots marching through the streets of Nicosia.
	   He promised to keep his isolated state ``alive against the
odds.''
	   Cyprus has been partioned since Turkish troops took control of
the northern third in 1974 to protect the Turkish minority in the
wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The Turkish Cypriot state proclaimed on Nov. 15, 1983, is
recognized only by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there. A
U.N. buffer zone divides the two sides.
	   A top Turkish general came to the Turkish Cypriot celebrations
with a fierce warning for Greek Cypriots.
	   ``Heroic Turkish sons will be able to drown in their own blood
those who want to drink Turkish blood,'' Gen. Hilmi Ozkok declared.
	   The president of the Greek Parliament, Apostolos Kaklamanis,
flew in from Athens to join protests by the Greek Cypriots.
	   ``We call on the international community to ensure respect for
the Security Council resolutions branding the breakaway state
illegal and calling for the reunification of Cyprus,'' said
Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader.
	   Political party delegations and Greek Cypriot refugee
organizations delivered similar appeals to the embassies of the
five permanent members of the Security Council.
	   Hundreds of refugees also gathered at the U.N. crossing point
linking the two sectors to protest the division and reaffirm their
determination to return to their homes in the north.
	   This year's anniversary is marked by increased tension following
a warning by Turkey it will take military action to prevent the
planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles.

Iraqis believe America's real target is Saddam Hussein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Fixes date in 7th graf, style on airstrike &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Many Iraqis believe that if the United
States goes ahead with a military strike on Iraq, it won't be over
U.N. weapons inspections. They think the target is President Saddam
Hussein.
	   ``Saddam backed down from his decision. What they seem to want
now is to kill him,'' Samir Abdel-Hussein, a 37-year-old carpenter
told The Associated Press on Sunday.
	   The comment was repeated over and over by Iraqis interviewed in
Baghdad. Some said they went to bed thinking Iraq's letter Saturday
promising a renewal of U.N. army inspections had solved the crisis,
then awakened to find American airstrikes were still threatened.
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers delivered the message that the
United States was for aggression, no matter what. The daily Babil,
published by Saddam's son Odai, said American threats of a military
strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a cruel joke.''
	   Shoppers in Baghdad's Karada neighborhood, which was crowded
with families buying food, also complained about the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed eight years ago to punish Iraq for its invasion
of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and other trade
dealings, can't be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Bushra Noori al-Mousawi, 32, a teacher, said he was amazed to
learn Sunday morning that Washington had turned down Iraq's offer
to let the inspectors return and was still planning an attack.
	   ``They want to humiliate the president because they do not like
him, but they are doing it in the wrong way _ they are humiliating
the Iraqi people,'' al-Mousawi said.
	   ``The question is, who are they after?'' said Usama Hussein
Mousa, 57, a retired university instructor. ``If they are after
Saddam, why are they going after him over the bodies of over a
million Iraqis?''
	   It was a reference to Iraq's repeated assertion that shortages
of food and medicine under the sanctions regime have taken the
lives of more than 1.5 million people, many of them children.
	   Mousa complained that he couldn't afford the food he needed.
	   ``I have tasted meat or vegetables only a few times this year
because of the sanctions and the high prices,'' he said.
	   Ayad Mohammed Ali, 28, a candidate for a master's degree in
psychology at Baghdad University, said he was angry at the American
stance.
	   ``They (the Americans) wanted Iraq to reverse its decision, and
Iraq has done so,'' Ali said. ``Then today I have found out that
America is planning to kill me and other Iraqis.''
	   He added: ``We must unite to fight this.''
	   Muna Jameel Rohi, 45, a homemaker, said she had other concerns.
	   ``Yes, I fear war,'' she said. ``This does not mean I am a
coward. But I have children and a home to care for that could be
bombed by mistake.''

U.N. delays return of relief workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final 4 grafs to ADD details on food supplies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has delayed returning
its relief workers to Baghdad because of continuing debate in the
U.N. Security Council over the weapons inspection crisis, a U.N.
official said Sunday.
	   There had been reports from New York on Saturday that the 150
U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated last week to the Jordanian
capital Amman would begin moving back here on Sunday.
	   But the Security Council was unable to conclude its discussions
on Iraq's offer to renew cooperation with the weapons inspectors,
and a further session was scheduled Sunday.
	   ``Because of the extended deliberations in the Security Council,
it has been decided that the staff should remain in Amman for the
time being,'' U.N. spokesman Eric Falt told reporters. ``Of course,
we are anxious to have them return as soon as possible and to
return to full operations as soon as possible.''
	   The evacuations last Wednesday and Thursday reduced the U.N.
relief staff in Baghdad to about 55 people. An additional 230 U.N.
humanitarian workers remain in the north supervising aid to Iraqi
Kurds.
	   They monitor the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program. It is an
exception from U.N. sanctions that allows Iraq to sell limited
amounts of crude oil to buy needed food and medicine.
	   The food is distributed as monthly rations to Iraq's 22 million
people.
	   The program also was set back with the British-headquartered
Lloyds Register evacuated its workers. Lloyds must certify incoming
shipments at border points or suppliers don't get paid.
	   ``The United Nations is concerned by the implications of the
absence of personnel at the four border points, and we are in touch
with our parties to find a solution either through Lloyds or
through other venues,'' Falt said.
	   He said lines of trucks were forming at the Zakho border entry
point from Turkey.
	   More than half of food shipments come in at Iraq's southern port
of Umm Kasr, Falt said. They also enter at Trabil on the Jordanian
border and Al-Waleed on the Syrian border, he said.
	   He said there were no signs of shortages and that food
distribution was continuing smoothly. U.N. food stocks are ``fairly
satisfactory,'' he added.
	   Falt said that there was enough food in the country for all
Iraqis to collect their full November ration.
	   Full rations in upcoming months look problematic, he added. The
country has about a 23-day supply of wheat and a 12-day supply of
rice. On the other hand, the baby milk supply was enough for 108
days.
	   Falt later told reporters that food supplies were backing up at
entry points to the country because of the absence of Lloyds staff
to check them in.
	   He said that about 75 trucks carrying wheat were backed up at
Al-Waleed, 59 trucks at Zakho and a shipment of 14,000 tons of rice
at Umm Kasr.

Report: Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc plan merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ German pharmaceutical giant Hoechst and France's
Rhone-Poulenc are close to agreeing a 26 billion pound (dlrs 43.1
billion) merger, The Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper said banking advisers to the groups, Lazard Freres
for Hoechst and Rothschild for Rhone-Poulenc, have been in
intensive negotiations and a deal is expected within a week.
	   No confirmation of the report could be obtained Sunday.
	   The merged group would not match Britain's Glaxo Wellcome, worth
66 billion pounds (dlrs 110 billion), but would put the new company
among world's leading drugs and agrochemical firms.
	   Shareholders in Hoechst, with a current market value of 15.6
billion pounds (dlrs 25.9 million) compared with the French
company's 10 billion pounds (dlrs 16.6 billion), would have a
slightly larger proportion of the merged group.
	   The Sunday Times said opinion was divided about the reported
merger. Larger shareholders in Hoechst feared a culture clash and
said an existing joint venture, a plasma business called Centeon,
had suffered big difficulties, the newspaper said.
	   But other analysts were enthusiastic.
	   ``Both Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc have been imaginative in their
portfolio reorganization, so speculation of a merger could be
well-founded,'' Peter Blair, an analyst at the London company
Salomon Smith Barney was quoted as saying.

Gov. Ota's challenger claims victory in Okinawa gubernatorial
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with challenger Inamine's victory

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A governor opposed to the U.S. military presence on
his southern Japanese island lost his re-election bid Sunday to a
more flexible opponent, the semi-government television reported.
	   With 99 percent of the ballots counted, Keiichi Inamine, 65, an
adviser to a group of local business leaders, had 374,210 votes,
while incumbent Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota, backed by the largest
opposition party, had 337,149, NHK television said.
	   It showed Inamine celebrating victory as his supporters chanted
``Banzai!'' in unison.
	   ``There was a feeling that Okinawa was stuck with the military
base issues and the economy both not moving forward at all,'' said
Inamine, who was backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   ``I wanted to break this gloomy feeling and improve the
situation so that people can start seeing some light and make
Okinawa a place for young people to have future dreams and hopes,''
he said.
	   Two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are concentrated
on Okinawa, which accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's total
land area. The island was the site of some of the bloodiest
fighting in World War II.
	   Longstanding opposition to the military presence in Japan
exploded in 1995 when three U.S. servicemen raped a 12-year-old
Okinawan girl.
	   The central military issue of the campaign involved how to carry
out a 1996 U.S.-Japan agreement to move a U.S. Marine Corps
facility from a crowded Okinawan city to a more remote location.
	   Aimed at easing the American military burden on Okinawa, the
centerpiece of the accord calls for the closure of Futenma Air
Station in five to seven years as long as a suitable replacement is
built elsewhere.
	   The national government has proposed building a floating
heliport off the coast of Nago, a central Okinawan city north of
the capital of Naha. But Ota, 73, wanted the facility moved to
another part of Japan or outside the country entirely.
	   The 65-year-old Inamine backs a plan calling for the military
heliport to be incorporated into a new airport in northern Okinawa
that would also be open to civilian air traffic.
	   In February, a supporter of plans to build the floating heliport
narrowly won a mayoral election in Nago.
	   ``I'm sorry,'' Ota was quoted by Kyodo News as telling his
supporters. He had been seeking his third four-year term.
Expressing concerns over the likely change of policy, he added:
``I'm worried about a loss of consistency in the future.''
	   Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the ruling party, said voters
supported Inamine's realistic ideas about economic measures and
military base issues, Kyodo reported.
	   Inamine has pledged to improve Okinawa's relations with the
central government,which have soured over the bases issue, to help
promote economic stimulus measures.
	   The LDP supported a setback in another election, however. On the
main southern island of Kyushu, incumbent Fukuoka Mayor Keiichi
Kuwahara, who was backed by the ruling party, was defeated by
challenger Hirotaro Yamasaki, a former member of Parliament
supported by the nation's main opposition Democratic Party of
Japan.

Government wants to bring back prime minister's killers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The government is making all efforts to
extradite to Bangladesh the recently convicted killers of the
country's first prime minister, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the foreign
minister said Sunday.
	   Abdus Samad Azad told parliament the countries where the
convicts were hiding have assured Bangladesh they would cooperate
in sending them back.
	   Rehman was gunned down along with most of his family during a
coup in 1975.
	   A trial court in Dhaka convicted 15 of the 19 accused and
sentenced them to death for the assassination of Rehman, father of
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Four of the accused were acquitted
for lack of evidence.
	   The government is trying to track down the nine convicted
killers who are not in custody. Most of them were believed to have
fled Bangladesh after Hasina became prime minister two years ago.
	   A senior official at the interior ministry Saturday said that
formal requests have already been made to different countries where
the fugitives were believed to be hiding.
	   One convict was extradited from Bangkok, Thailand, last week.

Sokolova completes Russian sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - Yelena Sokolova completed a
Russian sweep of the titles at the Nations Cup by capturing the
women's event Sunday for her first major international victory.
	   Sokolova, an 18-year-old from Moscow, easily held on to her lead
after the short program by completing four triples to a classical
violin piece.
	   She scored marks between 5.4 and 5.7. She showed her coolness
under pressure by improvising a triple loop after bailing out of it
twice.
	   ``I don't know why I tried it again,'' Sokolova said. ``I knew I
should do it.''
	   Second was Ukrainian Yulia Lavrenchuk who started well but
faltered in the second half of her program.
	   Third was European champion Maria Butyrskaya who had a
disastrous free-skate. She made mistakes on nearly every one of the
jumps she tried and scored technical marks as low as 4.8.
	   Butyrskaya was so disappointed she refused to talk to the press
afterwards.
	   Butyrskaya won Skate America two weeks ago with Sokolova second.
	   Sokolova knows things will be difficult to make the Russian team
for the European or world championships.
	   ``There are a lot of good girls now in Russia and a victory here
doesn't guarantee anything,'' Sokolova said. ``But I don't want to
beat anyone. I just want to skate well.''
	   Sokolova's victory made it 4-for-4 for Russia at the Nations
Cup.
	   Even without Olympic champions competing this season, the
Russians have won eight of 12 events as the International Figure
Skating Grand Series reaches its mid-point.
	   Men's gold medalist Ilia Kulik and pairs champion Oksana
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev have bypassed the Grand Prix series
this year, preferring to enter pro-ams and do the show circuit
while staying eligible for future Olympic competition.
	   Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov have split up and no longer
eligible
	   Yet without them, the Russians still dominate the skating ranks.
The Russians will probably face tougher competition at their
nationals at the beginning of January than they will at the
European championships in Prague later that month.
	   Alexei Yagudin won the world title and has won four competitions
in four weeks and looks for another next week in Paris at the
Lalique Trophy. He showed a quad in his victory in Gelsenkirchen
yet Alexander Abt pushed him by just missing quads in the short and
long programs.
	   Newcomers Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov took the pairs title
and show they could challenge world champions and Olympic silver
medalists Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikarulidze.
	   Petrova and Tikhonov have been skating together five months
after he was in shows for nearly four years. Petrova and
Sikharulidze once skated together.
	   Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov unveiled a controversial
new program at the Nations cup but failed to score a convincing
victory. The routine, with no music but only drums and percussion
instruments, was greeted lukewarmly by the both the public and the
judges.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. Butyrskaya and
Yagudin are the top Russians in Paris next week and should continue
winning. The Cup of Russia in two weeks at Moscow and the NHK in
Japan are the final two Grand Prix competitions.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Czech opposition says too early to proclaim parliamentary victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite a strong showing in the
first round of Czech Senate elections, leaders of the main
opposition party cautioned Sunday that they weren't assured of
increasing their strength in Parliament.
	   The Civic Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced
the most candidates to the second round of any party competing in
the Friday and Saturday elections. Updated results early Sunday
showed they had qualified for runoffs in 22 of 27 districts.
	   The governing Social Democrats are next with 15 candidates in
next weekend's runoffs, a showing they called disappointing. A
grouping of four opposition parties led by the Christian Democrats
and Freedom Union finished third with 14 candidates, while
Communist candidates advanced it in three districts.
	   But no one received the majority needed to win outright victory,
and Civic Democratic Party officials cautioned that the results
were inconclusive and could be reversed in the next round, as they
were in 1996.
	   ``It was just the semifinals,'' Klaus said on Czech television.
``Nobody should rejoice too much.''
	   The first round, however, was a ``good signal for the future''
because it did not confirm an anticipated turn to the left, he
said.
	   A third of the seats in the 81-member Senate are at stake. The
top two vote-getters in each district will face each other in the
runoffs next Friday and Saturday.
	   The Civic Democratic Party currently controls 29 seats in the
Senate, 12 of them up for grabs in the vote. The Social Democrats
have 26 senators, with six up for re-election.
	   The rest of the seats are held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and Communists.
	   The Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted
by the lower chamber.
	   Preliminary results from local elections, which also took place
Friday and Saturday, indicated that independent candidates fared
well in small villages while the Civic Democratic Party led in big
towns.
	   More than 60,000 local posts were at stake. Final results were
expected by Monday.

Assad discusses modernizing army with Russian defense minister

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ President Hafez Assad on Sunday discussed
plans to modernize the Syrian army with the Russian defense
minister, diplomats said.
	   Syrian Defense Minister Gen. Mustafa Tlas also attended the
talks with Igor Sergeyev, Russian diplomats said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Russia has been Syria's main weapons supplier and most of the
Arab country's arms are believed to be outdated and in need of
upgrading.
	   Sergeyev is on a Middle East tour which will also take him to
Egypt.
	   He is expected to discuss the latest crisis between Iraq and the
United Nations with Syrian and Egyptian officials.

Turkey warns against granting asylum to Kurdish rebel leader

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy
for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to
``opening doors to terrorism.''
	   In Rome, 1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstrations
outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held
under tight security. Kurds arrived from Germany and France to show
solidarity with the rebel leader. A Kurdish group stopped at Rome's
airport launched a hunger strike.
	   If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured for
certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the
singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And very
possibly he'll be killed.''
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the Rome airport as soon as he
stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after
fleeing his hideout in Syria.
	   He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has
been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since
1984. The conflict has killed nearly 37,000 people.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and its most-wanted
criminal.
	   ``If Western European nations open their arms (to the rebels)
they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' Deputy
Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
	   ``If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday,
it will be opening its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added,
referring to Italy's handling of brawls that broke out among the
Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on Saturday.
	   The protests were peaceful Sunday.
	   Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has
heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there
have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has
consistently refused to extradite anyone if there were even a risk
of capital punishment.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a
meeting of European defense and foreign ministers, saying he would
tell Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that ``we expect a
serious and fair approach.''
	   He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who
reportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request.
	   ``To announce the results of an extradition trial that has not
yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told
reporters before departing.
	   In Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison took an Italian
prisoner hostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition.
Metris prison officials said the jail director was talking to the
inmate captors.
	   Ocalan, a political science dropout from Ankara University,
founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group
toward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among poor
Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims to have all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey but the rebels have havens in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the
fighting continues.

Czech ruling party says church interfering in politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The governing Social Democrats
accused the country's Roman Catholic leaders Sunday of interfering
in politics, saying a prominent cardinal was sabotaging relations
with the state.
	   In a statement by the Social Democratic Party leadership carried
by the CTK news agency, the party accused Cardinal Miloslav Vlk of
``irresponsible attempts to break the dialogue between the state
and the churches.''
	   It also said it rejects the cardinal's ``attacks'' on the Social
Democrats as ``an unacceptable politization of the Roman Catholic
Church.''
	   The statement follows an exchange between Vlk and Premier Milos
Zeman last week, after Vlk said the government was unwilling to
agree on members for a committee on what to do about property
confiscated from the church during the communist era.
	   The cardinal criticized the governing party for an inconsistent
policy on the church issue and said it does not enjoy the church's
confidence.
	   Zeman then demanded that Vlk apologize.
	   The dispute appears to be the biggest between the two sides
since the communist regime fell in 1989, although the church has
often been at odds with the government over restitution of
property.
	   Earlier this year, Vlk complained that 3,300 buildings were
confiscated from the church after the 1948 communist takeover. He
said governments were only giving back property they didn't want.
	   The Social Democrats are strong opponents to church restitution,
reflecting public sentiments in a country where Protestant
traditions remain strong.
	   Many fear that large-scale restitution would return the church _
the symbol of centuries of domination by the Roman Catholic
Austro-Hungarian empire _ to undue prominence.
	   The government is expected to discuss the latest controversy at
its regular session on Wednesday.

Roma beats Juve 2-0 to take over second place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It may have been a changing of the guard.
	   Young AS Roma controlled the action, scored late in each half
and generally seemed the more poised club Sunday as it beat
Juventus of Turin 2-0 to take over second place from the two-time
defending Italian League champions.
	   Both Roma and Juventus are just one point behind Serie A leader
Fiorentina, which went down to a 4-2 loss at Piacenza in a match
that featured three of the day's eight penalty kicks.
	   Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio slotted in Francesco Totti's
quickly lobbed 20-meter (-yard) free kick in the 44th minute and
French defender Vincent Candela squeezed a shot from a tough angle
between the post and 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi in the 87th for Roma
(5-2-2).
	   In between the goals, Juventus lost Paolo Montero to a red card
when the Uruguayan defender elbowed Paulo Sergio.
	   Roma's collection of young, swift players (Totti is 23, Candela
25) who fit well into Czech coach Zdenek Zeman's attack-first
philosophy has now beaten both Fiorentina and Juventus this season.
The capital's club looks capable of making a run at its first
league title since in 15 years.
	   There were extenuating circumstances for Juventus, though.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi, serving a one-game suspension for yelling
at the referee last week, watched the game from the stands. And
more significantly, it was the team's first game since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went down with what is likely to be a
season-ending knee injury.
	   Fiorentina (6-0-3) has no such excuse.
	   The league's best attack was simply outscored by 10th-place
Piacenza, the only all-Italian Serie A club. Paolo Cristallini
broke a 2-2 halftime tie with a header in the 58th minute, and
Giampiero Piovani added a late, insurance goal for Piacenza.
	   Fiorentina has 18 points, Roma (which owns the league's best
goal differential of plus-9) and Juventus 17, and AC Parma _ which
beat Udinese 4-1 as Argentine striker Hernan Crespo had a hat-trick
_ is fourth with 16.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, French striker Youri Djorkaeff hit two penalty
kicks in the first half to lift Internazionale of Milan past
Sampdoria of Genoa 3-0; last-place Venezia stunned Italian Cup
holder Lazio of Rome 2-0; Giuseppe Signori's hat-trick led Bologna
past Vicenza 4-0; Marco Di Vaio scored twice to lead Salernitana
past Perugia 2-0, and Arturo Di Napoli's double gave Empoli a 2-1
win over Cagliari.

French school monitors make plans for strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Following teachers and high school students, school
monitors made plans Sunday for a nationwide strike set for Tuesday
and Thursday.
	   The monitors say reforms proposed by Education Minister Claude
Allegre will result in a pay reduction as well as a lowering of
qualifications for the jobs.
	   Monitors in the Paris region will demonstrate Tuesday afternoon
in front of the Education Ministry. Teachers in other regions were
still planning their protest movements.
	   High schools and junior highs have been disrupted all fall,
first by sporadic strikes by teachers and then by a longer movement
by students demanding reform of the education system.
	   The students want more teachers to reduce overcrowding in
classrooms, more money to modernize buildings and equipment and a
reduction in their course loads.
	   Worried about unemployment which is high among young people,
high school students also want skills that will make it easier for
them to find jobs after graduation.

<TEXT>
	   PERIGUEUX, France (AP) _ A French man who had lit a fire in his
fireplace to keep warm was burned alive after he felt ill and fell
into the hearth where the flames consumed him, police said.
	   Jean Pautier, 63, lived alone and there was no one to help him
escape the flames Saturday evening in his home in the Dordogne
region of central France, police said.
	   A neighbor who had come to bring Pautier a document found the
elderly man about 8:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) and quickly alerted the
police.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Four former military commanders on
Sunday appealed their death sentences in the assassination of
Bangladesh's first prime minister, their lawyers said.
	   Syed Farooqur Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid Khan, Mohiuddin
Ahmed and Bazlul Huda were among the 15 former army officers
convicted last week in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a
1975 military coup. The officers were sentenced to die by public
firing squad.
	   The 11 other convicted killers, who were tried in absentia, were
reportedly living in Canada, the United States, Libya, Pakistan,
Kenya and Zimbabwe.
	   Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told Parliament on Sunday that
Bangladesh was trying to trace the fugitives and bring them home to
face execution.
	   The trial was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Rehman's
daughter, after she swept the general elections in 1996.
	   Rahman was killed along with his many family members, including
a 10-year-old son. Hasina and a younger sister survived because
they were on vacation in Germany.
	   No date has been set for the appeal hearing.

ROME: over Cagliari.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Bari hosted AC Milan in the night match.
 &UR; Roma 2, Juventus 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, a crowd of 72,000 packed Olympic Stadium, where the
hosts improved to 5-0-0, outscoring opponents 13-2. Paulo Sergio
snuck behind the Juventus defense to meet Totti's precise pass for
the go-ahead goal, and Roma was helped by Montero's expulsion in
the 59th minute.
	   Juve's substitute Uruguayan striker Daniel Fonseca, who used to
play for Roma, nearly leveled the score in the 77th, but his
20-meter (yard) free kick slammed off the woodwork with 'keeper
Antonio Chimenti beaten.
	   But as is its wont under Zeman, Roma continued to press forward,
and Candela's brilliant shot inside the far post sealed victory.
 &UR; Piacenza 4, Fiorentina 2 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, the hosts went ahead in the 12th minute on Massimo
Rastelli's goal, and the clubs traded penalty kicks _ Portugal's
Rui Costa and Brazil's Edmundo hit for Fiorentina, Simone Inzaghi
for Piacenza _ to make it 2-2 at halftime.
	   Fiorentina has lost three of its last five, while Piacenza
improved to 3-2-4.
 &UR; Parma 4, Udinese 1 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Crespo's goals in the third, 36th, and 61st minutes
give him five in the past three games and kept the hosts (4-4-1) on
their steady climb up the standings. Croat winger Mario Stanic
added Parma's fourth in the 86th, while Brazil's Marcio Amoroso
scored his seventh goal of the year for Udinese (2-4-2) in the
35th.
 &UR; Inter Milan 3, Sampdoria 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Djorkaeff connected from the spot in the sixth and
16th minutes and sealed the win by lofting a free kick that Chilean
striker Ivan Zamorano headed home in the 79th. Inter improved to
4-2-3, while Samp fell to 3-2-4.
	   Inter, which has already seen Roberto Baggio and Ronaldo miss
significant chunks of the season with knee injuries, had young
striker Nicola Ventola go down with a bad knee. Coach Luigi Simoni,
whose club ended a four-game winless skid, said Ventola could be
out a month.
 &UR; Venezia 2, Lazio 0 &QC; 
	   At Venice, Brazil's Tuta scored in the fifth minute and
midfielder Francesco Pedone doubled the advantage in the 39th for
Venezia (1-2-6), which was the last of the league's 18 clubs to win
a game. Lazio (3-4-2) also lost to then-last place Salernitana two
weeks ago.
 &UR; Bologna 4 Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, Signori _ who had one goal all season before Sunday
_ tallied in the 34th, 74th and 77th minutes to lead Bologna
(3-4-2), while Russian striker Igo Kolyvanov added another with a
minute to go. Vicenza is 2-3-4.
 &UR; Salernitana 2, Perugia 0 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Di Vaio hit the target in the 56th minute and in
injury time for Salernitana (2-1-6). Perugia is 3-2-4.
 &UR; Empoli 2, Cagliari 1 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, Di Napoli made a penalty kick in the 22nd minute and
scored again in the 63rd for the hosts (2-3-4). Cagliari fell to
3-2-4.

West Indies' Lara scores 101 for 213 at tea time with Griqualand

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara
hit 101 to take his side to tea on 213 for five wickets Sunday, the
second day of their four-day match against the provincial
Griqualand West.
	   Griqualand West were dismissed for 271 in their first innings on
Saturday.
	   With the first Test upcoming on Nov. 26, the 29-year-old batting
maestro was in threatening form. In 161 minutes at the crease, Lara
flayed the ball to all corners and conserved energy on yet another
scorching day by collecting 76 runs via the boundary ropes.
	   Lara cracked 16 fours and two sixes in all, with his 100 coming
off 140 deliveries.
	   Offspinner Pat Symcox yielded his duel with Lara to part-time
spinner Martyn Gidley, who eventually cut Lara down. Andre Botha
held onto a hesitant drive with a good catch in the covers. For
Botha, who had taken some stick from Lara _ his fourth over yielded
23 runs _ it was a catch to be savored.
	   Gidley and Symcox managed to pull a rampant run rate back to a
trickle. The most successful bowler was left-arm quickie Adri
Swanepoel, who despite conceding 23 runs from two overs, got rid of
Shivnarine Chanderpaul (42) and Stuart Williams in his second spell
to finish with 2-44 from 14 overs.
	   Chanderpaul, who batted for 138 minutes, put on 107 with Lara
for the third wicket, with Lara contributing 75.
	   The other wicket to fall was that of opening bat Clayton
Lambert, who was caught behind off the bowling of paceman Deon
Kruis for 11 in the third over.
	   West Indies' top bowler Courtney Walsh, who limped off the field
on Saturday, had no serious injures from a sprained ankle, the
South African Press Association reported. It was not known if he
would play on Sunday.
	   Two other West Indies players are out of action _ Curtly Ambrose
with a toenail removal and Jimmy Adams with severed finger tendons.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh had hoped to break
the record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcolm Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test
wickets.
	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's play against a
Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play after the
team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

Greeks hope Kurdish rebel leader will stay in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek media and officials leveled strong
opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan,
the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional
rival Turkey.
	   Ocalan, whose Kurdistan Workers Party has waged a 14-year war
with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, is in prison
custody in Rome where his arrest was announced Friday.
	   ``We do not give advise to other countries,'' said parliament
speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. ``Europe has a tradition of
civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by
that tradition.''
	   Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's arrest, which
was welcomed by the United States. But Greek government officials
have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination.
	   ``We have repeatedly brought attention to the problems created
by the blatant violation of human rights in southeast Turkey,''
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said late Saturday.
	   In the past, Greece has accused Ankara of waging a campaign of
``genocide'' against its Kurdish population. Ankara counters that
Greece is harboring PKK ``terrorists.'' Both sides angrily deny the
charges.
	   Thousands of Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq and Turkey have
sought refuge in Greece. A group of more than 100 Kurds began a
three-day fast in a downtown Athens square Saturday in support of
Ocalan.
	   Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, Turkey requested his
extradition to face a number of terrorism-related charges, which
could carry the death penalty.
	   ``Italy knows what the fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he
falls into the hands of the Turkish military regime,'' said an
editorial Saturday in the Greek daily Eleftherotypia. ``Ocalan has
requested political asylum in Italy as head of the Kurdish
liberation movement and should be allowed to remain in a democratic
country. He must not be extradited to Turkey.''
	   Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party
called on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep
Ocalan there.
	   The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary
deputies from the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a
bloc of 109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an
invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece.

Medieval singer Barbara Thornton popularized 12th-century opera
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Singer and medieval musicologist Barbara
Thornton, whose performances of an opera by a 12th-century abbess
popularized the little-known work with scholars and medieval music
aficionados, died last Sunday. She was 48.
	   Thornton, who died of complications from a brain tumor at the
Caritas hospice in Cologne, founded and directed the Cologne-based
Sequentia medieval music ensemble with her partner, Benjamin Bagby.
	   A specialist in the sacred music of Hildegard von Bingen,
Thornton introduced the abbess's opera ``Odro Virtutum'' to a wide
audience when Sequentia performed it for the first time in 1982.
	   The ensemble has since recorded all of Hildegard's music, and
its summer production of the opera at New York's Lincoln Center
Festival was one of three versions performed this year.
	   ``Her instrument was her voice, which was particularly suited to
medieval music,'' said her mother, Margaret Thornton, of Exeter,
N.H.
	   Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., and graduated from Sarah
Lawrence College. At 19 she moved to Europe, where she studied in
the Netherlands and Italy, and received a diploma from the Schola
Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland.
	   After moving to Cologne, she founded Sequentia in 1977 with
Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist. In addition to the works of
Hildegard, the ensemble has recorded sacred works from Spanish
monasteries and courtly love songs from the 14th and 15th
centuries.
	   In addition to her mother, Thornton is survived by her father,
Fletcher Thornton, also of Exeter, N.H., and sisters Susan Frey
Starbuck of Seattle and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock,
Vermont.
	   Thornton will be buried in Ascona, Switzerland, her mother said.

their campaign to forge a stronger European defense within NATO.
	   At a Rome meeting of European Union foreign and defense
ministers, British officials are prepared to outline their new
thinking on Europe taking a more independent stance on defense.
	   Until now, that was taboo. Britain worried a go-it-alone Europe
would erode Washington's long commitment to European security
through NATO.
	   But to the relief of France and Germany in particular, Prime
Minister Tony Blair changed course last month, endorsing the idea
of making the Western European Union, the EU's embryonic defense
group, into a more effective organization.
	   Monday's WEU session will be the first chance for Britain to
explain its thinking in that area.
	   ``If Europe wants the United States to maintain its commitment
to Europe, Europe must share more of the burden of defending the
West's security interests,'' Blair wrote in an opinion piece in The
New York Times on Friday.
	   ``We need to reform our armed services so that they fit together
better and are tailored to the next conflict, not the last war. We
need to reconstruct our forces together and make sure that spending
on defense in all nations matches the need,'' Blair wrote.
	   That will be tough, for technical reasons and others.
	   Duplication in arms-making by governments favoring their own
producers has long been a nightmare for NATO. As a result, European
arms programs have long been a hodge-podge of norms, standards and
ammunitions needs.
	   If the EU nations can make something of the WEU, they may at
last be able to project influence and security eastward, reducing
their reliance on United States.
	   Waffling by EU governments has put Washington in the driver's
seat of peace efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo. In 1997, the EU was
unable to deploy troops to secure aid deliveries to Albania amid
civil unrest there.
	   In the end, Italy cobbled together a 6,000-strong multinational
force.
	   At WEU ministerial meetings in the past year, in fact, France,
Belgium and other countries publicly suggested dropping the idea of
forging a common defense policy.
	   Ahead of the Rome ministerial meeting, WEU Secretary general
Jose Cutileiro complained to reporters, ``Why do we spend so much
time and energy talking about it not in considering how to
strengthen it but in endless discussions about its imminent, not so
imminent or hotly denied demise?''
	   The WEU is made up of 10 EU nations: Germany, Britain, France,
Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal and
Greece. The other five members _ Austria, Finland, Sweden, Denmark
and Ireland _ are observers.

Armenians in Emirates build their first church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROSHAN K. MACHADO &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Armenian community on
Sunday celebrated the consecration of the first church of its own
in the Gulf.
	   More than 1,000 members of the Emirates Armenian community
showed up to celebrate the consecration, crowding the 250-capacity
church, the community center, the courtyard and the street.
	   ``This is a dream come true for all of us and we have been
planning this for nearly 20 years,'' said Nishan Basmanjian, the
secretary of the Armenian community's local council.
	   Armenians previously worshipped in some of the country's 20
other churches.
	   The church was consecrated by Catholicos Aram I of the Holy See
of Cilipia, in Armenia - the Armenian equivalent of the Catholic
pope.
	   Aram I sprinkled holy water on the altar and the churches' two
entrances while reading scripture.
	   The stone church, with its stained glass windows, dome and two
spires, cost dlrs 1 million to build and took 11 months to
complete.
	   The money was collected from the country's 3,000-member Armenian
community and the 1,500 square meter (1,800 square yard) plot of
land, which also houses a community center and a catechism room,
was donated by the ruler of the emirate of Sharjah, one of the
seven that make up the United Arab Emirates.
	   Basmanjian, who is also a moderator at the Geneva-based World
Council of Churches, said there are plans to build a second
Armenian church in the capital Abu Dhabi.
	   For now, many are happy with what they've finally achieved.
	   ``We are happy that the Armenian community finally has a church
of its own to worship at, and which will also be a good place for
the youth to get together,'' said Sylvia Davidian.
	   The United Arab Emirates is the most tolerant of the
conservative Gulf Arab states.
	   Some two thirds of its population of 2.4 million are foreigners,
many of whom are Christians.
	   In Kuwait, Armenians worship in a hall converted into a church
that was built in the early 1960's.

	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara
hit 101 to take his side to tea on 213 for five wickets Sunday, the
second day of their four-day match against the provincial
Griqualand West.
	   Griqualand West were dismissed for 271 in their first innings on
Saturday.
	   With the first Test upcoming on Nov. 26, the 29-year-old batting
maestro was in threatening form. In 161 minutes at the crease, Lara
flayed the ball to all corners and conserved energy on yet another
scorching day by collecting 76 runs via the boundary ropes.
	   Lara cracked 16 fours and two sixes in all, with his 100 coming
off 140 deliveries.
	   Offspinner Pat Symcox yielded his duel with Lara to part-time
spinner Martyn Gidley, who eventually cut Lara down. Andre Botha
held onto a hesitant drive with a good catch in the covers. For
Botha, who had taken some stick from Lara _ his fourth over yielded
23 runs _ it was a catch to be savored.
	   Gidley and Symcox managed to pull a rampant run rate back to a
trickle. The most successful bowler was left-arm quickie Adri
Swanepoel, who despite conceding 23 runs from two overs, got rid of
Shivnarine Chanderpaul (42) and Stuart Williams in his second spell
to finish with 2-44 from 14 overs.
	   Chanderpaul, who batted for 138 minutes, put on 107 with Lara
for the third wicket, with Lara contributing 75.
	   The other wicket to fall was that of opening bat Clayton
Lambert, who was caught behind off the bowling of paceman Deon
Kruis for 11 in the third over.
	   West Indies' top bowler Courtney Walsh, who limped off the field
on Saturday, had no serious injures from a sprained ankle, the
South African Press Association reported. It was not known if he
would play on Sunday.
	   Two other West Indies players are out of action _ Curtly Ambrose
with a toenail removal and Jimmy Adams with severed finger tendons.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh had hoped to break
the record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcolm Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test
wickets.
	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's play against a
Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play after the
team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

Roma beats Juve 2-0 to take over second place
</HEADLINE>

late match, scheduled to start at 1930 GMT. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It may have been a changing of the guard.
	   Young AS Roma controlled the action, scored late in each half
and generally seemed the more poised club Sunday as it beat
Juventus of Turin 2-0 to take over second place from the two-time
defending Italian League champions.
	   Both Roma and Juventus are just one point behind Serie A leader
Fiorentina, which went down to a 4-2 loss at Piacenza in a match
that featured three of the day's eight penalty kicks, one short of
the Serie A record.
	   Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio slotted in Francesco Totti's
quickly lobbed 20-meter (yard) free kick in the 44th minute and
French defender Vincent Candela squeezed a shot from a tough angle
between the post and 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi in the 87th for Roma
(5-2-2).
	   In between the goals, Juventus lost Paolo Montero to a red card
when the Uruguayan defender elbowed Paulo Sergio.
	   Roma's collection of young, swift players (Totti is 23, Candela
25) who fit well into Czech coach Zdenek Zeman's attack-first
philosophy has now beaten both Fiorentina and Juventus this season.
The capital's club looks capable of making a run at its first
league title in 15 years.
	   There were extenuating circumstances for Juventus, though.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi, serving a one-game suspension for yelling
at the referee last week, watched the game from the stands. And
more significantly, it was the team's first game since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went down with what is likely to be a
season-ending knee injury.
	   Fiorentina (6-0-3) has no such excuse.
	   The league's best attack was simply outscored by 10th-place
Piacenza, the only all-Italian Serie A club. Paolo Cristallini
broke a 2-2 halftime tie with a header in the 58th minute, and
Giampiero Piovani added a late, insurance goal for Piacenza.
	   Fiorentina has 18 points, Roma (which owns the league's best
goal differential of plus-9) and Juventus 17 apiece, and AC Parma _
which beat Udinese 4-1 as Argentine striker Hernan Crespo had a
hat-trick _ is fourth with 16.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, French striker Youri Djorkaeff hit two early
penalty kicks to lift Internazionale of Milan past Sampdoria of
Genoa 3-0; last-place Venezia stunned Italian Cup holder Lazio of
Rome 2-0; Giuseppe Signori's hat-trick led Bologna past Vicenza
4-0; Marco Di Vaio scored twice to lead Salernitana past Perugia
2-0, and Arturo Di Napoli's double gave Empoli a 2-1 win over
Cagliari.
	   Bari hosted AC Milan in the night match.
 &UR; Roma 2, Juventus 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, a crowd of 72,000 packed Olympic Stadium, where the
hosts improved to 5-0-0 and have outscored opponents 13-2. Paulo
Sergio snuck behind the Juventus defense to meet Totti's precise
pass for the go-ahead goal, and Roma was helped by Montero's
expulsion in the 59th minute.
	   Juve's substitute Uruguayan striker Daniel Fonseca, who used to
play for Roma, nearly leveled the score in the 77th, but his
20-meter (yard) free kick slammed off the woodwork with 'keeper
Antonio Chimenti beaten.
	   But as is its wont under Zeman, Roma continued to press forward,
and Candela's brilliant shot inside the far post sealed victory.
 &UR; Piacenza 4, Fiorentina 2 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, the hosts went ahead in the 12th minute on Massimo
Rastelli's goal, and the clubs traded penalty kicks _ Portugal's
Rui Costa and Brazil's Edmundo hit for Fiorentina, Simone Inzaghi
for Piacenza _ to make it 2-2 at halftime.
	   Fiorentina has lost three of its last five, while Piacenza
improved to 3-2-4.
 &UR; Parma 4, Udinese 1 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Crespo's goals in the third, 36th, and 61st minutes
gave him five in the past three games and kept the hosts (4-4-1) on
their steady climb up the standings. Croat winger Mario Stanic
added Parma's fourth in the 86th, while Brazil's Marcio Amoroso
scored his seventh goal of the year for Udinese (2-4-2) in the
35th.
 &UR; Inter Milan 3, Sampdoria 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Djorkaeff connected from the spot in the sixth and
16th minutes and sealed the win by lofting a free kick that Chilean
striker Ivan Zamorano headed home in the 79th. Inter improved to
4-2-3, while Samp fell to 3-2-4.
	   Inter, which has already seen Roberto Baggio and Ronaldo miss
significant chunks of the season with knee injuries, had young
striker Nicola Ventola go down with a sprained right knee. Coach
Luigi Simoni, whose club ended a four-game winless skid, said
Ventola could be out a month.
 &UR; Venezia 2, Lazio 0 &QC; 
	   At Venice, Brazil's Tuta scored in the fifth minute and
midfielder Francesco Pedone doubled the advantage in the 39th for
Venezia (1-2-6), which was the last of the league's 18 clubs to win
a game. Lazio (3-4-2) lost to then-last place Salernitana two weeks
ago.
 &UR; Bologna 4 Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, Signori _ who had one goal all season before Sunday
_ tallied in the 34th, 74th and 77th minutes to lead Bologna
(3-4-2), while Russian striker Igo Kolyvanov added another with a
minute to go. Vicenza is 2-3-4.
 &UR; Salernitana 2, Perugia 0 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Di Vaio hit the target in the 56th minute and in
injury time for Salernitana (2-1-6). Perugia is 3-2-4.
 &UR; Empoli 2, Cagliari 1 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, Di Napoli made a penalty kick in the 22nd minute and
scored again in the 63rd for the hosts (2-3-4). Cagliari fell to
3-2-4.

	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara
scored an unbeaten 87 (not out) to take his side to lunch on 133
for two wickets Sunday, the second day of their four-day match
against the provincial Griqualand West.
	   Griqualand West were dismissed for 271 in their first innings on
Saturday.
	   With the first Test upcoming on Nov. 26, the 29-year-old batting
maestro was in threatening form. In just over two hours at the
crease, Lara flayed the ball to all corners and conserved energy on
yet another scorching day by collecting 72 runs via the boundary
ropes.
	   Lara cracked 15 fours and two sixes in all, with his 50 coming
off just 75 deliveries.
	   Offspinner Pat Symcox went to lunch with a respectable 1-25 from
11 overs, first claiming Philo Wallace's wicket before duelling
with Lara.
	   Umpire Cyril Mitchley turned down a leg-before appeal from
Symcox when Lara had 46.
	   Lara responded by dancing down the wicket and cracking the ball
to the mid-wicket fence. He followed that with a searing six over
mid-off.
	   The other wicket to fall was that of opening bat Clayton
Lambert, who was caught behind off the bowling of paceman Deon
Kruis for 11 in the third over.
	   West Indies' top bowler Courtney Walsh, who limped off the field

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Todd Martin capitalized on Thomas
Johansson's sloppy serving and beat the Swede in three straight
sets to win the Stockholm Open for the first time Sunday.
	   The 28-year-old American, who lost the title match two years ago
to another Swede, Thomas Enqvist, won 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 before a
sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall.
	   He became the first American winner of one of the world's oldest
indoor tournaments since John McEnroe in 1984 and 1985.
	   ``I was very confident before the final, because I've played
very well in the past few weeks,'' said Martin, who beat world No.
3 Patrick Rafter and No. 5 Andre Agassi en route to the semis in
the Paris Open a week ago. ``Neither of us played our best tennis,
but I was fortunate to start each set well.''
	   Johansson, 23, a member of the Royal Lawn Tennis Club, played
his worst match of the tournament.
	   ``I had a good week, but it was a pity that I couldn't play
better in the final,'' Johansson said. ``It was my worst match this
week. But he played very well and deserved to win. If you want to
lose to someone, it's against Todd, because he's such a good guy.''
	   For Martin, it was the second ATP title this year. He also won a
tournament on clay in Barcelona in April.
	   Martin, unseeded and ranked 21st in the world going into the
event, earned dlrs 112,000 for his seventh career title. Johansson
earned dlrs 66,200.
	   It was the American's third victory in as many matches with
Johansson.

Portugal's Premier opens first railway across Tagus River
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres on
Sunday inaugurated Portugal's first railway line across the Tagus
River.
	   The railway was built on a 2.3-kilometer (1.4-mile) lower deck
of the April 25 Bridge, which is 32 years old and a near carbon
copy of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.
	   The 50-billion-escudo (about dlrs 300-million) project _ due to
open to the public in April _ is expected to ease traffic on the
bridge, which is used by an average of 220,000 commuters per day.
	   The new trains have a capacity of transporting 120,000 people
per day. One-way tickets range in cost from 190 escudos (dlrs 1.1)
to 440 escudos (dlrs 2.6).
	   A new 14-kilometer (8.4-mile) suspension bridge over the Tagus
opened earlier this year, but a toll of 320 escudos (dlrs 1.86) has
kept most commuters from using it as an alternative.

Yevgeny Kafelnikov beats Goran Ivanisevic to win Kremlin Cup

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with quotes from Ivanisevic, Kafelnikov,
doubles results &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia
beat Goran Ivanisevic in the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup for his
third title of the year Sunday, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-5).
	   With the victory, Kafelnikov secured the eighth and final berth
in the ATP Tour World Championship, which will be played Nov. 24-29
in Hanover, Germany.
	   Neither player managed to break in the first set, though
Ivanisevic came close on the twelfth game. With advantage at deuce,
the Croatian dropped set point when he sent an overhead smash into
the net. Kafelnikov then fired an ace and held with another
powerful serve Ivanisevic couldn't return.
	   In the tie-breaker, Ivanisevic, ranked No. 13 on the ATP tour,
sent another ball into the net to go down 6-2, and Kafelnikov
finished the set with a backhand cross.
	   ``I missed the very easy overhead _ impossible to miss,''
Ivanisevic said afterwards. ``Yevgeny played a better match than me
today when he needed to, and that's why he won.''
	   Kafelnikov said the first set tiebreaker was the key to his
victory, although he didn't necessarily realize it at the time.
	   ``I knew I had to win, and I didn't pay much attention to his
mistake at the end of the first set, `` he said. ``If I hadn't won
the first set, it all could have been different.''
	   The second set saw the capacity crowd of 18,000 grow more
raucous as the two players traded breaks on the extremely quick
Supreme carpet surface.
	   Kafelnikov broke in the fourth game to go up 3-1, but Ivanisevic
quickly broke back. Kafelnikov then broke again, holding his
opponent to love to make it 4-2. But Ivanisevic broke back yet
again and went on to hold in the next game to draw even at 4-4.
	   The two then held into the tie breaker. Finally, Kafelnikov, No.
8 in the world, took advantage of a weak Ivanisevic second serve to
go up 6-5 and followed with a powerful forehand volley to end the
match.
	   Ivanisevic had defeated Kafelnikov in the Kremlin Cup final in
1996.
	   The victory was Kafelnikov's third title of the year. He won at
the London Indoor in February and at Halle, Germany, in June.
	   Kafelnikov earned dlrs 157,400 and 230 points in the win.
	   In the doubles final, the U.S. team of Jared Palmer and Jeff
Tarango beat Kafelnikov and Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic,
6-4, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3.

Greeks hope Kurdish rebel leader will stay in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek media and officials raised strong
opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of a Kurdish
guerrilla leader to Greece's traditional rival Turkey.
	   Abdullah Ocalan, whose Kurdistan Workers Party has waged a
14-year fight for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, is in custody in
Rome, where his arrest was announced Friday.
	   ``Italy knows what the fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he
falls into the hands of the Turkish military regime,'' said an
editorial Saturday in the Greek daily Eleftherotypia. Ocalan
``should be allowed to remain in a democratic country. He must not
be extradited to Turkey.''
	   Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party
called on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep
Ocalan there. The move was also supported by a number of
parliamentary deputies from the governing Socialist party.
	   Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's arrest. But
Greek government officials have stressed support for Kurdish
self-determination.
	   In the past, Greece has accused Ankara of waging a campaign of
``genocide'' against its Kurdish population. Ankara counters that
Greece is harboring Kurdish ``terrorists.'' Both sides angrily deny
the charges.
	   Thousands of Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq and Turkey have
sought refuge in Greece. A group of more than 100 Kurds began a
three-day fast in a downtown Athens square Saturday in support of
Ocalan.

Armenians in Emirates build their first church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROSHAN K. MACHADO &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Armenian community on
Sunday celebrated the consecration of the first church of its own
in the Gulf.
	   More than 1,000 members of the Emirates Armenian community
crowded the 250-capacity church, the community center, the
courtyard and the street.
	   ``This is a dream come true for all of us, and we have been
planning this for nearly 20 years,'' said Nishan Basmanjian, the
secretary of the Armenian community's local council.
	   Armenians previously worshipped in some of the country's 20
other churches.
	   The church was consecrated by Catholicos Aram I of the Holy See
of Cilipia, in Armenia.
	   Aram I, the Armenian equivalent of the Catholic pope, sprinkled
holy water on the altar and the churches' two entrances while
reading scripture.
	   The stone church, with its stained glass windows, dome and two
spires, cost dlrs 1 million to build and took 11 months to
complete.
	   The money was collected from the country's 3,000-member Armenian
community and the 1,500 square meter (1,800 square yard) plot of
land, which also houses a community center and a catechism room,
was donated by the ruler of the emirate of Sharjah, one of the
seven that make up the United Arab Emirates.
	   Basmanjian, who is also a moderator at the Geneva-based World
Council of Churches, said there are plans to build a second
Armenian church in the capital Abu Dhabi.

Young striker out a month, will miss Italy-Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Nicola Ventola, the young striker who has
carried Internazionale of Milan during the prolonged injury
absences of Roberto Baggio and Ronaldo, went down with a sprained
right knee himself Sunday.
	   Ventola, 20, was hurt late in the first half of Inter's 3-0
victory over Sampdoria of Genoa. He had surgery to repair the
anterior cruciate ligament of the same knee last November, while
playing for Bari.
	   ``It looks like Ventola will be out for about a month,'' Inter
coach Luigi Simoni said.
	   Ventola will definitely miss Italy's friendly game Wednesday
against Spain. He had earned his second straight call-up to the
national team, thanks to his club-high five goals for Inter.
	   Baggio replaced Ventola on the field for Inter Sunday and now
will likely move back into the starting lineup. Brazilian star
Ronaldo has appeared in just three of Inter's nine league games,
scoring in each, and sat out again Sunday. Both of the high-priced
strikers have battled knee tendinitis.
	   Inter also saw Dutch midfielder Aron Winter go down Sunday with
a right calf strain. It is unclear how long he might be sidelined.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Queen's Flight, the Royal Air Force squadron
that transports the royal family, government ministers and VIPs
around the world, may become partially private, the Ministry of
Defense said Sunday.
	   In a move designed get more value for money, companies are being
invited to submit ideas for private sector involvement in the
running of the 32 (The Royal) Squadron.
	   ``These are very early stages. We are looking at ways of working
with industry in partnership, with them offering support
services,'' said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defense,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``It could be
engineering, food, anything.''
	   The spokeswoman said the initiative does not amount to a
privatization of the fleet, which includes three jets and six
smaller planes.
	   Virgin Atlantic Airways, headed by British billionaire Richard
Branson, could be among the companies submitting proposals.
	   ``We have no definite plans at the moment, but we would
potentially be interested,'' said a spokesman for the Virgin Group,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.

Expelled Serb vice premier says he'd go to Bosnia again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's ultranationalist vice
premier on Sunday decried his expulsion from Bosnia by NATO troops
and vowed to visit again despite a ban on his presence there.
	   ``That was pure self-will, brutality showed by the occupying
forces,'' an angry Vojislav Seselj told reporters a day after being
forced to leave the neighboring country. ``I will go to Bosnia
again, when I wish to.''
	   Seselj was expelled after attending an inauguration party in the
Serb-run part of Bosnia for new Bosnian Serb president and fellow
nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   NATO peacekeepers in armored cars surrounded the hotel in Banja
Luka where the reception was held and told Poplasen that Seselj had
to leave. They cited orders from the office of the U.N. high
representative in Bosnia _ the top foreign authority overseeing the
country's postwar development.
	   The order, signed by the American deputy head of that office,
Jacques Klein, said ``Seselj's activities and statements both
during the war and recently offer clear evidence that his presence
in Bosnia would constitute an activity detrimental to the
implementation'' of peace.
	   Seselj left, condemning ``American occupation'' that he claimed
was aimed at destroying the Bosnian Serb republic. He was back in
Belgrade on Sunday, blasting ``the veiled form of occupation which
basically does not differ from Hitler's.''
	   ``The occupiers will have to leave'' the Bosnian Serb substate
or ``it won't exist,'' Seselj said, adding that Klein and his boss,
Carlos Westendorp, act like ``occupational governors of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.''
	   Seselj, a former paramilitary leader in Serb rebellions in
Bosnia and Croatia, heads the ultranationalist Serbian Radical
Party. Poplasen is head of the twin Serb Radical Party in Bosnia.
	   Seselj said that even though he thinks the expulsion contradicts
the 1995 Dayton peace agreement guaranteeing freedom of movement,
he agreed to leave on Saturday to spare Poplasen from more trouble.
	   In recent presidential elections, Poplasen won over a moderate
Bosnian Serb who was supported by Western peace officials.
	   Hours after the tense scene at the reception, Poplasen proposed
that fellow hardliner Dragan Kalinic replace the moderate Milorad
Dodik as Bosnian Serb premier.
	   ``Dodik must not remain premier because Americans want him so
much,'' Seselj said. ``That is the best proof that he is a
traitor.''

Cyclone hits southern Indian state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cylone hitting coast. ADDS details. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ A cyclone with wind speeds of 180
kilometers (110 miles) an hour hit the coastal districts in India's
southeastern Andhra Pradesh state Sunday causing extensive damage
to property and bringing normal life to a halt, officials said.
	   As many as 74 villages in low-lying northern districts were
evacuated as the cyclone buffeted the coast after dusk, uprooting
trees and ripping roofs from houses, Chief Minister Chandrababu
Naidu told reporters. The worst affected were mud and straw huts in
rural areas.
	   Train and road transport was halted as trees were ripped from
their roots and flung on rail tracks and highways. Power and
telecommunication installations were also damaged and several
thousand acres (hectares) of paddy and sugarcane fields were
destroyed.
	   But no casualties were reported, Naidu said.
	   This was mostly because advance warning of the cyclone had been
given to the coastal areas and several thousand people had been
evacuated. Air force and navy was also placed on high alert and
asked to keep ready naval boats and helicopters for the relief
operations.
	   Earlier Sunday weather officials warned a cyclone was hovering
over west central Bay of Bengal and was likely to reach the coast
near the port city of Vishakhapatnam, 800 kilometers (480 miles)
northeast of the capital Hyderabad, Sunday evening.
	   Power supply in Vishakhapatnam has been shut off and
communication systems has been disrupted.
	   After floods in September which killed an estimated 200 people,
this is second time in less than two months that natural calamities
have hit the state. Andhra Pradesh is buffeted by cyclones every
year. In 1996, a fierce cyclone killed more than 2,000 people.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with end of bus strike in Rennes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking train workers in Marseille held talks with
management Sunday, but service was seriously disrupted in parts of
southern France on the fifth day of a rail strike in the port city.
	   Only one out of five regional lines was running Sunday. Traffic
on long-distance routes was normal, although some delays were
reported.
	   The striking workers want the national rail company to hire 30
extra train conductors by the end of the year. A majority of train
conductors in Marseille support the walkout.
	   Talks between workers and management have been tense. On
Saturday, strikers sequestered six railway officials for several
hours before letting them go.
	   Traffic risks being even more disrupted this coming week since
train conductors in nearby Avignon said they would stage a one-day
walkout on Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, striking bus drivers in the western city of Rennes
voted Sunday to end their 12-day walkout. The drivers said they had
received assurances the upcoming 35-hour work week without a cut in
pay would be respected, as well as provisions for more breaks.

Arafat warns: ``our rifle is ready'' to pray in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS top and UPDATES with new Israeli reaction to Arafat
comments &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL103-107
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start that latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a
group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning
work on a bypass road for Jewish settlers for which 40 acres of
Arab land were confiscated in al-Khader near Bethlehem.
	   About 30 soldiers beat back 20 protesters who responded with a
hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets and tear gas
canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were treated for tear
gas inhalation, including Palestinian lawmaker Salah Tamari, and
one Israeli soldier was injured from a chunk of rock.
	   The sharpening rhetoric came as Ross tried to get both sides to
implement the Wye River memorandum, which calls for a 13 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange for stepped up
Palestinian security measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli officials Sunday and negotiators from both
sides met later in the day. He urged moving the debate off the air
waves and to the negotiating table.
	   ``One thing that is key: it is always better for the two sides
to talk to each other instead of at each other,'' Ross told
reporters after meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   Sharon said Arafat's comments made it ``difficult to conduct
negotiations'' and reiterated that Israel would ``annex'' the areas
of the West Bank it holds if Arafat announced a state.
	   Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's strong language came in
response to Israeli annexation threats and as a result of the delay
in implementing the withdrawal agreement. The first pullback had
been slated for Monday, but Israel said it would be delayed for a
matter of ``days.''
	   Speaking to members of his Fatah faction in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Arafat said: ``Our rifle is ready, and we are ready to
use it if they try to delay us from praying at al-Aqsa,'' the
holiest mosque in Jerusalem.
	   Defying Israel and the United States which have urged him to
drop the demand, Arafat said, ``we will declare our state on the
4th of May next year. This is our right....''
	   Netanyahu told reporters that Arafat's threats were undermining
the agreement.
	   ``This endangers the entire Oslo agreement and casts a very dark
shadow over the Wye agreement, as well,'' he said.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, Netanyahu delayed the time table
for implementing the land-for-security accord.
	   Sunday, Bar-Illan said Netanyahu informed Arafat in a telephone
call there would be a further delay due to recent events and
pending approval for the accord in the Israeli Knesset, expected
Tuesday.
	   ``There will be a few days delay in the withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from these areas,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated
Press.

Report: Pinochet will be moved from hospital to await ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet may soon be moved
from a London hospital to a more private place to await a final
ruling on Spain's request that he be extradited to face genocide
charges, a Chilean congresswoman said Sunday.
	   ``I was informed that Scotland Yard is looking for a safe place,
away from pressures by reporters and demonstrators,'' Maria
Angelica Cristi said.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 at the request of Spanish judge
Baltasar Garzon, who wants to try him for genocide during his
1973-90 dictatorship.
	   Chilean newspapers reported Sunday that Pinochet, who will turn
83 on Nov. 25, will be moved closer to the Brize Norton air base
near London. The Chilean air force has two planes stationed there
ready to bring Pinochet back home should he be released.
	   The reports said the transfer may occur as early as Monday.
	   The High Court of London recognized Pinochet's immunity from
prosecution, in his capacity as a former chief of state, but
prosecutors appealed that ruling. A final decision by the House of
Lords is expected this week.
	   Cristi, who visited Pinochet twice last week, said he is
improving slowly after undergoing back surgery on Oct. 9.
	   ``He is walking somewhat better, but still using a cane or
crutches,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, the Supreme Court was expected to announce Monday or
Tuesday its decision on a government request that one of its
justices take over 12 lawsuits against Pinochet that are being
handled by a lower level judge.
	   Media reports indicate the Court will turn down the request,
leaving Judge Juan Guzman in charge of the suits filed by human
rights organizations, relatives of victims of repression, the
Communist Party and the National Organization of Journalists.
	   The government request sought to prove that Pinochet would face
justice at home if he is freed in Britain.
	   At the same time, according to the government, its move
emphasized that it is for Chile's courts, not Spain's, to try
possible crimes that happened in Chile.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With choirs, prayers and speeches from politicians
including President Roman Herzog, Germany held annual memorial day
services Sunday remembering the victims of the century's two world
wars and those killed in acts of terrorism.
	   Before an audience of 1,500 in Berlin's lavish, gilded
cathedral, Herzog read a traditional remembrance statement
beginning: ``We remember today the victims of violence and war,
children, women and men of all nationalities.''
	   Giving the main address was Roland Ries, the mayor of
Strasbourg, France, who urged France and Germany to guard against
extreme right-wing movements. ``These voices, which make use of our
democratic institutions, succeed in being heard by those who lack
direction,'' Ries said.
	   The leader of Germany's Jews, Ignatz Bubis, and the German
army's chief of staff, Hartmut Bagger, laid wreaths Sunday morning
at a cemetery for German Jewish soldiers killed in World War II.
Berlin police held services remembering officers killed in the line
of duty.

	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara
hit 101 to take his side to a 56 point lead at stumps and only six
wickets down on Sunday, the second day of their four-day match
against the provincial Griqualand West.
	   Griqualand West were dismissed for 271 in their first innings on
Saturday, and West Indies held 327 at stumps.
	   Carl Hooper was the second top batter with 64, and Darren Ganga
took 50.
	   With the first Test upcoming on Nov. 26, the 29-year-old batting
maestro was in threatening form. In 161 minutes at the crease, Lara
flayed the ball to all corners and conserved energy on yet another
scorching day by collecting 76 runs via the boundary ropes.
	   Lara cracked 16 fours and two sixes in all, with his 100 coming
off 140 deliveries.
	   Offspinner Pat Symcox yielded his duel with Lara to part-time
spinner Martyn Gidley, who eventually cut Lara down. Andre Botha
held onto a hesitant drive with a good catch in the covers. For
Botha, who had taken some stick from Lara _ his fourth over yielded
23 runs _ it was a catch to be savored.
	   Gidley and Symcox managed to pull a rampant run rate before
lunch back to a trickle. The most successful bowler was left-arm
quickie Adri Swanepoel, who despite conceding 23 runs from two
overs, got rid of Shivnarine Chanderpaul (42) and Stuart Williams
in his second spell to finish with 2-44 from 14 overs.
	   Chanderpaul, who batted for 138 minutes, put on 107 with Lara
for the third wicket, with Lara contributing 75.
	   Opening bat Clayton Lambert was caught behind off the bowling of
paceman Deon Kruis for 11 in the third over.
	   West Indies' top bowler Courtney Walsh, who limped off the field
on Saturday, had no serious injures from a sprained ankle, the
South African Press Association reported. It was not known if he
would play on Sunday.
	   Two other West Indies players are out of action _ Curtly Ambrose
with a toenail removal and Jimmy Adams with severed finger tendons.
	   Replacement Floyd Reifer arrived in Kimberley on Sunday,
travelling from a match with the West Indies A side in Bangladesh.
	   When the test starts later this month, Walsh had hoped to break
the record for most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler now held by
Malcolm Marshall with 376 wickets. Marshall has captured 375 Test
wickets.
	   Rain and hail brought an early end to Wednesday's play against a
Gauteng Invitation XI at Soweto, the first real play after the
team's arrival was delayed by a pay dispute.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

Medieval singer Barbara Thornton popularized 12th-century opera
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Singer and medieval musicologist Barbara
Thornton, whose performances of an opera by a 12th-century abbess
popularized the little-known work with scholars and medieval music
aficionados, died Nov. 8. She was 48.
	   Thornton, who died of complications from a brain tumor at the
Caritas hospice in Cologne, founded and directed the Cologne-based
Sequentia medieval music ensemble with her partner, Benjamin Bagby.
	   A specialist in the sacred music of Hildegard von Bingen,
Thornton introduced the abbess's opera ``Odro Virtutum'' to a wide
audience when Sequentia performed it for the first time in 1982.
	   The ensemble has since recorded all of Hildegard's music, and
its summer production of the opera at New York's Lincoln Center
Festival was one of three versions performed this year.
	   ``Her instrument was her voice, which was particularly suited to
medieval music,'' said her mother, Margaret Thornton, of Exeter,
New Hampshire.
	   Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., and graduated from Sarah
Lawrence College. At 19 she moved to Europe, where she studied in
the Netherlands and Italy, and received a diploma from the Schola
Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland.
	   After moving to Cologne, she founded Sequentia in 1977 with
Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist. In addition to the works of
Hildegard, the ensemble has recorded sacred works from Spanish
monasteries and courtly love songs from the 14th and 15th
centuries.
	   In addition to her mother, Thornton is survived by her father,
Fletcher Thornton, also of Exeter, New Hampshire, and sisters Susan
Frey Starbuck of Seattle and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock,
Vermont.
	   Thornton will be buried in Ascona, Switzerland, her mother
said.

Arafat warns: ``our rifle is ready'' to pray in Jerusalem

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start implementation of the latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a
group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning
work to pave a road for Jewish settlers. Israel had confiscated 40
acres (16 hectares) of Arab land in the West Bank village of
al-Khader for the road.
	   About 30 soldiers beat back 20 protesters, who responded with a
hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets and tear gas
canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were treated for tear
gas inhalation, including Palestinian lawmaker Salah Tamari. One
Israeli soldier was injured from a chunk of rock.
	   The sharpening rhetoric came as Ross tried to get both sides to
implement the Wye River memorandum, which calls for a 13 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange for stepped up
Palestinian security measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli officials Sunday and negotiators from both
sides met later in the day. He urged moving the debate off the
airwaves and to the negotiating table.
	   ``One thing that is key: it is always better for the two sides
to talk to each other instead of at each other,'' Ross told
reporters after meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   Sharon said Arafat's comments made it ``difficult to conduct
negotiations'' and reiterated that Israel would ``annex'' the areas
of the West Bank it holds if Arafat unilaterally declared a
Palestinian state.
	   Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's strong language came in
response to Israeli annexation threats and as a result of the delay
in implementing the withdrawal agreement. The first pullback had
been slated for Monday, but Israel said it would be delayed for a
matter of ``days.''
	   Speaking to members of his Fatah faction in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Arafat said: ``Our rifle is ready, and we are ready to
use it if they try to delay us from praying at al-Aqsa,'' the
holiest mosque in Jerusalem.
	   Defying Israeli and the U.S. wishes, Arafat said, ``We will
declare our state on the 4th of May next year. This is our right...
.''
	   Netanyahu told reporters that Arafat's threats were undermining
the agreement.
	   ``This endangers the entire Oslo agreement and casts a very dark
shadow over the Wye agreement, as well,'' he said.
	   Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought to
allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying it
will be the ``bridge of love and peace.''
	   In a 30-minute broadcast on the official Voice of Palestine,
Arafat coupled his appeal with a warning to Islamic militants and
their supporters in the Arab world that he would not tolerate
interference.
	   ``We are not going to allow anyone to attack our dream and to
destroy our Palestinian national project,'' he said, adding that
anti-Israel attacks now would provide Israel with an excuse to back
out of the agreement to hand over land.
	   Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli
school bus and a Jerusalem market, Netanyahu delayed the time table
for implementing the land-for-security accord.
	   Sunday, Bar-Illan said Netanyahu told Arafat in a telephone call
there would be a further delay because of those events and pending
approval of the accord in the Israeli Knesset, expected Tuesday.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms
inspectors means any attack carried out now by the United States
would amount to ``naked aggression'' without legal grounds, an
Iraqi official said Sunday.
	   The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said the government of President Saddam Hussein was
reversing decisions taken in August and October to halt cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   President Clinton said Sunday that Iraq had narrowly averted a
military strike and warned Baghdad that it must live up to its
pledge to cooperate unconditionally with the inspectors.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Baghdad to Clinton's
statement.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair also warned that the crisis
``is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance is
guaranteed and delivered.''
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, however, cautioned that
airstrikes would ``be counterproductive,'' the Interfax new agency
reported.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ With choirs, prayers and speeches from politicians
including President Roman Herzog, Germany held annual memorial day
services Sunday remembering the victims of the century's two world
wars and those killed in acts of terrorism.
	   Before an audience of 1,500 in Berlin's lavish, gilded
cathedral, Herzog read a traditional remembrance statement
beginning: ``We remember today the victims of violence and war,
children, women and men of all nationalities.''
	   Giving the main address was Roland Ries, the mayor of
Strasbourg, France, who urged France and Germany to guard against
extreme right-wing movements. ``These voices, which make use of our
democratic institutions, succeed in being heard by those who lack
direction,'' Ries said.
	   The leader of Germany's Jews, Ignatz Bubis, and the German
army's chief of staff, Hartmut Bagger, laid wreaths Sunday morning
at a cemetery for German Jewish soldiers killed in World War I.
Berlin police held services remembering officers killed in the line
of duty.

Medieval singer Barbara Thornton popularized 12th-century opera

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Singer and medieval musicologist Barbara
Thornton, whose performances of an opera by a 12th-century abbess
popularized the little-known work with scholars and medieval music
aficionados, died Nov. 8. She was 48.
	   Thornton, who died of complications from a brain tumor at the
Caritas hospice in Cologne, founded and directed the Cologne-based
Sequentia medieval music ensemble with her partner, Benjamin Bagby.
	   A specialist in the sacred music of Hildegard von Bingen,
Thornton introduced the abbess's opera ``Odro Virtutum'' to a wide
audience when Sequentia performed it for the first time in 1982.
	   The ensemble has since recorded all of Hildegard's music, and
its summer production of the opera at New York's Lincoln Center
Festival was one of three versions performed this year.
	   ``Her instrument was her voice, which was particularly suited to
medieval music,'' said her mother, Margaret Thornton, of Exeter,
New Hampshire.
	   Thornton was born in Summit, New Jersey, and graduated from
Sarah Lawrence College. At 19 she moved to Europe, where she
studied in the Netherlands and Italy, and received a diploma from
the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland.
	   After moving to Cologne, she founded Sequentia in 1977 with
Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist. In addition to the works of
Hildegard, the ensemble has recorded sacred works from Spanish
monasteries and courtly love songs from the 14th and 15th
centuries.
	   In addition to her mother, Thornton is survived by her father,
Fletcher Thornton, also of Exeter, New Hampshire, and sisters Susan
Frey Starbuck of Seattle and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock,
Vermont.
	   Thornton will be buried in Ascona, Switzerland, her mother said.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite a strong showing in the
first round of Czech Senate elections, leaders of the main
opposition party said Sunday they weren't assured of increasing
their strength in Parliament.
	   The Civic Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced
the most candidates to the second round of any party competing in
the Friday and Saturday elections. Updated results Sunday showed
they had qualified for runoffs in 22 of 27 districts.
	   The governing Social Democrats are next with 15 candidates in
next weekend's runoffs, a showing they called disappointing. A
grouping of four opposition parties led by the Christian Democrats
and Freedom Union finished third with 14 candidates, while
Communist candidates made it in three districts.
	   But no one received the majority needed to win outright victory,
and Civic Democratic Party officials cautioned that the results
were inconclusive and could be reversed in the next round, as in
1996.
	   ``It was just the semifinals,'' Klaus said on Czech television.
``Nobody should rejoice too much.''
	   He said the first round did send a ``good signal for the
future,'' as it did not confirm an anticipated turn to the left.
	   The senatorial voting is considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government, which took over from Klaus'
party after elections in June. The stagnant Czech economy and poor
law enforcement are among the top issues.
	   A third of the seats in the 81-member Senate are at stake. The
top two vote-getters in each district will face each other in the
runoffs next Friday and Saturday.
	   Turnout was 42 percent, 7 percent higher than in the first
Senate elections in 1996.
	   The Civic Democratic Party currently controls 29 seats in the
Senate, 12 of them up for grabs in the vote. The Social Democrats
have 26 senators, with six up for re-election.
	   The rest of the seats are held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and Communists.
	   The Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted
by the lower chamber.
	   Complete unofficial results from local elections, which also
took place Friday and Saturday, showed that independent candidates
fared well in small villages while the Civic Democratic Party led
in big towns.
	   Nationwide, independent candidates gained 57.1 percent, followed
by the Christian Democrats with 11.8 percent and the Communists
with 9.6 percent. The Civic Democratic Party finished fourth with
9.5 percent.
	   In the country's 13 biggest towns, the Civic Democratic Party
won with 30.6 percent followed by the Social Democrats with 22.5
percent.
	   The turnout for local elections was 45 percent.
	   More than 60,000 local posts were at stake. Official results are
expected Monday.

Iraq says a U.S. attack would be ``naked aggression''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton comments, British, Russian reactions &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ If the United States were to attack Iraq,
even after the Arab state capitulated to U.N. demands, it would be
simply an act of ``naked aggression'' with no legal merit, an Iraqi
official said Sunday.
	   In a letter sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Iraq said the government of President Saddam Hussein was reversing
its decision to halt cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday that Iraq had narrowly
averted a military strike and warned Baghdad that it must live up
to its pledge to cooperate unconditionally with the inspectors.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Baghdad to Clinton's
statement.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair also warned that the crisis
``is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance is
guaranteed and delivered.''
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, however, cautioned that
airstrikes would ``be counterproductive,'' the Interfax new agency
reported.

Greens call for government to give permits to illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Environment Minister appealed to the
government Sunday to give residency permits to illegal immigrants,
saying it was a ``humane solution'' to the problem.
	   Dominique Voynet spoke at a national assembly of the Greens two
days after police ended a 73-day sit-in by illegal immigrants who
were demanding the government reconsider their residency permits.
	   The French government has legalized the status of some 76,000
illegal immigrants but has rejected residency requested for more
than 64,000 others.
	   The Greens want the Socialist-led government to provide
residency status for all of illegal immigrants, who in French are
called ``sans papiers'' or those without papers.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has been more generous in granting
residency permits to illegal immigrants than the previous
conservative government.
	   But the far right National Front, which blames high unemployment
on immigrants, has accused Jospin of being too soft on the issue.

Turkey warns against granting asylum to Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for
the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan,
saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening
doors to terrorism.''
	   Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protests
and hunger strikes in fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel
leader. Kurds came to Rome by bus and car from across Western
Europe for a 1,500-strong protest outside the military hospital
where Ocalan is believed held under tight security.
	   If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured for
certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the
singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And very
possibly he'll be killed.''
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the Rome airport as soon as he
stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after
fleeing his hideout in Syria.
	   He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has
been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since
1984. The conflict has killed nearly 37,000 people.
	   To Turkey, Ocalan is the nation's most-wanted criminal.
	   ``If Western European nations open their arms (to the rebels)
they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' Deputy
Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
	   ``If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday,
it will be opening its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added,
referring to Italy's handling of brawls that broke out during the
first day of protests Saturday outside the Rome military hospital.
	   The protest in Rome was peaceful Sunday. Elsewhere in Europe,
dozens of Kurds protested in Bucharest until chased away by police;
1,000 Kurds rallied in Bonn, some waving pictures of the Kurd
leader; and 100 Kurds in Vienna set up tents outside Parliament and
declared a hunger strike.
	   In Turkey, four Kurdish prison inmates were in critical
condition after setting themselves on fire to protest Ocalan's
arrest, the independent Human Rights Association said.
	   Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has
heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there
have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has
consistently refused to extradite anyone if there were even a risk
of capital punishment.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a
meeting of European defense and foreign ministers, saying he would
tell Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that ``we expect a
serious and fair approach.''
	   He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who
reportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request.
	   ``To announce the results of an extradition trial that has not
yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told
reporters before departing.
	   Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin indicated to reporters in
Rome that Italian companies could be shut out of Turkey's billions
of dollars of defense contracts if it fails to turn over the Kurd.
	   In Italy, Dini told reporters in the city of Trento that the
government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a ``clear
and responsible manner.''
	   It was up for the courts to decide Turkey's extradition request,
as well as an expected one from Germany, he said.
	   In Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison took an Italian
prisoner hostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition.
Metris prison officials said the jail director was talking to the
inmate captors.
	   Ocalan founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the
group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among
poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims to have all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey but the rebels have havens in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the
fighting continues.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek media and officials leveled strong
opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan,
the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional
rival Turkey.
	   Ocalan, whose Kurdistan Workers Party has waged a 14-year war
with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, is in prison
custody in Rome where his arrest was announced Friday.
	   ``We do not give advise to other countries,'' said parliament
speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. ``Europe has a tradition of
civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by
that tradition.''
	   Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's arrest, which
was welcomed by the United States. But Greek government officials
have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination.
	   ``We have repeatedly brought attention to the problems created
by the blatant violation of human rights in southeast Turkey,''
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said late Saturday.
	   In the past, Greece has accused Ankara of waging a campaign of
``genocide'' against its Kurdish population. Ankara counters that
Greece is harboring PKK ``terrorists.'' Both sides angrily deny the
charges.
	   Thousands of Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq and Turkey have
sought refuge in Greece. A group of more than 100 Kurds began a
three-day fast in a downtown Athens square Saturday in support of
Ocalan.
	   Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, Turkey requested his
extradition to face a number of terrorism-related charges, which
could carry the death penalty.
	   ``Italy knows what the fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he
falls into the hands of the Turkish military regime,'' said an
editorial Saturday in the Greek daily Eleftherotypia. ``Ocalan has
requested political asylum in Italy as head of the Kurdish
liberation movement and should be allowed to remain in a democratic
country. He must not be extradited to Turkey.''
	   Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party
called on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep
Ocalan there.
	   The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary
deputies from the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a
bloc of 109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an
invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece.

	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ Brian Lara opened his tour with a
101 and led the West Indies to 327 for six at stumps Sunday, the
second day of a four-day exhibition against provincial side
Griqualand West.
	   Carl Hooper had an unbeaten 64 to help the Caribbean islanders,
who were replying to Griqualand West's first innings' 271 all out.
	   Darren Ganga added 50 for the West Indians, who have another
four-day exhibition match before starting its first test against
South African on Nov. 26.
	   But it was clearly Lara's show. The 29-year-old star batsman,
who was at the center of a pay dispute that threatenend to cancel
the West Indies' three-month tour of South Africa, hit 16 fours and
two sixes in his 161 minutes and reached his century off 140
deliveries.
	   Offspinner Pat Symcox yielded his duel with Lara to part-time
spinner Martyn Gidley, who eventually claimed Lara's wicket.
	   Andre Botha held onto a hesitant drive with a good catch in the
covers.
	   For Botha, whose his fourth over against Lara yielded 23 runs,
it was welcome relief.
	   Gidley and Symcox slowed a rampant run rate before lunch to a
comparative trickle.
	   The most successful bowler was left-arm quickie Adrian
Swanepoel, who despite conceding 23 runs from two overs, removed
Shivnarine Chanderpaul (42) and Stuart Williams in his second spell
to finish with two wickets for 44 from 14 overs.
	   Chanderpaul, who batted for 138 minutes, put on 107 with Lara
for the third wicket, with Lara contributing 75.
	   Opening batsman Clayton Lambert was caught behind off the
bowling of paceman Deon Kruis for 11 in the third over.
	   In a related matter, West Indies' top bowler Courtney Walsh
apparently was suffering from nothing more serious than the badly
sprained ankle incurred in Saturday's play, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   It was unclear if he would return to the match on Monday.
	   Two other West Indies players already have been ruled out _
Curtly Ambrose with a toenail removal and Jimmy Adams with severed
finger tendons.
	   Adams' replacement, Floyd Reifer, arrived in Kimberley on
Sunday, travelling from a match with the West Indies A side in
Bangladesh.
	   Walsh needs only one wicket for 376 which would equal the record
for test wickets by a West Indian bowler.
	   The long-awaited tour, West Indies' first here since the fall of
apartheid, should decide the No. 2 team after Australia.
	   In a sport dominated by white players, the black team's tour has
symbolic importance for South Africa, where President Nelson
Mandela sees sports as a bridge between racial divisions.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The home-court advantage didn't help
Thomas Johansson.
	   Capitalizing on the Swede's sloppy serving, Todd Martin beat
Johansson in three straight sets to win the Stockholm Open for the
first time Sunday.
	   The 28-year-old American, who lost the final two years ago to
another Swede, Thomas Enqvist, won 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 before a sellout
crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall.
	   Johansson, a member of the Royal Lawn Tennis Club, became a hero
on the same center court two months ago when he clinched another
final berth in the Davis Cup for Sweden.
	   But Johansson just couldn't get his usual strong serves going
against Martin. And he couldn't shake off the early jitters.
	   The American didn't serve well either in the first set, which
featured five service breaks, including four in a row. But
Johansson only managed to hold his serve once in the first set.
	   ``It was a very strange match,'' Martin said. ``I started off
very well and Thomas started off very poorly. He was nervous. And
the fact that he was a little nervous made me a little nervous.
	   ``That's why there were five breaks in the first set. That's not
the type of tennis you'd expect us to play, especially on this
(fast) court. But there's one thing I've learned over the last
couple of years. You don't have to play great to win.''
	   Martin became the first American winner of the Stockholm Open,
one of the world's oldest indoor tournaments, since John McEnroe in
1985.
	   ``I was very confident, because I've played very well in this
arena and in the past few weeks,'' said Martin, who beat
third-ranked Patrick Rafter of Australia and fifth-ranked
countryman Andre Agassi in the Paris Open a week ago.
	   ``And I was fortunate to start every set early with the break.''
	   Johansson, 23, the highest ranked (18th) Swede on the ATP Tour,
played his worst match of the tournament.
	   ``I had a good week, but it was a pity that I couldn't play
better in the final,'' he said. ``It was my worst match this week.
But he played very well and deserved to win. If you want to lose to
someone, it's against Todd because he's such a good guy.''
	   The ATP Tour is now over except for its annual season-ending
World Championships, featuring the top eight players, later this
month in Hanover, Germany. But the season is not over for
Johansson.
	   He'll try to get one of the singles spots for defending champion
Sweden in the Davis Cup final against Italy early next month in
Milan.
	   For Martin, it was the second ATP Tour title this year. He also
won a tournament on clay in Barcelona in April.
	   ``I felt like I have played better than I ever had in the past
five weeks and even before that, in the U.S. Open and
Indianapolis,'' Martin said. ``It's thrilling for me and I hope to
continue to improve and enjoy some more success like this.''
	   Martin, unseeded and ranked 21st on the ATP Tour going into the
event, earned dlrs 112,000 for his seventh career title.
	   It was the American's third victory in as many matches with
Johansson.

Czech opposition says too early to proclaim parliamentary victory

unofficial election results in grafs 12, 13 &QL;

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite a strong showing in the
first round of Czech Senate elections, leaders of the main
opposition party cautioned Sunday that they weren't assured of
increasing their strength in Parliament.
	   The Civic Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced
the most candidates to the second round of any party competing in
the Friday and Saturday elections. Updated results early Sunday
showed they had qualified for runoffs in 22 of 27 districts.
	   The governing Social Democrats are next with 15 candidates in
next weekend's runoffs, a showing they called disappointing. A
grouping of four opposition parties led by the Christian Democrats
and Freedom Union finished third with 14 candidates, while
Communist candidates advanced it in three districts.
	   But no one received the majority needed to win outright victory,
and Civic Democratic Party officials cautioned that the results
were inconclusive and could be reversed in the next round, as they
were in 1996.
	   ``It was just the semifinals,'' Klaus said on Czech television.
``Nobody should rejoice too much.''
	   The first round, however, was a ``good signal for the future''
because it did not confirm an anticipated turn to the left, he
said.
	   The senatorial voting is considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government, which took over from Klaus'
party after elections in June. The stagnant Czech economy and poor
law enforcement are among the top issues.
	   A third of the seats in the 81-member Senate are at stake. The
top two vote-getters in each district will face each other in the
runoffs next Friday and Saturday.
	   The Civic Democratic Party currently controls 29 seats in the
Senate, 12 of them up for grabs in the vote. The Social Democrats
have 26 senators, with six up for re-election.
	   The rest of the seats are held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and Communists.
	   The Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted
by the lower chamber.
	   Complete unofficial results from local elections, which also
took place Friday and Saturday, showed that independent candidates
fared well in small villages while the Civic Democratic Party led
in big towns.
	   More than 60,000 local posts were at stake. Official results
were expected by Monday.

Russia begins withdrawing women and children from Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with new quotes from Ivanov, Ivanov meeting
Albright; EDITS to DELETE outdated material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fearing Western air strikes against Iraq, Moscow
began withdrawing some Russian personnel from Baghdad on Sunday, a
government spokesman said.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov later said the decision had been
made ``in a rather tense psychological situation,'' before the
United States backed down from its threat to carry out attacks.
	   More than 100 people, mostly employees of the Russian embassy in
Iraq and some of their family members, left for the city of
Kermanshah in Iran by bus, the duty officer at the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   The ministry sent two planes to Kermanshah to pick up the
Russian citizens, who were expected to arrive in Moscow late Sunday
or Monday.
	   Ivanov, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, told reporters that ``no state in the world''
had backed Iraq's decision to bar U.N. weapons inspections and he
applauded the Iraqi decision to back down.
	   Interfax reported that Ivanov met with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to discuss the Iraqi situation.
	   ``We have common final objectives, we agree that the Security
Council's resolution must be fulfilled and the U.N. Special
Commission must continue its work in full and without any
preconditions,'' he said.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein halted United Nations' monitoring of
weapons sites Oct. 31. But the latest crisis has been building
since Aug. 5 when Iraq prohibited field inspections for nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.
	   Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. Saturday saying arms inspectors
could return, but the United States has said it fails to meet
American conditions to resume checks.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations
with the West.

Coventry keeps winning without Dublin; Dublin keeps scoring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Coventry doesn't seem to miss Dion Dublin.
	   With three goals from Steve Froggatt, Darren Huckerby and Noel
Whelan, Coventry beat Everton 3-0 Sunday in a battle of clubs
trying to stay out of the relegation zone.
	   It was Coventry's second victory in two games without Dion
Dublin _ and Whelan and Huckerby have scored in each. The win gave
Coventry 14 points, good for 15th place just behind Tottenham.
	   As for Dublin, first-place Aston Villa could not be happier.
	   Dublin, in his second match since moving on a 5.75-million-pound
(dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from Coventry, scored a hat trick in
Villa's 4-1 victory Saturday at last-place Southampton. He has five
in two games.
	   The victory kept Villa on top in the Premier League, three ahead
of Manchester United (25) and four up on Arsenal (24). Chelsea,
Leeds and West Ham have 20 points.
	   ``Dion has added something to our game which was lacking
before,'' Villa manager John Gregory said.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Arsenal 0, Tottenham 0;
Charlton 1, Middlesbrough 1; Chelsea 3, Wimbledon 0; Liverpool 1,
Leeds 3; Manchester United 3, Blackburn 2; Newcastle 1, Sheffield
Wednesday 1; West Ham 3, Leicester 2.
	   At Arsenal, former Arsenal boss George Graham had the final word
as Spurs managed a 0-0 draw. Tottenham coach Graham was met with
signs and calls of ``Judas,'' ``Tottenham Scum'' and ``Traitor.
	   ``Some people in the crowd gave me stick before and during the
game but it is part and parcel of the game these days,'' Graham
said.
	   At Anfield, Gerard Houllier's first game in charge at Liverpool
was a 3-1 loss to Leeds on three late goals in seven minutes _ two
by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Houllier, the former French national
coach, took over Thursday when co-manager Roy Evans stepped down.
The latest loss dropped Liverpool to 12th place.
	   ``I feel very, very sorry for the players. They are very
frustrated,'' Houllier said. ``We are too frail mentally.''
	   Manchester United beat Blackburn 3-2 as Paul Scholes scored
twice and then held off a late rally by Rovers.
	   At Chelsea, the Blues beat Wimbledon 3-0 with goals from
Gianfranco Zola, Gustavo Poyet and Dan Petrescu. It was Poyet's
seventh despite being used mostly as a substitute.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland pushed its
league-leading point total to 40 with a 2-0 win at Port Vale.
Ipswich held second place (35 points) with a 1-0 win over Barnsley.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division, Rangers stayed on top with 30
points after a 2-1 home win over Aberdeen with goals by Giovanni
Van Bronckhorst and Andrei Kanchelskis.
	   The weekend also signaled the start of the F.A. Cup with 33
first-round matches Saturday and four more Sunday, many pitting
semi-pro teams against clubs from England's second and third
divisions. The big upset was probably minnow Bedlington's 4-1 win
Saturday over second-division Colchester.

Politican: Turks in Germany welcome planned citizenship law change

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Germany's 2 million Turks are eager to
gain dual nationality under a planned easing of the nation's strict
citizenship law, a lawmaker said Sunday, one day after the
controversial deportation of a German-born juvenile delinquent of
Turkish decent.
	   Muhlis Ari _ known in the German media as ``Mehmet'' _ was flown
to Istanbul from Munich on Saturday, after Germany's highest court
upheld Bavarian state officials in revoking the boy's residency
permit for his long history of vandalism, fights and petty thefts.
	   His deportation followed months of debate and legal wrangling
over whether the state had the right to deport the 14-year-old, who
feels himself to be German but is not a citizen. A 1913 law bases
citizenship on German blood ties, not place of birth.
	   Seeking to better integrate the foreigners who make up one-tenth
of Germany's 75 million people, the newly elected government
recently agreed to ease the law to allow dual citizenship and to
give citizenship to those born in Germany.
	   ``If Mehmet had had double citizenship, he would have been
treated like any other German youth,'' said Cem Ozdemir, a member
of German parliament who is of Turkish decent.
	   The new law has yet to be drafted, but Ozdemir said many of
Turks are eager to take advantage of it after years of living
caught between two cultures.
	   Ari's parents, for example, have lived for 30 years in Germany.
His father, Yusef, worked for BMW, and his mother, Guelsen, was a
hotel maid. They have never been in trouble with the law, yet
Bavarian officials also sought to deport them, accusing them of
endangering public safety by failing to raise their son properly.
	   Courts blocked the deportation of Ari's parents, but after a
swift trial, Bavaria's highest court last month upheld the state's
decision to deny him a new residency permit, clearing the way for
deportation.
	   Ari's relatives living outside Istanbul were expected to take
him in, but they have not yet contacted the boy, his lawyer
Alexander Eberth said. Ari spent Saturday night in a state-run
juvenile home and then moved Sunday into an Istanbul hotel with his
16-year-old girlfriend, who flew with him from Germany. She is
expected to return to Munich in a week.

UEFA appeals panel confirms Fiorentina suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The appeals panel of European soccer's governing
body Sunday confirmed the decision to kick Fiorentina out of the
UEFA Cup for the rest of the season because of an explosion that
injured a match official.
	   The UEFA Appeals Body announced its decision after listening to
the Italian club's bid to have the game replayed. The incident
stopped the match earlier this month in a game against
Switzerland's Grasshoppers.
	   The game was played in Salerno and not in Florence, and the fan
who tossed the explosive device from the stands was apparently a
supporter of rival Italian club Salernitana.
	   UEFA ruled last Sunday that Fiorentina was responsible for order
and security both inside and around the stadium, but said the
``mitigating circumstances'' stopped it being excluded from future
UEFA club competitions.

Wiretapping scandal reveals industrial espionage is common in
</HEADLINE>
Brazil &QL; 
 &UR; BY JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Industrial espionage has become so
pervasive in Brazil that even President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
and his top ministers are vulnerable, the nation's chief security
officer said Sunday.
	   ``We are well aware that knowledge of commercial affairs of
state is big business,'' Gen. Alberto Cardoso told reporters.
``That's why the spy market is sophisticated and expanding.''
	   Gen. Cardoso, no relation to the president, was referring to
recorded conversations made public Sunday between the president,
Communications Minister Luiz Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara
Resende, the president of the state development bank.
	   Taped in July on the eve of the dlrs 19 billion auction of the
state-run telephone company, the recordings apparently show
Mendonca de Barros and Resende, the two officials who headed up the
sale, favoring a consortium of personal friends in its bid to
purchase a conventional telephone line company.
	   It is unclear where the tapes came from or who made them.
	   These revelations came as Finance Minister Pedro Malan was on an
official visit to the United States and Europe in an effort to get
credit lines from foreign banks. And President Cardoso recently
introduced an austerity program to reduce the nation's budget
deficit.
	   Some analysts fear the tapes and other recent allegations that
President Cardoso and three political allies hid millions in an
overseas bank account will divert attention from the government's
attempt to revive South America's largest economy, said Alexandre
Barros, a Brasilia-based business consultant.
	   This is the third time since Cardoso took office in 1995 that a
wiretapping incident has embarrassed his administration.
	   In 1995, a wiretap recorded a presidential aide, Julio Cesar
Gomes dos Santos, apparently asking a representative of the
U.S.-based Raytheon Co. whether he had paid the finance committee
chairman of Brazil's Senate for approval of the company's dlrs 1.4
billion project to build an Amazon Basin radar system.
	   And last year, two congressmen resigned after taped phone
conversations revealed them discussing bribes to vote for a
constitutional amendment allowing Cardoso's re-election.
	   The federal police said in a 1994 reports that Brazil's 600
largest corporations lose dlrs 7 billion annually to electronic
eavesdropping, most likely conducted by former intelligence agents.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, wiretappers brazenly offer their services in
newspaper classified sections.
	   Gen. Cardoso said his security agents have revamped the
telephone system in the presidential palace and key ministries and
make periodic sweeps for bugs in government offices.
	   Despite those precautions, Gen. Cardoso is not optimistic that
he can stop the bugs.
	   ``It's practically impossible for any government to have a
foolproof system against wiretapping,'' he said.

Voters turn out in Burkina Faso elections despite boycott call
</HEADLINE>

results by Nov. 29. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Voters throughout this dusty
and wind-swept West African country turned out Wednesday to
participate in presidential elections that opposition leaders had
hoped to derail with a boycott.
	   Polling stations were packed after opening just early in the day
and continued to see an steady flow of voters show up to cast their
ballots.
	   ``I just want to participate in democracy,'' said businessman
Louis Diallo while leaving a voting center in Burkina Faso's
capital of Ouagadougou.
	   Critics have maintained that incumbent president, Blaise
Compaore, manipulated the elections in his favor. His only
contenders are both seen as supporters of the president and not
genuine candidates.
	   Candidates from the country's leading opposition parties refused
to run in the election, calling it ``anti-democratic.''
	   Compaore denied the charges and urged all eligible voters to
cast their ballots.
	   ``I'm confident in the ongoing democratic process,'' he said
after voting.
	   Despite tensions between Compaore's supporters and his political
opponents, there were no major incidents reported.
	   Additional police and paramilitary troops were deployed in
Ouagadougou as a precautionary measure.
	   Opponents contend the election lacked transparency, although
observers from the European Union and the Organization of African
Unity were on hand Sunday to monitor the voting.
	   The weekend voting was the second presidential election in the
past seven years. Compaore transformed his military leadership into
a civilian administration by holding the first polls in 1991.
	   The head of state since he helped depose Capt. Thomas Sankara's
military leadership in 1987, Compaore later resigned his military
commission in order to stand for election in 1991.
	   Opposition parties working together boycotted those polls and
mounted a campaign to keep people from voting. Only 26 percent of
eligible voters took part in those elections.
	   This time around, a coalition of oppositions parties mounted a
similarly visible anti-election campaign, posting notices saying
``Do not vote'' or ``I boycott.''
	   The boycott strategy is partially in response to poor showings
in previous elections that opposition parties have participated in.
	   In National Assembly elections earlier this year, opposition
candidates won only 9 of 111 seats.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start that latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a
group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning
work on a bypass road for Jewish settlers for which 40 acres (16
hectares) of Arab land were confiscated in al-Khader near
Bethlehem.
	   About 30 soldiers beat back 20 protesters who responded with a
hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets and tear gas
canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were treated for tear
gas inhalation, including Palestinian lawmaker Salah Tamari, and
one Israeli soldier was injured from a chunk of rock.
	   Sunday, Ross tried to get both sides to implement the Wye River
memorandum, which calls for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank in exchange for stepped up Palestinian security
measures.
	   Ross met with Israeli officials and with negotiators from both
sides. Palestinian officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the three-way meeting produced a loose timetable for
implementation this week.
	   Committees dealing with economics, a Palestinian safe passage
route and seaport are to begin meeting Monday and Tuesday.
Wednesday, the sides open critical final status talks. Thursday,
the Palestinians will be shown Israel's withdrawal maps and by the
end of Friday, Israel will have pulled its troops from an initial 2
percent of land.
	   Earlier, Ross urged moving Sunday's public debate off the air
waves and to the negotiating table.

Years of economic hardship ahead for Central America

<TEXT>
	   OJOCHAL, Nicaragua (AP) _ Ricardo Santeliz looks over the land
where his family's farm once stood. What had been fertile fields of
peanuts is now a wasteland of caked mud.
	   Where the family had grown sorghum, beans, sugar cane and soy,
the gnarled roots of huge trees claw up from the earth.
	   ``Now the situation is very critical regarding the question of
food,'' the young man said. His family would look to move
elsewhere. ``Here there is no hope.''
	   Santeliz is just one of an uncounted number of Central Americans
whose livelihood was destroyed by Hurricane Mitch. The disaster,
which killed as many as 10,000, will be felt in the region's
economy for years.
	   Governments, overwhelmed by the need for relief work and stymied
by broken communication links, have yet to calculate the full
magnitude of the economic loss.
	   The storm destroyed as much as 70 percent of the important crop
banana and coffee crops in Honduras and Nicaragua, along with most
of the roads and bridges needed to carry produce from the rural
mountains to central markets.
	   The Inter-American Development Bank has estimated up to 90
percent of roads and other infrastructure was destroyed in
Honduras, the worst-hit nation.
	   Rebuilding bridges across Central America's rugged terrain could
take two to four years, analysts say.
	   The economies of Central America's two largest nations had been
hurting before the storm. The global economic crisis had forced a
drop in prices for their key exports, said Francisco Larios, a
senior emerging markets economist with Standard and Poor's DRI in
Lexington, Massachusetts.
	   Now with the damage caused by Mitch, ``you're probably going to
see not only recession but severe drops in growth,'' Larios said.
	   Agriculture is responsible for a quarter of Honduras' gross
domestic product and employs nearly two-thirds of the workforce. In
Nicaragua, it accounts for 15 percent of the GDP and employs more
than 40 percent of its workforce.
	   Nicaragua's Labor Ministry said this week that Mitch surely had
put thousands of people out of work.
	   To offset the damage, the government has offered 10,000
temporary jobs, such as helping clean debris from roads and
highways at a weekly salary of 100 cordobas, or dlrs 10.
	   Similarly, aid groups are supplying rice, beans and other
staples to men and women clearing roads in the province of
Chinandega, home to Ojochal, and Leon.
	   Labor unions, though, see the job programs as a threat to other
workers. The work will be temporary, and when it ends, the
hurricane victims will be left wanting.
	   ``The rural populations will find it hard to come back, and you
will see a deepening of poverty,'' said Larios, a Nicaraguan
native.
	   The Nicaraguan Labor Ministry said many companies have asked to
suspend their businesses temporarily to recover from the storm's
damage.
	   In some regions, schools and factories have shut down to shelter
hurricane victims.
	   Meanwhile, Nicaragua and Honduras, citing the need to rebuild
their countries, have asked for forgiveness of the combined dlrs 10
billion they owe in foreign debt.
	   France agreed to forgive its small portion of the debts last
week. Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman called it ``a message of
optimism which surely will stimulate other countries to take the
same decision.''
	   Cuba also announced it was canceling Nicaraguan debts.
	   The governments also could try to persuade private lenders not
to demand scheduled payments, to extend repayment deadlines and to
cut interest rates, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with Wells
Fargo Bank in Minneapolis.
	   Added Larios, ``For all practical purposes, Nicaragua and
Honduras will be unable to repay, at least in 1999, because of the
magnitude of the tragedy.''
	   The countries will be under internal pressure to quickly rebuild
and put the millions of dollars it is receiving in foreign aid to
good use.
	   In Nicaragua, bad memories still remain over the Somoza
government's slow reconstruction efforts and misuse of foreign aid
after a devastating 1972 earthquake. The scandal helped build
support for the leftist Sandinistas, who seized power in 1979.
	   ``The governments will be keen to avoid the perception that this
is dragging on too long,'' Larios said.
	   ``These are among the poorest countries in the Western
Hemisphere. What is now an economic disaster could very quickly
erupt into a political problem.''

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Inmates at an Istanbul prison took an
Italian prisoner hostage on Sunday to push for the extradition of
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome.
	   A director at Metris prison was negotiating with an imprisoned
mob leader to win the captive's release, said Mario Calesebati, a
prison official.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said mafia leader Yasar Oz was
determined not to free his hostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's
demand to send back Ocalan.
	   ``We wanted to do something for the return of Ocalan,'' Oz told
private ATV television, speaking on a mobile phone from prison.
	   He said his group had no intention of harming the Italian.
Calesebati, allowed to speak to ATV on the same phone, said he was
``fine but under stress.''
	   Calesebati's Turkish lawyer, Suha Burckin, said his client was
waiting to be extradited to Switzerland where he was wanted in
connection with a killing. He was arrested in Istanbul in August.
	   Fifteen people gathered in front of the prison in support of the
hostage-taking and demanded Ocalan's extradition. They later
dispersed peacefully

Kurds protest rebel leader's arrest for second day in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Hundreds of Kurds rallied in Germany for a
second day Sunday to protest Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan's
arrest in Italy and possible extradition to Turkey.
	   About 1,000 Kurds protested in Bonn, and 100 launched a hunger
strike outside federal government offices, police said. Some
protesters carried pictures of Ocalan, whose outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party is fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since
1984.
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday after stepping off a plane from
Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his
hideout in Syria.
	   On Saturday, more than 2,000 Kurds protested in the western
cities of Sauerbruch and Wiesbaden. In Cologne, 400 Kurds protested
in the square around the city's 14th-century cathedral, many of
them carrying signs emblazoned with PKK, the initials of Ocalan's
group.
	   Police said the protests both days were peaceful.

Celta confirmed as Spanish leader after Mallorca falls to

Valladolid
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Alen Peternac gave Valladolid a 1-0 win
over Mallorca Sunday, quashing the Balearic side's bid to retake
first place from fellow upstart Celta de Vigo.
	   Peternak scored in the 18th minute on a header after a pass from
Victor Fernandez to deal Mallorca its first defeat of the season
and confirm Celta as league leader for the first time since 1970.
	   Celta ousted Mallorca from first place on Saturday with a 2-1
victory over Real Madrid in Santiago Bernabeu stadium, its first
there in 50 years.
	   Celta, a little known team from northwest Spain, now leads the
league with 20 points after 10 weeks of play.
	   The other perennial powerhouse of Spanish soccer, FC Barcelona,
snapped a three-game losing streak on Sunday as Philip Cocu scored
in the 15th and 62nd minutes and Rivaldo and Sonny Anderson once
each late in the game for a 4-1 rout at home against lowly
Tenerife.
	   The victory should provide fresh job security for Barcelona
coach Louis Van Gaal, who was sliding toward dismissal as his team

	   OJOCHAL, Nicaragua (AP) _ Ricardo Santeliz looks over the land
where his family's farm once stood. What had been fertile fields of
peanuts is now a wasteland of caked mud.
	   Where the family had grown sorghum, beans, sugar cane and soy,
the gnarled roots of huge trees claw up from the earth.
	   ``Now the situation is very critical regarding the question of
food,'' the young man said. His family would look to move
elsewhere. ``Here there is no hope.''
	   Santeliz is just one of an uncounted number of Central Americans
whose livelihood was destroyed by Hurricane Mitch. The disaster,
which killed as many as 10,000, will be felt in the region's
economy for years.
	   Governments, overwhelmed by the need for relief work and stymied
by broken communication links, have yet to calculate the full
magnitude of the economic loss.
	   The storm destroyed as much as 70 percent of the important
banana and coffee crops in Honduras and Nicaragua, along with most
of the roads and bridges needed to carry produce from the rural
mountains to central markets.
	   The Inter-American Development Bank has estimated up to 90
percent of roads and other infrastructure was destroyed in
Honduras, the worst-hit nation.
	   Rebuilding bridges across Central America's rugged terrain could
take two to four years, analysts say.
	   The economies of Central America's two largest nations had been
hurting before the storm. The global economic crisis had forced a
drop in prices for their key exports, said Francisco Larios, a
senior emerging markets economist with Standard and Poor's DRI in
Lexington, Massachusetts.
	   Now with the damage caused by Mitch, ``you're probably going to
see not only recession but severe drops in growth,'' Larios said.
	   Agriculture is responsible for a quarter of Honduras' economic
output and employs nearly two-thirds of the workforce. In
Nicaragua, it accounts for 15 percent of output and employs more
than 40 percent of its workforce.

Jones, Mosely defend title in dominating fashion

<TEXT>
	   MASHANTUCKET, Connecticut (AP) _ Roy Jones Jr. and Sugar Shane
Mosely dominated opponents in defense of world titles, but Jones
still heard some jeers in a bingo hall at the Foxwoods Resort
Casino.
	   Jones knocked down Otis Grant of Canada twice and retained the
WBA and WBC light heavyweight titles Saturday night when Grant's
trainer, Russ Anber, jumped in to the ring after Grant was knocked
down in the 10th.
	   Jones also knocked down Grant in the sixth round, but then in
the seventh he did so little that the crowd of about 3,500 jeered
him and referee Arthur Mercanty stepped in at one point and told
Jones to fight.
	   ``I'm the man, I'm the best, I do whatever I have to do to
win,'' Jones said.
	   Mosley was just too fast and powerful for James Leija, knocking
the former WBC super featherweight champion down three times and
stopping him after nine rounds in defense of the IBF lightweight
title.
	   Jones was in complete control and did what he pleased with
Grant, the WBO middleweight (75 kilos, 165 pounds) champion who
fought at 78 kilos (172 pounds). The class limit is 79.2 kilos (175
pounds) but there was a contract limit of 77.4 (171), and Jones
weighed 77.4 (171).
	   Jones scored the knockdown in the sixth when he landed a right
uppercut to the jaw of Grant, who was punching out of a crouch. The
knockdown in the 10th came from a leaping right hand to the jaw.
After Grant struggled up at eight, Anber jumped into the ring to
stop the fight at 1:18.
	   ``I was fine,'' Grant said. ``I wasn't hurt or anything. I've
been with this guy (Anber) since I was 13, and he wasn't going to
let me get hurt.''
	   Mosley was just too much for the veteran Leija and after the
third knockdown of the fight in the ninth round, Leija's corner
motioned to referee Eddie Cotton that their man had had enough.
	   ``I was trying to get a good shot in,'' Mosley said, ``and every
time I tried, he ducked his head down. By about the sixth round, my
knuckles were hurting from hitting the top of his head. It was like
he had a hard hat on.''
	   Mosley had just too much hand and foot speed for the 32-year-old
Leija and was in charge from the opening bell.
	   Mosley, 61 kilos (135 pounds), knocked down Leija, 61 kilos (135
pounds), with a five-punch flurry in the sixth round, knocked him
down again with a right to the side of the jaw in the eighth and
then put him down the final time with another right late in the
ninth.
	   The 27-year-old Mosley was penalized a point for a low blow in
the seventh round.
	   Jones, 29, boosted his record to 38-1 with 31 knockouts. Grant
is 31-2 with one draw and 17 knockouts.
	   Mosley improved to 30-0 with 28 knockouts. Leija, a former WBC
super featherweight champion and like Mosley an American, fell to
37-4 with two draws and 15 knockouts.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials raised new
concerns about the safety of peace monitors in Kosovo after a
Yugoslav army vehicle fired a machine-gun burst over a car
containing U.S. diplomatic observers Sunday.
	   The incident, which caused no injuries, came with hope rising
for progress toward a political settlement for the restive Serbian
province.
	   Serb authorities, attempting a new initiative, invited Kosovo
Albanians to hold face-to-face talks this week, with international
officials in attendance.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders, who have rejected several such
invitations in the past, had no immediate response to the offer by
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, made late Saturday and
reported Sunday by state media.
	   But the invitation, following a flurry of U.S.-led shuttle
diplomacy, could signal that the Serbs and Albanians are closer to
long-sought direct talks.
	   The shooting incident Sunday afternoon and prompted the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to demand an
explanation from Serb and Yugoslav authorities.
	   A spokesman said a car from the Kosovo Diplomatic Observers
Mission containing three Americans and a translator was near Dulje,
35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of Pristina, when it encountered
an army column coming the other way.
	   As the car passed, an army vehicle equipped with a heavy machine
gun fired a burst overhead, OSCE spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   Serb and Yugoslav authorities had no immediate explanation for
the incident, but Bullivant said the observers' car was clearly
marked.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat putting together the
OSCE-led verification mission, plans to raise the matter with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday in a previously
scheduled meeting, he said.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said. ``Random firing is not in the spirit of the
cease-fire agreement.
	   ``Firing machine guns over the heads of anyone is dangerous, and
we have guarantees of security from Mr. Milosevic,'' he said.
	   Walker plans to express concern to Milosevic about ``the
deterioration of the agreement'' and suggest he withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said in
Belgrade.
	   The shooting incident highlights concerns raised by
international officials earlier that the ground verification force,
of as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors, is vulnerable to Kosovo
unrest despite Milosevic's assurances. NATO plans to station a
rapid reaction force in neighboring Macedonia as backup security
for the monitors.
	   In his statement, Milutinovic said he also is inviting U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill and the Russian and Chinese ambassadors to
talks with the ethnic Albanians that he proposes to chair on
Wednesday.
	   ``All conditions are in place for a direct meeting and for a
discussion to find a political solution for Kosovo problems,'' he
said.
	   Hill has met with both Milutinovic and ethnic Albanian political
leader Ibrahim Rugova as part of efforts to mediate a lasting
settlement for the province, where the ethnic Albanian-dominated
population favors independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo this year in
Milosevic's crackdown against separatist rebels. Scattered violence
has continued despite the Oct. 12 agreement in which Milosevic
pledged to halt hostilities and start talks aimed at restoring
Kosovo's autonomy.
	   In an indication rebels have no intention of scaling down their
fight for independence, the Kosovo Liberation Army on Sunday
demanded financial donations from ethnic Albanians here and abroad.
	   The guerrillas oppose any political settlement that does not
entail full independence for Kosovo.

Expelled Serb vice premier says he'd go to Bosnia again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's ultranationalist vice
premier on Sunday decried his expulsion from Bosnia by NATO troops
and vowed to visit again despite a ban on his presence there.
	   ``That was pure self-will, brutality showed by the occupying
forces,'' an angry Vojislav Seselj told reporters a day after being
forced to leave the neighboring country. ``I will go to Bosnia
again, when I wish to.''
	   Seselj was expelled after attending an inauguration party in the
Serb-run part of Bosnia for new Bosnian Serb president and fellow
nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   NATO peacekeepers in armored cars surrounded the hotel in Banja
Luka where the reception was held and told Poplasen that Seselj had
to leave. They cited orders from the office of the U.N. high
representative in Bosnia _ the top foreign authority overseeing the
country's postwar development.
	   The order, signed by the American deputy head of that office,
Jacques Klein, said ``Seselj's activities and statements both
during the war and recently offer clear evidence that his presence
in Bosnia would constitute an activity detrimental to the
implementation'' of peace.
	   Seselj, a former paramilitary leader in Serb rebellions in
Bosnia and Croatia, heads the ultranationalist Serbian Radical
Party. Poplasen is head of the twin Serb Radical Party in Bosnia.
	   Seselj said that even though he thinks the expulsion contradicts
the 1995 Dayton peace agreement guaranteeing freedom of movement,
he agreed to leave on Saturday to spare Poplasen from more trouble.

Clinton statement on Iraq draws support from United Nations and

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. President Clinton's warning Sunday that
Saddam Hussein's climbdown over weapons inspections is not enough
drew support from Britain and the United Nations, but prompted a
French former prime minister to say the United States is
``obsessed'' with the departure of the Iraqi dictator.
	   Clinton said Saddam narrowly averted a military strike but must
now live up to his promise to cooperate unconditionally with U.N.
weapons inspectors and that forces remain poised for a strike.
	   His statement led news broadcasts in France and Britain, where
it also went out live on the Sky News satellite television station.
	   It was welcomed at the United Nations.
	   ``President Clinton's statesmanlike response today will be
welcomed by the international community,'' U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said in a statement.
	   A spokeswoman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain
supports Clinton's position ``absolutely.''
	   In France, former conservative Prime Minister Raymond Barre,
said on Europe 1 radio that he believes the United States is
obsessed with the departure of Saddam Hussein.
	   ``The desire of the United States is to get rid of Saddam
Hussein,'' he said.
	   Barre warned the United States would be making a mistake in
attacking Saddam.
	   ``The more they attack Mr. Saddam Hussein, the more the Iraqi
people rally around him,'' he said.
	   He said France should not participate now in military action
against Iraq.
	   After Clinton's warning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel has no illusions about
Saddam Hussein's intentions.
	   ``There is always doubt as to the degree to which he will
fulfill his commitments, and therefore Israel will keep its eyes
open and remain ready for every possible situation in the future,''
he said.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said in a statement
that Israel hopes the return of the weapons inspectors will allow
for meaningful supervision.
	   ``We believe and know that the U.S., the UK, and the countries
of the world will do what is necessary to prevent the creation of
danger to the region,'' he said.

Jewish settler shot and wounded in West Bank drive-by shooting

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish settler was shot and wounded in a
drive-by shooting Sunday in the northern West Bank close to
Palestinian-held territory.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison unit to the
Palestinians, blamed the shooting on Palestinian militants bent on
derailing the peace process.
	   The shooting took place near the Jewish settlement of Hermesh,
close to the Palestinian-run city of Jenin at about 8:00pm
(18:00gmt).
	   ``There are some Palestinians there who want to stop this
process,'' Dror told The Associated Press. He said the Israeli army
was searching the area.
	   Dror said the settler, who was driving his car at the time of
the shooting, was lightly wounded and taken to an Israeli hospital
for treatment.
	   Last week, two Israeli soldiers were ambushed in their vehicle
on a West Bank road after dark. The assailants, believed by Israel
to have been Palestinian militants, opened fire on the military
truck as it approached an intersection and then fled on foot
towards Palestinian-controlled territory. One soldier was shot in
the chest, the other was wounded from flying glass.
	   Despite that shooting, the Israeli government decided to
continue with the latest Mideast peace plan to withdraw troops from
13 percent of the West Bank. An initial withdrawal is expected to
be completed by Friday.
	   Israel radio said that Hermesh is one of 18 settlements which
will become isolated enclaves after the pullback and surrounded by
Palestinian-control territory.

UEFA appeals panel confirms Fiorentina suspension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS quotes, detail, background, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The appeals panel of European soccer's governing
body Sunday confirmed the decision to kick Fiorentina out of the
UEFA Cup for the rest of the season because of an explosion that
injured a match official.
	   After close to seven hours of testimony and deliberations,
UEFA's board of appeal rejected the Italian club's bid to have the
game replayed.
	   UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission handed out the
suspension last Sunday after Belgian off-field referee Philippe
Flament was injured by an explosive device hurled from the stands,
causing the match to be stopped short.
	   As a result, the Zurich Grasshoppers advance to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Girondins de Bordeaux.
	   ``The board made it clear that the decision taken by the first
instance is appropriate,'' said UEFA in a press release. ``The
fundamental UEFA principle whereby the organising club is
responsible for order and security was confirmed.
	   ``In view of the fact that the security control at the entry
gates of the stadium were judged insufficient, but also given the
previous record of the Italian club and the serious nature of the
incident, the board had no other choice.''
	   Having won the first leg in Zurich against Grasshoppers 2-0 and
leading 2-1 after the first half of its home match, Fiorentina was
expected to easily qualify for the third round.
	   But the match was suspended after a spectator tossed the
explosive from the stands onto the field, injuring Flament and
temporarily deafening several players.
	   Flament was taken to hospital with a right knee injury.
	   UEFA said that Fiorentina was responsible for security even
though the match was played in Salerno and not at Fiorentina's home
city of Florence.
	   ``It was revealed today that the size of the bomb was such that
it should have been detected,'' said Rene Eberle, head of UEFA's
competition and logistics department. ``A more thorough search
would have detected it. But only a random search of spectators was
done, where they only searched those who looked suspicious.''
	   The match was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
serving the second and last round of its Franchi stadium
suspension, resulting from fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners
Cup game.
	   Only the fact that it was apparently a supporter of Fiorentina's
Italian rival Salernitana who threw the device saved the team from
being banned from all future UEFA club competitions as well, said
UEFA.
	   Outraged, Fiorentina's General Manager Luciano Luca said the
club couldn't afford such drastic security measures, adding he felt
the team had been victimized.
	   ``This sentence is a real injustice to Florence,'' said Luna.
``We are the victims of a terrorist attack which had nothing to do
with sport.
	   ``The rules should be revised. It gives the wrong idea. It's not
possible to have such an interpretation of rules as we enter the
new millenium.''

Niemann-Stirnemann wins again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMAR, Norway (AP) _ Germany's Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann was the
only woman under two minutes in the 1,500 meter speedskating
competition when she took her second World Cup victory in two days
in the Viking Ship Sunday.
	   Niemann-Stirnemann competed with Chris Witty and the American
had the edge for most of the race. However, the American stiffened
at the end, and Niemann-Stirnemann won the race in 1 minute, 59.76
seconds. Witty was 0.26 seconds behind.
	   Germany confirmed its dominance in female speedskating when
Claudia Pechstein captured third in 2:00.24, 0.44 seconds ahead of
Jennifer Rodriquez of the United States.
	   In the men's 5,000, Dutch long distance specialist Gianni Romme
opened hard with a first round of 29.3, and he finished in 6:35.60.
But the last rounds were tough, and Norway's Brigt Rykkje touched
Romme's time in the last couple of the competition.
	   ``Romme is not superman, but he'll come back strongly,'' Rykkje
said, adding that he hoped to beat Ritsma this season.
	   Romme's teammate Rintje Ritsma took third in 6:36.69, 0.09
seconds ahead of Norway's Kjell Storelid.
	   KC Boutiette of the United States managed a 14th in 6:44.87.

British aid worker shot and wounded in Albania

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A British aid worker known as the ``angel
of Mostar'' for her humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city
during the war was shot and wounded by a gunman Sunday in northern
Albania, officials said.
	   Sally Becker was hospitalized after being shot in the right leg
in the town of Bajram Curri, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said. Her condition was not immediately
known.
	   Becker was walking with another volunteer when she was shot by
an unidentified gunman outside her hotel, OSCE official Bill Foxton
said by telephone from Bajram Curri.
	   She has been staying in the crime-riddled town since early this
month, delivering aid to Kosovo refugees staying there, Foxton
said.
	   The OSCE ambassador to Albania, Daan Everts, condemned the
shooting. But in a statement issued late Sunday, he called it ``an
isolated incident and should not be seen as indicative of the
security situation across Albania.''
	   It's the second time this fall Becker has been attacked in the
area.
	   In September, armed bandits near Bajram Curri forced her from
her vehicle at gunpoint and hit her over the head with a rifle,
hospitalizing her briefly.
	   ``Nothing will stop me and my work,'' Becker said shortly after
that incident. ``While there are people in need I shall try to
help.''
	   On July 16 she was imprisoned by the Serbs in Kosovo, sentenced
to 30 days in prison for illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav
border while trying to help Kosovo refugees. She was released and
deported two weeks later.

Russian government issues written economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with government issuing report on
economic plan. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government promised Sunday to cut
taxes, attract foreign investment, pay its workers on time and hold
down inflation _ all measures that it said would help lift the
country out of economic ruin.
	   Unveiling its long-awaited economic plan, the government of
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said it intended to increase state
intervention in the economy and make it more ``socially oriented.''
	   It has said that frequently in the past, but the 37-page report
given to Russian news organizations Sunday outlined the
government's plans in somewhat greater detail than before.
	   The report was issued the same day a 90-day moratorium on
Russia's foreign debt repayments expired. The government and the
country's troubled commercial banks may not be able to resume
payments. The coming week could see a flurry of lawsuits against
Russian banks, which face the likely seizure of their foreign
assets.
	   The Russian government decided Aug. 17 to effectively devalue
the ruble and to impose the 90-day moratorium on repayments of
foreign commercial debt. The economy, which was in deep trouble at
that point, quickly tumbled into full-fledged crisis.
	   President Boris Yeltsin fired the then-prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko, a young, market-oriented reformer, and nominated
Primakov to replace him. Primakov has assembled a government that
represents a far broader spectrum of the Russian political
spectrum, including Communists.
	   He has consistently said that he aims to continue pursuing
market reforms, but with more of a social safety net and more
active government intervention.
	   That is the vision that is sketched out in the report, ``On
Measures of the Russian Government and the Central Bank to
Stabilize the Social and Economic Situation in the Country,''
according to extensive accounts by the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies.
	   The report foresees greater tax collection, despite _ or perhaps
because of _ lower rates, which are intended to encourage
compliance. The maximum rate of the revenue tax would decline from
35 to 30 percent, and income taxes would be readjusted along a
sliding scale.
	   The government also plans to gradually lower the value added
tax.
	   The ruble would continue to float, and the government said it
was crucial that it hold inflation down to 30 percent in 1999.
	   The government said it planned to introduce a package of laws to
encourage direct foreign investment in the economy. Foreign
investment in Russia has been relatively paltry compared to that in
more robust developing economies, in part because of roadblocks the
government has set in the path of direct investment.
	   The government also promised, as it has many times in the past,
to begin paying its workers on time.
	   The plan called for restructuring the country's banking system,
and said a list of banks to be restructured under state control
would be drawn up by the end of this month.
	   By then, the government should have a better sense of the
fallout from the foreign debt default.
	   Russian banks' debt on forward contracts to foreign banks totals
about dlrs 6 billion, but the banks will probably be able to pay
off no more than dlrs 2 billion, Interfax said.
	   And as the banks scramble for dollars to pay off the debts, the
ruble rate is likely to fall hard, Interfax said.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said the body would
only support those banks that can insure debt settlements and
retain ``the skeleton of the banking system,'' according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.

Clinton statement on Iraq draws support from United Nations and

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from streets of Rome; no uppick
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. President Clinton's warning Sunday that
Saddam Hussein's climbdown over weapons inspections is not enough
drew support from Britain and the United Nations, but prompted a
French former prime minister to say the United States is
``obsessed'' with the departure of the Iraqi dictator.
	   Clinton said Saddam narrowly averted a military strike but must
now live up to his promise to cooperate unconditionally with U.N.
weapons inspectors and that forces remain poised for a strike.
	   His statement led news broadcasts in France and Britain, where
it also went out live on the Sky News satellite television station.
	   It was welcomed at the United Nations.
	   ``President Clinton's statesmanlike response today will be
welcomed by the international community,'' U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said in a statement.
	   A spokeswoman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain
supports Clinton's position ``absolutely.''
	   In France, former conservative Prime Minister Raymond Barre,
said on Europe 1 radio that he believes the United States is
obsessed with the departure of Saddam Hussein.
	   ``The desire of the United States is to get rid of Saddam
Hussein,'' he said.
	   Barre warned the United States would be making a mistake in
attacking Saddam.
	   ``The more they attack Mr. Saddam Hussein, the more the Iraqi
people rally around him,'' he said.
	   He said France should not participate now in military action
against Iraq.
	   After Clinton's warning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel has no illusions about
Saddam Hussein's intentions.
	   ``There is always doubt as to the degree to which he will
fulfill his commitments, and therefore Israel will keep its eyes
open and remain ready for every possible situation in the future,''
he said.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said in a statement
that Israel hopes the return of the weapons inspectors will allow
for meaningful supervision.
	   ``We believe and know that the U.S., the UK, and the countries
of the world will do what is necessary to prevent the creation of
danger to the region,'' he said.
	   On the streets of Rome, Francesco Bianco from Sicily supported
the U.S. threat of force.
	   ``Clinton is completely right because this problem cannot go on.
He has to put a stop to it, and the best way is to send aircraft
and kill Saddam Hussein, definitely, to avoid any problems in the
future,''

Muckraking journalism: risky in small towns of South America
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) _ Gerardo Bedoya wrote in his Cali,
Colombia, daily that he would rather be ``pro-Yankee'' than a
friend of drug traffickers. Jairo Elias Marquez irreverently
attacked local lawmakers in his small-town weekly west of Bogota.
	   Both were killed for their words.
	   An investigator for the Inter American Press Association
reported Sunday that muckraking journalism can be just as dangerous
in the smaller towns and cities of South America as in their larger
counterparts.
	   Perhaps more so.
	   ``Both in Brazil and Colombia, reporters working for major
dailies have more working space and are safer, but journalists
working in the provinces are more at risk,'' researcher Ana Arana.
told the IAPA's 54th general assembly here.
	   Arana told the western hemisphere's leading publishing group of
the risks of groundbreaking journalism against corruption and drug
cartels in many South American provinces.
	   In Colombia, for instance, reporters and columnists in Bogota
and other big cities contracted bodyguards and armored cars in
1997. Many reporters in small towns did not.
	   Bedoya, 56, was shot dead in Cali on March 21, 1997; and
Marquez, 42, on Nov. 20, 1997, in Armenia, a small town 190 miles
(300 kilometers) west of Bogota.
	   ``They did not understand that living in the provinces made them
more vulnerable,'' Arana said.
	   Bedoya, a tough editorial writer and columnist for the daily El
Pais in Cali, was apparently killed on orders of the Cali cartel,
Arana said. The investigation is in preliminary stages.
	   After Marquez' shooting in Armenia, a local congressman who had
been attacked by Marquez's writings was detained for questioning in
several killings, according to Arana.
	   Brazil carries its own dangers for reporters.
	   ``Brazil is a rambunctious country. On one side it has major
metropolises _ sophisticated and monumental _ but just hours away
by cars lies another reality: towns where local powers are locked
in feudal times,'' Arana said.
	   Arustey Guida, 38, was killed in the town of Sao Fidelis on May
12, 1995 after fearlessly amassing evidence that local officials
ran a car theft ring, according to Arana.
	   Zaqueu de Oliveira, 28, published Gazeta de Barroso a local
newspaper in Barroso that intended to keep politicians in check.
	   Under the newspaper slogan ``The Truth to Whomever it Hurts,''
he attacked the local mayor while denouncing bad roads, health
problems and other ills unattended by government.
	   On the morning of March 21, 1995 he was shot in Barroso's
square. Though the area was filled with witnesses, no one publicly
stepped forward.
	   These reporters ``were passionately involved in their work and
careless in their footsteps,'' Arana said.

Jewish settler shot and wounded in West Bank drive-by shooting

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish settler was shot and wounded in a
drive-by shooting Sunday in the northern West Bank near
Palestinian-held territory.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison unit to the
Palestinians, blamed the shooting on Palestinian militants bent on
derailing the peace process.
	   The shooting took place near the Jewish settlement of Hermesh,
close to the Palestinian-run city of Jenin about 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
	   ``There are some Palestinians there who want to stop this
process,'' Dror told The Associated Press. He said the Israeli army
was searching the area.
	   Dror said the settler, who was driving his car at the time of
the shooting, was lightly wounded and taken to an Israeli hospital
for treatment.
	   Last week, two Israeli soldiers were ambushed in their vehicle
on a West Bank road after dark. The assailants, believed by Israel
to have been Palestinian militants, opened fire on the military
truck as it approached an intersection and then fled on foot toward
Palestinian-controlled territory. One soldier was shot in the
chest, the other was wounded from flying glass.
	   Despite that shooting, the Israeli government decided to
continue with the latest Mideast peace plan to withdraw troops from
13 percent of the West Bank. An initial withdrawal is expected to
be completed by Friday.
	   Israel radio reported that Hermesh is one of 18 settlements that
will become isolated enclaves after the pullback and surrounded by
Palestinian-control territory.

Cooperation in Europe said. Her condition was not immediately
known.
	   Becker was walking with another volunteer when she was shot by
an unidentified gunman outside her hotel, OSCE official Bill Foxton
said by telephone from Bajram Curri.
	   She has been staying in the crime-riddled town since early this
month, delivering aid to Kosovo refugees staying there, Foxton
said.
	   The OSCE ambassador to Albania, Daan Everts, condemned the
shooting. But in a statement issued late Sunday, he said it was
``an isolated incident and should not be seen as indicative of the
security situation across Albania.''
	   It's the second time this fall Becker has been attacked in the
area.
	   In September, armed bandits near Bajram Curri forced her from
her vehicle at gunpoint and hit her over the head with a rifle. She
was briefly hospitalized.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Flooding in the Carpathian Mountains of western
Ukraine has claimed at least 12 lives and left thousands homeless,
a Russian news agency reported Sunday.
	   The dead include a family of four, swept away along with their
home when it was struck by a mud slide, Interfax said, citing
Ukraine's Ministry of Emergency Situations.
	   The flooding has destroyed an estimated 1,630 houses in 30
villages. About 8,500 people have been evacuated.
	   As many as 9,000 people have been involved in a massive program
of humanitarian relief to bring food, fuel, medical and building
supplies to the stricken region, Interfax said.

Arafat warns: ``our rifle is ready'' to pray in Jerusalem

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jewish settler shot in West Bank shooting &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL103-107
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start that latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   In the West Bank, a Jewish settler suffered light gunshot wounds
in a drive-by shooting close to Palestinian-held territory. Shlomo
Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison unit to the Palestinians,
blamed the shooting on Palestinian militants bent on derailing the
peace process.
	   ``There are some Palestinians there who want to stop this
process,'' Dror told The Associated Press. He said the Israeli army
was searching the area.
	   Earlier, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a group of
Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning work on a
bypass road for Jewish settlers for which 40 acres (16 hectares) of
Arab land were confiscated in al-Khader near Bethlehem.

Feyenoord leads league after PSV holds Ajax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven escaped from the
Amsterdam Arena with a 2-2 draw with Ajax Sunday, despite losing
one goalkeeper to a red card and almost a second to a head injury.
	   Feyenoord (9-2-1) was the team to profit from the deadlock. The
Rotterdammers downed Fortuna Sittard 4-1 and lead the league with
29 points, one ahead of SC Heerenveen and Ajax.
	   At 2-2 with 13 minutes left Ajax teenage striker Brutil Hose was
denied a debut goal by a deliberate Ronald Waterreus foul, which
saw the keeper sent off for the second time this season.
	   Then sub keeper Patrick Lodewijks collected the ball on the
ground and took a kick in the head from Portuguese Ajax star Dani,
who amazingly was only yellow-carded.
	   Lodewijks bld heavily and played out the last five minutes with
his right eye almost closed. He sank to the ground at the final
whistle and was taken to hospital after the game with suspected
concussion.
	   PSV played a cat-and-mouse game at the start, allowing Ajax most
of the ball and waiting to counterattack at speed.
	   It paid off after eight minutes when Tomek Ivan leaving Richard
Witschge in his wake sprinted 40 meters (yards) to beat Edwin van
der Sar with a cool near-post finish.
	   But a precise Ronald de Boer through ball set up Brazilian
Wamberto for a fine Ajax equalizer on 25 minutes.
	   Witschge and Frank de Boer contrived to give the ball away to
Ruud van Nistelrooy, who found striking partner Luc Nilis alone in
front of an empty net and it was 2-1 to PSV at half time.
	   But Ajax went into overdrive and Frank de Boer scored after an
hour with a powered header which Waterreus could only parry into
the net via the post and defender Robert Fuchs' head.
	   PSV remains undefeated in the Arena after five visits and has
climbed to eighth place on 19 points.
	   Among Sunday's other results: Vitesse Arnhem stayed in fourth
with a 2-0 win over FC Utrecht and bottom club RKC Waalwijk
celebrated its first win of the season in style, 5-1 over Sparta
Rotterdam.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Allies of a popular cancer doctor defended a cancer
treatment branded a failure by a government study, upholding its
effectiveness and urging Italians to keep the faith in his cure.
	   Italy's president weighed in on the controversy, telling
reporters that science had rendered its verdict on Dr. Luigi Di
Bella's treatment.
	   In the face of the cold facts, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
said, he could add only an offer of ``human solidarity for those
who suffer and for the family and friends of those whose suffering
has ended.''
	   Di Bella's blend of hormones and vitamins has drawn hundreds of
cancer patients to his clinic in the northern city of Modena for
prescriptions. His supporters have demonstrated by the thousands to
push for clinical trials.
	   On Friday, however, a National Health Institute study of 386
patients who were being treated with Di Bella's formula showed 57
percent died and 33 percent saw their cancer advance. The study
called the so-called cure useless.
	   Di Bella has said nothing publicly since Friday's challenge.
	   But son Guiseppe Di Bella spoke to Italy's Il Tempo newspaper,
saying the study ignored many other cases in which the doctor's
patients survived still.
	   Applied correctly, he said, the therapy had ``extraordinary
effectiveness.''
	   The study should mean not the end of Italians' faith in the
treatment, ``but the end of faith in the institutions of state,''
he suggested.
	   ``If the therapy of Dr. Di Bella was truly as ineffective as the
Ministry of Health said, not one patient would have gotten better
or cured, as has happened,'' said Carlo Madaro, a judicial official
and leading supporter of the doctor.
	   A survey published in Il Tempo suggested public opinion remained
on the doctor's side. Fully 57.5 percent of those surveyed said
they would send a loved one with cancer to Di Bella, the study
said.
	   The study, conducted Saturday by Datamedia, gave no margin of
error or polling size.

heads of foreign observers, OSCE comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials raised new
concerns about the safety of peace monitors in Kosovo after a
Yugoslav army vehicle fired a machine gun over a car containing
U.S. diplomatic observers Sunday.
	   The incident, which caused no injuries, came at a time of rising
hopes for progress toward a settlement that would end months of
violence in the restive Serbian province.
	   Serb authorities, attempting a new initiative, invited ethnic
Albanian separatists to hold face-to-face talks this week.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders, who have rejected several such
invitations in the past, made no immediate response to the offer
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic made late Saturday.
	   But the latest invitation, following a flurry of U.S.-led
diplomacy, could signal that the Serbs and ethnic Albanians were
closer to direct negotiations.
	   A Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that started in
February has left hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and
made refugees of hundreds of thousands more. The province's ethnic
Albanian majority favors independence, while Serbs consider Kosovo
an integral part of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Scattered violence has continued despite an Oct. 12 agreement in
which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to halt his
offensive and start talks aimed at restoring Kosovo's autonomy.
	   The shooting incident on Sunday prompted the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to demand an explanation from
Serb and Yugoslav authorities.
	   A spokesman said a car from the Kosovo Diplomatic Observers
Mission containing three Americans and an ethnic Albanian
translator was near Dulje, 35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of
the provincial capital, Pristina, when it encountered an army
column coming the other way.
	   As the car passed, an army vehicle equipped with a heavy machine
gun fired a burst overhead, OSCE spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   Serb and Yugoslav authorities gave no immediate explanation for
the incident, but Bullivant said the observers' car was clearly
identifiable as belonging to the diplomatic mission. Its bright
orange color and lettering are unique to vehicles of the Kosovo
observer mission.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat putting together an
OSCE-led verification mission, planned to discuss the incident with
Milosevic in a previously scheduled meeting on Monday, he said.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said. ``Random firing is not in the spirit of the
cease-fire agreement.
	   Walker plans to express concern to Milosevic about ``the
deterioration of the agreement'' and suggest that he withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said in the
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade.
	   The shooting incident highlights concerns that international
officials raised earlier that the ground verification force of as
many as 2,000 unarmed monitors is vulnerable to unrest in Kosovo,
in spite of Milosevic's assurances. NATO plans to station a rapid
reaction force in neighboring Macedonia to provide backup security
for the monitors.
	   In his statement, the Serbian president said he also is inviting
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and the Russian and Chinese ambassadors
to talks with the ethnic Albanians on Wednesday.
	   ``All conditions are in place for a direct meeting and for a
discussion to find a political solution for Kosovo problems,''
Milutinovic said.
	   Hill has met with both Milutinovic and ethnic Albanian political
leader Ibrahim Rugova as part of efforts to mediate a lasting
settlement for the province.
	   In a sign that ethnic Albanian rebels have no intention of
scaling back their fight for independence, the Kosovo Liberation
Army on Sunday demanded financial contributions.
	   The rebel force opposes any political settlement that does not
entail full independence for Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   HAMAR, Norway (AP) _ Germany's Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann was the
only woman to break two minutes Sunday, winning the 1,500 meters
and claiming her second World Cup speedskating race in two days at
the Viking Ship.
	   Niemann-Stirnemann skated side-by-side with American Chris
Witty, who led for most of the race. However, the American slowed
at the end, and Niemann-Stirnemann rallied to win in 1 minute,
59.76 seconds. Witty finished second, 0.26 seconds behind.
	   Germany confirmed its dominance in women's speedskating when
Claudia Pechstein captured third in 2:00.24, 0.44 seconds ahead of
Jennifer Rodriquez of the United States.
	   In the men's 5,000, Dutch distance specialist Gianni Romme
opened with a first lap of 29.3 seconds, but finished in 6:35.60
and had to share the victory with Norway's Brigt Rykkje.
	   But like Witty, Romme slowed in the final laps allowing Rykkje
to catch the Dutchman in the final pairing.
	   ``Romme is not superman, but he'll come back strongly,'' Rykkje
said.
	   Ritsma took third in 6:36.69, 0.09 seconds ahead of Norway's
Kjell Storelid.

	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. President Clinton's warning Sunday that
Saddam Hussein's climbdown over weapons inspections is not enough
drew support from Britain and the United Nations, but prompted a
French former prime minister to say the United States is
``obsessed'' with the departure of the Iraqi dictator.
	   Clinton said Saddam narrowly averted a military strike but must
now live up to his promise to cooperate unconditionally with U.N.
weapons inspectors and that forces remain poised for a strike.
	   His statement led news broadcasts in France and Britain, where
it also went out live on the Sky News satellite television station.
	   It was welcomed at the United Nations.
	   ``President Clinton's statesmanlike response today will be
welcomed by the international community,'' U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said in a statement.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told CNN on Sunday night
that Britain is ``fully behind President Clinton in the central
thrust of his remarks.''
	   ``It is quite clear that Saddam Hussein has backed down, and the
only reason he has backed down is because he was convinced there
was a real, credible threat of force from the United States and the
United Kingdom,'' Cook said.
	   He said he agreed with Clinton that Saddam must now prove his
commitment by allowing inspectors unfettered access, saying:
``We're both going to keep our guard up until he does that.''
	   But in France, former conservative Prime Minister Raymond Barre,
said on Europe 1 radio that he believes the United States is
obsessed with the departure of Saddam Hussein.

Yugoslavia warns Macedonia against hosting NATO rapid reaction

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia warned neighboring
Macedonia on Sunday not to allow deployment of NATO forces in its
territory that might intervene in Kosovo.
	   Yugoslavia's deputy foreign minister, Zoran Novakovic, lodged an
``energetic protest'' to a top Macedonian diplomat in Belgrade, the
official Tanjug news agency reported. He warned that Macedonia's
consent to serve as base for ``any military action against
Yugoslavia would be contrary to long-term interests of the two
countries'' and their good relations.
	   Under a U.S.-brokered agreement, Yugoslavia has agreed to a
2,000-strong monitoring mission to verify a cease-fire in Serbia's
war-torn Kosovo province. NATO is also to conduct aerial
surveillance of the province, but wants to station a rapid reaction
force in adjacent Macedonia as back up security for the ground
monitors.
	   Macedonia has been trying to maintain good relations both with
NATO and with Yugoslavia.
	   Novakovic said that NATO concerns for safety of the ground
monitors are a pretext to create a force for possible cross-border
action, and that Macedonia must not allow that.
	   ``It would not be understandable that a friendly country allows
abuse of its territory for military actions against another
friendly, neighboring country,'' Novakovic was quoted as saying.

Iraq declares victory in dispute over U.N. weapons inspections

deputy prime minister, CHANGES overline, byline.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ After backing down over U.N. weapons
inspections _ and narrowly avoiding an American missile strike _
Iraq in typical fashion declared itself Sunday as the victor in the
dispute.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan told state-run television
that Iraq had been able ``to prove to the whole world that our
views are correct'' and that the Americans were misguided.
	   ``This is the foundation and the basis of our victory,'' he
declared.
	   It was the first official reaction to the weekend's tumultuous
events, and the rhetoric obviously was for local consumption in a
country weary of U.N. sanctions and of being isolated, even from
its Arab neighbors.
	   The newscast made no mention of U.S. President Clinton's warning
Sunday that if Iraq does not abide by its newly inked agreement to
allow U.N. weapons teams to come back and work freely, it will
suffer a military attack.
	   ``Iraq has backed down,'' Clinton declared in a news conference
at the White House. ``But that is not enough. Now Iraq must live up
to its obligations.''
	   He said U.S. forces would stay in the Gulf and warned: ``We
remain ready to act.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq criticized Clinton's statement that
the American government is committed to replacing Saddam's regime
in Iraq.
	   ``I have to condemn strongly the statement of Mr. Clinton, the
plans of his government to overthrow the government of Iraq,'' Aziz
said in an interview on the Cable News Network. ``This is a
flagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions as well as
international law.''
	   Aziz said he would not comment on whether the crisis was over
since the Security Council was still debating it. ``Whether this is
going to end the current crisis is up to the belligerents who are
saber rattling,'' he said, referring to U.S. and British threats to
attack.
	   Iraq would allow the U.N. arms inspectors to do their normal
work under Security Council resolutions and the understanding that
Aziz signed in February with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
deputy prime minister said.
	   ``Iraq does not accept any further conditions,'' he added, but
the resolution and agreement with Annan appeared to cover Clinton's
demands for unfettered access for the inspectors and full Iraqi
cooperation with them.
	   The United States and Britain began building up their forces
after Iraq suspended cooperation last month with the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq on Saturday notified Annan that it had reversed its
decision. But the United States _ which called off an attack at the
11th hour to study Iraq's statement _ did not accept it until
Sunday, when Washington was assured by the Iraqi regime that there
were no conditions attached.
	   Washington had complained a two-page ``annex'' to Aziz's letter
to Annan amounted to conditions.
	   But Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon offered assurances the
document did not present conditions, but only Iraq's that U.N.
sanctions should be eased or lifted following a promised Security
Council review of Iraq's elimination of its weaponry.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until the
weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated all proscribed
weapons.
	   Chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler said that no decision had
yet been made on when to move his teams back to Iraq from Bahrain,
where they were evacuated last week. But he said they could be back
on the ground ``within 24 hours.''
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs, said he
expected 150 relief workers evacuated to Jordan to return soon but
that no date had yet been announced.
	   He earlier had told reporters that food supplies were adequate
to ensure that Iraq's 22 million people received a full ration this
month. But he said that there were not enough supplies _ especially
of staples like wheat and rice _ to guarantee full rations next
month.
	   Ramadan said the intent of Iraq's letter to Annan was ``to fend
off the bad intentions of America and Britain,'' which he said were
misrepresenting Iraq's demands for a Security Council review that
would lead to ending the sanctions.
	   Now that the it has been accepted, Ramadan said, ``any attack
against Iraq would be an American aggression without any support or
reason.''
	   Editorials in the state-run newspapers supported the
government's view.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath party, said
that ``As we register this new victory, we must praise our people,
who sacrificed by being so patient and closely attached to their
leadership, which is fighting for their rights.''

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Alen Peternac gave Valladolid a 1-0 win
over Mallorca Sunday, quashing the Balearic side's bid to retake
first place from fellow upstart Celta de Vigo.
	   Peternac scored in the 18th minute on a header after a pass from
Victor Fernandez to deal Mallorca its first defeat of the season
and confirm Celta as league leader for the first time since 1970.
	   Celta ousted Mallorca from first place on Saturday with a 2-1
victory over Real Madrid in Santiago Bernabeu stadium, its first
there in 50 years.
	   Celta, a little known team from northwest Spain, now leads the
league with 20 points after 10 weeks of play.
	   The other perennial powerhouse of Spanish soccer, FC Barcelona,
snapped a three-game losing streak on Sunday. Philip Cocu scored in
the 15th and 62nd minutes and Rivaldo and Sonny Anderson once each
late in the game for a 4-1 rout at home against lowly Tenerife.
	   The victory should provide fresh job security for Barcelona
coach Louis Van Gaal, who was sliding toward dismissal as his team
slipped toward elimination from the Champions League.
	   The win raised the Catalan side from fourth to second place with
19 points, ahead of Mallorca on goal difference. Real Madrid drops
to fourth with 18.
	   In other games Sunday, Deportivo La Coruna tied the Basque team
Alaves 2-2, Athletic Bilbao lost at home 3-5 to Oviedo, Betis
defeated Real Sociedad 1-0, Zaragoza fell to Espanyol 0-3, Racing
de Santander trounced Salamanca 4-1 and last-placed Extremadura
beat Valencia 1-0.
	   Atletico de Madrid lost 2-1 at division newcomer Villareal.
Osvaldo Giroldo Juninho was expelled in the 90th minute over an
argument with a Villareal player.

	   HOEK VAN HOLLAND, Netherlands (AP) _ The wife of Royal Philips
Electronics' president remained hospitalized in critical condition
Sunday after she was found severely injured, handcuffed and dumped
next to a road.
	   Hans Raatjes-Boonstra, 62, the wife of Philips chief Cor
Boonstra, was discovered by a motorist Friday night in this western
coastal city about 70 kilometers (40 miles) from Amsterdam, Dutch
television reported.
	   Police believe she was the victim of a premeditated attack, but
there was no word on whether they had any leads or suspects.
	   Dutch television reported that the Boonstras have been separated
for a year. Philips, Europe's largest consumer electronics group,
declined to comment on the attack.

illegal immigrants trying to get into Italy over the past five
days. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police over the past five days have
intercepted about 1,200 illegal immigrants trying to slip into
Italy where they hoped to receive work permits, police said Sunday.
	   Police were expecting hundreds more illegal immigrants to try to
cross the border in the Alpine region of Savoie into Italy in the
next several days.
	   The immigrants hope to benefit from an Italian decision to grant
38,000 work permits to foreigners who can prove they were in Italy
before March 27, 1998 or that they have a job offer, or a promise
of one.
	   Italy and France have largely abandoned border controls as a
part of European Union integration, but some checks still exist and
since many of the illegal immigrants are from Africa or Asia they
are easy to spot.
	   The illegal immigrants are being sent back to their country of
origin or released and told to leave French territory within 48
hours, police said.
	   The Red Cross has set up a booth to try to help the illegal
immigrants at the train station just before the Franco-Italian
border at Modane in the Savoie region.
	   Meanwhile, in another development concerning illegal immigrants,
France's Environment Minister on Sunday appealed to the government
to give residency permits to illegal immigrants in France, saying
it was a ``humane solution'' to the problem.
	   Dominique Voynet spoke at a national assembly of the Greens two
days after police ended a 73-day sit-in by illegal immigrants who
were demanding the government reconsider their residency permits.
	   The French government has legalized the status of some 76,000
illegal immigrants but has rejected residency requested for more
than 64,000 others.
	   The Greens want the Socialist-led government to provide
residency status for all of illegal immigrants, who in French are
called ``sans papiers'' or those without papers.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has been more generous in granting
residency permits to illegal immigrants than the previous
conservative government.
	   But the far right National Front, which blames high unemployment
on immigrants, has accused Jospin of being too soft on the issue.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials raised new
concerns about the safety of peace monitors in Kosovo after a
Yugoslav army vehicle fired a machine-gun burst over a car
containing U.S. diplomatic observers Sunday.
	   The incident, which caused no injuries, came with hope rising
for progress toward a political settlement for the restive Serbian
province.
	   Serb authorities, attempting a new initiative, invited Kosovo
Albanians to hold face-to-face talks this week, with international
officials in attendance.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders, who have rejected several such
invitations in the past, had no immediate response to the offer by
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, made late Saturday and
reported Sunday by state media.
	   But the invitation, following a flurry of U.S.-led shuttle
diplomacy, could signal that the Serbs and Albanians are closer to
long-sought direct talks.
	   The shooting incident Sunday afternoon and prompted the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to demand an
explanation from Serb and Yugoslav authorities.
	   A spokesman said a car from the Kosovo Diplomatic Observers
Mission containing three Americans and a translator was near Dulje,
35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of Pristina, when it encountered
an army column coming the other way.
	   As the car passed, an army vehicle equipped with a heavy machine
gun fired a burst overhead, OSCE spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   Serb and Yugoslav authorities had no immediate explanation for
the incident, but Bullivant said the bright orange observers' car
was clearly marked as a diplomatic vehicle.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat putting together the
OSCE-led verification mission, plans to raise the matter with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday in a previously
scheduled meeting, he said.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said. ``Random firing is not in the spirit of the
cease-fire agreement.
	   ``Firing machine guns over the heads of anyone is dangerous, and
we have guarantees of security from Mr. Milosevic,'' he said.
	   Walker plans to express concern to Milosevic about ``the
deterioration of the agreement'' and suggest he withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said in
Belgrade.
	   The shooting incident highlights concerns raised by
international officials earlier that the ground verification force,
of as many as 2,000 unarmed monitors, is vulnerable to Kosovo
unrest despite Milosevic's assurances.
	   NATO plans to station a rapid reaction force in neighboring
Macedonia as backup security for the monitors _ although Yugoslavia
warned Macedonia on Sunday that it objects to such a plan.

McEnroe, Forget reach final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ John McEnroe beat Mats Wilander of Sweden
6-0, 6-2 Sunday to reach the final of an ATP senior tournament in
which Iranian Mansour Bahrami provided some humorous moments.
	   Bahrami lost to Bjorn Borg 6-3, 6-4. On one point, when he
couldn't reach a Borg serve, he took another ball from his pocket
and ``returned'' it. Later, they staged a mock fight in front of
the refrigerator over who would take the drinks first. The argument
ended when Borg jokingly threw Bahrami into the refrigerator.
	   Borg will play for third place in this robin-round tourney
against Frenchman Henri Leconte, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Guillermo
Vilas of Argentina.
	   Guy Forget of France will face McEnroe in Monday's final, even
though he lost to Croatia's Goran Prpic 2-6, 6-4, 10-5. That's
because Forget's overall results in the Croatia Classics tournament
were better than Prpic's.

Congolese rebels try to avoid division, invite new guerrilla to
</HEADLINE>
cooperate &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Trying to avoid a rift within the
guerrilla forces trying to overthrow President Laurent Kabila,
Congolese rebels on Sunday called on an obscure anti-Kabila fighter
to join forces and talk out differences between them.
	   But Jean-Pierre Bemba, who has claimed military successes
against government troops and their allies from Chad in northern
Congo, said he would continue fighting on his own.
	   ``I am not here to argue with people,'' Bemba told The
Associated Press from northern Congo. ``My task is to take town
after town and be with my soldiers and mobilize the population.''
	   Bemba said the Congolese Democratic Coalition, which has
captured the eastern third of Congo since taking up arms on Aug. 2,
had created a vaccum in northern and northeastern Congo by failing
to rally the local populations.
	   Echoing concerns by Congolese civilians that the rebels are
backed by foreign forces, Bemba claimed he was closer to the people
and more successful in mobilizing popular support.
	   However, he admitted that he had launched his own uprising,
backed by several thousand men, after three months of military
training by Ugandan instructors in Kisangani, Congo's third largest
city.
	   Arthur Ngoma, a rebel leader, dismissed Bemba's accusations and
called on him to approach them in their eastern stronghold of Goma
to prevent Kabila from exploiting the divisions and avoiding talks
with rebel representatives.
	   So far, Kabila has ruled out talking with the rebels, demanding
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for the
insurgents.
	   Both countries have provided troops and arms to the rebels.
Rwanda and Uganda, which installed Kabila in power in May 1997
after ousting former Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, accuse him
of failing to rid the common border of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Bemba is son of a well-known tycoon in the Congolese capital of
Kinshasa and a businessman himself. He said since launching his
uprising he has taken the towns of Aketi and Dulia, some 300
kilometers (185 miles) north of Kisangani.
	   He said his forces had killed at least 100 soldiers from Chad
and captured dozens of others.
	   Ugandan government-owned Sunday Vision reported the 39-year-old
Bemba had challenged the rebel leaders in Goma, apparently with the
backing of Ugandan troops, who control much of the area.
	   ``Bemba is abusing his freedom. We are ready to talk to all
Congolese, including Bemba, but we don't need his cordial
relations,'' Ngoma said. ``We are not fighting for the partition of
the country. He should join us. But he doesn't want to come to
Goma.''

Iraq declares victory in dispute over U.N. weapons inspections

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ After backing down over U.N. weapons
inspections and narrowly avoiding an American missile strike, Iraq
in typical fashion declared itself Sunday as the victor in the
dispute.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan told state-run television
that Iraq had been able ``to prove to the whole world that our
views are correct'' and that the Americans were misguided.
	   ``This is the foundation and the basis of our victory,'' he
said.
	   It was the first official reaction to the weekend's tumultuous
events, and the rhetoric was clearly aimed at the Iraqi population
in a country weary of U.N. sanctions and of being isolated, even
from its Arab neighbors.
	   The newscast made no mention of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
warning Sunday that if Iraq does not abide by its newly signed
agreement to allow U.N. weapons teams to come back and work freely,
it will suffer a military attack.
	   ``Iraq has backed down,'' Clinton said at the White House. ``But
that is not enough. Now Iraq must live up to its obligations.''
	   He said U.S. forces would stay in the Gulf and warned: ``We
remain ready to act.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz criticized Clinton's statement
that the American government is committed to replacing Saddam's
regime in Iraq.
	   ``I have to condemn strongly the statement of Mr. Clinton, the
plans of his government to overthrow the government of Iraq,'' Aziz
told CNN. ``This is a flagrant violation of the Security Council
resolutions as well as international law.''
	   Aziz declined comment on whether the crisis was over since the
Security Council was still debating it. ``Whether this is going to
end the current crisis is up to the belligerents who are saber
rattling,'' he said, referring to U.S. and British threats to
attack.
	   Iraq would allow the U.N. arms inspectors to do their normal
work under Security Council resolutions and the understanding that
Aziz signed in February with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
deputy prime minister said.
	   ``Iraq does not accept any further conditions,'' he added.
	   The agreement with Annan appeared to cover Clinton's demands for
unfettered access for the inspectors and full Iraqi cooperation
with them.
	   The United States and Britain began building up their forces
after Iraq suspended cooperation last month with the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq agreed to destroy its weapons of mass destruction under
U.N. resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraq on Saturday notified Annan that it had reversed its
decision to end the inspections. But the United States _ which
called off an attack at the 11th hour to study Iraq's statement _
did not accept it until Sunday after receiving Iraqi assurances
that there were no conditions attached.
	   Washington had complained a two-page ``annex'' to Aziz's letter
to Annan amounted to conditions.
	   But Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon offered assurances the
document did not present conditions, but only Iraq's stance that
U.N. sanctions should be eased or lifted following a promised
Security Council review of Iraq's elimination of its weaponry.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until the
weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated all banned
weapons.
	   Chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler said that no decision had
yet been made on when to move his teams back to Iraq from Bahrain,
where they were evacuated last week. But he said they could be back
on the ground ``within 24 hours.''
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs, said he
expected 150 relief workers evacuated to Jordan to return soon but
that no date had yet been announced.
	   He earlier had told reporters that food supplies were adequate
to ensure that Iraq's 22 million people received a full ration this
month. But he said that there were not enough supplies _ especially
of staples like wheat and rice _ to guarantee full rations next
month.

	   HOEK VAN HOLLAND, Netherlands (AP) _ The wife of Royal Philips
Electronics' president remained hospitalized in critical condition
Sunday after she was found severely injured, handcuffed and dumped
next to a road.
	   Hans Raatjes-Boonstra, 62, the wife of Philips chief Cor
Boonstra, was discovered by a motorist Friday night in this western
coastal city about 70 kilometers (40 miles) from Amsterdam, Dutch
television reported.
	   Police believe she was the victim of a premeditated attack, but
there was no word on whether they had any leads or suspects.
	   Dutch television reported that the Boonstras have been separated
for a year. Philips, Europe's largest consumer electronics group,
declined comment on the attack.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Western officials raised new
concerns about the safety of peace monitors in Kosovo after a
Yugoslav army vehicle fired a machine gun over a car containing
U.S. diplomatic observers Sunday.
	   The incident, which caused no injuries, came at a time of rising
hopes for progress toward a settlement that would end months of
violence in the restive Serbian province.
	   Serb authorities, attempting a new initiative, invited ethnic
Albanian separatists to hold face-to-face talks this week.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders, who have rejected several such
invitations in the past, made no immediate response to the offer
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic made late Saturday.
	   But the latest invitation, following a flurry of U.S.-led
diplomacy, could signal that the Serbs and ethnic Albanians are
closer to direct negotiations.
	   A Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that started in
February has left hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and
made refugees of hundreds of thousands more. The province's ethnic
Albanian majority favors independence, while Serbs consider Kosovo
an integral part of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Scattered violence has continued despite an Oct. 12 agreement in
which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to halt his
offensive and start talks aimed at restoring Kosovo's autonomy.
	   The shooting incident on Sunday prompted the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to demand an explanation from
Serb and Yugoslav authorities.
	   A spokesman said a car from the Kosovo Diplomatic Observers
Mission containing three Americans and an ethnic Albanian
translator was near Dulje, 35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of
the provincial capital, Pristina, when it encountered an army
column coming the other way.
	   As the car passed, an army vehicle equipped with a heavy machine
gun fired a burst overhead, OSCE spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   Serb and Yugoslav authorities gave no immediate explanation for
the incident, but Bullivant said the observers' car was clearly
marked. Its bright orange color and lettering are unique to
vehicles of the Kosovo observer mission.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat putting together an
OSCE-led verification mission, planned to discuss the incident with
Milosevic in a previously scheduled meeting on Monday, he said.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said.
	   Walker plans to express concern to Milosevic about ``the
deterioration of the agreement'' and suggest that he withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said in the
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade.
	   The shooting highlights concerns that international officials
raised earlier that the ground verification force of as many as
2,000 unarmed monitors is vulnerable to unrest in Kosovo, in spite
of Milosevic's assurances. NATO plans to station a rapid reaction
force in neighboring Macedonia to provide backup security for the
monitors.
	   NATO plans to station a rapid reaction force in neighboring
Macedonia as backup security for the monitors _ although Yugoslavia
warned Macedonia on Sunday that it objects to such a plan.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With the United States saying Sunday that
Iraq's promise to allow U.N. arms inspections to resume was indeed
unconditional, the divisions within the Security Council appeared
to have narrowed.
	   The council was meeting Sunday to continue consultations on
Iraq's offer to resume cooperation with inspectors, and its
subsequent clarifications that the offer was without additional
demands.
	   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
council would try to reach consensus on a ``short and simple''
statement on Iraq's decision to allow inspectors from the U.N.
Special Commission to resume work.
	   The statement would be to ``demonstrate the council got what it
has asked for all along, which is a clear, unconditional and
authoritative statement from the government of Iraq which rescinds
the decision ... and demonstrates their commitment XXXXXwith
cooperating with UNSCOM,'' the official said.
	   The United States holds the rotating council presidency.
	   Earlier Sunday, U.S. President Bill Clinton acknowledged that
Iraq had backed down unconditionally, but said Saddam Hussein could
not be trusted.
	   If Saddam's government fails to keep its word, overwhelming
force remains an option, the president warned.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement that
Clinton's ``statesmanlike response today will be welcomed by the
entire international community.''
	   He warned, however, that in a future crisis, military force
might be the only way out. ``Some governments have made it clear
that next time around there may not even be time for diplomatic
appeals,'' Annan said in an interview with CNN.
	   Iraq halted U.N. inspections Oct. 31, saying it would only
resume cooperation with the arms experts if the council moved to
lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions have paralyzed exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   U.N. resolutions that ended the Gulf war, which was sparked by
Iraq's invasion, say sanctions can only be lifted after inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Threatened with imminent U.S. airstrikes, Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz sent a letter to Annan on Saturday saying Iraq
had agreed to allow inspections to resume.
	   Permanent council members Russia, China and France _ who are
generally more sympathetic to Iraq _ had welcomed the move.
	   The United States rejected the offer, saying it contained
conditions which have already been rejected by the United States
and the council.
	   Britain said it remained skeptical and was keeping its options
open.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, provided additional
letters of clarification in an attempt to assure the Americans and
British that Iraq's decision was unconditional.
	   The council met for nearly five hours Saturday but was unable to
agree on a response.

	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. President Clinton's warning Sunday that
Saddam Hussein's climbdown over weapons inspections is not enough
drew support from Britain and the United Nations, but prompted a
French former prime minister to say the United States is
``obsessed'' with the departure of the Iraqi dictator.
	   Clinton said Saddam had narrowly averted a military strike but
must now live up to his promise to cooperate unconditionally with
U.N. weapons inspectors and that forces remain poised for a strike.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the statement, which he
called ``statesmanlike,'' would be welcomed by the international
community.
	   But Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq criticized Clinton's
comment that the American government is committed to replacing
Saddam's regime in Iraq.
	   ``I have to condemn strongly the statement of Mr. Clinton, the
plans of his government to overthrow the government of Iraq,'' Aziz
said in an interview on the Cable News Network. ``This is a
flagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions as well as
international law.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told CNN that Britain is
``fully behind President Clinton in the central thrust of his
remarks.''

Chemerkin claims 105-plus title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHTI, Finland (AP) _ Andrei Chemerkin of Russia hoisted a total
of 437 1-2 kilos and beat Ara Vardanayan of Armenia by 10 kilos to
win the men's unlimited title at the World Weightlifting
Championships on Sunday.
	   Both Chemerkin and Vardanayan lifted 197 1-2 in the snatch, but
Chemerkin beat his opponent in the clean-and-jerk, where he lifted
240 kilos.
	   Victor Scerbatihs of Latvia took the bronze in the 105-kilo plus
category with a total weight of 422 1-2.
	   In the women's unlimited (75-kilo plus) division Tang Gonghong
of China beat Chen Hsio-Lien with a total lift of 255 kilos, 10
more kilos than her Taiwanese opponent.
	   Maria Isabel Urrutia of Colombia was third, lifting a total of
242 1-2 kilos, same as Poland's Agata Wrobel but winning with a
lower body weight.
	   They were the final events in the week-long competition, which
saw the Bulgarians and Greeks win six gold medals each to share the
honor as top nation. Both countries also claimed four silver and
five bronze medals each.
	   China was clearly the dominant nation on the women's side,
winning 13 golds, eight more than the next closest nation, Tawain.
	   Ten world records were set during the week, five of them in the
snatch.

Arafat warns: ``our rifle is ready'' to pray in Jerusalem

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jewish settler shot in West Bank. &QL;

 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start implementation of the latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   In the West Bank, a Jewish settler suffered light gunshot wounds
in a drive-by shooting close to Palestinian-held territory. Shlomo
Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison unit to the Palestinians,
blamed the shooting on Palestinian militants bent on derailing the
peace process. He said the Israeli army was searching the area.
	   Earlier, clashes broke out when soldiers moved on a group of
Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning work on a
bypass road for Jewish settlers for which 40 acres (16 hectares) of
Arab land were confiscated in al-Khader near Bethlehem.

Roma beats Juve 2-0 to take over second place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bari-Milan late match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It may have been a changing of the guard.
	   Young AS Roma controlled the action, scored late in each half
and generally seemed the more poised club Sunday as it beat
Juventus of Turin 2-0 to take over second place from the two-time
defending Italian League champions.
	   Both Roma and Juventus are just one point behind Serie A leader
Fiorentina, which went down to a 4-2 loss at Piacenza in a match
that featured three of the day's eight penalty kicks, one short of
the Serie A record.
	   Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio volleyed in Francesco Totti's
quickly lobbed 20-meter (yard) free kick in the 44th minute and
French defender Vincent Candela squeezed a shot from a tough angle
between the post and 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi in the 87th for Roma
(5-2-2).
	   In between the goals, Juventus lost Paolo Montero to a red card
when the Uruguayan defender elbowed Paulo Sergio.
	   Roma's collection of young, swift players (Totti is 23, Candela
25) who fit well into Czech coach Zdenek Zeman's attack-first
philosophy has now beaten both Fiorentina and Juventus this season.
The capital's club looks capable of making a run at its first
league title in 15 years.
	   There were extenuating circumstances for Juventus, though.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi, serving a one-game suspension for yelling
at the referee last week, watched the game from the stands. And
more significantly, it was the team's first game since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went down with what is likely to be a
season-ending knee injury.
	   Fiorentina (6-0-3) has no such excuse.
	   The league's best attack was simply outscored by 10th-place
Piacenza, the only all-Italian Serie A club. Paolo Cristallini
broke a 2-2 halftime tie with a header in the 58th minute, and
Giampiero Piovani added a late, insurance goal for Piacenza.
	   Fiorentina has 18 points, Roma (which owns the league's best
goal differential of plus-9) and Juventus have 17 apiece, and AC
Parma _ which beat Udinese 4-1 as Argentine striker Hernan Crespo
had a hat-trick _ is fourth with 16.
	   AC Milan wasted a chance to join Roma and Juventus Sunday night,
settling for a 0-0 draw at Bari. Milan (4-3-2) is fifth with 15
points, while Bari (2-6-1) is alone in ninth place.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, French striker Youri Djorkaeff hit two early
penalty kicks to lift Internazionale of Milan past Sampdoria of
Genoa 3-0; last-place Venezia stunned Italian Cup holder Lazio of
Rome 2-0; Giuseppe Signori's hat-trick led Bologna past Vicenza
4-0; Marco Di Vaio scored twice to lead Salernitana past Perugia
2-0, and Arturo Di Napoli's double gave Empoli a 2-1 win over
Cagliari.

Coventry keeps winning without Dublin; Dublin keeps scoring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in 4th-7th grafs Coventry hoping to sign Norway's Rune
Lang; Strachan, Froggatt quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Coventry doesn't seem to miss Dion Dublin.
	   With three goals from Steve Froggatt, Darren Huckerby and Noel
Whelan, Coventry beat Everton 3-0 Sunday in a battle of clubs
trying to stay out of the relegation zone.
	   It was Coventry's second victory in two games without Dion
Dublin _ and Whelan and Huckerby have scored in each. The win gave
Coventry 14 points, good for 15th place just behind Tottenham.
	   Manager Gordon Strachan said he hoped on Monday to sign
Norwegian Rune Lang from Norway's Tromso on a 2.5-million-pound
(drls 4.1 million), helping to take up the slack left by Dublin.
	   ``He's a good player, he is an exciting youngster,'' Strachan
said.
	   Meanwhile, Coventry has gained confidence it can win without the
talented Dublin.
	   ``It was massively important for us to win today,'' Froggatt
said. ``We have leap frogged Everton and another win next week and
we will be in the top half of the table. We can build on this
win.''
	   As for Dublin, first-place Aston Villa could not be happier.
	   Dublin, in his second match since moving on a 5.75-million-pound
(dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from Coventry, scored a hat trick in
Villa's 4-1 victory Saturday at last-place Southampton. He has five
in two games.
	   The victory kept Villa on top in the Premier League, three ahead
of Manchester United (25) and four up on Arsenal (24). Chelsea,
Leeds and West Ham have 20 points.
	   ``Dion has added something to our game which was lacking
before,'' Villa manager John Gregory said.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Arsenal 0, Tottenham 0;
Charlton 1, Middlesbrough 1; Chelsea 3, Wimbledon 0; Liverpool 1,
Leeds 3; Manchester United 3, Blackburn 2; Newcastle 1, Sheffield
Wednesday 1; West Ham 3, Leicester 2.
	   At Arsenal, former Arsenal boss George Graham had the final word
as Spurs managed a 0-0 draw. Tottenham coach Graham was met with
signs and calls of ``Judas,'' ``Tottenham Scum'' and ``Traitor.
	   ``Some people in the crowd gave me stick before and during the
game but it is part and parcel of the game these days,'' Graham
said.
	   At Anfield, Gerard Houllier's first game in charge at Liverpool
was a 3-1 loss to Leeds on three late goals in seven minutes _ two
by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Houllier, the former French national
coach, took over Thursday when co-manager Roy Evans stepped down.
The latest loss dropped Liverpool to 12th place.
	   ``I feel very, very sorry for the players. They are very
frustrated,'' Houllier said. ``We are too frail mentally.''
	   Manchester United beat Blackburn 3-2 as Paul Scholes scored
twice and then held off a late rally by Rovers.
	   At Chelsea, the Blues beat Wimbledon 3-0 with goals from
Gianfranco Zola, Gustavo Poyet and Dan Petrescu. It was Poyet's
seventh despite being used mostly as a substitute.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland pushed its
league-leading point total to 40 with a 2-0 win at Port Vale.
Ipswich held second place (35 points) with a 1-0 win over Barnsley.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division, Rangers stayed on top with 30
points after a 2-1 home win over Aberdeen with goals by Giovanni
Van Bronckhorst and Andrei Kanchelskis.
	   The weekend also signaled the start of the F.A. Cup with 33
first-round matches Saturday and four more Sunday, many pitting
semi-pro teams against clubs from England's second and third
divisions. The big upset was probably minnow Bedlington's 4-1 win
Saturday over second-division Colchester.

Kuwaitis not interested in another rerun of the old Saddam movie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuwaiti army still on alert &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANA ELIAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Iraqi defiance leads to a U.S. military buildup,
then to a last-minute diplomatic solution. Saddam Hussein's small
neighbor has repeatedly lived this scenario _ and feared its
consequences _ since the Gulf War.
	   But this time around, very few seem to be alarmed or even
bothered.
	   ``People are sick of this song and dance,'' said Masouma
al-Mubarak, who teaches political science at Kuwait University.
``They want a solution, an end to this situation with Saddam as a
source of tension in the area.''
	   In February, during the last crisis between Iraq and the United
Nations, Kuwaitis stocked up on food and water. Some sealed rooms
against a possible retaliatory Iraqi attack with chemical or
biological weapons. Some even bought gas masks.
	   ``We got used to this,'' Jamal al-Naki, a 40-year-old Kuwaiti,
explained as he selected fresh vegetables at a supermarket. He was
not buying anything extra.
	   But al-Naki and some newspapers also expressed bitterness at
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over his army's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. ``This time they will get him. He will be their target,''
al-Naki told The Associated Press.
	   And columnist Fouad al-Hashem, anticipating an attack, wrote in
the Sunday edition of the daily Al-Watan: ``Saddam, his family, his
cronies and his Baath Party will have dug their own graves. We will
shovel dirt on them and their history.''
	   For the past week, however, most Kuwaitis have been more
concerned about winning the Gulf soccer cup _ which they did.
	   As more American soldiers prepared to deploy to the region
Friday, young Kuwaitis danced in the streets and waved flags to
greet the returning champions.
	   Around 1,500 U.S. soldiers are in Kuwait training in the desert
or maintaining equipment prepositioned to protect the country.
	   On Sunday, the Cabinet was informed of contingency plans should
there be airstrikes on Iraq, but the plans were not made public.
The country's tiny military is on alert, but a Defense Ministry
spokesman told the AP the measure was ``precautionary.'' The
military remained on alert Sunday.
	   Officials have urged Iraq to rescind its decision to halt
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors but have made it a point to
stay out of any confrontation. Defense Minister Sheik Salem
al-Sabah said last week that Kuwait was ``not a party'' to the
tensions.
	   Some U.S. Embassy families have made plans to depart, but there
are no signs of widespread panic among Kuwait's 8,000 American
residents, who were advised to consider leaving by the State
Department.
	   Still, the Kuwaitis' public nonchalance has brought one warning
_ from a columnist for the pro-government al-Anba daily.
	   ``This repeated heating and cooling should not become like the
famous `cry wolf' story,'' wrote Sami al-Nisf. ``We should not take
it easy because nothing has happened in the past, only to be caught
unprepared.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start that latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Israel has asked the United States, which mediated the recent
peace agreement, to condemn Arafat's comments as well.

Fiorentina coach, players bitter over appeal loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Fiorentina's coach and players expressed
anger and disappointment Sunday after the club's appeal of its
expulsion from the UEFA Cup was denied.
	   Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta called the decision ``a
great injustice.''
	   ``I feel very bad,'' the Serie A leader's captain said. ``It's
like they sent us to jail even though we did nothing. We're all
upset, we're broken up about it. What happened is ridiculous.''
	   UEFA ruled Sunday that there will be no replay of the Nov. 3 cup
game between Fiorentina and Swiss club Grasshoppers, a match
suspended at halftime after an explosive device tossed from the
stands injured an off-field official.
	   That game was played at Salerno, Italy, because Fiorentina's
home field was suspended for violence at a 1997 match.
	   The decision ``means we will concentrate on the league and the
Italian Cup, trying to get our revenge there,'' Fiorentina coach
Giovanni Trapattoni said.

U.S. military buildup continues despite Iraqi back down

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in the Gulf over the
weekend as part of the American military buildup aimed at
threatening Iraq, but other warplanes were diverted to Europe
instead, Air Force officials said Sunday.
	   In announcing that Iraq agreed unconditionally to allow U.N.
weapons inspectors to do their work, President Bill Clinton said
Sunday that the buildup of about 400 warplanes by Thanksgiving
would continue to ensure Saddam Hussein meets his obligations.
	   But Defense Secretary William Cohen said the buildup might not
reach full planned strength because the United States already has
plenty of firepower in the region, with more than 170 aircraft, one
aircraft carrier and about two dozen other ships.
	   Military strength can be ``increased at a moment's notice if we
have to do so,'' Cohen said.
	   Some of the diversions were due to ``a lack of clearances'' for
some of the aircraft to land in the region, said a senior defense
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official
wouldn't say who denied the clearance.
	   Defense officials weren't saying where the warplanes were
supposed to land in the Gulf region. Previously, American jet
fighters and bombers have used bases in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia and some of the other Gulf states.
	   Within about two weeks, two aircraft carriers, more than two
dozen ships, some 400 warplanes and about 45,000 U.S. troops were
supposed to be in the Gulf as part of the buildup. Ground forces
would include 4,500 in Kuwait prepared to defend against any Iraqi
action if the U.S. troops are sent as previously planned.
	   Ten of 12 F-117 stealth fighters slated to go to the Gulf left
on Saturday from Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, said Capt.
Gregg Bottemiller, public affairs director for the base. There was
no confirmation on where or when the aircraft landed.
	   Six B-52s out of Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, arrived at
the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, according to Air Force
Capt. Sandy Troeber. But six other B-52s, which can launch Tomahawk
cruise missiles, remained at Fairchild AFB at Spokane, Washington.
	   Meanwhile, some of the more than three dozen F-15 and F-16 jet
fighters that had departed various U.S. bases on Friday and
Saturday were diverted to Europe.
	   Troeber said several fighter aircraft went to bases in Spain and
Italy for ``operational reasons'' and were expected to continue to
the Gulf when conditions permit.
	   Six B-1 bombers also left over the weekend for the region. Some
550 Air Force personnel were leaving Sunday and Monday to support
the aircraft.
	   An E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System
aircraft, known as Joint STARS, left for the Gulf on Saturday. The
surveillance planes have long-range air-to-ground systems designed
to track targets in all weather conditions.
	   Three other surveillance aircraft, E-3C AWACS, for Airborne
Warning and Control System, left Saturday as well.
	   Three EC-130s, electronic jammers, were scheduled to leave on
Monday, the Air Force said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's belt tightening austerity package will drastically affect
several government social programs, said a congressional report
released Sunday.
	   The study shows that the most affected programs include
low-income housing, agrarian reform and projects to alleviate the
drought-stricken northeast and increase the minimum wage.
	   ``The government has cut some very important assistance lines to
the needy,'' Sen. Ramez Tebet told the newspaper O Globo.
	   The budget cuts are part of an austerity program to save dlrs 24
billion in 1999 and dlrs 80 billion by 2002. Such reductions helped
Brazil secure an International Monetary Fund rescue package Friday
of dlrs 41.5 billion.
	   About 25 million of Brazil's 160 million inhabitants live in
extreme poverty.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ As a final ruling on his legal status
nears, Gen. Augusto Pinochet is expected to be moved from a London
hospital to an undisclosed destination near an air field, a
right-wing congresswoman said.
	   ``I was informed that Scotland Yard is looking for a safe place,
away from reporters and demonstrators,'' said Maria Angelica
Cristi, who visited Pinochet last week.
	   The Chilean air force reportedly has two planes stationed at
Brize Norton air base to bring Pinochet home if he is released. The
reports said the transfer could occur as early as Monday.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 at the request of Spanish Judge
Baltasar Garzon, who charged him with genocide, torture and murder
that occurred during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   The High Court of London ruled that as a former head of state,
Pinochet was immune from prosecution. But prosecutors have appealed
that ruling. A final decision by the House of Lords is expected
this week.
	   Cristi, who visited Pinochet twice last week, said the retired
general is slowly improving after undergoing back surgery on Oct.
9.

Kuwaitis not interested in another rerun of the old Saddam movie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuwaiti military still on alert. &QL; 
 &UR; With Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANA ELIAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Iraqi defiance leads to a U.S. military buildup,
then to a last-minute diplomatic solution. Saddam Hussein's small
neighbor has repeatedly lived this scenario _ and feared its
consequences _ since the Gulf War.
	   But this time around, very few seem to be alarmed or even
bothered.
	   ``People are sick of this song and dance,'' said Masouma
al-Mubarak, who teaches political science at Kuwait University.
``They want a solution, an end to this situation with Saddam as a
source of tension in the area.''
	   In February, during the last crisis between Iraq and the United
Nations, Kuwaitis stocked up on food and water. Some sealed rooms
against a possible retaliatory Iraqi attack with chemical or
biological weapons. Some even bought gas masks.
	   ``We got used to this,'' Jamal al-Naki, a 40-year-old Kuwaiti,
explained as he selected fresh vegetables at a supermarket. He was
not buying anything extra.
	   Al-Naki echoed some newspapers in calling for vengeance against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over his army's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
	   ``This time they will get him. He will be their target,''
al-Naki told The Associated Press.
	   And columnist Fouad al-Hashem, anticipating an attack, wrote in
the Sunday edition of the daily Al-Watan: ``Saddam, his family, his
cronies and his Baath Party will have dug their own graves. We will
shovel dirt on them and their history.''
	   For most Kuwaitis though, the most recent threat of airstrikes
against Iraq concerned them less than their soccer team's
performance in the Gulf cup. They won.
	   As more American soldiers prepared to deploy to the region
Friday, young Kuwaitis danced in the streets and waved flags to
greet the returning champions.
	   Around 1,500 U.S. soldiers are in Kuwait training in the desert
or maintaining equipment prepositioned to protect the country.
	   On Sunday, the Cabinet was informed of contingency plans should
there be airstrikes on Iraq, but the plans were not made public.
The country's tiny military is on alert, but a Defense Ministry
spokesman told the AP the measure was ``precautionary.'' The
military remained on alert Sunday.

Hick called up for injured Atherton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Graeme Hick has been called into
England's cricket squad as concern mounts over opening batsman
Michael Atherton.
	   Atherton was unable to take his place in the field and did open
England's second innings in a tour match against Queensland on
Sunday.
	   With the first of five tests starting in Brisbane on Friday,
Atherton's continual back problems are worrying the tourists.
	   England coach David Lloyd said he was not confident that
Atherton will be fit for the Ashes opener, which is followed by the
second test in Perth starting on Nov. 28.
	   ``I knew something like this could happen but the call from
(chairman of selectors) David Graveney still came as a bit of a
surprise, but a nice one all the same,'' Hick said. ``I know I'm
going out as cover just in case any other injury doubt crops up and
at the moment I don't know how long I'll be with the squad.''
	   An England team spokesman in Cairns said Hick would be with the
Ashes squad for at least the initial two tests.
	   The spokesman said Hick is unlikely to play in those tests as
John Crawley is expected to open the batting if Atherton's injury
does not improve.
	   Graveney said Hick would depart London on Monday and join the
rest of the squad in Brisbane on Wednesday.
	   ``Given the recurrence of the stiffness in Atherton's back and
with the first two tests looming, sending for cover in case of
further injury worries to any of the other batsmen in the squad is
the right and proper thing to do,'' Graveney said.
	   ``Michael's back condition is well documented however there is
no suggestion at this stage he will be forced out of the tour
through injury, although we will continue to monitor the situation
closely.
	   ``We nominated standby players for the tour for just this type
of situation and we are confident Graeme will do an excellent job
if he is called upon.''
	   Hick, 33, has played 48 tests and scored 2681 runs at an average
of 34.82.

UEFA appeals panel confirms Fiorentina suspension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA's appeals panel on Sunday confirmed the
decision to expel Fiorentina from the UEFA Cup for the rest of the
season because of an explosion that injured a match official.
	   After close to seven hours of testimony and deliberations,
UEFA's board of appeal rejected the Italian club's bid to have the
Nov. 3 second-round, second-leg match at Salerno replayed.
	   UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission suspended the Italian
team last Sunday after Belgian off-field referee Philippe Flament
was injured during halftime by an explosive device hurled from the
stands, causing the match to be abandoned.
	   As a result, Zurich's Grasshoppers advances to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Girondins de Bordeaux.
	   ``The board made it clear that the decision taken by the first
instance is appropriate,'' UEFA said in a press release. ``The
fundamental UEFA principle whereby the organising club is
responsible for order and security was confirmed.
	   ``In view of the fact that the security control at the entry
gates of the stadium were judged insufficient, but also given the
previous record of the Italian club and the serious nature of the
incident, the board had no other choice.''
	   Having won the first leg in Zurich 2-0 and leading 2-1 after the
first half of its home match, Fiorentina was expected to easily
qualify for the third round.
	   But the match was suspended after a spectator tossed the
explosive from the stands onto the field, injuring Flament and
temporarily deafening several players.
	   Flament was taken to hospital with a knee injury.
	   UEFA said that Fiorentina was responsible for security even
though the match was played in Salerno and not at Fiorentina's home
city of Florence.
	   ``It was revealed today that the size of the bomb was such that
it should have been detected,'' said Rene Eberle, head of UEFA's
competition and logistics department. ``A more thorough search
would have detected it. But only a random search of spectators was
done, where they only searched those who looked suspicious.''
	   The match was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
serving the second and last round of its Franchi stadium
suspension, resulting from fan violence during a 1997 European Cup
Winners' Cup game.
	   The one mitigating factor that helped Fiorentina was that the
suspect in the case, is reported to be a supporter of Fiorentina's
Italian rival Salernitana. That factor saved the team from being
banned from all future UEFA club competitions as well, UEFA said.
	   Outraged, Fiorentina's General Manager Luciano Luca said the
club couldn't afford such drastic security measures, adding he felt
the team had been victimized.
	   ``This sentence is a real injustice to Florence,'' Luna said.
``We are the victims of a terrorist attack which had nothing to do
with sport.
	   ``The rules should be revised. It gives the wrong idea. It's not
possible to have such an interpretation of rules as we enter the
new millenium.''
	   Luna added that the punishment would further aggravate
Fiorentina's financial problems.

Congo foreign minister to meet South African counterpart Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Congo Foreign Minister
Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe is to meet Monday with his South
African counterpart, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, to discuss the
Congo crisis, a foreign affairs spokesman said Sunday.
	   Lolakombe, who recently criticized President Nelson Mandela for
meeting Congo rebel leader Ernst Wamba dia Wamba, will meet Nzo at
the Union Buildings in Pretoria early on Monday.
	   Last week, Mandela met with Rwanda's Deputy President Paul
Kagame, another foe of Congo's President Laurent Kabila.
	   The spokesman, Marco Boni, said the talks would be a
``continuation of discussions aimed at securing a ceasefire''.
	   African officials and heads of state have been crisscrossing the
continent since August trying to bring an end to fighting in the
Congo that now involves at least five outside countries.

Graf upsets Davenport to win Advanta

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Steffi Graf took a dramatic step
in her tennis comeback on Sunday by stunning top-ranked Lindsay
Davenport to win the Advanta Championships.
	   The unseeded Graf defeated Davenport 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a grueling
two-hour match, to win her second tournament in as many tries since
returning from a two-month layoff because of wrist surgery.
	   The loss spoiled Davenport's debut on American soil as the
top-ranked player in the WTA Tour's computer rankings. She had won
her last seven matches, including a victory over Monica Seles in
the semifinals Saturday and the European Championships finals
against Venus Williams last month.
	   Davenport is still assured of finishing the season at No. 1
regardless of what she does at the Chase Championships next week.
Second-ranked Martina Hingis cannot garner enough points to
overcome Davenport, even if Hingis wins the Chase event.
	   But it was Graf who celebrated this time in the first meeting
between the two in a championship final. Minutes after Davenport's
return hit the net on match point, Graf smiled widely and shook her
fist in the air.
	   ``It's been a tough road back, but I seem to be doing really
well,'' Graf said after receiving her dlrs 79,000 winner's check.
	   After splitting the first two sets and exchanging service breaks
as Davenport took a 4-3 lead in the third set, Graf went to work,
allowing Davenport just four points in the last three games.
	   Graf went up 40-15 in the last game and was cheered by the crowd
after Davenport's return sailed into the net.
	   It was Graf's 10th straight match victory, including a win in
the finals of the Leipzig Open, since returning from wrist surgery
last month. It was the second time Graf has won the tournament, and
the second straight year that Davenport has lost an Advanta final.
	   The two were tied at 2-2 in the third set before exchanging
service breaks on consecutive serves, with Graf needing five break
points, and Davenport four.
	   Graf came out blazing in the first set, nailing three aces and
pushing Davenport back on most of her service returns to take a 4-1
lead.
	   Davenport turned it around winning the last five games. She
rallied back from three points down to take one game, then rocketed
a forehand winner past a charging Graf to break service on the way
to taking the set.
	   Graf took the first game of the second set, then had to retreat
to the locker room for trainers to re-tape her left leg, which
cramped in the quarterfinals against the second-seeded Martina
Hingis.
	   The delay showed little effect on Graf, who jumped out to a 5-3
lead. On the last game, Graf held off two break points, hit a
forehand winner, then took the set after a Davenport return went
long.

Bad weather delays search for son of former Canadian prime
</HEADLINE>
minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ Poor weather and the risk of
further snowslides delayed the search Sunday for former Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau's youngest son, believed killed when he was
swept into an icy lake by an avalanche.
	   Michel Trudeau, 23, was on a back-country ski expedition Friday
when he was thrown into Kokanee Lake in the Kootenay Mountains of
southeast British Columbia. The two other skiers with Trudeau
survived.
	   A team of police divers was ready to search for his body once
weather conditions permitted. But rain and low clouds prevented
authorities from dispatching helicopters to the site of the
avalanche, which is inaccessible by overland vehicle.
	   Cpl. Randy Koch of the Mounties' local detachment said he had
spoken by telephone with Pierre Trudeau.
	   ``He's deeply shaken by this,'' Koch said. ``He was very quiet,
but he told us to go on to recover the body.''
	   Three hikers were walking along the same ridge behind Michel
Trudeau's group when the avalanche struck. They tried to help, but
were swept away themselves by a second avalanche.
	   One of the hikers, Paul Williamson, said Trudeau was ``still
alive, shouting for help and groaning. We could see him. But we
couldn't reach him. He was in the middle of the lake.''
	   After digging themselves out, the hikers had to walk about four
miles in soggy clothing to reach their car and drive to seek help.
	   Michel Trudeau had visited the area earlier this year with his
father and one of his brothers. He was an avid skier and hiker, and
had worked as a ski lift attendant in the Kootenay Mountains last
winter.
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien called Pierre Trudeau from
Singapore to express his condolences.
	   ``Mr. Trudeau is a man who doesn't easily express his
emotions,'' Chretien told Radio-Canada. ``But his tone of voice was
heavy and it was obvious he must have been suffering enormously.''
	   The former prime minister, who held power from 1968 to 1984
except for a nine-month gap, has two other sons, Sacha and Justin.
He and the boys' mother, Margaret, are divorced.

Arafat warns: ``our rifle is ready'' to pray in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sharon calling for West Bank land grab grafs 5-8 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL103-107
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start that latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Israel has asked the United States, which mediated the recent
peace agreement, to condemn Arafat's comments as well.
	   And in comments certain to heighten tensions, Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon called on Jewish settlers Sunday to grab West Bank
hilltops now before the two sides reach a permanent territorial
agreement over the area where the Palestinians want to build their
future state.
	   ``Everyone there should move, should run, should grab more
hills, expand the territory. Everything that's grabbed, will be in
our hands, everything that we don't grab, will be in their hands.
That's how it will be,'' Sharon said at a meeting with members of
the right-wing Tsomet party, a coalition partner in Netanyahu's
government. His comments were broadcast on Israel radio.
	   The United States has called on Israel to refrain from building
in settlements or changing the current status of the West Bank in
any way and the latest peace accord signed at the White House last
month says both Israel and the Palestinians will not carrying out
any unilateral actions.
	   Bar-Illan said Sharon's comments did not conflict with the
wording or spirit of the latest peace accord because Sharon was
referring to hilltops which neighbor Jewish settlements and which
Israel already considers to be part of existing settlements.
	   Settlers have begun placing trailer homes on several hilltops
adjacent to their settlements in order to stake a claim over areas
still up for discussion. But Sharon's comments Sunday were the
first indication that the settler actions have government approval.

Pressure eases on Jorge as PSG wins 4-0 at Le Havre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Struggling Paris Saint-Germain secured a
much-needed victory on Sunday as it pounded Le Havre 4-0.
	   PSG, France's richest club, has had a miserable start to the
season, and new coach Artur Jorge had won only one match before the
success at Le Havre.
	   Marco Simone scored a goal in each half, while Jimmy Algerino
and Gregory Paisley struck in the first half.
	   PSG moved up to ninth place with the win.
	   In Sunday's other game, improving Strasbourg beat bottom club
Lorient 2-0.
	   On Saturday, league leader Marseille went four points clear at
the top with a 1-0 win over Lens, after Bordeaux had been held to a
goalless draw at home to Sochaux.

Arafat warns: ``our rifle is ready'' to pray in Jerusalem

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
	   The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start that latest Mideast peace accord.
	   A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
	   	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Israel has asked the United States, which mediated the recent
peace agreement, to condemn Arafat's comments as well.
	   And in comments certain to heighten tensions, Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon called on Jewish settlers Sunday to grab West Bank
hilltops now before the two sides reach a permanent agreement over
the area where the Palestinians hope to build an independent
homeland.
	   ``Everyone there should move, should run, should grab more
hills, expand the territory. Everything that's grabbed, will be in
our hands, everything that we don't grab, will be in their hands.
That's how it will be,'' Sharon said at a meeting with members of
the right-wing Tsomet party, a coalition partner in Netanyahu's
government. His comments were broadcast on Israel radio.
	   The United States has called on Israel to refrain from building
in settlements or changing the current status of the West Bank. The
latest peace accord, signed at the White House last month, says
both Israel and the Palestinians will not carry out any unilateral
actions.
	   Bar-Illan said Sharon's comments did not conflict with the
latest peace accord because Sharon was referring to hilltops that
neighbor Jewish settlements and that Israel already considers to be
part of existing settlements.
	   Settlers have begun placing trailer homes on several hilltops
adjacent to their settlements to stake a claim over areas still up
for discussion. But Sharon's comments Sunday were the first
indication that the settler actions have government approval.

Gov. Ota's challenger claims victory in Okinawa gubernatorial

comments &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A governor opposed to the U.S. military presence on
his southern Japanese island lost a re-election bid Sunday to a
more flexible opponent, the semi-government television broadcaster
reported.
	   With 100 percent of the ballots counted, Keiichi Inamine, 65, an
adviser to a group of local business leaders, had 374,833 votes,
while incumbent Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota, backed by the largest
opposition party, had 337,369, NHK television reported.
	   It showed Inamine celebrating victory as his supporters chanted
``Banzai!'' in unison.
	   ``There was a feeling that Okinawa was stuck with the military
base issues and the economy both not moving forward at all,'' said
Inamine, who was backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   ``I wanted to break this gloomy feeling and improve the
situation so that people can start seeing some light and make
Okinawa a place for young people to have future dreams and hopes,''
he said.
	   Voters in the economically depressed prefecture, or state,
apparently chose Inamine's aggressive economic policy over Ota's
steadfast opposition to the presence of U.S. bases, the Yomiuri
newspaper, Japan's largest daily, reported Monday morning.
	   Voter turnout was 76.54 percent, far higher than the previous
poll's 62.54 percent four years ago, media reports said.
	   Two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are concentrated
on Okinawa, which accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's total
land area. The island was the site of some of the bloodiest
fighting in World War II.
	   Longstanding opposition to the military presence in Japan
exploded in 1995 when three U.S. servicemen raped a 12-year-old
Okinawan girl.
	   The central military-related issue of the campaign involved how
to carry out a 1996 U.S.-Japan agreement to move a U.S. Marine
Corps facility from a crowded Okinawan city to a more remote
location.
	   Aimed at easing the American military burden on Okinawa, the
centerpiece of the accord calls for the closure of Futenma Air
Station in five to seven years as long as a suitable replacement is
built elsewhere.
	   The national government has proposed building a floating
heliport off the coast of Nago, a central Okinawan city north of
the capital of Naha. But Ota, 73, wanted the facility moved to
another part of Japan or outside the country entirely.
	   The 65-year-old Inamine backs a plan calling for the military
heliport to be incorporated into a new airport in northern Okinawa
that would also be open to civilian air traffic.
	   In February, a supporter of plans to build the floating heliport
narrowly won a mayoral election in Nago.
	   ``I'm sorry,'' Ota was quoted by Kyodo News as telling his
supporters. He had been seeking his third four-year term.
Expressing concerns over the likely change of policy, he added:
``I'm worried about a loss of consistency in the future.''
	   Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the LDP, said voters
supported Inamine's realistic ideas about economic measures and
military base issues, Kyodo reported.
	   Inamine has pledged to improve Okinawa's relations with the
central government, which have soured over the bases issue, to help
promote economic stimulus measures.
	   The LDP supported a setback in another election, however. On the
main southern island of Kyushu, incumbent Fukuoka Mayor Keiichi
Kuwahara, who was backed by the ruling party, was defeated by
challenger Hirotaro Yamasaki, a former member of Parliament
supported by the nation's main opposition Democratic Party of
Japan.

	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ Michel Trudeau, son of former
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was missing and presumed
drowned after an avalanche swept him and fellow skiers into a lake,
police said Saturday.
	   Trudeau, 23, was with three friends who were caught in the snow
slide in British Columbia's Kootenay Mountains on Friday.
	   The three others were picked up by helicopter Saturday after
they made their way to shore. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
said Trudeau was last seen in the water and described the chances
of finding him alive as ``very slim.''
	   ``It would appear he wasn't able to get to shore,'' said Cpl.
Randy Koch.
	   The former prime minister, who held power from 1968 to 1984
except for a nine-month gap, has two other sons, Sacha and Justin.
He and his wife, Margaret, are divorced.
	   The area where the accident occurred is popular with back
country skiers, and there have been avalanche fatalities in the
past. In January, six skiers were killed in an avalanche not far
from the site of Friday's accident.

Secretary-general defuses glitch over Iraq's pledge to cooperate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with details of glitch; quote
from Hamdoon; quote from chief U.N. weapons inspector; edits to
trim. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stepped
in Sunday to defuse a potentially serious glitch in the Security
Council over Iraq's pledge to cooperate fully and unconditionally
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The council meeting was delayed by more than an hour because
some members were concerned that a statement by Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Sunday might have repudiated three key letters
from Iraq's U.N. ambassador clarifying Iraq's position.
	   It was the contents of these letters from Iraqi Ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon that led U.S. President Bill Clinton to reverse the U.S.
position and declare Sunday that Iraq's promise to allow U.N. arms
inspections to resume was indeed unconditional.
	   Annan said in a statement that Clinton's ``statesmanlike
response today will be welcomed by the entire international
community.''
	   He warned, however, that in a future crisis, military force
might be the only way out. ``Some governments have made it clear
that next time around there may not even be time for diplomatic
appeals,'' Annan said in an interview with CNN.
	   Doubts about Iraq's unconditional commitment to inspections
arose when Aziz told CNN Sunday that ``Iraq is only committed to
the contents of the letter'' he sent to Annan on Saturday.
	   The letter said weapons inspectors could resume their ``normal
duties'' _ but it also contained an annex with Iraq's terms for a
comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N. resolutions, many
of which have already been rejected by the United States. And
Washington rejected the Iraqi offer as unacceptable.
	   During nearly five hours of meeting Saturday night, Hamdoon
provided three letters of clarification stating that Iraq's
decision to allow unfettered inspections was unconditional, that
the annex represented only the Iraqi government's ``views and
preferences,'' and that the inspectors could immediately resume all
their activities.
	   After Aziz appeared on television, the Security Council
president, who this month happens to be Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh, asked the secretary-general to clarify whether the
deputy prime minister's statement was a repudiation of Hamdoon's
letters.
	   The council meeting was delayed while Hamdoon met Annan and
Burleigh. According to a U.S. diplomat, Hamdoon arranged a phone
call to Aziz during the meeting, and with Burleigh listening, Aziz
said his letter included the three letters of clarification from
the ambassador.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said a note from that telephone
conversation was presented to council members. It stated that Aziz
had authorized Hamdoon's letters to the council, and ``they
therefore formed part and parcel of his letter.''
	   After the meeting, Hamdoon told reporters: ``I think this matter
is behind us now.''
	   The council then began meeting behind closed doors to continue
consultations on a response to Iraq's offer to resume cooperation
with inspectors, and its subsequent clarifications that the offer
was without additional demands.
	   Diplomats said they were considering two draft statements, one
from Russia and one from Britain.
	   ``I think the council should make it clear it is now up to Iraq
to make sure that their promises hold and that UNSCOM should have
good access and it should be successful,'' said Slovenia's U.N.
Ambassador Danilo Turk.
	   ``I think we're quite close to consensus on moving the
inspectors back under terms that require absolutely full and
complete and unconditional observation by Iraq of Security Council
resolutions,'' said Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, told reporters that
he had already started the logistical process of arranging an
aircraft and making other plans to send the inspectors back to
Baghdad.
	   ``I told the council that the minute the `go' order is given, we
could be back at work in 24 hours, and that remains the case,'' he
said.
	   Butler said Clinton had ``superbly defined'' in his speech
Sunday morning what full cooperation with the weapons inspectors
should mean ``and I earnestly hope that Iraq says that's fine by
us.''
	   Clinton said Iraq must resolve all outstanding issues raised by
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, give inspectors
unfettered access to all sites without restrictions, turn over all
relevant documents, accept all U.N. resolutions related to its
weapons of mass destruction, and not interfere with the
independence of the inspectors.
	   Hamdoon said he wanted ``to put the record straight,'' when
asked about Clinton's points.
	   ``Iraq abides by the relevant Security Council resolutions,''
agreements with UNSCOM and the memorandum of understanding Aziz
signed with Annan in February, which ended the last crisis with
Iraq, he said.
	   ``There is nothing more, nothing less,'' Hamdoon said.
	   Iraq halted U.N. inspections Oct. 31, saying it would only
resume cooperation with the arms experts if the council moved to
lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions have paralyzed exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   U.N. resolutions that ended the Gulf war, which was sparked by
Iraq's invasion, say sanctions can only be lifted after inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.

Valladolid stuns Mallorca, Celta holds onto lead

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Alen Peternac's 18th minute header gave
Valladolid a 1-0 victory over Mallorca Sunday and left tiny Celta
atop the Spanish first division for the first time since 1970.
	   Peternac scored off a cross from Victor Fernandez and dealt
Mallorca its first defeat of the season.
	   Celta moved into the league lead on Saturday with a 2-1 victory
over Real Madrid, its first win in Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in a
half-century.
	   Celta, a little team from the Galcian region in northwest Spain,
remains the only unbeaten team in the Primera Division with a 5-5-0
record and 20 points, one better than Barcelona and Mallorca.
	   FC Barcelona kept pace, snapping a three-game losing streak with
a 4-1 victory over lightly regarded Tenerife. Philip Cocu scored in
the 15th and 62nd minutes and Rivaldo and Sonny Anderson each added
one late for Barca.
	   The victory should provide some job security for Barcelona coach
Louis Van Gaal, who has been more harshly ciriticized as his team
slips toward elimination from the European Champions League.
	   The victory raised the Catalan side from fourth to second, ahead
of Mallorca on goal difference. Real Madrid dropped to fourth with
18 points.
	   In other games Sunday, Deportivo La Coruna drew with Alaves 2-2;
Oviedo won 5-3 at Athletic Bilbao; Betis defeated Real Sociedad
1-0; Espanyol beat Zaragoza 3-0, Racing Santander trounced
Salamanca 4-1; and last-placed Extremadura beat Valencia 1-0.
 &UR; Betis 1, Sociedad 0 &QC; 
	   At Seville, Fernando Sanchez scored after only four minutes and
Betis won its second straight game at home under new coach Javier
Clemente. Clemente took over for Chilean Vicente Cantatore on Oct.
26 and is 2-0-1 with the club, having carried it five places to
15th.
 &UR; Villarreal 2, Atletico 0 &QC; 
	   At Villarreal, Moises Garcia gave Villarreal the lead for good
in the 61st minute and his club only its second victory this
season. Romanian striker Georghe Craioveanu put Villarreal ahead in
the 19th. Juninho tied it on a penalty in the 52nd but missed a
chance to put Atletico ahead three minutes later when he bounced a
second penalty off the crossbar.
	   Juninho compounded his miss by getting expelled in the 90th
minute.
 &UR; Extremadura 1, Valencia 0 &QC; 
	   At Almendralejo, Alberto Toril's 60th-minute header gave
Extremadura its first victory at home this season. Extremadura
improved to 2-2-6 but remained in last place, one point behind
Alaves.
 &UR; Racing 4, Salamanca 1 &QC; 
	   At Santander, Victor Sanchez scored three goals, one on a
penalty, and Racing moved within five points of the league lead
with its victory.
	   Russian Sergei Shustikov gave Santander the lead after only
seven minutes but Victor added his first two goals in the 43rd and
56th minutes to squash Salamanca's chances.
	   Lorenzo ``Loren'' Moron tried to rally Salamanca with a goal in
the 71st but Victor's final tally in the 75th _ which gave him a
share of the league scoring lead with six goals _ followed by the
expulsion of Leo Ramos a minute later ended Salamanca's day.
 &UR; Oviedo 5, Athletic Bilbao 3 &QC; 
	   At Bilbao, Ivan Iglesias and Julio Cesar Dely Valdes scored 12
minutes apart and completed Oviedo's rally from a first-half,
two-goal deficit. Josu Urrutia and Jose Maria Lacruz gave Bilbao a
2-0 lead by the 16th minute, but Cesar Martin started to whittle
away only seven minutes later and an own goal by Mikel Lasa tied it
in the 54th.
	   Iglesias and Dely Valdes scored in the 63rd and 75th, and
despite a late Bilbao rally on an 83rd-minute goal by Santiago
Ezquerro, Oviedo stayed within five points of the lead on a penalty
by Ivan Ania in the 89th.
 &UR; Espanyol 3, Zaragoza 0 &QC; 
	   At Zaragoza, Argentine midfielder Kily Gonzalez's 19th-minute
expulsion reduced Zaragoza to 10 men and Espanyol finally
capitalized with three goals in seven minutes midway through the
second half.
	   Capdevilla started the scoring in the 60th, Fernando ``Nando''
Munoz added another in 66th and Juan Esnaider tacked on a penalty
in the 67th.
 &UR; Deportivo 2, Alaves 2 &QC; 
	   At La Coruna, a handball on Mauro Silva in the 79th minute led
to a converted penalty by Pablo Gomez, and Alaves earned the draw
with Deportivo.
	   The handball wasted a two-goal performance by Portuguese striker
Pauleta, who twice had given Deportivo the lead, in the 12th minute
on a header, and again in the 54th.
	   Manuel Canabal had tied it for Alaves, which won only its second
game this season, in the 31st.

Italian priest freed by kidnappers in the Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada announced
Monday that an abducted Italian priest has been freed unharmed by
kidnappers in the southern Philippines after more than two months
of captivity.
	   The kidnappers handed over the Rev. Luciano Benedetti to Muslim
rebels belonging to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a thickly
forested area in southern Zamboanga province late Sunday.
	   The rebels then turned the priest over to government officials.
	   ``This is good news. Father Benedetti was not hurt. He's strong
and we greeted each other over the phone,'' Estrada told a Manila
radio station.
	   Officials plan to escort Benedetti to a meeting with Estrada
before the Philippine leader flies to Malaysia later Monday for a
summit of Pacific Rim nations.
	   Benedetti, 54, from Treviso, was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected
Muslim rebels in Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, and his
kidnappers have demanded a ransom of 10 million pesos (dlrs
250,000), officials and rebel leaders have said.
	   Several other people remain in the hands of different groups of
kidnappers, including the family of a Taiwanese businessman, a pair
of Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian, all kidnapped in the
southern Mindanao region.
	   Al Haj Murad, the vice chairman of the MILF for military
affairs, said the MILF secured Benedetti's release without paying a
ransom.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling
the central government in an attempt to establish a separate
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   It is involved in on-and-off peace negotiations with Manila and
has promised to help the government combat rampant kidnappings in
Mindanao, although the military says the rebels might be involved
in some abductions.
	   Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign against the
kidnappings and scored a major victory last month with the rescue
of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors in
Manila.
	   He promised upon taking office in June to end the kidnappings
within six months.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ After visiting Guatemalan communities hard
hit by Hurricane Mitch, French President Jacques Chirac announced
Sunday that his government would forgive dlrs 134 million owed by
all Central American countries.
	   The French government announced Tuesday it was wiping away the
debts of the two most affected nations _ Honduras and Nicaragua.
But Guatemala and El Salvador also suffered serious damage earlier
this month. Costa Rican crops were hurt as well.
	   Chirac also vowed to propose that a Central American
reconstruction fund be established, to be overseen by the World
Bank.
	   ``The international community should mobilize to reconstruct all
that has been destroyed,'' Chirac told a news conference in
Guatemala City after he visited three heavily damaged Guatemalan
communities.
	   Two weeks after Mitch dumped heavy rains across the isthmus,
sweeping away entire villages and burying others in mud, foreign
aid continues to pour into the region, where officials estimate
more than 10,000 people died.
	   Chirac's visit is the latest by a number of world leaders and
celebrities traveling to Central America to see the damage first
hand.
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives Monday in Honduras for a
previously scheduled trip to Central America, which now will be
focused in large part on disaster relief efforts. Tipper Gore, the
wife of Vice President Al Gore, recently toured heavily damaged
regions of Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   Chirac arrived in Guatemala on Saturday and met with Indian
rights activist and Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu. On
Monday, he was to travel to Honduras to tour the devastation there.
	   Spanish Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon was in neighboring El
Salvador on Sunday, continuing his own tour of storm ravaged areas.
	   The crown prince walked along the banks of the River Lempa, some
70 kilometers (45 miles) outside the nation's capital, where many
lost homes when it overflowed its banks. And he stopped by a school
converted into a shelter to house several hundred homeless people.
	   ``We come to express Spain's solidarity,'' the prince said. ``We
have not stood by with crossed arms while our Central American
brothers undergo hard times.''
	   Although Mitch didn't strike El Salvador as hard as Nicaragua or
Honduras, the storm killed 175 people in the country, according to
government figures.
	   Another 65 people remain missing and 84,000 were left homeless
or temporarily displaced. Total damage has been estimated at dlrs
113 million.
	   Spanish First Vice President Francisco Alvarez, who accompanied
the prince on his tour, said that his country would send more than
dlrs 200 million to hard-hit countries.
	   ``This is a tragedy without precedent,'' he said.

Feyenoord leads league after PSV holds Ajax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven lost one keeper to
an ejection and nearly a second to a head injury but still managed
a 2-2 draw with Ajax at Amsterdam Arena Sunday.
	   The draw enabled Feyenoord to take over first place, beating
Foruna Sittard 4-1 to improve to 9-2-1 at 29 points, one ahead of
SC Heerenveen and Ajax.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Vitesse Arnhem remained in fourth with a 2-0
victory over FC Utrecht; RKC Waalwijk celebrated its first victory
of the season, 5-1 over Sparta Rotterdam; and Willem II defeated
NAC Breda 2-1.
	   At Amsterdam, goalkeeper Ronald Waterreus was sent off with 13
minutes remaining after a deliberate foul on Ajax teen-age striker
Brutil Hose, a play that kept the game 2-2.
	   Waterreus's replacement Patrick Lodewijks was kicked in the head
by Ajax's Portuguese forward Dani while covering a ball on the
ground, resulting in only a yellow for Dani but a massive cut and
swollen eye for Lodewijks.
	   Lodewijks bled heavily but played out the last five minutes with
his right eye almost closed. He sank to the ground at the final
whistle and was taken to hospital after the game with suspected
concussion.
	   PSV allowed Ajax most of the possession early and looked to
counter.
	   After eight minutes, Tomek Ivan sprinted 40 yards, past Richard
Witschge and beat goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar with a near-post
finish.
	   But a precise Ronald de Boer through ball set up Brazilian
Wamberto for an Ajax equalizer in the 25th minute.
	   Ruud van Nistelrooy found Luc Nilis alone in front of an empty
net to give PSV a 2-1 halftime lead.
	   But Ajax equalized on Frank de Boer's 60th-minute powerful
header which Waterreus could only parry into the net off the post
and defender Robert Fuchs' head.
	   PSV remains undefeated in the Arena in five matches and climbed
to eighth place with 19 points.

McEnroe, Forget reach final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ John McEnroe beat Mats Wilander of Sweden
6-0, 6-2 Sunday to reach the final of an ATP senior tournament in
which Iranian Mansour Bahrami provided some humorous moments.
	   Bahrami lost to Bjorn Borg 6-3, 6-4. On one point, when he
couldn't reach a Borg serve, he took another ball from his pocket
and ``returned'' it. Later, they staged a mock fight in front of
the refrigerator over who would take the drinks first. The argument
ended when Borg jokingly threw Bahrami into the refrigerator.
	   Borg will play for third place in this robin-round tourney
against Frenchman Henri Leconte, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Guillermo
Vilas of Argentina.
	   Guy Forget of France will face McEnroe in Monday's final, even
though he lost to Croatia's Goran Prpic 2-6, 6-4, 10-5. That's
because Forget's overall results in the Croatia Classics tournament
were better than Prpic's.

Ponting wins back test place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Ricky Ponting won back the contentious
No. 6 batting spot from Darren Lehmann when Australia named its
team Monday for the first test against England starting Friday.
	   Star spinner Shane Warne missed out, as expected, because of his
shoulder injury. Warne is hoping to return in time for the third
test on Dec. 26 but there remains some doubt that he will take any
part in the five-test series.
	   Lehmann took over on Australia's recent tour of Pakistan because
he is rated a better player of spin bowling. But with England's
attack revolving around seamers, Ponting won a recall.
	   Fast bowler Jason Gillespie was selected after a successful
recovery from back, groin and ankle injuries. He starred on
Australia's tour of England two years ago but played only two first
class matches last summer because of his injuries.
	   Also back after missing the Pakistan tests is paceman Michael
Kasprowicz, who put his name in front of the selection panel with a
fiery burst in the current four-day match between Queensland and
England in Cairns.
	   Victorian seamer Paul Reiffel was also recalled because of his
good record against England. He has dismissed struggling England
captain Alec Stewart five times in tests.
	   Australian captain Mark Taylor, who made a stunning 334 in
Pakistan, will play his 100th test this week.
	   Team: Mark Taylor (captain), Steve Waugh (vice-captain), Michael
Slater, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Jason
Gillespie, Damien Fleming, Stuart MacGill, Glenn McGrath, Michael
Kasprowicz (12th man to be named).

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors and other U.N.
personnel will return to Iraq in the next two days after Iraq
agreed to resume cooperation with the inspectors unconditionally,
U.N. officials said Sunday.
	   At the end of a Security Council meeting, chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler said he was ordering the return of the
inspectors on Tuesday.
	   Earlier, Benon V. Sevan, the head of the humanitarian program in

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Iraq narrowly avoided punishing military
strikes by dropping its defiance of the United Nations, but it now
must cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, without conditions,
President Bill Clinton said Sunday. ``Iraq has backed down, but
that is not enough. Now Iraq must live up to its obligations,''
Clinton said at the White House. If Saddam Hussein's government
fails to keep its word, overwhelming force remains an option, the
president warned. ``We remain ready to act,'' he said. In Iraq's
first comments following the weekend's tumultuous events, Iraq in
typical fashion declared itself the victor in the dispute. (IRAQ,
US-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel. The escalation of rhetoric
came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought to jump start implementation
of the latest Mideast peace accord. Israel called Arafat's comments
a ``declaration of war on the peace process'' and asked the United
States, which mediated the recent peace agreement, to condemn
Arafat's comments. Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's strong
language came in response to Israeli threats to annex parts of the
West Bank and frustration over Israeli delays in carrying out a
promised withdrawal from the West Bank. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations failed Sunday
to achieve a landmark agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5
trillion in global trade, but did manage to keep the effort from
totally collapsing. The fight now goes to the World Trade
Organization where the hope is to eventually overcome stiff
Japanese resistance to cutting tariffs in two sectors its considers
politically sensitive _ wood and fish products. The United States,
which had pushed the hardest to force Japan to agree to slash
tariffs in all nine sectors of the proposed agreement, reluctantly
accepted the outcome as the best Washington could get at the
moment. (APEC)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ His palace under heavy guard following
riots and protests, President B.J. Habibie on Sunday stood by his
military chief despite outrage over the shooting deaths of at least
five students in clashes with riot officers. Police, meanwhile,
took two opposition figures from their homes for questioning after
Habibie ordered the military to get tough on those he has accused
of trying to overthrow his 6-month-old government. Two other
pro-democracy activists were questioned Saturday and later
released. The streets of Jakarta were quiet Sunday after rampaging
mobs burned buildings and cars and attacked police during riots a
day earlier that were triggered by the killings of the students.
(INDONESIA)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for
the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan,
saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening
doors to terrorism.'' Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania
launched protests and hunger strikes in fervent shows of solidarity
with the rebel leader. Kurds came to Rome by bus and car from
across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong protest outside the

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It wasn't Woody Allen's idea for Kenneth Branagh
to mimic the nervous comedian in ``Celebrity.''
	   ``I said to him, `This part is definitely not me. If I was
younger I definitely would not play it,'' Allen says in Sunday's
Daily News. ``It requires a younger and more attractive person than
me.''
	   But when it came time to shoot the film, Allen and everyone else
involved couldn't help noticing how Branagh played his character
with Allen's trademark halting speech, fluttering hands and jittery
energy. Despite subtle directing suggestions, the characterization
persisted.
	   ``In the end, I had so much respect for him as an actor that I
felt, look, I don't wanna sit down and say we gotta reshoot
everything and you gotta do it my way,'' Allen said. ``So that's
what happened.''
	   ``Celebrity'' stars Branagh, Leonardo DiCaprio and Charlize
Theron.

	   DENVER (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu, who helped
end decades of racial segregation in South Africa, is urging U.S.
teens to take up a similar fight against hatred in America.
	   ``People were torn apart, were divided, were separated, were
alienated from one another. And whenever that happens, people
become suspicious of one another and they hate,'' he said. ``They
hate while they are apart.''
	   Speaking to about 250 youths Saturday, Tuto urged them to turn
their enemies into friends.
	   ``You know from your own lives how difficult it is to say I'm
sorry, and how difficult it can be to say I forgive you,'' he said.
``But any other route is filled with so much peril.''
	   The 67-year-old former archbishop won the 1984 Nobel Peace
Prize. More recently, he headed South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which held hearings on apartheid-era
crimes.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Media mogul Ted Turner says he is ``very
serious'' about making a bid for the White House, even though his
wife, actress Jane Fonda, doesn't approve, according to a magazine
report.
	   In its Nov. 23 issue, out Monday, The New Yorker says Turner let
slip the idea after a recent black-tie Southern California dinner
where he received the World Citizenship Award from a group
dedicated to eliminating nuclear weapons.
	   ``I am very serious about running for president, but Jane
doesn't want me to do it,'' the flamboyant founder of CNN
reportedly told several members of the Nuclear Age Peace
Foundation.
	   According to the magazine, Fonda left the door open to a Turner
campaign, saying, ``Wherever Ted goes, I go.''
	   The article said Turner's prize acceptance speech included the
claim that the United States was keeping nuclear weapons as
protection from ``the starving masses of the Third World when they
come to our door.''
	   Turner said they would be coming across the border from Mexico
and from Saudi Arabia, ``when they run out of oil,'' according to
the article.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Whitney Houston is tired of the rumors that she
and husband Bobby Brown might be abusing drugs.
	   ``No, I'm not a drug addict, and neither is my husband,''
Houston says in the issue of Newsweek hitting newsstands Monday.
``If that were so, you'd get a lot less work out of me. It would
show in the performances and in the work.''
	   The singer-actress, whose new album is ``My Love is Your Life,''
said her recent cancellation of a scheduled appearance on ``The
Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' which helped fueled the drug rumors, was
due to illness. She also blamed her frantic work and family
schedule for the drug talk.
	   ``A lot of what we go through is stress. When I'm stressed I
don't eat, and I guess that makes people think I'm on drugs,''
Houston said. ``Some people eat; I don't. But there is no problem,
no reason for me to, like, check in.''

Japan's September current account surplus rises again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade jumped in
September, climbing over 70 percent from a year ago, the government
announced Monday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.933 trillion yen (dlrs 15.8 billion) in September, up 70.4
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise marked the 18th consecutive monthly year-on-year
increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning surplus.

Tyson news conference postponed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A news conference Tuesday to announce Mike
Tyson's comeback fight has been postponed because all the details
have not been worked out.
	   ``We haven't got everything finished yet,'' Shelly Finkel,
Tyson's boxing advisor, said Sunday. ``We just want to get it all
finished. There are no problems at all. It's just not done. We
thought it would be done now.''
	   Steve Brener, a spokesman for Showtime, the American cable
television outlet which will televise Tyson's comeback fight,
expected to be against Francois Botha of South Africa Jan. 16 at
the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, agreed with Finkel.
	   ``The deal is not totally finalized,'' Brener said. ``There are
a few things to be ironed out. The date of Jan. 16 is set.''
	   Should the MGM Grand not be the site, it's possible Tyson would
fight Jan. 15 at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas.
	   America Presents, Tyson's new promoter, contacted Botha, at the
Los Angeles airport, where he was preparing to leave for New York.
	   Finkel said a news conference would be held after the American
Thanksgiving holiday, Nov. 26.
	   Tyson has not fought since being disqualified for biting Evander
Holyfield's ears June 28, 1997, at the MGM Grand for which he was
fined dlrs 3 million and had his license revoked by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission. The commission restored his license by a
4-1 vote Oct. 19.
	   Tyson is scheduled to go to trial Dec. 1 in Montgomery Country,
Maryland, on misdemeanor assault charges following an Aug. 31
traffic accident in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg. Tyson
has denied the charges.
	   Should Tyson fight Jan. 16, he would be coming off a layoff of
almost 19 months, the second longest of his career. Previously, he
was out of action from June 28, 1991, when he stopped Donovan
``Razor'' Ruddock, to Aug. 19, 1995, when he stopped Peter
McNeeley, during which he served three years in prison on a rape
conviction.
	   Botha has a 37-1 record. His loss came when he was stopped in
the 12th round by Mike Moorer in an IBF title fight Nov. 9, 1996.

The Chase is on for No. 1 in women's tennis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Besides the season-ending title and a pot of
money, there will be a little extra on the plate at this week's
Chase Championships: the No. 1 ranking.
	   Ameriocan Lindsay Davenport, the U.S. Open champion who is
ranked No. 1, will be among the 16 women at Madison Square Garden.
As will Swiss Martina Hingis, the Open winner who lost the top
ranking on Oct. 12.
	   ``Getting to No. 1 was such a huge step in my career after
winning the U.S. Open,'' Davenport said. ``To try and finish the
year No. 1 would be amazing.''
	   Others will be aiming at different targets in a tournament Czech
Jana Novotna calls a ``fifth Grand Slam.'' The winner's check is
dlrs 500,000.
	   The Championships begin Monday and conclude next Sunday with a
best-of-5 sets final, the only time during the year women play more
than three sets.
	   ``Staying at No. 1 is probably going to be the hardest thing
that I've ever tried to do in my tennis career,'' Davenport said.
``But I'm going to try. Once you get to No. 1, I'm definitely not
satisfied and giving up now. I'm going to try even harder to try
and stay there, try and make the most of everything that I've been
able to do the last year.
	   ``It's tough. I mean, everyone is gunning for you, you're never
supposed to lose, you're always the favorite. You kind of have to
deal with that kind of pressure in a different way.''
	   Standing in Davenport's way could be Steffi Graf, who has been
unbeatable since undergoing wrist surgery after the U.S. Open.
	   Graf has won her last two tournaments, including Sunday, when
she defeated Davenport 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the Advanta Championships
title match.
	   ``I'm right where I want to be,'' Graf said in Philadelphia. ``I
didn't think I'd be here two weeks ago. Winning these last two
tournaments shows I'm much further along than I thought I'd be.''
	   Davenport, who dominated the WTA Tour this summer, will begin by
facing Frenchwoman Sandrine Testud in their opening match on the
carpet.
	   Testud rarely wins tournaments yet remains dangerous, especially
against Davenport. The American holds a 6-2 edge but Testud won the
last time in Germany last month. They split their last four
matches.
	   ``You definitely have to be ready for the first match,''
Davenport said. ``You're not going to get a qualifier. You can't
really work your way into the tournament.
	   ``That's a difficult thing because whoever you play is going to
be in the top 16 and one of the best players in the world. ... At
the same time, you kind of look at it like there's not too much
pressure. I mean, you can't really have a bad loss here.''
	   In one of the most open years in women's tennis, Hingis was the
only woman to play in more than one of the four Grand Slam
tournament finals. She lost to Davenport in the U.S. Open.
	   Also in contention for the Chase title are French Open champion
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain and runner-up Monica Seles of the
United States; Wimbledon winner Novotna and runner-up Nathalie
Tauziat of France and Australian Open runner-up Conchita Martinez
of Spain.
	   ``It's great for women's tennis; it's great for the players,''
Novotna, the defending champion, said of the strong competition.
``There was a period when a player dominated _ Steffi, Monica,
Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert _ when they won everything. Now
it's wide open. Anybody can win any tournament. Anyone can win a
Grand Slam.''
	   Novotna could face a roadblock when she begins her title
defense. She plays Graf, who after two years of injuries and
surgery is beginning to show the game that once made her No. 1.
	   ``The minute Steffi got injured and she couldn't play for two
years, I went and won all the tournaments that I couldn't win in 10
years while I was competing with her,'' Novotna said. ``Now she's
back and I have to play her in the first round. It's just like a
destiny, really.''
	   Hingis will find a familiar face in the first round _ Swiss Fed
Cup teammate Patty Schnyder, making her first Championships
appearance.
	   In other opening matches, it's Sanchez-Vicario vs. Irina Spirlea
of Romania, Seles vs. Anna Kournikova of Russia, Frenchwoman Mary
Pierce vs. Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, Martinez vs. Dominique
van Roost of Belgium and Tauziat vs. Natasha Zvereva of Russia.
	   ``Everyone has earned their place here, everyone is extremely
good,'' said Davenport, who is playing in her fifth consecutive
Championships. ``It's a very difficult tournament to win. You have
to play your best, and hopefully you can do that from your first
match out there.''

Moderate earthquake hits in Sea of Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.9 struck Monday morning in the Sea of Japan, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   There was no fear of tsunami, or seismic waves caused by
undersea earthquakes or volcanic activity, from the 8:08 a.m. (2308
GMT Sunday) tremor, the agency said.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake was centered approximately 10 kilometers (6 miles)
under the ocean floor at a point about 355 kilometers (220 miles)
northwest of Tokyo, the agency said.
	   It was most strongly felt in Ryotsu, a port city on Sado Island,
306 kilometers (190 miles), northwest of Tokyo, according to agency
data.
	   A magnitude 4 quake can shake houses and buildings and cause
hanging objects such as lamps to swing, while one of magnitude 5
can cause damage to homes if it occurs in a residential area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
its sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

Clinton retreats from brink of war with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a familiar outcome, President Bill Clinton
stepped back from the brink of war with Iraq after Saddam Hussein
played a cheat-and-retreat game and promised again to play by the
rules.
	   But the betting is that Saddam will turn defiant within months
and interfere with U.N. weapons inspectors _ as he's done about a
dozen times since the Persian Gulf War. ``Candidly, I think it will
be a gigantic surprise if he does comply, but I hope he does,''
said Republican Sen. Arlen Specter.
	   Once again, the question is what happens next time. Clinton said
the best long-term solution is a new Iraqi government, and he
pledged to intensify support for Saddam's opponents.
	   After coming so close to attack, the swift White House retreat
raised doubts about Clinton's threats and whether Arab nations
would stick out their necks again to stand with the United States
against an unpredictable Iraq.
	   ``Our Gulf allies must be just shaking their heads at the
Clinton administration,'' said Eliot Cohen, a professor of
strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University who directed a
Pentagon study of the Gulf air war.
	   ``If you're Saudi Arabia or Qatar or Bahrain, you think the
Americans flinched. You wouldn't say Saddam flinched. He's had
another confrontation with the United States where he gets to go
back to the status quo ante without having paid for it.''
	   ``This will not be the last go round,'' Cohen said. ``It's in
Saddam's nature to keep pressing. It's in our nature, the nature of
this administration, to threaten but not be sure they mean it.''
	   David Kay, a former chief of the U.N. arms inspection team in
Baghdad, said Saddam got out of this jam without making any new
promises. ``This is what Iraq has been obligated to do from the
very beginning and has failed to do.''
	   ``Saddam played his usual game,'' Kay said. ``He played it right
to the last second. He spun out of the bull's-eye and lives to
fight another day. Saddam again proves he's smarter than the
Americans.''
	   The Iraqi leader triggered the showdown in August by limiting
inspectors' access to suspected weapons sites. On Oct. 31, Iraq
broke off cooperation.
	   Saddam ended the crisis simply by promising to allow the
inspectors to return, backing down even as American warplanes were
in the air. Iraq declared victory.
	   Clinton said it was ``the outcome we preferred'' and called off
the attack. ``Now Iraq must live up to its obligations,'' he said.
``Until we see complete compliance, we will remain vigilant, we
will keep up the pressure, we will be ready to act.''
	   However, it is a vigilance that carries a price. The United
States spent more than dlrs 1 billion in rushing military forces to
the Gulf earlier this year, only to stand down when Saddam
retreated. The cost this time will be hundreds of millions of
dollars more, plus the toll on the morale of U.S. forces and the
wear and tear on equipment.
	   Over the last few weeks, the administration worked quietly to
stitch together a coalition to isolate Saddam. It was a diplomatic
victory for Clinton.
	   The Security Council voted 15-0 to demand that Iraq reverse
course. Eight Arab nations, led by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria,
warned that Iraq alone would bear responsibility for the
consequences of refusing to cooperate with arms inspectors. Even
Russia, France and China muted their usual objections about
striking Iraq.
	   ``The world spoke with one voice,'' Clinton said.
	   But that consensus began dissolving when Iraq came forward with
a letter Saturday promising full cooperation. The United States
said the Iraqi pledges were conditional and unclear and refused to
accept them until Iraq made clear it was promising unconditional
compliance.
	   ``Now, we will test that,'' Clinton said.
	   White House officials are highly skeptical that Saddam will keep
his word.
	   ``The balance of risk here was in favor of waiting and testing''
whether Saddam was serious about cooperating, a senior
administration official said. ``If he is not, there is plenty of
time to go forward militarily.''
	   Clinton acknowledged that ``no one can be sure'' what Saddam
will do.

Falcons take over division lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Atlanta took over first place in the NFC West
Division on Sunday, using its defense to score twice before
clinching a 31-19 victory over San Francisco on Chris Chandler's
78-yard touchdown pass to Terance Mathis.
	   The 49ers (7-3) have dominated the West since 1980 and blown out
Atlanta through most of the '90s. The Falcons (8-2) captured their
only division title 18 years ago and have been one of the league's
sorriest franchises since entering the U.S. National Football
League in 1966.
	   After Ray Buchanan set up a touchdown with an interception and
Jessie Tuggle on a fumble recovery, the Falcons gave up two long
touchdown passes by Steve Young that closed the 49ers to 24-19 with
3:09 remaining.
	   But on second-and-8 from the Falcons 22, Chandler went deep to
Mathis for the touchdown that sealed it.
 &UR; Dolphins 13, Panthers 9 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, _ Karim Abdul-Jabbar rushed for
127 yards, the best outing by a Miami player since 1996, and the
Dolphins ended a three-game road losing skid by winning at
Carolina.
	   The Dolphins (7-3), who took over first place alone in the AFC
East when the New York Jets lost, finished with season-highs of 184
yards rushing and 40 carries.
	   Miami blew fourth-quarter leads in each of its previous two road
games, but had no such problems against the Panthers (1-9).
 &UR; Colts 24, Jets 23 &QC; 
	   At Indianapolis, Peyton Manning passed for three touchdowns,
including 14 yards to tight end Marcus Pollard with 24 seconds to
go, lifting Indianapolis over New York.
	   The Colts (2-8) drove 80 yards on their final possession. Tight
end Pollard appeared stopped just short of the goal line, but
stretched his arms into the end zone before he hit the ground,
tying the game. Mike Vanderjagt, whose missed field goal at the end
of the first half led to one New York touchdown, kicked the extra
point to snap the Jets' four-game winning streak.
 &UR; Redskins 28, Eagles 3 &QC; 
	   At Landover, Maryland, Skip Hicks scored three touchdowns on
short runs, and the NFL's most generous defense held the league's
most inept offense to 215 total yards.
	   The 25-point margin of victory was the second largest in Norv
Turner's five seasons as Washington coach. Philadelphia has lost
four games by 25 or more points this season.
 &UR; Oilers 23, Steelers 14 &QC; 
	   At Nashville, Tennessee, Al Del Greco, who failed to get on the
field for a field-goal attempt in Tennessee's last home game,
kicked a 22-yarder with three seconds left that lifted the Oilers
over Pittsburgh.
	   The Oilers (6-4) tacked on a final touchdown with time expired
as the Steelers (6-4) tried to keep the ball alive off the kickoff.
They lateraled it around the field and Will Blackwell lost the ball
into the end zone, where Michael Roan fell on it.
 &UR; Vikings 24, Bengals 3 &QC; 
	   At Minneapolis, Minnesota used Dwayne Rudd's 63-yard fumble
return to break open a sloppy game against Cincinnati.
	   The Vikings (9-1) are off to their best start since the 1975
team was 10-0. The Bengals (2-8) lost for the seventh time in eight
games and are guaranteed their eighth consecutive season without a
winning record. They scored their only points on a drive that
included 35 yards in penalties against Vikings cornerback Corey
Fuller.
	   Playing just six days after surgery to remove two bone chips
from his right knee, Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham was
13-for-20 for 224 yards with a touchdown, two interceptions and a
3-yard sneak that gave Minnesota a 7-0 lead midway through the
first quarter. It was the first rushing TD by a Minnesota
quarterback in two years.
 &UR; Bills 13, Patriots 10 &QC; 
	   At Orchard Park, New York, Doug Flutie threw a touchdown pass
and jump-started Buffalo's running game against New England.
	   Flutie threw 10 yards to tight end Jay Riemersma with 1:57 left
in the third quarter for the Bills' only touchdown, capping a drive
of 47 yards. The score ended the Bills' drought of nearly seven
quarters without a touchdown, during which Steve Christie kicked
nine field goals.
 &UR; Saints 24, Rams 3 &QC; 
	   At New Orleans, Kerry Collins, making his first start for New
Orleans, drove the Saints 62 yards for a touchdown on their first
possession, capping it with a 10-yard touchdown toss to Cam
Cleeland.
	   It was the first time the Saints had scored in the first quarter
since the second game of the season. St. Louis (3-7) has now given
up 90 points in the first quarter _ the worst in the NFL.

	   The council noted that Iraq has rescinded its Aug. 5 ban on spot
weapons inspections, and its Oct. 31 decision to cut all dealings
with the Special Commission.
	   Iraq's cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA ``will allow the
return of inspectors to resume all their activities on an
immediate, unconditional and unrestricted basis,'' the council
said.
	   This was the green light that Butler had been waiting for to
order the inspectors back to Baghdad.
	   ``I'm going upstairs now to order our people back. They'll be
going back on Tuesday morning,'' Butler said as he left the council
chamber.

Owners express support for Stern in NBA lockout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On Day 136 of the American National Basketball
Association lockout, some owners talked Sunday about commissioner
David Stern and his approach to negotiating a new deal with the
players.
	   ``We call him Easy Dave,'' Donald Sterling, principal owner of
the Los Angeles Clippers, told the New York Times. ``I don't think
Stern would ever take advantage of anybody. I think he wants to
leave something on the table for everyone. I have my own ideas and
they're not consistent with Stern's.
	   ``I think some owners feel that since we create and make the
game and put up the seed money and take all the risk that perhaps
we should get a more equitable distribution of the revenue. Stern
is going soft on them.''
	   Sterling spoke despite a league-wide gag order during
negotiations. Owners are not supposed to talk about collective
bargaining or the deal that is on the table and some teams already
have been fined for violating that order. The names of the teams
and the amount of the fines were not disclosed.
	   Still, as the number of canceled games closed in on 100 and with
the earliest start of a season at least one month away, a few
frustrated owners began talking last week.
	   ``We're prepared to gut out the season,'' said Abe Pollin,
chairman of the Washington Wizards and the league's senior owner.
``We went into this knowing that if we can't make a fair deal, the
season would be gone.''
	   The league ordered the collective bargaining agreement reopened
when the players' share of revenues reached 57 percent. The owners
want a 50-50 split. The union has proposed 60-40.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   Jerry Colangelo, owner of the Phoenix Suns, said, ``I love the
game, but not at the price of another mistake.''
	   Colangelo said the roles of Stern and deputy commissioner Russ
Granik as spokesmen and negotiators for the owners were
appropriate.
	   ``I've been in this league 32 years and I care about the game,''
he said. ``It's been my passion. I believe David shares the same
passion.''
	   Another owner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he
did not share Stern's belief that high-profile agents were blocking
a deal.
	   ``I do think there is a deference to the stars in this league
that you're seeing now,'' he said. ``And if the stars don't like
the deal, everyone goes along.
	   ``Some of the owners are hurting but everybody's hurting. And
it's my perception that the owners can recuperate over time. I
don't understand how players, with limited careers, guys that may
not play for more than a few years, are going to make this money
up. It's as if 400 of them are sacrificing for the needs of a
few.''
	   Some teams spoke with players over the past 10 days to explain
details of the most recent offer the NBA made to the union. Those
contacts were cut off this weekend.

	   Calling the outcome ``satisfactory,'' Britain's U.N. Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock said: `We wish to see the unconditional delivery
of cooperation by Iraq and in the meantime we remain vigilant and
alert and that means in the sense of having the threat of force to
hand.''
	   The council had initially been divided over a response to Iraq's
offer to resume cooperation with UNSCOM, with Russia, France and
China who have been sympathetic to Baghdad's demand for a lifting
of tough economic sanctions endorsing it and the United States
rejecting it.
	   But President Bill Clinton reversed the U.S. position Sunday
after three clarifying letters from Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon
reiterated that Iraq's decision was unconditional.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement that
Clinton's ``statesmanlike response today will be welcomed by the
entire international community.''
	   He reiterated at a news conference later Saturday that he was
grateful to Clinton ``for the courageous and difficult decision''
which he announced Sunday morning.
	   ``This is a victory for all those who expressed their firm
determination that United Nations Security Council resolutions must

	   ``For the crisis to be put permanently behind us, Iraq must move
swiftly to ensure complete and unconditional compliance. This is

	   Annan warned, however, that in a future crisis, military force
might be the only way out.
	   ``Some governments have made it clear that next time around
there may not even be time for diplomatic appeals,'' Annan said in
an earlier interview with CNN.
	   Annan stepped in Sunday afternoon to defuse a potentially
serious glitch in the council over Iraq's pledge to cooperate fully
and unconditionally with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Doubts about Iraq's unconditional commitment to inspections
arose when Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told CNN that
``Iraq is only committed'' to the contents of the original letter
he sent to Annan.
	   Burleigh asked Annan to clarify whether Aziz's statement was a
repudiation of Hamdoon's letters. While the council delayed its
meeting, Hamdoon met with Annan, who telephoned Aziz while Burleigh
listened.
	   Aziz quickly clarified his position, saying his reference to the
``letter'' included the three letters of clarification from Hamdoon
to the Security Council.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said a note taken from that
telephone conversation stated that Aziz had authorized Hamdoon's
letters to the council, and that the letters ``formed part and
parcel of his letter.''
	   The note was given to the Security Council for review.

Weapons inspectors and other U.N. personnel returning to Iraq

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors and other U.N.
personnel will return to Iraq in the next two days after Iraq
agreed to resume cooperation with the inspectors unconditionally,
U.N. officials said Sunday.
	   At the end of a Security Council meeting, chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler said he was ordering the return of the
inspectors on Tuesday.
	   Earlier, Benon V. Sevan, the head of the U.N. humanitarian
program in Iraq, said all 151 U.N. humanitarian international staff
would return by Monday evening.
	   The Security Council issued a statement taking note of a letter
and clarifications from the Iraqi government that it has decided
``clearly and unconditionally'' to cooperate with the U.N. Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which are
charged with eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Taking note of past experience with Iraq, council members
underlined that their confidence in Iraq's intentions needs to be
established by unconditional and sustained cooperation with the
Special Commission and the IAEA in the full range of their
activities,'' the council said in a statement read by the current
council president, Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   The council noted that Iraq had rescinded its Aug. 5 ban on spot
weapons inspections, and its Oct. 31 decision to cut all dealings
with the Special Commission.
	   Iraq's cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA ``will allow the

Woman blinded in embassy attack hopes newborn will see for her
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Catherine Bwire touches the feathery
lashes of the newborn daughter she will never see.
	   ``One day, she will tell me about the things I am not seeing,''
the shy young woman says. ``I will see the world through her
eyes.''
	   Eleven weeks before giving birth, Catherine was blinded in the
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. When her world
went black, only the fluttering of the child in her womb gave her
the will to live.
	   ``When I was told I was blind, I felt I was now useless in this
world,'' she says. ``My baby has really encouraged me because I
thought, I've lost my sight, but I still have the baby.''
	   She beams a broad, crooked smile toward tiny Jean Bahati
Lukhoba.
	   The baby has earned her middle name, Swahili for luck _ luck she
had in surviving, luck she has brought her mother.
	   ___
	   At 10:39 a.m. Aug. 7, Catherine, 25, was at her clerk's desk in
the federal teachers' agency on the 13th floor of a downtown bank
building. A bang outside drew workers to the windows in curiosity _
just in time to catch the force of a much larger explosion, a car
bomb, that turned the windows' glass and metal to shrapnel.
	   ``It felt as if the front of my face was sliced off,'' she says.
``Already, I could not see.''
	   Clinging to her boss's dress, she stumbled down stairs jammed
with other casualties. She heard glass crunch beneath her shoes;
she felt the handrail slick with blood.
	   Weakening on the third floor, she felt a man ``wearing rough
clothing and gumboots'' lift her onto his back and carry her to the
street.
	   ``There was a lot of noise,'' she recalls. ``People were
screaming. Ambulance sirens were going.'' Choking clouds of smoke
carried the stench of burning flesh.
	   At Nairobi Hospital, surgeons plucked glass shards from
Catherine's neck, chest, arms and legs. But her belly was
unscathed. Before passing out, her head swathed in bandages, she
remembers thinking, ``but the baby is OK.''
	   Other women were not so lucky _ five bombing victims on her ward
alone miscarried.
	   For days, Catherine clung to hope she would see again.
	   ``I thought when the doctor removed the bandages I would be able
to see. Two days later he did, but I was not able.
	   ``Then I thought I would be able to see when he removed my
stitches. Some days later, he did. I still was not able.''
	   Catherine's chocolate-drop eyes, so badly damaged, were removed.
Her long hair, filled with glass, was shorn. Her face is a maze of
scars.
	   Blindness, Catherine laments, ``is a world of no beauty. It's
boring. You can't admire how you look, and you don't know how other
people are dressed.''
	   But she says she's learning sensitivity to textures and rhythms:
``It's like I'm using the sense of touch to see. It's becoming
stronger.''
	   ___
	   The blow of Catherine's injuries ripples out to loved ones.
	   ``At first, my husband was very distraught. He didn't want
anyone to talk to him,'' Catherine says.
	   ``I feel angry about the whole thing,'' Henry Lukhoba, 32,
acknowledges. He struggles with hatred he says he feels for all
Muslims, whom he blames for his wife's injuries and the deaths of
213 people in Nairobi. Eleven died in a simultaneous embassy
bombing in neighboring Tanzania.
	   U.S. authorities believe Osama bin Laden, Saudi exile and
militant Muslim, masterminded the bombings. Two weeks ago, a
238-count indictment unsealed in New York City charged bin Laden
and a cohort with murder and conspiracy. Three alleged
co-conspirators are already jailed in New York.
	   Henry's distress worries his young wife.
	   ``Henry can see maybe the situation is difficult to handle and
maybe he will divorce me,'' Catherine says.
	   In Africa, when a spouse becomes disabled, ``it is quite common
for couples to divorce,'' says Mary Kimathi, an officer with the
Kenya Society for the Blind. ``In our culture, disabled people are
not looked on favorably. The question becomes, did they really
marry for better, for worse?''
	   Henry is a warehouseman with no permanent job. Catherine's
monthly pay of 5,700 shillings, less than dlrs 100, was their
steady income.
	   Catherine's father, George Albert Bwire, complains bitterly
about losing that paycheck. Catherine was helping pay school fees
for five younger brothers and sisters.
	   ``She was hardworking and the breadwinner of the family,'' Bwire
says. ``We deserve help.''
	   Some help has come. Besides dlrs 1,670 Catherine will likely
collect as compensation, she and Henry have moved from a one-room,
tin-roofed shack to a two-bedroom suburban apartment rented by
foreign donors. One year was the period agreed to allow Catherine
time to breastfeed Jean, retrain and find a new job.

	   Being blinded cost Catherine more than job skills.
	   ``When you lose your vision you are like a child again. You no
longer know how to walk, bathe, dress, eat or talk,'' Kimathi says.
	   The explosion completely blinded 25 people and left more than 75
with severely impaired vision. All face huge difficulties in Kenya,
which has neither guide dogs _ few families could afford to feed
one _ nor such simple aids as sidewalk warning bumps.
	   Initially, Catherine shuffled about timidly, waving her arms in
search of walls or furniture. Now, by focusing on what her feet
feel, she can follow a path through a grassy yard or a carpet down
a hallway. Later, she will learn to use a cane.
	   At home, Catherine has relearned other skills: washing her hair,
making a bed, peeling carrots and washing potatoes so she can help
prepare meals. But her most pressing concerns are finding work and
caring for Jean.
	   ``I'm scared,'' Catherine says. ``It's another life that I'll be
responsible for.''
	   To learn more, Catherine spent two weeks at an institute for the
blind. Practicing on a doll, she learned to bathe and diaper a
baby. Trickiest was dressing the doll. Baby clothing is so
confusing, Catherine says, recalling how she fumbled to find the
right openings. Which for the head? Which for the arm?
	   She also learned Braille. Painstakingly, she pushed bead-topped
pins into soft wood to practice writing her name: ``C, positions
one and four. A, position one.''
	   ___
	   Today, more confident in her skills and finished with her anger,
Catherine says she still feels lost. Her dream of a secretarial
career was shattered, and she doesn't know where to start again.
	   A telephone operator, perhaps, ``because it's only sound,'' she
muses.
	   Kimathi tells Catherine she's aiming too low and urges her to
consider computers, social work or public relations. She suggests a
college degree.
	   But resources are meager. Kenya has no Braille computer to help
her studies.
	   ``I still cannot see my future, except I am seeing it will be
difficult,'' she says. ``But it will be possible.''
	   Catherine's beacon is the Oct. 27 birth of her daughter.
	   With her fingertips, she traces the snail-shell curves of Jean
Bahati's ears, the soft curls on her head, her long legs, then
flashes that crooked smile.
	   ``I had forgotten,'' she says, ``how it was to be happy.''

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks advance in early

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Monday in Tokyo on growing expectations the Federal Reserve won't
cut interest rates at a policy-making meeting this week. Japanese
stocks advanced.
	   The dollar bought 122.38 yen in early trading, up 0.70 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 122.72 yen
on Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 98.09 points,
or 0.69 percent, to 14,366.30 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the average closed 193.15 points higher, or
1.37 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar held its strength from Friday's
trading in New York, where new government data showed some strength
in the U.S. economy.
	   That may keep the Fed from lowering interest rates for a third
time this year when its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday.
	   The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales, which
account for a third of the country's economic activity, rose 1
percent to a seasonally adjusted dlrs 227 billion in October.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened sharply higher Monday
amid expectations the government's latest economic stimulus package
announced Monday would be larger than expected.
	   Kyodo News, quoting government sources, said Sunday the package
would likely total about 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196.7 billion),
including nearly 7 trillion yen (dlrs 57.4 billion) in income and
corporate tax cuts to be implemented next year.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 7.49 percent, 0.68 percent, to 1,100.01 points. The
TOPIX closed up 10.59 points, or 0.98 percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.805 percent from Friday's 0.815 percent, driving its
price up to 108.85 yen from 108.75 yen.

Japanese Cabinet approves record stimulus plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet approved a record economic stimulus
package worth more than 23 trillion yen (dlrs 188 billion) Monday
in a bid to spend the country out of its worst recession in
decades.
	   The approval comes after the government outlined a plan last
Thursday for 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in new spending and
tax cuts, which was immediately panned by critics as insufficient.
	   Apparently shaken by the criticism that the plan would not be
enough to resuscitate the economy, officials began dropping hints
the next day that the package would likely be bigger.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi sees the package as his best change
to stop the economy from contracting for a third consecutive year _
a key pledge made after taking office in July.
	   Obuchi said the package would include more than 17 trillion yen
(dlrs 139 billion) in spending projects and more than 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 49 billion) in tax cuts.
	   Following the Cabinet's approval, the plan is expected to be
passed later this month in a special session of Parliament.
	   Japan has come under strong international pressure to pull its
economy, the world's second largest, out of a prolonged slump and
to help Asian economies hit by a major financial crisis to get back
on track.
	   Monday's package comes on the heels of legislation passed last
month by Parliament aimed at rejuvenating Japan's banking system
saddled with huge amounts of bad loans.

	   EPSOM, England (AP) _ Matthew Morris-Steward shinnies up a tree,
swings his legs over a branch and looks down cockily from inside
his treehouse.
	   It seems the most natural thing in the world for an 11-year-old
boy to be doing on a balmy, fall morning. But Matthew is up there
to make a point.
	   He calls himself an ``eco-warrior,'' and instead of attending
school, he travels throughout southern England with a growing
network of environmental activists who literally take to the trees
when their neighborhood canvassing and petitions fail to get
results.
	   The activists say they will do anything _ burrow underground or
chain themselves to trees _ to block development and turn a local
environmental cause into a front-page story. Often, their actions
lead to arrest.
	   ``They have been a key environmental force in this country,''
says Tony Juniper, policy and campaigns director for the
conservation group Friends of the Earth. ``What they do is
challenge the public, in a forceful way, through TV screens and
newspapers, to take a view one way or another.''
	   For many of the activists, protesting is a full-time job; they
move from one demonstration to another.
	   While eco-warriors are not just a British phenomenon, Britons
have particularly warmed to them, perhaps because of the romantic
view many English hold about their countryside.
	   ``I have been absolutely thrilled with them,'' says Gillian
Tiplady, who lives in Epsom, a conservative suburb southwest of
London, where Matthew and a handful of other eco-warriors set up
camp May 1.
	   Miss Tiplady and her neighbors had campaigned for two years to
preserve a scruffy, three-acre (1.2-hectare) lot of century-old
trees, overgrown grass and knee-high brush near the town hall. But
last spring, when the town's plan to bulldoze some of the trees and
build a road gathered momentum, the local activists sought help.
	   ``Someone knew some 'eco-people' and made a call,'' says Miss
Tiplady, whose home faces the lot. ``We didn't know what to
expect.''
	   Matthew and his fellow environmentalists soon arrived in vans
and rusty, old pickups. They declared squatters' rights, raised
treetop shelters and dug tunnels to ensure that a forced eviction
would be difficult and expensive for the town.
	   Activists shuttled in and out, and campfires burned at night. A
handpainted sign was propped up near the sidewalk, seeking supplies
like bedding, food, tools and locks. Journalists came in droves to
interview Matthew.
	   Epsom Council immediately sought permission to evict the
squatters. A judge granted the order, but the environmentalists
appealed, claiming Epsom would be violating the 1990 International
Convention of Children's Rights by forcing Matthew from his new
home.
	   The environmentalists lost their appeal Oct. 2, but they vow to
remain. And town officials concede any eviction process _ because
of the tunnels and tree huts _ will be expensive and lengthy.
	   ``If they weren't here, that park would not still be here,''
Miss Tiplady says. ``They are the only thing standing in the way.''
	   Epsom Council, however, contends the eco-warriors have damaged
the grove they are fighting to protect with their tunnels and
treetop homes.
	   The only thing both sides agree on is that eco-warriors are fast
becoming media celebrities. Matthew has even informally sought
advice from a London public relations guru who once represented
O.J. Simpson.
	   Freddie Williams, 80, who lives outside Epsom, would like to see
the trees stay, but disagrees with some of the eco-warriors'
tactics _ particularly the promotion of Matthew, ``that little boy
who really should be in school.''
	   Matthew, who stopped attending school regularly at age 8, can
neither read nor write.
	   Since he arrived at the camp with his mother, Lorraine, and
older brother, 13-year-old Luke, he has been at the center of the
media storm, only rarely taking a weekend off to travel to the
family's home in Kingston.
	   Though this is his third environmental protest, it the first
where he has been at the forefront. He has appeared on the front
page of most national papers and joined his mother on a TV talk
show.
	   ``The point is we are not using him,'' says Nigel Veal, who
lives in Epsom and worked closely with the eco-warriors to frame
their court appeal. ``There is no adult pulling the strings. And
don't just assume that Matthew is a five-minute wonder. In 10
years, he will be one of the world's leading environmentalists.''
	   ``Of course, it would be a great help if he could read and
write,'' adds Veal, who is acting as Matthew's tutor.
	   Asked about his high profile, Matthew _ who prefers to be called
by his ``earth name, 'Gen. Survival''' _ merely pushes his long,
scraggly hair out of his eyes and shrugs his shoulders.
	   ``He is much happier here, and he is learning something new
every day,'' says his mother, who has not worked in 15 years and
has no plans to send her son back to school. ``This is what he
wants to do.''
	   When asked why, Matthew shrugs again. ``'Cause it is better,''
he finally says. Pressed to expand on that answer, he says after a
long pause: ``It is good to save trees really. They give us
oxygen.''

Looking for development, peace in Guatemala's war-torn villages

	   MAYALAN, Guatemala (AP) _ Bickering between former guerrillas
and people who sided with the army during Guatemala's civil war has
long strangled development in this remote jungle village.
	   Plans by foreign aid groups for a water project, a farm project,
cement-block houses and more were canceled in recent years as
pro-government factions refused to approve programs they saw as
pro-rebel.
	   ``They shouted down women's projects. They shouted down
development projects,'' said community elder Alfonso Monzon,
recalling uproars over a basketball court and a day-care center.
	   ``They would say: `These people are no good. They were
guerrillas. They were involved in the war,' '' Monzon said.
``Foreign agencies saw that if they helped that side, they would
anger this one; if they helped this side, they would anger that
one.''
	   Finally, the U.S. Agency for International Development found
something both sides wanted: a 130-foot (40-meter) steel trestle
spanning the Pescado River to link impoverished Mayalan with the
rest of the Central American nation.
	   The span, which opened in June, is part of a four-year, dlrs 4.1
million project in which the U.S. agency is building up to 10
bridges and repairing about 100 miles (175 kilometers) of gravel
road to improve access and allow export of goods from the
long-ignored Ixcan region of northern Guatemala.
	   All the better, villagers say, if the bridges also unite divided
communities in their struggle to improve lives.
	   ``This bridge is going to help this community,'' said Rodrigo
Montejo, a Mayalan resident. ``We hope it will bring materials for
houses and a water system, as it has now brought materials for the
school and health clinic,''
	   Montejo is a former guerrilla who became Mayalan's community
president after the 36-year civil war ended in December 1996. He
was ousted later because of what other villagers said were his
leftist sympathies.
	   Despite the peace accord that ended the war, such squabbling and
suspicions remain common in the remote communities of Ixcan.
	   The region has long been neglected by the central government and
it suffered greatly during the decades of guerrilla war. Now, many
former rebels and government supporters live side by side in the
same communities.
	   Once, no one lived in Ixcan's pristine jungles. Then in the
1950s land-poor farmers began moving in even though the area is
plagued by thin soil and endemic tropical diseases.
	   When the civil war raged in the 1970s and 1980s, four army
battalions controlled Ixcan's eastern half. The rebel Guerrilla
Army of the Poor controlled the west.
	   Thousands of settlers caught in the middle took refuge in
neighboring Mexico. Thousands more were killed, many of them in the
estimated 52 massacres committed in Ixcan over the years _ most of
them by soldiers or their civilian paramilitaries.
	   Nationwide, the conflict left 200,000 people dead or missing.
Hatreds born during that time remain.
	   In Mayalan, the infighting flared in May 1997 when a half-dozen
of the community's estimated 400 residents publicly admitted they
had fought with leftist rebels. Afterward, any project they
proposed was turned down.
	   Then came the idea for a bridge.
	   Separated from the rest of the province by 9,000-foot
(2,750-meter) mountains, Mayalan's only access to the world was a
pot-holed, bandit-plagued road that meandered to the east, away
from the capital, Guatemala City, to the south.
	   Mayalan is one of more than 160 communities in 620 square miles
(1,600 square kilometers) that share four police officers, three
high schools and one health center.
	   But villagers hope the Mayalan bridge will change that.
	   The coffee-colored river that the new bridge spans is only 12
feet (about 4 meters) wide and about 4 feet (a little more than 1
meter) deep. But during the rainy season, from April to November,
it swells to depths of 20 feet (6 meters) and becomes impassable
except by small boat.
	   Before the bridge, Monzon said, ``We had to walk (about a mile)
at 3 a.m. in the mud to get to the river to cross and meet the
trucks on the other side. Sometimes goods fell in.''
	   The bridge allows traffic to reach the village, such as the
trucks that brought building materials for a new school and clinic.
During a recent malaria outbreak, doctors drove in to distribute
medicine.
	   Nature can still intrude, though. When Hurricane Mitch hit
Central America in early November, the USAID bridges escaped
unharmed but flooding damaged some of the new roads leading to
them.
	   Another bridge was recently completed over the snaking, brown
Tzeja River in nearby La Trinitaria, a palm-thatched village 95
miles (150 kilometers) north of Guatemala City as the crow flies,
but 200 miles (320 kilometers) by winding road.
	   Regional leader Carlos Osler said the 150-foot (45-meter) bridge
is a new beginning for La Trinitaria.
	   Even before President Alvaro Arzu finished his speech
inaugurating the bridge in late September, representatives from at
least nine communities presented petitions to have the proposed
road extended to their villages.
	   In another project, USAID is spending dlrs 5.5 million in Ixcan
to help grow crops like pineapples and hearts of palm as a way to
bring desperately needed cash to residents of the region.
	   ``Because of the war, we lost a great deal,'' Osler said. ``We
lost houses. We lost crops. We lost animals. We were left with
nothing.
	   ``We know we cannot recover what was lost. But there is hope.''

With food imports falling, Russian farms try to fill the gap

	   RZHAVKI, Russia (AP) _ Whether they're pouring feed in the
henhouse or sipping coffee in the director's office, workers at the
Plemptitsa poultry plant bundle up in padded jackets and boots
against the autumn chill.
	   The onetime flagship of Russian broiler chicken production can't
afford to keep the heat on to warm the 70 employees. It's working
at only one-third capacity. Several decaying buildings sit empty,
surrounded by overgrown grass.
	   Russia's farms were in dire shape even before the country's
economic crisis hit in August, and the latest turmoil could be a
fatal blow to some operations.
	   Yet the crisis also represents an opportunity for Russian farms.
Imported food is now too expensive for most Russians, and any
domestic farm that can get more of its goods to market is likely to
win a new lease on life.
	   Can the farms meet the challenge?
	   Russia is the largest country in the world, and has large tracts
of fertile land. Yet the Soviet farming system was hugely
unproductive and there has been little agriculture reform since the
Soviet Union collapsed.
	   Russian farm output fell 36 percent from 1990 to last year, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says. And
production was off 55 percent at large farms of more than 100
hectares (250 acres) _ the former collective farms of the Soviet
era that occupy most of Russia's arable land.
	   ``We've never experienced anything like this before, even in the
(World War II) years,'' mourned Alexei Zinchenko, a statistics
professor at Moscow's Timiryazev Agricultural Academy.
	   This summer's drought made things worse. The grain harvest, down
nearly half from last year, will be the worst in four decades.
	   ``The land is dying, and there are no programs for preserving or
developing fertility. ... Only 5 percent of land is irrigated, and
that means there's absolutely no insurance for bad years,''
Zinchenko said.
	   Zinchenko blamed the farming decline on the sudden withdrawal of
government financing, and the flood of imports that knocked Russian
food products out of the competition.
	   With American and Dutch chicken imports gobbling up the market,
Russian chicken production has fallen to just 200,000 tons yearly
since 1993 _ compared with 1.7 million tons previously.
	   Zinchenko said the decline in agriculture was also due to what
he called a mistaken reorientation to small, private farms to
replace the huge collectives of the Soviet era.
	   Advocates for the approximately 280,000 small farms, which
occupy about 6 percent of Russia's arable land, counter that
they've been better able to adjust than the Soviet-era mammoths.
	   ``The big farms really don't use inputs efficiently at all,''
said Gregory Mohrman, Moscow director of the Rural Development
Institute of the University of Washington.
	   All farms, big and small, are struggling to find financing.
	   State subsidies are largely gone, and what little, high-interest
credit was available to farms has dried up. The costs of feed,
fertilizers and farm equipment have skyrocketed. Transactions are
increasingly in barter rather than cash. Farmers are falling deeper
into debt.
	   For most farms, private financing is out of the question, partly
because of their dismal record and partly because it takes a long
time for an investment to show any return.
	   But chicken is an exception, because an investor can
theoretically get his money back relatively quickly. Investors have
moved into all five poultry plants in the Moscow region.
	   An import-export company has helped the Plemptitsa broiler
business, although Lev Kroik, the Plemptitsa director, refused to
name the company.
	   ``They pay part of the salaries'' of 800 rubles (dlrs 47) a
month, he said. ``I can't say that the salary level suits us, but
we pay on time.''
	   The partners had agreed on a dlrs 1 million (17 million rubles)
plan for getting the entire plant, with its 3,000-ton potential
annual output of broilers, back into operation within three years.
	   The August financial crisis has put that plan on hold, however,
because Plemptitsa's partner can't get its money out of the bank.
For now, the operation is limited to three henhouses, where 30,000
chickens live 12 to a cage.
	   ``We had great plans,'' Kroik said, sitting in an office stuffed
with feed samples, dusty cans of luncheon meat and posters bearing
testimonials to the health-boosting benefits of quail eggs. ``Today
we have big problems.''
	   Still, he sees opportunities that didn't exist before the
crisis.
	   Plemptitsa is selling every bird it raises, and a major Moscow
supermarket chain is clamoring for more _ and continuing to pay the
top price, about 25 rubles a kilogram (62 cents a pound).
	   ``People are beginning to reorient themselves to Russian
products and realize they're not bad at all,'' said Elena Tyurina,
an analyst at the Institute for Agrarian Market Trends, a market
research company.

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ The names have changed, but the
results stay the same. Russia is ruling the skating ranks this year
even without its Olympic champions.
	   Yelena Sokolova's victory Sunday sealed a perfect 4-for-4
showing by a Russian team of veterans and rookies at the Nations
Cup, the third event of the International Skating Union's Grand
Prix series. The Russians have won eight of 12 Grand Prix events
this season.
	   This week the scene shifts to Paris for the Lalique Trophy
competition. In two weeks the skaters head to the Cup of Russia in
St. Petersburg followed by the NHK trophy in Japan.
	   In Gelsenkirchen, world champions Alexei Yagudin and Angelika
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won the men's and ice dance events to
continue the Russian domination.
	   Russian newcomers like Sokolova and pair Maria Petrova and
Alexei Tikhonov also contributed to the dominant showing. It was
Sokolova's first major international victory.
	   Perhaps most amazing, Olympic champions Ilia Kulik and Pasha
Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov did not compete. Nagano pairs champions
Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev are also bypassing the Grand
Prix series.
	   Sokolova took over after a lackluster showing by European
champion Maria Butyrskaya, who had a poor short program and a
poorer long program but salvaged third place.
	   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski now ineligible and world
champion Michelle Kwan taking the year off from these competitions,
the women's field is wide open this year.
	   Sokolova may move into the void. She was second at Skate
American two weeks ago behind Butyrskaya, although many felt
Sokolova skated better.
	   With two-time European champion Irina Slutskaya also around for
Russia, along with two world junior champions, Sokolova realizes
that it will be difficult at the national competition at the
beginning of January.
	   ``There are a lot of good girls now in Russia and a victory here
doesn't guarantee anything,'' Sokolova said. ``But I don't want to
beat anyone. I just want to skate well.''
	   Yagudin has now won four competitions in four weeks. He showed a
quadruple jump in his victory in Gelsenkirchen.
	   Teammate Alexander Abt just missed quads in the short and long
programs.
	   Abt is another skater who would be probably be another country's
best skater but is hard-pressed to even make the Russian
championship team. There are at least five Russian skaters doing
quads.
	   ``It might be more difficult to finish among the best three
skaters at the Russian championships than at the Europeans,'' Abt
said. ``It will depend how we skate and the national federation
will have the last say in the matter.''
	   Abt should know. He was fourth at last year's Russian
championships. When Kulik skipped last year's, Europeans the
Russian Federation added him to the team and he came in third
behind two Russians _ Yagudin and Yevgeny Pluschenko _ but ahead of
others, like Olympics bronze medalist Philippe Candeloro of France.
	   In the ice dance, world champions Krylova and Ovsiannikov won,
despite a controversial routine to the banging of bongo drums
without any music.
	   ``But we are world champions and I think we can take risks and
try something new,'' Krylova said.

Italian priest freed by kidnappers in the Philippines

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada announced
Monday that an abducted Italian priest has been freed unharmed by
kidnappers in the southern Philippines after more than two months
of captivity.
	   The kidnappers handed over the Rev. Luciano Benedetti to Muslim
rebels belonging to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a thickly
forested area in southern Zamboanga province late Sunday.
	   The rebels then turned the priest over to government officials.
	   ``This is good news. Father Benedetti was not hurt. He's strong
and we greeted each other over the phone,'' Estrada told a Manila
radio station.
	   Officials plan to escort Benedetti to a meeting with Estrada
before the Philippine leader flies to Malaysia later Monday for a
summit of Pacific Rim nations.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Treviso, was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected
Muslim rebels in Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, and his
kidnappers have demanded a ransom of 10 million pesos (dlrs
250,000), officials and rebel leaders have said.
	   Several other people remain in the hands of different groups of
kidnappers, including the family of a Taiwanese businessman, a pair
of Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian, all kidnapped in the
southern Mindanao region.
	   Al Haj Murad, the vice chairman of the MILF for military
affairs, said the MILF secured Benedetti's release without paying a
ransom. Government sources, however, said an unspecified amount of
ransom was paid to the kidnappers.
	   Murad said the kidnappers, who included former Muslim rebels and
company security guards, were allowed to escape after releasing the
priest.
	   Another MILF leader, Ghazali Jaafar, said MILF rebels surrounded
the kidnappers' lair then pressured them into giving up Benedetti
peacefully. ``We made sure no shots would be fired. We didn't want
the priest to be hurt,'' he said.
	   Fellow missionaries of Benedetti's in the Pontifical Institute
for Foreign Missions, a worldwide society of missionaries, were
ecstatic about Benedetti's release and said his abduction would not
scare them into leaving the Philippines.
	   ``There is one thing which is very clear and that is we will
stay. Two of our people had been killed in the past, do you think
we were scared of that?'' said the Rev. Giampiero Bruni, who is
based in southern Zamboanga province.
	   An Italian priest, the Rev. Carzedda Salvatore was killed in an
ambush in Zamboanga in 1992 and another, the Rev. Tulio Favali was
killed in 1985 by an anti-communist vigilante group. Both belong to
the institute, which has 17 missionaries in the volatile southern
region of Mindanao.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling
the central government in an attempt to establish a separate
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   It is involved in on-and-off peace negotiations with Manila and
has promised to help the government combat rampant kidnappings in
Mindanao, although the military says the rebels might be involved
in some abductions.
	   Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign against the
kidnappings and scored a major victory last month with the rescue
of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors in
Manila.
	   He promised upon taking office in June to end the kidnappings
within six months.

Japanese Cabinet approves record stimulus plan

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet approved a record economic stimulus
package worth more than 23 trillion yen (dlrs 188 billion) Monday
in a bid to spend the country out of its worst recession in
decades.
	   The approval comes after the government outlined a plan last
Thursday for 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in new spending and
tax cuts, which was immediately panned by critics as insufficient.
	   Apparently shaken by the criticism that the plan would not be
enough to resuscitate the economy, officials began dropping hints
the next day that the package would likely be bigger.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi sees the package as his best change
to stop the economy from contracting for a third consecutive year _
a key pledge made after taking office in July.
	   ``We must do all we can to cut the vicious cycle of recession in
order to put the nation's economy back into recovery,'' Obuchi told
reporters after the Cabinet decision, saying the package was aimed
at providing economic growth within one or two years.
	   Obuchi said the package would include more than 17 trillion yen
(dlrs 139 billion) in spending projects and more than 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 49 billion) in tax cuts.
	   The plan is expected to be passed later this month in a special
session of Parliament.
	   Japan has come under strong international pressure to pull its
economy, the world's second largest, out of a prolonged slump and
to help Asian economies hit by a major financial crisis to get back
on track.
	   Monday's package comes on the heels of legislation passed last
month by Parliament aimed at rejuvenating Japan's banking system
saddled with huge amounts of bad loans.

Norman returns to golf with a bang
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THOUSAND OAKS, California (AP) _ This was supposed to be a slow,
easy return to golf for Greg Norman, sidelined the past seven
months after surgery on his left shoulder. But then, Norman has
never been satisfied with just showing up.
	   He was making every putt in sight and quickly making up ground
on the leaders in the final round of the Shark Shootout when his
wife drove up in a cart to watch on the eighth hole.
	   ``He would love to come straight out and win,'' Laura Norman
said. ``That's just Greg's nature.''
	   With a little help from partner Steve Elkington, Norman returned
in style Sunday.
	   Norman forced a playoff with an 8-foot (2.5-meter) birdie on the
18th hole, then won the Shark Shootout on the third sudden-death
hole when Elkington, his partner, hit a 9-iron into 2 feet (60 cms)
on the same hole.
	   ``I'm glad he's back,'' Elkington said. ``And I'm glad we won.''
	   Norman and Elkington closed with a 58 in the scramble format to
tie the team of John Cook and Peter Jacobsen, who tied a tournament
record with a 17-under 55. Both finished at 27-under 189.
	   Norman didn't have to win this week to feel good about his game.
His left shoulder felt strong throughout the 54-hole event, his
putting was superb at times and he came up with his share of big
shots throughout the day.
	   ``Under the gun, I felt pretty good,'' he said.
	   But the closing holes belonged to Elkington, who himself missed
his share of golf this year with a litany of illnesses and injury.
	   Elkington's 8-iron into 8 feet (2.5 meters) set up the playoff,
the first in the 10-year history of the Franklin Templeton Shark
Shootout. On the first playoff hole, Elkington hit his approach
into 10 feet (3 meters). Norman made that one, too, a big putt
coming after Cook's 20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt.
	   Both teams made short birdie putts on the 385-yard (350 meters)
10th hole, and they returned to the 18th for the third time in
about an hour.
	   Norman, who had put his two previous approach shots into the
front bunker, this time landed safely in the middle of the green,
and Elkington took the suspense out of it by sticking yet another
one close.
	   ``I knew I had a good horse, but I had to pull my weight, too,''
Norman said. ``It was a very satisfying week.''
	   Norman and Elkington each won dlrs 160,000 from the dlrs 1.3
million purse.
	   More importantly for Norman, it was a huge first step toward
making a strong return to golf. He'll play the Skins Game at the
end of the month, and then two events that will matter a little bit
more _ the Australian Open, followed by the Presidents Cup.
	   ``It's good to come back,'' Norman said. ``It's good to feel the
internal feelings that you feel. I'm pretty happy with the way I've
come back.''
	   Norman, the tournament host, won for the first time in its
10-year history. He certainly picked the right partner to make a
victorious return _ Elkington won the team competition for the
third time in five years with his third partner.
	   Jacobsen and Cook made four eagles in their round of 17-under
55, which tied the tournament record set in 1993 by Norman and Nick
Price. They birdied the last two holes and then had to wait about
40 minutes to see if the 189 would stand.
	   For a while, it looked like it wouldn't.
	   Norman and Elkington complemented each other beautifully
throughout the round _ Elkington hitting it stiff on the front nine
and Norman making every putt, the roles reversed on the back nine.
	   Norman made three birdie putts over 15 feet (5 meters) on the
front nine. In fact, Norman was so pure with the putter that
Elkington's first contribution with the short stick was a 6-foot (2
meters) eagle putt on the 11th hole.
	   After a three-putt par from 50 feet (15 meters) on the par-5
13th, Norman hit into 6 feet (2 meters) on each of the next two
holes for two more birdies _ both made by Elkington _ and they were
in good shape to wrap it up when Elkington hit his approach on the
par-5 16th to 8 feet.
	   But again, neither of them could make the eagle putt, and they
both missed from about 20 feet (6 meters) on the 17th.
	   Norman had said that the pressure shots was the one thing he had
missed during his seven-month hiatus from golf, and there were
plenty of situations Sunday with mixed results.
	   Needing a birdie on the 18th to force a playoff, Norman's 7-iron
came off heavy and drifted right and short, into a bunker.
Elkington hit a hard 8-iron into 8 feet (2.5 meters), and Norman
finally rose to the occasion by making the putt.
	   ``I felt the rush you need to feel, all these aspects of the
game that you remember,'' Norman said.
	   It didn't take long to remember what it's like to win.

Latest developments in Iraqi crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Iraq, Clinton-Iraq Endgame &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Developments Sunday in the crisis with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspectors:
	   ___
	   President Bill Clinton says Iraq must cooperate unconditionally
with U.N. weapons inspectors or Saddam Hussein could again face the
military strikes he avoided this weekend by agreeing to work with
the United Nations.
	   Clinton said Iraq must allow inspectors ``unfettered access'' to
view any site they wish; it must turn over all relevant documents
on chemical and biological weapons production; and it must not
interfere with the inspectors themselves.
	   ___
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen says the U.S. military will
``maintain a steady force'' in the region ``that is more than
adequate to deal with Saddam Hussein.''
	   ___
	   Iraq declares itself the victor in the dispute, with Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan saying Iraq had been able ``to prove
to the whole world that our views are correct'' and the United
States was misguided.
	   ___
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler says inspectors to
return to Iraq on Tuesday.
	   ___
	   The U.N. Security Council welcomes Iraq's promise to to
cooperate with U.N. inspectors, but U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan warns that in a future crisis, military force might be the
only way out.
	   ___
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, says
Saddam had stopped his government's cooperation with the inspectors
out of frustration over U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq, but
the resulting international pressure forced a change of strategy.

Justice at last in case involving atrocities against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Developing from court hearing set to begin at 0900 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos staffing &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The alleged atrocities stand out
for their horror, the alleged victims for their ethnic backgrounds.
	   In the latest case before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, the
U.N. court is passing judgment in the first trial dealing with
atrocities against the Bosnian Serbs. The Serbs have been blamed
for the vast majority of the war crimes committed during the 3
1/2-year conflict.
	   The verdicts, which were expected Monday, come as Serb
authorities in Yugoslavia accuse the U.N. tribunal of being
anti-Serb as its prosecutors seek to investigate alleged atrocities
in troubled Kosovo province.
	   Monday's proceedings ended the marathon 20-month trial of three
Muslims and a Bosnian Croat charged with war crimes and crimes
against humanity in the murder, torture and rape of Bosnian Serb
inmates at the Celebici prison camp in 1992.
	   Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of 10 years for Zejnil
Delalic, a Muslim charged with having overall control of the
Bosnian government-run camp.
	   They asked for tougher punishment for the three others: 20 years
for Croat camp commander Zdravko Mucic; life imprisonment for
deputy commander Hazim Delic, a Muslim, with a recommendation that
he serve at least 35 years; and a life sentence with a minimum of
25 years served for Muslim guard Esad Landzo.
	   Life imprisonment is the maximum sentence at the U.N. court,
which has no death penalty. In an effort to speed up justice at the
tribunal, prosecutors were allowed to make their sentencing
requests before the judges began deliberations.
	   If found guilty, Delalic and Mucic will become the first
defendants convicted for ``command responsibility,'' an attempt to
bring to justice those in authority who either ordered atrocities
or knowingly failed to prevent them.
	   Landzo, who was convicted of an unrelated murder in Bosnia
before being extradited to the tribunal, has admitted to two of the
five murders in his indictment.
	   Delic also has a prior murder conviction in Bosnia, but he,
Mucic and Delalic have denied any involvement in crimes carried out
at Celebici, a former Yugoslav Army base in central Bosnia.
	   During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122
witnesses _ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed
against Serbs in the area.
	   Inmates were beaten to death by guards wielding baseball bats,
wooden planks and rifle butts, according to testimony. Others were
set on fire, raped and forced to commit sexual acts with members of
their own family.
	   The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts
that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner was
beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a
witness claimed.
	   ``It is hard to comprehend the depravity of the accused and
others who inflicted such treatment,'' prosecutors told the
three-judge panel in their written sentencing recommendations.
	   Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic for
humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some
prisoners and releasing others.
	   The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has
convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb
Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing
and torturing Muslims in 1992.
	   Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the
tribunal two more convictions while sparing it the need for trials.

Hale Irwin wins Senior Match Play Challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALM DESERT, California (AP) _ Hale Irwin has won his third
tournament in eight days, crushing Senior PGA Tour rival Gil Morgan
6 and 5 in the finals of the inaugural Senior Match Play Challenge.
	   Irwin, who defeated David Graham 6 and 4 in the morning
semifinals, earned dlrs 240,000 for the win Sunday at Bighorn Golf
Club in Palm Desert.
	   Earlier in the week, he had won the Senior Tour Championship and
was a member of the winning senior tour team in the Wendy's
Three-Tour Challenge. Irwin's eight-day earnings reached dlrs
687,000.
	   ``If there was ever a day to save your best, this was it,''
Irwin said. ``My timing was perfect.''
	   In his 27 holes Sunday, 14 against Graham and 13 against Morgan,
Irwin made 12 birdies and one eagle. Twice he didn't have to finish
a hole, as Graham and Morgan each conceded a hole before reaching
the green.
	   ``I didn't play very well and Hale played well,'' said Morgan,
who earned dlrs 120,000. ``I anticipated he'd play well. I thought
he might be keyed up for it.''
	   Irwin and Morgan swapped wins on the first two holes of the
finals, but Irwin eagled the par-5 third to take the lead for good.
Morgan tried to force a second shot onto the green of the par-5
sixth and instead found a lake, leading to an Irwin win.
	   Irwin won the seventh with a short birdie putt, then made a
20-footer (6-meter shot) for another birdie and a win on the ninth
for a four-hole lead.
	   Irwin quickly closed out the match on the back nine, winning the
par-4 11th when Morgan failed to match Irwin's birdie and the par-5
12th when Morgan took a non-playable lie in the nearby desert and
couldn't reach the green in 4.
	   The duo, who combined for 13 senior wins and just over dlrs 5
million in earnings this year, halved the 13th hole to clinch the
win for Irwin.
	   Morgan advanced to the finals with a 7 and 5 rout of Bob Charles
in the morning. Charles failed to make a birdie in the match. Both
Charles and Graham earned dlrs 60,000 for reaching the semifinals.

 &UR; Cowboys 35, Cardinals 28 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Tempe, Arizona, Dallas barely held off after taking a 28-0
lead as Jake Plummer passed for a career-high 465 yards and three
touchdowns for Arizona.
	   Plummer had the Cardinals on the Cowboys 4 in the final seconds,
but he threw two incompletions after spiking the ball on first down
to stop the clock with 9 seconds left after a 57-yard pass to Rob
Moore. The final pass was knocked out of Moore's hands by Kevin
Smith as time expired as the Cardinals vehemently claimed pass
interference.
	   Dallas' sixth victory in as many games against NFC East
opponents moved the Cowboys (7-3) two games ahead of the
second-place Cardinals with six to go.
	   Emmitt Smith rushed for 118 yards in 26 carries and three scores
to move ahead of Jim Brown to No. 3 on the NFL career touchdown
list with 127. Only Jerry Rice and Marcus Allen have more.
 &UR; Packers 37, Giants 3 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Brett Favre became the second
fastest quarterback to throw 200 career touchdown passes and reach
the 25,000-yard plateau, while Reggie White had two sacks in Green
Bay's rout of New York.
	   The impressive performance came just six days after the Packers
(7-3) were beaten by Pittsburgh for their third loss in five games.
	   The Giants (3-7) managed just 127 yards and Favre was 21-of-33
for 267 yards. He threw two touchdown passes to backup tight end
Tyrone Davis as the Packers gained 433 yards and scored on seven of
nine offensive series in one stretch.
 &UR; Jaguars 29, Buccaneers 24 &QC; 
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, Fred Taylor ran 70 yards touchdown
with 2:40 remaining to lift the host Jaguars past Tampa Bay.
	   It was his third touchdown of the game as the Jaguars (8-2) won
their third straight and took a two-game lead over Pittsburgh in
the AFC Central.
	   All talk of the playoffs is off in Tampa Bay (4-6), which lost
its seventh straight road game and would need to finish the season
undefeated to match last year's 10-6 record.
	   The Bucs had a chance after Taylor's run, but Aaron Beasley
picked off Trent Dilfer's pass on fourth-and-5 with 1:49 remaining.
	   Brunell completed 22 of 37 passes for 248 yards. Taylor finished
with 128 yards on 21 carries.
 &UR; Raiders 20, Seahawks 17 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Greg Davis's second field goal of the
fourth quarter, a 37-yarder with 21 seconds left, gave the Oakland
the narrow victory over Seattle.
	   After Warren Moon drove the Seahawks (5-5) 65 yards in eight
plays for the tying touchdown, a 12-yard toss to Christian Fauria,
Donald Hollas moved the Raiders 54 yards in just 36 seconds to set
up Davis' tiebreaking kick.
	   The game featured punt runbacks for touchdowns by Joey Galloway
and Desmond Howard.
 &UR; Chargers 14, Ravens 13 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, the host Chargers won despite the loss of running
back Natrone Means with a broken left foot.
	   Craig Whelihan, elevated to starting quarterback when troubled
rookie Ryan Leaf was benched on Monday, erased the zero from his
won-loss record, improving to 1-7. He threw a 47-yard touchdown
pass to Charlie Jones in the second quarter, and Terrell Fletcher
returned from a four-game absence due to a knee injury to score the
game-winner on a 3-yard run with 14:47 to play.

Graf upsets Davenport to win Advanta

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Steffi Graf took a dramatic step
in her tennis comeback on Sunday by stunning top-ranked Lindsay
Davenport to win the Advanta Championships.
	   The unseeded Graf defeated Davenport 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a grueling
two-hour match, to win her second tournament in as many tries since
returning from a two-month layoff because of wrist surgery.
	   The loss spoiled Davenport's debut on American soil as the
top-ranked player in the WTA Tour's computer rankings. She had won
her last seven matches, including a victory over Monica Seles in
the semifinals Saturday and the European Championships finals
against Venus Williams last month.
	   But it was Graf who celebrated this time in the first meeting
between the two in a championship final. Minutes after Davenport's
return hit the net on match point, Graf smiled widely and shook her
fist in the air.
	   But it was Graf who celebrated this time in the first meeting
between the two in a championship final. Minutes after Davenport's
return hit the net on match point, Graf smiled widely and shook her
fist in the air.
	   ``It's been a tough road back, but I seem to be doing really
well,'' Graf said after receiving her dlrs 79,000 winner's check.
	   After splitting the first two sets and exchanging service breaks
as Davenport took a 4-3 lead in the third set, Graf went to work,
allowing Davenport just four points in the last three games.
	   Graf went up 40-15 in the last game and was cheered by the crowd
after Davenport's return sailed into the net.
	   It was Graf's 10th straight match victory, including a win in
the finals of the Leipzig Open, since returning from wrist surgery
last month. It was the second time Graf has won the tournament, and
the second straight year that Davenport has lost an Advanta final.
	   The two were tied at 2-2 in the third set before exchanging
service breaks on consecutive serves, with Graf needing five break
points, and Davenport four.
	   Graf came out blazing in the first set, nailing three aces and
pushing Davenport back on most of her service returns to take a 4-1
lead.
	   Davenport turned it around winning the last five games. She
rallied back from three points down to take one game, then rocketed
a forehand winner past a charging Graf to break service on the way
to taking the set.
	   Graf took the first game of the second set, then had to retreat
to the locker room for trainers to re-tape her left leg, which
cramped in the quarterfinals against the second-seeded Martina
Hingis.
	   The delay showed little effect on Graf, who jumped out to a 5-3
lead. On the last game, Graf held off two break points, hit a
forehand winner, then took the set after a Davenport return went
long.

APEC decisions half a world away vital to many Americans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the United States, most
chemical workers, medical equipment manufacturers and lumberjacks
are unlikely to have heard of APEC.
	   But millions of them and workers in other industries of the
world's largest economy have a lot riding on a trade battle waged
in Malaysia's capital for the past four days under the banner of
the 21-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The goal of U.S. negotiators was to eliminate or at least
drastically cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of global trade.
In the end they couldn't strike a deal because of heavy opposition
from Japan to lowering barriers in wood and fish products.
	   On Sunday, however, APEC countries agreed to regroup and try the
effort again in an even broader forum, the 124-nation World Trade
Organization based in Switzerland.
	   Lower border taxes in Japan, China or Australia mean more sales
for U.S. companies trying to export into those markets. And the
diverse group of industries covered _ environmental goods, medical
equipment, chemicals, energy, forest products, fish, toys, jewelry,
telecommunications equipment _ represent many areas where the
United States is highly competitive on world markets.
	   In fact, America, the world's largest exporter of chemicals,
accounts for one-fourth of global trade in this sector. Chemicals
bring in 10 cents of every $1 America earns in export sales.
	   Thirteen of the top 20 medical equipment companies, makers of
everything from surgical instruments to artificial limbs, are
U.S.-owned, while American lumber mills and paper factories supply
a fourth of the world's demand for these products.
	   In the end, it was Japanese fishermen and tree farmers who held
sway in Kuala Lumpur. The Japanese government said it could not ask
its domestic producers in those two industries to face increased
foreign competition at a time when Japan is suffering through its
worst recession in 50 years.
	   Scrambling to salvage what they could, U.S. negotiators
eventually accepted language that simply put Japan on record as
willing to consider lower barriers for wood and fish but leaving
the timetable for those reductions and the size of the tariff cuts
to later negotiations.
	   The goal is to make those decisions as part of wider discussions
that will now be held at the Geneva-based WTO.
	   Like a general who has sounded retreat in order to live to fight
another day, a weary U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
insisted that the American side got the best agreement possible
after four days of tough bargaining.
	   ``Two days ago, we felt there was a high probability that the
whole initiative would collapse,'' she said. She said she was
uneasy that other Asian countries could have pulled back their own
market-opening offers in the face of Japanese intransigence.
	   But instead, Barshefsky said the other countries held firm and
eventually Japanese negotiators agreed to at least consider
lowering tariffs on wood and fish products.
	   The failure to achieve the goals set out by APEC leaders in
Vancouver, British Columbia, last year could not come at a worse
time for U.S. President Bill Clinton as his administration
scrambles to show that its strategy of pursuing market-opening
deals is the proper approach, despite a trade imbalance headed into
the stratosphere.
	   America's trade deficit is expected to reach an all-time high of
dlrs 165 billion this year on its way to dlrs 200 billion next
year. Asia's steep recessions have cut into American exports to the
region, and the weaker currencies have made Asian goods more
attractive to U.S. buyers.
	   Those forces have already prompted the steel industry to
petition Washington for penalty tariffs to ward off a flood of
cheaper imports, and other industries, such as textiles and machine
tools, could follow suit.
	   ``Many companies are beginning to feel the pain,'' said Greg
Mastel, economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington.
``The Asian crisis is definitely coming home to roost.''
	   Because of the Clinton administration's desire to combat those
protectionist pressures and show the world that APEC countries were
not turning inward in difficult times, Barshefsky and her crew went
into overdrive to force an agreement this week in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Some nations were philosophical, saying meager results were the
best that could be hoped for in a year when many nations in the
Asian region are in steep recessions that have pushed millions of
people into poverty.
	   ``In the spirit of realism, APEC has reached a decision everyone
can live with,'' Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said.
``We will have to count on it as another success that we can build
on at the next APEC meeting.''

Martin wins Stockholm Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Todd Martin feels right at home in
Stockholm. For Thomas Johansson, the home-court advantage didn't
help.
	   ``The weather is a lot like where I grew up in Michigan,'' the
American said after beating the Swede 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to win the
Stockholm Open on Sunday. ``To see the snow when you wake up in the
morning and have to bundle up a little bit to go outside for
dinner, I love it!
	   ``The city is beautiful, the people are as friendly as any place
in the world and it doesn't hurt that they all speak English very
well.''
	   Martin became the first American winner of one of the world's
oldest indoor tournaments since John McEnroe's fourth triumph in
1985.
	   Many people get depressed in Sweden because of the short days at
this time of the year.
	   ``But unlike everybody else I love when it gets dark early,''
Martin said. ``I think it provides a lot of atmosphere in the hall,
maybe it's because the Swedish fans can have a beer a little
earlier than usual.''
	   The Royal Tennis Hall, with its narrow well-worn wooden
bleachers, is a cramped place with only 4,500 seats and a past. It
was built during World War II and the first indoor arena built
expressly for the sport that King Gustav V _ known as ``Mr. G'' _
loved to play. Bill Tilden played there. So did Rod Laver, Ken
Rosewall, Arthur Ashe, Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg and today's
biggest names, led by Pete Sampras.
	   In this hall, Borg led Sweden to its first Davis Cup title in
1975.
	   And only two months ago, Johansson made his Davis Cup debut
before his own club members, and became a hero when he clinched the
11th final berth for Sweden since 1975.
	   But Johansson, a member of the Royal Lawn Tennis Club, played
his worst match in a long time against Martin. Normally a big
server, the Swede lost half of his 14 service games in the final.
	   ``I had a good week, but it was a pity that I couldn't play
better in the final,'' he said. ``It was my worst match this week.
But he played very well and deserved to win. If you want to lose to
someone, it's against Todd because he's such a good guy.''
	   The 28-year-old American, who lost the final two years ago to
another Swede, Thomas Enqvist, didn't serve well either in the
first set. It featured five service breaks, including four in a
row. But Johansson only managed to hold his serve once in the first
set.
	   ``It was a very strange match,'' Martin said. ``I started off
very well and Thomas started off very poorly. He was nervous. And
the fact that he was a little nervous made me a little nervous.
	   ``I was very confident, because I've played very well in this
arena and in the past few weeks,'' added Martin, who beat world No.
3 Patrick Rafter and No. 5 Andre Agassi in the Paris Open a week
ago.
	   ``And I was fortunate to start every set early with the break.''
	   The ATP Tour is now over except for its annual World
Championships, featuring the top eight players, later this month in
Hanover, Germany. But the season is not over for Johansson, a
non-qualifier for Hanover.
	   He'll try to get one of the singles spots for defending champion
Sweden in the Davis Cup final against Italy early next month in
Milan.
	   For Martin, it was the second ATP title this year. He also won a
tournament on clay in Barcelona in April.
	   ``I felt like I have played better than I ever had in the past
five weeks and even before that, in the U.S. Open and
Indianapolis,'' Martin said. ``It's thrilling for me and I hope to
continue to improve and enjoy some more success like this.''
	   Martin, unseeded and ranked 21st in the world going into the
event, earned dlrs 112,000 for his seventh career title.

Daewoo chairman Kim undergoes minor brain surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Kim Woo-joong, chairman of South
Korea's Daewoo group, was in stable condition Monday after brain
surgery, hospital and Daewoo officials said.
	   Kim, 62, was diagnosed with chronic subdural hematoma, a blood
clot in the brain, at Seoul National Hospital on Sunday.
	   A two-hour operation successfully removed the clot in its early
stage of development, doctors said.
	   ``It was a minor operation, which would not entail any
complications,'' doctor Kim Hyon-jip told reporters. ``Mr. Kim can
return to normal life in a week.''
	   Kim's Daewoo group is South Korea's fourth largest conglomerate,
producing cars, ships and electronic goods. He also heads the
Federation of Korean Industries, the lobby group for the nation's
major businesses.

Japanese Cabinet approves record stimulus plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, quotes, Obuchi not cutting
consumption tax &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet approved a record economic stimulus
package worth more than 23 trillion yen (dlrs 188 billion) Monday
in a bid to spend the country out of its worst recession in
decades.
	   The massive plan was aimed at boosting the Japanese economy into
growth by next year, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters
after the decision.
	   ``We must do all we can to cut the vicious cycle of recession in
order to put the nation's economy back into recovery,'' Obuchi
said.
	   The announcement comes after the government outlined a plan last
Thursday for 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in new spending and
tax cuts, which was immediately panned by critics as insufficient.
	   Apparently shaken by the criticism that the plan would not be
enough to resuscitate the economy, officials began dropping hints
the next day that the package would likely be bigger.
	   Obuchi sees the package as his best chance to stop the economy
from contracting for a third consecutive year _ a key pledge made
after taking office in July.
	   Japan could use the help. The economy shrank last fiscal year
for the first time in more than two decades. Unemployment and
bankruptcy debts are at record highs.
	   It was unclear how successful the plan will be. The government
has cut taxes and instituted new spending in the past, but
pessimistic consumers have not responded yet with a shopping spree.
	   Obuchi said the package would include more than 17 trillion yen
(dlrs 139 billion) in spending projects and more than 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 49 billion) in tax cuts.
	   The plan is expected to be passed later this month in a special
session of Parliament.
	   The premier, however, said the plan did not include a reduction
of the 5 percent national sales tax, as investors and opposition
politicians have been calling for.
	   The government's decision last year to raise the consumption tax
from 3 percent was widely blamed for choking off a growth spurt and
tipping the anemic economy back into recession.
	   Obuchi said the tax revenue was needed because of Japan's
mounting budget deficit.
	   ``Judging from the current fiscal situation, it's difficult to
comply with that,'' he said.
	   The government is also under heavy international pressure to
power the economy out of the doldrums and provide a more robust
market for products from ailing Asian economies.
	   U.S. officials likely will urge Obuchi to kick start the
Japanese economy at this week's summit meeting in Malaysia of
leaders from members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.
	   Obuchi said the plan includes a 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.2
billion) aid package for Asia.
	   Monday's package comes on the heels of legislation passed last
month by Parliament aimed at rejuvenating Japan's banking system
saddled with huge amounts of bad loans.

South Korean cruise ship returns after test run to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A chartered South Korean cruise ship
returned from North Korea on Monday after a successful test run for
regular sightseeing tours to the reclusive communist country.
	   The 28,700-ton Hyundai Kumkang carried 415 tour guides and
Hyundai officials on a two-day tour of Diamond Mountain, a major
scenic attraction on the North's east coast.
	   The trip was a final check by South Korea's Hyundai group and
North Korea of regular five-day tours to the mountain, scheduled to
start on Wednesday.
	   ``It was a successful test run, and I hope this will lay the
foundation for national unification,'' said Chung Se-yung, honorary
chairman of Hyundai Motor Co.
	   Chung said the cruise ship arrived at Changjon port, a gateway
to Diamond Mountain, early Sunday after a 12-hour voyage and that
visitors climbed the mountain in two groups.
	   ``I am confidant that the tours will proceed smoothly. North
Koreans have made good preparations,'' he said.
	   Although just a test run, it was the largest single group of
South Koreans to visit rival North Korea since the two countries
fought a bloody war in the early 1950s.
	   The same ship will carry 980 tourists and 600 crewmen Wednesday
for a five-day tour of the mountain. It will be South Korea's first
commercial sightseeing tour to the reclusive communist country.
	   Hyundai hopes that up to 2,000 tourists per week will
participate. It has agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 906 million over
the next six years for the right to operate the tour.
	   The two Koreas were separated into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war after
the 1950-53 Korean War ended without a permanent peace treaty.

Italian priest freed by kidnappers in the Philippines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Italian priest saying he was treated well by
kidnappers; other details in grafs 5-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada announced
Monday that an abducted Italian priest has been freed unharmed by
kidnappers in the southern Philippines after more than two months
of captivity.
	   The kidnappers handed over the Rev. Luciano Benedetti to Muslim
rebels belonging to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a thickly
forested area in southern Zamboanga province late Sunday.
	   The rebels then turned the priest over to government officials.
	   ``This is good news. Father Benedetti was not hurt. He's strong
and we greeted each other over the phone,'' Estrada told a Manila
radio station.
	   A military helicopter bearing Benedetti and police and
government officials made a brief stop in the town of Sultan
Kudarat in southern Maguindanao province to thank MILF leaders in
the area.
	   The priest, wearing a white shirt and native pants, looked gaunt
and had grown a beard, local officials said.
	   ``I was treated well,'' Benedetti said, when asked by reporters
to describe his ordeal. But he did not get off the helicopter and
was whisked off to an airport for the flight to Manila, officials
said.
	   Officials had planned to escort Benedetti to a meeting with
Estrada but the president left to attend a summit of Pacific Rim
nations in Malaysia without seeing the priest.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Treviso, was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected
Muslim rebels in Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, and his
kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 10 million pesos (dlrs
250,000), officials and rebel leaders said.
	   Several other people remain in the hands of different groups of
kidnappers, including the family of a Taiwanese businessman, a pair
of Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian, all kidnapped in the
southern Mindanao region.
	   Al Haj Murad, the vice chairman of the MILF for military
affairs, said the MILF secured Benedetti's release without paying a
ransom. Government sources, however, said an unspecified amount of
ransom was paid to the kidnappers.
	   Murad said the kidnappers, who included former Muslim rebels and
company security guards, were allowed to escape after releasing the
priest.
	   Another MILF leader, Ghazali Jaafar, said MILF rebels surrounded
the kidnappers' lair then pressured them into giving up Benedetti
peacefully. ``We made sure no shots would be fired. We didn't want
the priest to be hurt,'' he said.
	   Fellow missionaries of Benedetti's in the Pontifical Institute
for Foreign Missions, a worldwide society of missionaries, were
ecstatic about Benedetti's release and said his abduction would not
scare them into leaving the Philippines.
	   ``There is one thing which is very clear and that is we will
stay. Two of our people had been killed in the past, do you think
we were scared of that?'' said the Rev. Giampiero Bruni, who is
based in southern Zamboanga province.
	   An Italian priest, the Rev. Carzedda Salvatore was killed in an
ambush in Zamboanga in 1992 and another, the Rev. Tulio Favali was
killed in 1985 by an anti-communist vigilante group. Both belong to
the institute, which has 17 missionaries in the volatile southern
region of Mindanao.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling
the central government in an attempt to establish a separate
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   It is involved in on-and-off peace negotiations with Manila and
has promised to help the government combat rampant kidnappings in
Mindanao, although the military says the rebels might be involved
in some abductions.
	   Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign against the
kidnappings and scored a major victory last month with the rescue
of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors in
Manila.
	   He promised upon takn office in June to end the kidnappings
within six months.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors were ordered back
to Iraq after the U.N. Security Council told Baghdad to keep its
pledge to cooperate fully and unconditionally with the search for
weapons of mass destruction.
	   After a simmering three-month showdown over inspections that
nearly resulted in U.S. airstrikes, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan warned Iraq on Sunday that in a future crisis, military force
might be the only way out.
	   ``I'm not sure that if there is a next time we would even have
time for further diplomatic initiatives and appeals,'' he told
reporters after thanking President Bill Clinton ``for the
courageous and difficult decision'' he took Sunday to accept
Baghdad's promise that it would allow unfettered inspections.
	   ``For the crisis to be put permanently behind us, Iraq must move
swiftly to ensure complete and unconditional compliance,'' Annan
said.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had been waiting for
a green light from the council and announced that he was ordering
the inspectors back to Iraq. ``They'll be going back on Tuesday
morning,'' he said.
	   Benon V. Sevan, the head of the humanitarian program in Iraq,
said all 151 U.N. international staff who went to Amman, Jordan at
the height of the crisis would return to Iraq by Monday evening.
	   For the Americans and the British, the key will be Iraq's
compliance on the ground with the promises it made to cooperate
fully with the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency, charged with eliminating its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Calling the outcome ``satisfactory,'' Britain's U.N. Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock said: `We wish to see the unconditional delivery
of cooperation by Iraq and in the meantime we remain vigilant and
alert.''
	   ``There is a punch behind our requirement that ... unconditional
cooperation should be followed,'' he said.
	   The Security Council issued a statement taking note of a letter
from Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz announcing Baghdad's
decision to resume cooperation with the inspectors. It was
delivered to Annan Saturday morning, as the U.S. was about to
launch airstrikes, according to U.S. officials.
	   The council also noted clarifications from Iraq's U.N.
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon who confirmed that Iraq was allowing the
return of inspectors ``on an immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted basis.''
	   Hamdoon's clarifications were the key to Clinton reversing the
U.S. rejection of Iraq's initial offer.
	   The Security Council's statement, which is a reflection of its
views but not legally binding, put the onus on Iraq to comply with
its promises.
	   ``Taking note of past experience with Iraq, council members
underlined that their confidence in Iraq's intentions needs to be
established by unconditional and sustained cooperation with the
Special Commission and the IAEA in the full range of their
activities,'' the council said in a statement read by the current
council president, Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov welcomed Clinton's decision to
accept Iraq's promise, saying it allowed the council to reach
consensus on a statement.
	   The council had been divided Saturday, with the Russians,
Chinese and French, who are traditional sympathetic to the lifting
of sanctions against Iraq, saying the crisis was over and the
United States refusing to accept Baghdad's offer.
	   Once Annan has confirmed that Iraq is fully cooperating with
UNSCOM and the IAEA, council members reaffirmed their readiness to
proceed with a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   ``We expect an early report from the secretary-general ... that
UNSCOM and IAEA are receiving full cooperation on the ground, and
as soon as the secretary-general confirms this we (will) engage in
a comprehensive review process,'' Lavrov said.
	   Iraq halted U.N. inspections Oct. 31, saying it would only
resume cooperation with the arms experts if the council moved to
lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions have paralyzed exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   U.N. resolutions that ended the Gulf war, which was sparked by
Iraq's invasion, say sanctions can only be lifted after inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun welcomed ``the peaceful solution
of the Iraq crisis.''
	   ``We wish to see the comprehensive implementation of the
relevant council resolutions by Iraq and the early lifting of
sanctions against Iraq,'' he said.
 &UR; Annan stepped in, pick up 19th graf pvs.

Japan's current account surplus rises again in September
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade jumped in
September for the 18th consecutive month, climbing over 70 percent
from a year ago, the government announced Monday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.933 trillion yen (dlrs 15.8 billion) in September, up 70.4
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning surplus.
	   Although the pace of export growth was slow in September due to
a slowdown in other Asian economies, imports remained sluggish due
to a continued fall in oil prices and the weakness of the Japanese
economy, leading to the on-year rise in the surplus.
	   A ministry official briefing reporters said that while there is
no major change in the trend of a rising current account surplus, a
further acceleration in the pace of surplus increase is unlikely in
the long term.
	   A series of economic stimulus packages should help trim Japan's
surplus by boosting domestic demand and imports, the official said.
	   The average dollar-yen rate was 134.59 yen, up from 120.75 yen
in the year-earlier month.

Bad weather delays search for son of former Canadian prime

<TEXT>
	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ Poor weather and the risk of
further snowslides has delayed the search for former Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau's youngest son, believed killed when he was swept
into an icy lake by an avalanche.
	   Michel Trudeau, 23, was on a back-country ski expedition Friday
when he was thrown into Kokanee Lake in the Kootenay Mountains of
southeast British Columbia. The two other skiers with Trudeau
survived.
	   A team of police divers was ready to search for his body once
weather conditions permitted. But rain and low clouds prevented
authorities from dispatching helicopters Sunday to the site of the
avalanche, which is inaccessible by overland vehicle.
	   In a separate incident Sunday, a female university student was
killed and five others injured in an avalanche at Yoho National
Park in British Columbia.
	   Susanna Donald, a student at the University of Calgary, was
pronounced dead at the scene. None of the others were reported to
have life-threatening injuries _ one man sustained a broken pelvis.
	   More than 40 centimeters (nearly 16 inches) of snow fell in the
area over the weekend, causing the two avalanches.
	   Cpl. Randy Koch of the Mounties' local detachment said he had
spoken by telephone with Pierre Trudeau.
	   ``He's deeply shaken by this,'' Koch said. ``He was very quiet,
but he told us to go on to recover the body.''
	   Three hikers were walking along the same ridge behind Michel
Trudeau's group when the avalanche struck. They tried to help, but
were swept away themselves by a second avalanche.
	   One of the hikers, Paul Williamson, said Trudeau was ``still
alive, shouting for help and groaning. We could see him. But we
couldn't reach him. He was in the middle of the lake.''
	   After digging themselves out, the hikers had to walk about four
miles (seven kilometers) in soggy clothing to reach their car and
drive to seek help.
	   Michel Trudeau had visited the area earlier this year with his
father and one of his brothers. He was an avid skier and hiker, and
had worked as a ski lift attendant in the Kootenay Mountains last
winter.
	   The former prime minister, who held power from 1968 to 1984
except for a nine-month gap, has two other sons, Sacha and Justin.
He and the boys' mother, Margaret, are divorced.

Japanese Cabinet approves record stimulus plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES size of package to round numbers higher following new
details &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet approved a record economic stimulus
package worth 24 trillion yen (dlrs 197 billion) Monday in a bid to
spend the country out of its worst recession in decades.
	   The massive plan was aimed at boosting the Japanese economy into
growth by next year, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters
after the decision.
	   ``We must do all we can to cut the vicious cycle of recession in
order to put the nation's economy back into recovery,'' Obuchi
said.
	   The announcement comes after the government said last Thursday
that the package might total 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion),
surpassing the record 17 trillion yen (dlrs 139 billion) stimulus
package released last April.
	   But critics immediately panned the plan as insufficient to
resuscitate the economy. Apparently shaken by the criticism,
officials began dropping hints the next day that the package would
likely be bigger.
	   Obuchi sees the package as his best chance to stop the economy
from contracting for a third consecutive year _ a key pledge made
after taking office in July.
	   Japan could use the help. The economy shrank last fiscal year
for the first time in more than two decades. Unemployment and
bankruptcy debts are at record highs.
	   It was unclear how successful the plan will be. The government
has cut taxes and instituted new spending in the past, but
pessimistic consumers have not responded yet with a shopping spree.
	   Obuchi said the package would include more than 17.9 trillion
yen (dlrs 147 billion) in spending such as public works projects
and more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 49 billion) in tax cuts.
	   The plan is expected to be passed later this month in a special
session of Parliament.
	   The premier, however, said the plan did not include a reduction
of the 5 percent national sales tax, as investors and opposition
politicians have been calling for.
	   The government's decision last year to raise the consumption tax
from 3 percent was widely blamed for choking off a growth spurt and
tipping the anemic economy back into recession.
	   Obuchi said the tax revenue was needed because of Japan's
mounting budget deficit.
	   ``Judging from the current fiscal situation, it's difficult to
comply with that,'' he said.
	   The government is also under heavy international pressure to
power the economy out of the doldrums and provide a more robust
market for products from ailing Asian economies.
	   U.S. officials likely will urge Obuchi to kick start the
Japanese economy at this week's summit meeting in Malaysia of
leaders from members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.
	   Obuchi said the plan includes a 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.2
billion) aid package for Asia.
	   Monday's package comes on the heels of legislation passed last
month by Parliament aimed at rejuvenating Japan's banking system
saddled with huge amounts of bad loans.

England scrapes a win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Tailenders Robert Croft and Alan
Mullally led England to an unconvincing one-wicket victory Monday
in their final tour match ahead of the five-test Ashes series
against Australia.
	   Croft (15) and Mullally (23) put on a 38-run stand to take
England from 106-9 to the target of 142 in the four-day match
against Queensland.
	   England opener Michael Atherton, in some minor doubt for the
first test because of a back injury, made an appearance down the
order but was out stumped for one.
	   Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz put his state in sight of
victory with six wickets including three early on the final day as
England lost 4-15. Kasprowicz, named earlier in the test team,
finished with 6-31.
	   England's win followed draws against Western Australia and South
Australia earlier on tour. The first test starts in Brisbane on
Friday.
	   The form of England's leading batsmen is causing most concern.
Captain Alec Stewart has three ducks and one half century from his
four innings while opener Mark Butcher has scored just nine runs
from five appearances.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks drop in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stocks, dollar, bond rates, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Monday in Tokyo after the government announced an economic stimulus
package that contained few surprises. Japanese stocks dropped
slightly.
	   The dollar bought 122.30 yen at midday, up 0.67 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 122.72 yen on
Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 54.82
points, or 0.38 percent, to 14,213.39 points by the close of the
morning session at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT). On Friday, the average
closed 193.15 points higher, or 1.37 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar held its strength from Friday's
trading in New York, especially after the government announced a 23
trillion yen (dlrs 188 billion) stimulus package.
	   Though the package _ aimed at powering the economy out of its
deepest recession in decades _ is the biggest in Japanese history,
traders said the plan contained few surprises.
	   ``The package was mostly as expected. Initially there was no
impact on the dollar from the release of the package. But since
nothing new was included in the package, there was some
dollar-buying to cover short positions,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo.
	   Also bolstering the dollar was U.S. government data showing
strength in the economy, which may keep the Federal Reserve from
lowering interest rates for a third time this year when its
policy-making committee meets on Tuesday.
	   The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales, which
account for a third of the country's economic activity, rose 1
percent to a seasonally adjusted dlrs 227 billion in October.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened sharply higher Monday
but then dropped after the announcement of the stimulus package.
	   Masaaki Higashida, deputy manager of investment at Nomura
Securities, said the size of the package showed that the government
was making efforts to stimulate the economy, but questioned whether
it would be enough to boost growth significantly next fiscal year
beginning in April.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up a slight 2 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,095.52
points. The TOPIX closed up 10.59 points, or 0.98 percent, on
Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.800 percent from Friday's 0.815 percent, driving its
price up to 108.90 yen from 108.75 yen.

Moody's places two major Japanese automakers on review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: STANDS for story slugged Japan-Moody's on digest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citing ill effects from the Asian economic crisis,
U.S. credit rating agency Moody's said Monday it has placed Nissan
Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. on review for possible
downgrade.
	   Although Nissan and Mitsubishi are implementing major
cost-cutting programs, their high leverage could make them
vulnerable to troubled economies in Japan and the rest of Asia,
Moody's Investors Service said.
	   A lower rating is associated with higher risk for investors and
depositors.
	   Moody's said the Baa3 long-term debt ratings and Baa3 long-term
shelf registration ratings on the two Japanese automakers will be
reviewed for possible downgrade.
	   The agency also said the Baa3 ratings on overseas units of both
Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors have also been placed under review for
possible cuts.
	   Moody's review will focus on the ability of each company's
restructuring and operating strategies to withstand a deepening
recession in their major markets.
	   As a part of this review, Moody's said it will examine both
domestic and overseas operations of the two automakers.
	   Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker, reported last week it
suffered a net loss of 32.6 billion yen (dlrs 267 million) for the
six months ended in September, partly due to a deepening slump in
demand for vehicles in Japan.
	   Mitsubishi Motors, the nation's fourth-largest auto
manufacturer, has announced a major restructuring, including an
elimination of 30 percent of jobs at its plant in Thailand, steps
taken after suffering huge losses from Japan's recession and the
Asian financial crisis.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police early Monday picked up two
opposition figures at their homes for questioning after President
B.J. Habibie accused opponents of trying to overthrow his
6-month-old government.
	   At least five activists were in police custody following mob
riots and student clashes with police and soldiers last week. At
least 16 people, including eight students, were killed.
	   There were no reports of unrest Monday. Many shops opened and
rush-hour traffic returned to Jakarta's main boulevard, the site of
battles Friday night between riot officers and pro-democracy
protesters.
	   The unrest was the worst in the Indonesian capital since May,
when much heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat
authoritarian President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   About 100 student protesters gathered Monday at Trisakti
University, where the military fatally shot four activists in May,
triggering the violence that led to Suharto's downfall.
	   Wreathes were laid along the street outside Atma Jaya Catholic
University, where security forces shot and killed students with
plastic bullets last week.
	   Most campuses were quiet, but protests were planned later in the
day.
	   Habibie, whose efforts to implement political reforms have
failed to satisfy students who want faster change, said the
violence would only jeopardize Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   After Habibie ordered the military to get tough on those trying
to topple him, police this weekend rounded up activists who have
campaigned for a more sweeping overhaul of Suharto's rigid
political system.
	   Still in custody Monday were former political prisoner and
politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide
to opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Early in the morning, officers detained Hartono, an intellectual
who is active in the University of Indonesia's alumni association,
and Permadi Satario Wiwoho, an outspoken fortune teller, the
official Antara news agency reported.
	   Another activist, 75-year-old retired Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris, was
released late Sunday night after several hours of questioning.
Kemal has campaigned to replace Habibie with a transitional
government led by a presidium of community leaders.
	   Habibie has indicated he will stick by military chief Gen.
Wiranto despite outrage over the killings of the students by
security forces.
	   The clashes triggered riots by thousands of young men who burned
buildings and cars and attacked police on Saturday. Several
security personnel and pro-government civilian guards were also
killed.
	   The mobs vented their fury at the military, shouting taunts and
hurling stones at police vehicles. At Parliament, thousands of
student protesters shouted slogans against Wiranto, whose armed
forces has been tainted by human rights abuses.
	   In a meeting with local journalists Sunday, Wiranto expressed
regret for the shootings of the students and promised to take
action against officers involved.
	   Backed by armored personnel carriers and small tanks, Wiranto's
troops ringed the presidential palace and Parliament Monday.
	   Students timed their demonstrations to coincide with a meeting
last week of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, which agreed to hold parliamentary elections
in May or June and make other political reforms.
	   The assembly, filled with holdovers from the Suharto era, lacks
credibility among students who believe its members want to preserve
their political privileges.

<TEXT>
	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ Poor weather and the risk of
further snowslides has delayed the search for former Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau's youngest son, believed killed when he was swept
into an icy lake by an avalanche.
	   Michel Trudeau, 23, was on a back-country ski expedition Friday
when he was thrown into Kokanee Lake in the Kootenay Mountains of
southeast British Columbia. The two other skiers with Trudeau
survived.
	   A team of police divers was ready to search for his body once
weather conditions permitted. But rain and low clouds prevented
authorities from dispatching helicopters Sunday to the site of the
avalanche, which is inaccessible by overland vehicle.
	   In a separate incident Sunday, a female university student was
killed and five others injured in an avalanche at Yoho National
Park in British Columbia.
	   Susanna Donald, a student at the University of Calgary, was
pronounced dead at the scene. None of the others were reported to
have life-threatening injuries _ one man sustained a broken pelvis.
	   More than 40 centimeters (nearly 16 inches) of snow fell in the
area over the weekend, causing the two avalanches.
	   Cpl. Randy Koch of the Mounties' local detachment said he had
spoken by telephone with Pierre Trudeau.
	   ``He's deeply shaken by this,'' Koch said. ``He was very quiet,
but he told us to go on to recover the body.''
	   A spokesman for Pierre Trudeau issued a statement from Montreal
saying Michel's parents were deeply saddened by the report of his
death. He said they appreciated the many expressions of sympathy
they have received and asked that the family be given privacy.
	   ``They will be making no further public comment,'' the statement
said.

Ice trek adventurers reach first food depot on journey to South
</HEADLINE>
Pole &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - The trio of adventurers
recreating Englishman Robert Scott's ski trek to the South Pole
reached their first supply drop-off depot Monday, 10 days and just
60 miles (100 kilometers) from their departure point.
	   New Zealander Peter Hillary, son of Everest conqueror Sir Edmund
Hillary, and Australians Jon Muir and Eric Philips, left New
Zealand's Scott Base in Antarctica to ski the 1,875 miles (3,000
kilometers) to the South Pole and back.
	   The three hope to complete the epic journey with no outside
assistance as they recreate Scott's ill-fated 1911 expedition.
	   Icetrek spokeswoman Barbara Crocker said they each shed 24 lb.
(10.8 kilograms) of supplies at the first drop-off point and hoped
to cover the next 125 miles (200 kilometers) in 10 days.
	   They set out with each pulling 396 lb. (180 kilograms) of
supplies, fuel and equipment on sleds and will drop supplies along
the route to use on the return journey.
	   Scott and his team of four men, who had set out with ponies and
sled-dogs, died of starvation and weakness only a few miles
(kilometers) from a supply dump and only days from journey's end.
	   Hillary's team, however, is banking on the use of modern
technology _ like super lightweight equipment, an Iridium satellite
phone and paraglider-style kites _ to see it safely through the
adventure, which is estimated to last about 100 days.
	   Crocker said her weekend Internet e-mail update from the trio
told of the slow progress because of sastrugis _ bumpy, wave-like
ice formations caused by the strong Antarctic winds.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Highlights of Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's 24 trillion yen (dlrs 197 billion) stimulus package:
	   _The centerpiece is 17.9 trillion yen (dlrs 147 billion) in new
government spending. The biggest chunk is 8.1 trillion yen (dlrs 66
billion) earmarked for public works, most of which Obuchi said
would go to technology and environmental projects.
	   _Another 5.9 trillion yen (dlrs 48 billion) will be used to help
smaller companies ride out a severe credit crunch as Japan's banks
cut back on lending to dispose of their massive bad loans problem.
	   _Obuchi also unveiled cuts in individual and corporate income
taxes worth 6 trillion yen (dlrs 49 billion). The cuts are aimed at
bringing Japanese tax rates in line with those in major Western
economies. The top personal tax rate will drop to 50 percent from
its current 65 percent, and companies will pay 40 percent, down
from 46 percent.
	   _The package also includes an innovative plan to entice
consumers to spend more by distributing 700 billion yen (dlrs 5.7
billion) in shopping vouchers. While Obuchi was vague, news reports
said the government will give 20,000 yen (dlrs 160) gift
certificates to people over 65 and to families with young children.

Japan's Nikko Securities will close three Hong Kong units
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Japan's third largest brokerage said on Monday
that it is closing all securities and futures dealings in Hong Kong
as part of a global restructuring.
	   The Nikko Group said in a statement that it is trimming down
overseas operations, closing Nikko Securities Co. (Asia) Ltd.,
Nikko Securities Co. (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Nikko Futures (Hong Kong)
Ltd.
	   The company said it expects all its securities and
futures-related business to close on Jan. 15, but declined to say
how many of the about 90 staff employed in the three companies will
be sacked as a result of the closure.
	   ``We haven't decided yet,'' Stephen Chow of human resources at
Nikko Securities Co. (Asia) told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The South China Morning Post quoted company sources as blaming
the closure on an August joint venture share-swap agreement between
Nikko and Travelers Group of the United States.
	   Travelers recently merged with Citibank and also owns Salomon
Smith Barney.
	   Nikko Securities Co. (Asia) has business in investment banking,
Asian equities trading, fixed income and treasury operations, while
Nikko Research Center provides regional financial research.
	   In September, Nikko Research Center dismissed 10 employees each
from its Hong Kong and Singapore offices, and 31 employees were
laid off at Nikko Securities Co. (Asia).

Gores arrives for APEC summit set back by weak tariff deal
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore
arrived in Malaysia on Monday to meet with other Pacific Rim
leaders gathering to discuss the Asia economic crisis.
	   Gore is attending the summit in place of President Bill Clinton,
who scrapped the trip because of the U.S.-Iraq standoff.
	   In the end, Clinton canceled an ordered military strike against
Iraq when he received word that Saddam Hussein was backing down and
would allow U.N. personnel to resume weapons inspections.
	   Malaysia took at swipe at the United States on Tuesday,
depicting Clinton as Rambo in a cartoon in the government-backed
New Straits Times newspaper.
	   At the bottom of the cartoon, one small snake said to another,
``Clinton is threatening war on Iraq!'' The other replied: ``An
excuse not to attend the APEC summit.''
	   Leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
meet later this week for their annual summit. On Monday, they
planned to hold bilateral meetings to discuss a wide range of
issues, everything from border disputes to their economies.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet privately with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the
chairman of the summit, because of his standoff with Anwar Ibrahim.
Mahathir fired Anwar, his finance minister and deputy prime
minister, then jailed him and put him on trial after Anwar launched
a reform movement that sought Mahathir's resignation.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Canada's foreign
minister, Lloyd Axworthy, angered the Malaysian government by
meeting with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   Albright and Axworthy expressed concern for the way Anwar has
been treated, both during his trial on corruption and sex charges,
and when he was allegedly beaten up by prison guards while being
detained before the court sessions began.
	   Mahathir also opposes some elements of the free-market
philosophy that APEC was created to endorse.
	   For instance, he imposed controversial currency controls in
Malaysia after wild fluctuations in Western investment in Asia
caused many of the region's stock and currency markets to collapse
in 1997, setting off the Asian crisis that has since spread to
Russia and Brazil.
	   The leaders of Indonesia and the Philippines are both friends of
Anwar, so people will be carefully watching to see whether they
meet Azizah, too, and whether they join Gore and Chretien in
effectively snubbing Mahathir during their visits to Malaysia.
	   On Sunday, the APEC nations failed to achieve a landmark
agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global
trade, but did manage to keep the effort from totally collapsing.
	   The fight now goes to the 124-nation World Trade Organization,
where the hope is to eventually overcome stiff Japanese resistance
to cutting tariffs in two sectors its considers politically
sensitive _ wood and fish products.
	   The United States, which had pushed the hardest to force Japan
to agree to slash tariffs in all nine sectors of the proposed
agreement, reluctantly accepted the outcome as the best Washington
could get at the moment.
	   Seeking to put the best face on the failure to achieve a
breakthrough, U.S. officials insisted that it was at least a
partial victory that the whole effort did not collapse.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said that other
nations could have easily decided, without Japan's participation in
wood and fish, that they would pull their own tariff cuts off the
table, causing the deal to unravel. ``From our point of view,
moving forward is the key,'' she said.
	   At the WTO, APEC members hope to attract other countries outside
the region to the effort to slash tariffs in products ranging from
chemicals to medical equipment.
	   Japan claimed a victory in the trade negotiations, saying it
staved off pressure from the United States and other nations.
	   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the APEC leaders will meet in Kuala
Lumpur to endorse the work done on the trade initiative, plus
review an action plan being put together to deal with reforms
intended to halt the current financial turmoil and prevent it from
occurring in the future.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Faldo sees red over greens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ English star Nick Faldo has
warned World Cup of Golf organizers to take care with pin
placements after his first look at the Gulf Harbor course Monday.
	   Faldo, who will team with David Carter in the 32-nation
tournament starting Thursday, played nine holes in windy conditions
Monday and found the greens too fast for comfort.
	   ``The wind was very severe and the greens are also very
undulating,'' Faldo said. ``If we get a bit of a blow out there it
could get pretty serious. They may have to look at slowing the
greens down a bit.''
	   But Faldo was impressed with the new resort course an hour north
of Auckland.
	   ``The course is in fabulous condition and the key factors will
be the wind and the greens which are very slippery at the moment,''
Faldo said. ``They're going to have to put the pins in a few flat
spots.''
	   Faldo has struggled on the US Tour this year but says he has
gained confidence after firing mentor David Leadbetter and
employing Chip Koehkle. He also split from girlfriend Brenna
Cepelak last month.
	   ``I'm pleased with changing my coach. I think I was getting
bogged down with David,'' Faldo said. ``We were working on a few
things that just weren't working and I so went looking for a fresh
approach.
	   ``Chip Koehkle teaches my theory, he is part of the Faldo
institute in Orlando and so he teaches the Faldo way of playing
golf. He'll come up to me and say something that is all my own
stuff.''
	   Faldo said he was trying to recapture the form which gave him
four majors.
	   ``I'm trying to put myself back in time, find those feelings and
thoughts again and I feel good,'' Faldo said. ``I'm just trying to
give myself a new run and as they say a change is as good as a
break.
	   ``I feel positive that it is going to work. I feel relaxed and
it sure better work next year because I still want to play better
and I still have the drive so I hope it turns around.''
	   Faldo believes Scotland deserves to start favorite with Europe's
top money winner Colin Montgomery teaming up with Andrew Coltart,
who was the outstanding player on the Australasian circuit last
year.
	   New Zealand's Frank Nobilo had his first look at the course
Monday, playing nine holes before heading back to Auckland.
	   ``It looks great and I'm really looking forward to it. I did
think the greens were a bit quick and I'm sure they'll slow them
down,'' Nobilo said.
	   United States' John Daly and Scott Verplank will arrive Tuesday.

victory over Chicago.
	   Steve Stenstrom, making his second start in place of injured
Erik Kramer, was never in synch against the Lions (3-7), who won a

	   In Pontiac, Michigan, Rookie Charlie Batch passed for 253 yards
and Tommy Vardell scored three touchdowns in Detroit's victory over
Chicago.
	   Steve Stenstrom, making his second start in place of injured
Erik Kramer, was never in synch against the Lions (3-7), who won a
Sunday game for the first time all season. Stenstrom was 13-of-25
for 159 yards for the Bears (3-7), who scored three fourth-quarter
touchdowns to beat Detroit 31-27 with Kramer at quarterback on Oct.
4 in Chicago.
	   The Bears held Barry Sanders to 28 yards on 14 carries in their
first meeting. But this time Sanders, wearing a flak jacket to
protect sore ribs, rushed 24 times for 114 yards, the 75th 100-yard
game of his career.
