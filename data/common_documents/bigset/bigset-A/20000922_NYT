THE SMITH IN THE SHADOW AT GM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an early September morning at the Four Seasons Hotel, and
Manhattan's power brokers are back from their summer vacations,
posturing over cafe lattes and toast in the hotel restaurant,
bragging about their latest deals. Among them, in this cavernous
I.M. Pei room, Michael Smith sits quietly, picking at an egg-white
omelet.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the mild-mannered chairman and chief executive of Hughes
Electronics, hardly stands out among the Armani-clad bankers and
other Upper East Side prima donnas. But for 14 years, Smith, now
56, has had a substantial role in transforming Hughes, once an
anchor of Southern California's military industry, into a
technology powerhouse and the third-largest provider of pay
television in the United States, behind AT&AMP;T and Time Warner. Its
best-known venture, DirecTV, already has more than nine million
subscribers who receive programming in their homes using
pizza-sized satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   But the obscurity that he so enjoys, despite having held his
titles since 1997, is about to end. General Motors, which acquired
his company, the former Hughes Aircraft, in 1985 and still owns 100
percent of it (pay no attention to that tracking stock), is now
seeking a partner for it. Several possible suitors have emerged,
most notably Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Disney and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is well positioned to negotiate. He was part of the GM
team that brokered the Hughes acquisition 15 years ago. More
important, he has the ear of John F. Smith Jr., the GM chairman,
who is also his older brother. The two have never truly worked
together, Michael Smith said. They climbed the ranks independently,
he said, and when the board named him to lead Hughes, his brother
declined to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith appears happy to remain relatively unknown. ``I've
always distinguished between rainmakers and doers,'' he said, his
voice still thick with the accent he developed while growing up
near Boston. ``A lot of people make headlines, but they don't
really achieve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   His subdued demeanor is unusual in an era when chief executives,
especially of technology companies, are hailed as celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a charismatic leader,'' said Harry Pearce, the vice
chairman of GM, who has known him for 13 years. That sentiment is
echoed by Smith's wife, Jane. ``If he came into a room, he's not
the one who makes a big scene that he's there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just the personality needed to soothe Hughes
engineers who, when the company was owned by Howard Hughes, worked
for years on projects free from demanding managers. ``Because he
does things in a low-key way, they aren't intimidated,'' Pearce
said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened in 1990, when Smith brought in a
consultant to evaluate which of Hughes' technologies were worth
pursuing. ``He called them a bunch of underachievers and that set
off a rocket,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made his point in a quieter way. He called a meeting and
laid out several goals. If the engineers, virtually all of them
Hughes shareholders, met them, he explained, Hughes' stock price
would grow fourfold. ``That got them focused on what they needed to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1943, Smith was one of four children in an Irish family.
He spent afternoons at his family's ice cream shops, scooping
cones. Like most other young boys in the neighborhood, he played
ice hockey, paying $15 a day to practice at the local ice rink.
Summer weekends were spent at a rented New Hampshire cabin where
his aunts, uncles and cousins gathered. In 1965, he graduated from
Providence College with a degree in political science.
</P>
<P>
   Having belonged to the Reserve Officers Training Corps in
college, Smith joined the Army as an intelligence officer. In 1966,
during the Vietnam War and before he joined GM, he spent his days
roaming the South Vietnamese countryside interviewing villagers and
looking for enemy camps. On Christmas Day in 1966, he recalled, a
plane crashed in a village not far from an airport near Danang.
When Smith went with a doctor and engineer to assess the damage, he
saw that the crash had exposed a chain of tunnels built by enemy
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the village were scared,'' he said. But not
because they were found out. ``They were homeless.'' As he learned,
``There was a human side to the war.'' Such experiences helped him
identify with other people's circumstances and their stakes in an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife first met him at a high school dance, she was not
struck by his presence. But she noticed his quiet distinctiveness.
``I loved his sweater, a cardigan,'' Smith said, noting that she
still has it. ``It had multi colors and was different. He's an
individualist.'' She laughed as she remembered the moment, adding,
``He's not motivated by what other people think.'' The two were
married in 1966. They have had three children; one of them died
recently in a hiking accident.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after two years in Vietnam, Smith joined GM, earning
$7,800 a year working at the same plant in Framingham, Mass., where
his brother had worked. His first job was in the accounting
department, collecting workers' punched time cards and calculating
their hours. Three years later, having earned an MBA from Babson
College at night, he moved with GM to Detroit and joined the
finance team. Then came New York City and Spain, before his return
to Detroit in 1982 as assistant controller of the company. In 1986,
after GM acquired Hughes, he went to El Segundo, Calif. where the
company was based, to be its chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was quiet about the plans for Hughes, except to say, ``I'm
not ready to retire.'' But it is clear that he would like them to
include more time in the sun. ``When you leave a place like
Michigan'' for a place like Southern California, he said, ``you
never think of snow again.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wet and cool start to the weekend is likely along the Middle
Atlantic coast as the remnants of Tropical Storm Helene merge with
a warm front. Heavy rain is expected at the coast from Virginia to
northeastern New Jersey with lighter rain inland. Steady onshore
breezes will keep readings below 70 degrees in most sections from
Maine to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry weather will cover the South as tropical air flows north
from the Gulf of Mexico. The leading edge of a much cooler air mass
will progress southward from the Great Lakes into the middle
Mississippi Valley and Plains. A change in temperature of as much
as 30 degrees will be noted across the front.
</P>
<P>
   A cold rain will dampen the western Plains with more snow in the
eastern Rockies. Much of the West will be cool and dry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SEPTEMBER SNOW
</P>
<P>
   The season's first snow blanketed portions of Wyoming on Friday,
with over a foot falling in some places. Snow is not an infrequent
visitor to the Front Range of the Rockies during September. In
1995, a storm dumped nearly 10 inches of snow in Denver, damaging
over 80 percent of the still foliated trees in the city. The unique
topography of the eastern Rockies can rapidly funnel the first
intrusions of Canadian chill south along the Front Range, setting
the stage for early snowfalls. On Saturday, the season's first
flakes will fly near Denver, a marked change from last weekend's
95-degree heat. &QL;

HONEYBEES BUZZ HUMMER FEEDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Q: Our popular humming bird feeder has become an attraction to a
mini-swarm of honeybees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have thoroughly washed the feeder with mild soapy water and
refilled it for the birds, which we love. Within an hour the bees
were back, and we have been forced to take the feeder down. Our
hummers are checking for it every few minutes, and while they have
a lantana to keep their interest for the moment we need a solution
to the bee problem.
</P>
<P>
   Is there something we can use to repel the bees and not the
hummers? _ B.J., Houston
</P>
<P>
   A: Wasps and bees can be pests at the sugar-water feeders. You
can try moving the feeders and perhaps the insects will lose track
of them. Or buy feeders with bee guards.
</P>
<P>
   It's said bees are attracted to yellow, so those gardeners with
bee problems at feeders with yellow markings may try removing those
yellow parts and see if this helps.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to wash hummingbird feeders once a week with hot water
and a bottle brush. Fill with fresh sugar solution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an ixora in a pot. Can it be grown outside in a flower
bed and survive the winter? Can it be rooted from cuttings?
</P>
<P>
   I have a vitex tree that's 8 feet tall and bushy. This was the
first year it bloomed and was beautiful. Now there are tiny balls
where the blooms were. Do I cut them off or leave them on the tree?
_ C.W., Dayton, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Ixora needs protection from cold, and those grown in
containers can be moved during freezing weather. Ixora can be used
in beds as annuals. They may pull through when we have especially
mild winters; otherwise, you will need to replant in spring unless
you can provide extra protection. I use pots as mini-greenhouses on
various tender plants. Success, of course, depends on just how cold
it gets and the duration of that cold.
</P>
<P>
   Should you try ixora in a bed, provide a well-draining, slightly
acidic soil. Use a low-phosphorus fertilizer. Water, then allow the
soil to become fairly dry before watering again.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can propagate from cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   The balls you see on your vitex are seed. When brown they fall
from the tree and new plants sprout. Or you can harvest them and
sow them in pots, then in spring transplant seedlings into an area
of your garden.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, remove spent flowers from spring into fall for
continued bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two years ago I planted several dwarf bottlebrush plants and
have been pleased with how well they held up during this brutally
hot, dry summer. These plants are compact with a beautiful deep
blue-green color. Recently I went to a nursery to buy more, and I
noticed a difference between the ones I had planted and those at
the nursery, which were more green to yellow-green and less
compact. The clerk said the plants were the same variety but with a
different look due to how they were grown. If I purchase the new
plants, could I get them to look the same as the ones I already
have? _ B.P., Houston
</P>
<P>
   A: Callistemon viminalis `Little John' is an excellent
bottlebrush. Culture, of course, will alter appearance, and one
grower's plants may be a little greener and/or more compact than
another's. Fertilizer type and application frequency, and light are
factors. Generally, differences aren't that great.
</P>
<P>
   Potted plants that sit in nurseries for some time can lose
vigor, too, especially during brutal summers. Frequent watering
leaches nutrients and plants lose color; sometimes light is
inadequate and plants become leggy.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are sure they are the same variety, you might
purchase one or two and see if you can't deepen the green and
encourage more compact growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be that while the plants belong to the same genus
and species as your bottlebrush plants, those nursery plants are
actually another variety. For example, several growers grow
Loropetalum chinensis rubrum, commonly called red Chinese witch
hazel. But there are several varieties of this species. Some of
these varieties are close in appearance; others have more green
than burgundy on the foliage. L. chinensis rubrum `Plum Delight' is
popular. Others grow L. chinensis rubrum `Razzleberri,' L.
chinensis rubrum `Burgundy' or `Blush.'

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ Soon, Florida orange and juice labels may be written in
Portuguese.
 &HT;    Citrus companies based in Brazil, or heavily involved in
operations there, are squeezing the U.S. competition right out of
their own sunny Florida backyards. They are rooting themselves
firmly in the region's citrus processing, importing and even
growing operations. And Floridians realize they're being uprooted
from their own turf. ``Brazilians are always our No. 1
competition,'' says Barbara Oxford, the executive director of the
Peace River Valley Citrus Growers in Florida. ``And now they are
diversifying.''
 &HT;    Brazil's Cutrale Citrus has invested at least US$30 million to
acquire and upgrade operations in Florida, as has its compatriot
Citrosuco Paulista. Multinational commodities firms Louis Dreyfus
of France and Cargill of the United States, which are both major
players in Brazil _ the world's largest grower of oranges _ have
also acquired processing plants in the Sunshine State, the world's
No. 2 grower.
 &HT;    Brazil accounts for about a quarter of all the citrus fruits
worldwide, with oranges representing about two-thirds of the total.
Since the mid-1980s, however, the United States has slapped high
tariffs on Brazilian OJ, with duties reaching as high as 63
percent. To avoid these duties and attack new markets, Brazilians
are increasing their operations in Florida. ``The Brazilians are
now responsible for about 40 percent of the juice processed in the
state,'' says Philip Lesser, the economic and market research
director for the University of Florida's Citrus Research and
Education Center in Central Florida. ``And the growing trend is
continuing.''
 &HT;    Cutrale, a subsidiary of Brazil's Sucocitrico Cutrale, runs
former Florida Minute Maid processing plants, five Brazilian
processing plants and three ships. One of the largest growers and
processors of citrus products in the world, the company produces 25
million to 30 million boxes of oranges annually from more 100,000
acres in Brazil. Citrosuco has 80,000 acres under cultivation. And
adding in the operations of multinationals Dreyfus and Cargill,
experts estimate that the four concerns control 80 percent of the
Brazilian market and capacity capable of processing 30 percent of
U.S. orange output.
 &HT;    Florida's tristeza. While tariffs have managed to keep Brazilian
produce at bay, Florida growers, processors and other citrus
companies are fighting a host of elements. Florida's fight against
the dreaded orange tree disease _ citrus canker that lowers each
tree's fruit production _ may require the destruction of a million
trees by the beginning of next year. That's a third of the South
Florida's citrus tree population, but Gov. Jeb Bush says the state
must cut down the trees to keep the disease from spreading farther
north toward the heart of Florida's citrus empire.
 &HT;    Oxford, however, says growers are more concerned about a
possible outbreak of another disease, tristeza, which shuts down
the ability of trees to take in water. ``Commercially, that's what
we're seeing more of,'' she says. ``And especially with a drought,
the trees can die much more quickly.''
 &HT;    Whether it's death by canker or by tristeza, a large loss in
Florida acreage would give an even stronger foothold in the
industry to the razilians, who, Floridians say, face less
environmental pressures. ``We don't operate as other countries
do,'' Oxford contends. ``The American people, for example, are more
environmentally conscience.''
 &HT;    Now that the Brazilians are moving into Florida, however,
growers will no longer be able to claim unequal conditions.
Additionally, the Brazilians may begin to compete in new segments,
such as the high-priced juice known as ``not from concentrate.''
According to the Florida growers, the Latin American citrus titans
are cultivating their own production in the Sunshine State. ``A lot
of the Brazilian processors are getting their own acreage,'' says
Oxford of the Peace Valley association. ``They're going to have
more of their own supply.''
 &HT;    With their own acreage as well as their own supply of
Florida-grown oranges, Brazilians are expected to tap themselves
into every juncture of the citrus network. The local Florida
growers figure that the best defense is a good offense, emphasizing
Florida-quality orange juice. ``We figure that once someone's
tasted Florida orange juice, they'll never go back,'' Oxford says.
But more and more ``Florida'' orange juice is going through the
Brazilian pipeline.

possible outbreak of another disease, tristeza, which shuts down
the ability of trees to take in water. ``Commercially, that's what
we're seeing more of,'' she says. ``And especially with a drought,
the trees can die much more quickly.''
 &HT;    Whether it's death by canker or by tristeza, a large loss in
Florida acreage would give an even stronger foothold in the
industry to the razilians, who, Floridians say, face less
environmental pressures. ``We don't operate as other countries
do,'' Oxford contends. ``The American people, for example, are more
environmentally conscience.''
 &HT;    Now that the Brazilians are moving into Florida, however,
growers will no longer be able to claim unequal conditions.
Additionally, the Brazilians may begin to compete in new segments,
such as the high-priced juice known as ``not from concentrate.''
According to the Florida growers, the Latin American citrus titans
are cultivating their own production in the Sunshine State. ``A lot
of the Brazilian processors are getting their own acreage,'' says
Oxford of the Peace Valley association. ``They're going to have
more of their own supply.''
 &HT;    With their own acreage as well as their own supply of
Florida-grown oranges, Brazilians are expected to tap themselves
into every juncture of the citrus network. The local Florida
growers figure that the best defense is a good offense, emphasizing
Florida-quality orange juice. ``We figure that once someone's
tasted Florida orange juice, they'll never go back,'' Oxford says.
But more and more ``Florida'' orange juice is going through the
Brazilian pipeline.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ Es posible que muy pronto las etiquetas de las naranjas
y del jugo de naranja de la Florida esten en portugues.
 &HT;    Companias brasilenas de citricos, o con grandes operaciones en
Brasil, estan exprimiendo a la competencia norteamericana y
sacandola de sus terrenos en la Florida, donde se afianzan en
operaciones de procesamiento, importacion y hasta cultivo de
citricos. Y los floridanos saben que los estan batiendo en su
propio terreno. ``Los brasilenos son nuestros principales
competidores,'' dice Barbara Oxford, directora ejecutiva de la
organizacion Peace River Valley Citrus Growers en la Florida. ``Y
ahora se estan diversificando.''
 &HT;    Cutrale Citrus, de Brasil, ha invertido al menos US$30 millones
para adquirir y actualizar operaciones en la Florida, al igual que
Citrosuco Paulista. Las multinacionales de productos basicos Louis
Dreyfus, de Francia, y Cargill, de Estados Unidos, que tienen
grandes intereses en Brasil, el mayor cultivador de naranjas del
mundo, tambien han adquirido plantas de procesamiento en la
Florida, el segundo cultivador del planeta.
 &HT;    Brasil produce alrededor del 25 por ciento de los citricos del
mundo, y las naranjas son dos tercios del total. Sin embargo, desde
mediados de los anos 80, Estados Unidos ha impuesto altos aranceles
al jugo de naranja brasileno, hasta el 63 por ciento. Para evitar
esos aranceles y entrar en nuevos mercados, los brasilenos
incrementan sus operaciones en la Florida. ``Los brasilenos ya
producen alrededor del 40 por ciento del jugo procesado en el
estado,'' dice Philip Lesser, director de investigaciones
economicas y de mercado del Centro de Investigacion de Citricos de
la Universidad de la Florida. ``Y la tendencia va en aumento.''
 &HT;    Cutrale, filial de la brasilena Sucocitrico Cutrale, administra
las plantas procesadoras que pertenecian a Florida Minute Maid,
cinco procesadoras brasilenas y tres barcos. La compania es uno de
los mayores cultivadores y procesadores de citricos del mundo, y
produce entre 25 y 30 millones de cajas de naranjas al ano en mas
de 40.000 hectareas en Brasil. Citrosuco tiene unas 32.000
hectareas cultivadas. Y si se agregan las operaciones de las
multinacionales Dreyfus y Cargill, los expertos estiman que las
cuatro empresas controlan el 80 por ciento del mercado brasileno y
pueden procesar el 30 por ciento de la produccion norteamericana de
naranjas.
 &HT;    La tristeza de la Florida. Aunque los aranceles han mantenido a
raya a los productos brasilenos, los cultivadores, procesadores y
otras companias de citricos de la Florida luchan contra distintos
enemigos. En la batalla que libra la Florida contra el temible
cancro de los citricos, podria ser necesario destruir un millon de
plantas a principios del ano proximo. Esa es la tercera parte de la
cantidad de naranjos de la Florida, pero el gobernador Jeb Bush
dice que el estado debe eliminar las plantas para evitar que la
plaga se extienda mas al norte, hacia el corazon del imperio
citricola floridano.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, Oxford dice que a los cultivadores les preocupa mas
la posible aparicion de otra plaga, la tristeza, que impide que las
plantas puedan absorber agua. ``Comercialmente, es lo que mas
estamos viendo,'' dice. ``Y sobre todo con la sequia, las plantas
pueden morir rapidamente.''
 &HT;    Ya sea por el cancro o por la tristeza, una perdida importante
en los cultivos de la Florida daria una posicion todavia mas fuerte
a los brasilenos, quienes, segun los floridanos, encaran menos
presiones ecologicas. ``No funcionamos como otros paises,''
sostiene Oxford. ``El publico norteamericano, por ejemplo, tiene
mas conciencia ambiental.''
 &HT;    No obstante, ahora que los brasilenos entran en la Florida, los
cultivadores ya no podran afirmar que las condiciones son
desiguales. Ademas, los brasilenos pueden comenzar a competir en
segmentos nuevos, como el jugo puro de alto precio. Segun los
agricultores de la Florida, los titanes latinoamericanos de los
citricos cultivan su propiaproduccion en el estado norteamericano.
``Muchos procesadores brasilenos estan adquiriendo terrenos,'' dice
Oxford. ``Van a tener mas suministros propios.''
 &HT;    Con terrenos propios y tambien con su propio abastecimiento de
naranjas cultivadas en la Florida, se estima que los brasilenos
esten presentes en cada rincon del mundo de los citricos. Los
cultivadores floridanos piensan que la mejor defensa es el ataque y
subrayan la calidad del jugo de naranja de su estado. ``Pensamos
que cuando se ha probado el jugo de naranja de la Florida, ya no se
quiere tomar otro,'' dice Oxford. Pero cada vez mas jugo ``de la
Florida'' pasa por la tuberia brasilena.

BRITISH COURT APPROVES SURGERY TO SEPARATE TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ England's Court of Appeal ruled on Friday against the
parents of joined twins, saying that doctors could proceed with an
operation to separate the 6-week-old girls although the effort
would sacrifice one to save the other.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous three-judge verdict turned down an appeal by the
parents, who said their religious faith compelled them to let
nature take its course with no medical intervention, even though
doctors said both children would probably die if they remained
joined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers for the parents said they would appeal Friday's
decision to Britain's highest tribunal, the Law Lords of the House
of Lords, before the surgery, which is scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Ward, himself the father of twin girls, said it was
``an agonizing and difficult case'' and expressed the court's
sympathy for ``this family blighted with disaster.'' But he said
the court had been convinced by medical testimony that the weaker
sister was incapable of sustaining life on her own and that if she
remained joined, she would hasten the death of her sibling, who
doctors believe can lead a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad fact is that she lives on borrowed time, all of it
borrowed from her sister,'' he told the packed Royal Courts of
Justice chamber. ``She is incapable of independent existence. She
is designated for death.''
</P>
<P>
   During five days of hearings this month ranging over questions
of law, ethics, morality and the nature of ``God's will,'' all
three jurists observed that they had found the case one of the most
testing of their careers. The complexity of the case has prompted
widespread interest, dismay and concern as it weighed arguments
over whether it is ever lawful to permit the taking of life, and,
if so, under what circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups that can be outspoken on the charged subjects
involved _ euthanasia, the sanctity of life, the rights of newborn
children, the primacy of parental authority, the role of the state
_ have found the case a difficult one on which to take fully
committed stands.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, Jodie and Mary _ the courts used false names for them
to preserve anonymity _ were born on Aug. 8 at St. Mary's Hospital
in Manchester, joined at the pelvis. Jodie is said to be bright and
alert, but Mary, with an underdeveloped brain, is more passive and
relies on Jodie for heart and lung functions and lives only because
she is attached to her.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Roman Catholics from Gozo, an island in Malta, came
to England to have the children when they learned that the two were
joined and that the children would require sophisticated care that
their home community lacked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the first day of appellate hearings on Sept. 4, the parents,
who have not been named and did not attend court, submitted a
statement explaining their reason for appealing an Aug. 25 High
Court ruling that the operation should go ahead: ``We cannot begin
to accept or contemplate that one of our children should die to
enable the other one to survive. That is not God's will. Everyone
has a right to life, so why should we kill one of our daughters to
enable the other one to survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer, Simon Taylor, said that while they understood the
``dire prognosis without separation,'' they could not countenance
either of their daughters being ``actively killed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearings, Ward uttered a haunting comment on the
anguishing responsibilities that the court was obliged to weigh.
``Do we save Jodie by murdering Mary?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester medical team said it felt duty-bound to operate
after concluding that there was an 80 percent to 90 percent chance
that if the twins remained joined, both would die in three to six
months as Jodie's heart failed under the burden of supporting more
than just herself.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearings, specialists in treating joined twins from
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London raised what
Taylor called ``the horrible specter'' that they could survive
longer, possibly even for years, with weakening Mary slowly
draining away her healthier sister Jodie's life until both died.

 &HT;    No obstante, ahora que los brasilenos entran en la Florida, los
cultivadores ya no podran afirmar que las condiciones son
desiguales. Ademas, los brasilenos pueden comenzar a competir en
segmentos nuevos, como el jugo puro de alto precio. Segun los
agricultores de la Florida, los titanes latinoamericanos de los
citricos cultivan su propiaproduccion en el estado norteamericano.
``Muchos procesadores brasilenos estan adquiriendo terrenos,'' dice
Oxford. ``Van a tener mas suministros propios.''
 &HT;    Con terrenos propios y tambien con su propio abastecimiento de
naranjas cultivadas en la Florida, se estima que los brasilenos
esten presentes en cada rincon del mundo de los citricos. Los
cultivadores floridanos piensan que la mejor defensa es el ataque y
subrayan la calidad del jugo de naranja de su estado. ``Pensamos
que cuando se ha probado el jugo de naranja de la Florida, ya no se
quiere tomar otro,'' dice Oxford. Pero cada vez mas jugo ``de la
Florida'' pasa por la tuberia brasilena.

   CUBA-EMBARGO-$ADV24 _ VARADERO, Cuba _ The U.S. Congress has
moved closer to easing the Cuban embargo, giving initial passage to
measures that would allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, as
well as a bill that would ease travel restrictions that currently
bar most U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba. If the latter measure
wins final approval, it could prove a bonanza for the Cuban tourism
industry, which has grown dramatically in the past decade.

   CUBA-JOURNAL _ VARADERO, Cuba _ A golf vacation in Cuba: Now
there's a contradiction in terms for many baby-boomers, who spent
their elementary school years in the 1960s ducking under their
desks for nuclear attack drills during the Cuban missile crisis.
But the land that once threatened us with Russian nukes has built
its first modern 18-hole golf course at the tourist resort of
Varadero, and hopes Americans will soon be playing the sport of
capitalist bankers on its socialist shores. We play a round and
reflect on the study in contrasts that is modern Cuba. (Williams,

   CHINA-SEX _ BEIJING _ Prostitution is rampant in China. From the
biggest cities to the smallest towns, from the toniest hotels to
the seediest roadside stalls, women are making a living with their
bodies. Experts say it is one of the major reasons for a
skyrocketing number of cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Although the government is
starting to recognize the seriousness of the problem, few believe
it will be brought under control anytime soon. With an ever-more
mobile population, a dismal level of sex education for young people
who are becoming increasingly sexually active and a sex industry
that is almost institutionalized, government efforts to limit the
spread of STDs seem like a drop in the bucket. (Chao, Cox News

More than half a century later, amid the ongoing information boom,
social scientists say little has changed. American voters are
disturbingly ignorant about the country's political life and its
leaders. Even in the age of radio talk shows and Internet chat, a
majority of Americans have trouble identifying their congressman or

Georgians are farmers today, about 7 percent are high-tech workers,
such as computer engineers and programmers. In metro Atlanta alone,
roughly 10,000 tech companies employ about 220,000 people. But
while the tech sector is driving up the state's population and
wealth, Georgia's 13-member delegation to Congress remains outside
the inner circles of tech political power. Though they won't speak
on the record, many of Georgia's business executives and lobbyists
grumble about their lawmakers' lackluster leadership on tech

   FLIGHT-SERV _ When Todd Bottorff was brought in to help pull
Flightserv.com out of its dive in late May, he faced some
Internet-sized challenges. The Atlanta company's stock had dropped
90 percent from its 52-week high, after ranking as Georgia's
best-performing stock last year. A New York money manager had
cancelled the second half of a $10 million investment. Few business
travelers were using Flightserv's Web site, www.flightserv.com.,
which offers individual seats on private jet flights between
Atlanta and New York. And the company was running out of cash. So,
over the next several weeks, Flightserv's new president and chief
operating officer cut the staff and marketing budget and suspended
flights. Bottorff also plunged into retooling Flightserv's business
model and rounding up new investors and business partners.

   BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ We are a unique nation, created not
by a common ethnic background, or a shared history that goes back
centuries, or a single religious faith or even a single language.
We are instead a nation created by a commitment to shared ideals,
by a civic understanding with each other that must be created anew
with each generation of Americans, and with each influx of
immigrants. In that sense, we are more fragile and vulnerable than
more traditional countries. And should our commitment to those
shared ideas ever falter, our ability to act as a nation, to
sacrifice for a common cause, might falter as well. (Bookman,

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ Political memories are notoriously short, a
Republican friend reminded me during a conversation about Gov.
George W. Bush's current situation. After the primaries,
experienced politicos never expected the race to be anything other
than close. But then Bush caught a good bounce after the Republican
convention in Philadelphia and suddenly was portrayed as inevitable
in the national press, which now leads to stories about how badly
the campaign is stumbling. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman)

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ If you leave by speedboat from the
environs of Havana and set a course due north, you'll shortly reach
one of an atoll-like group of uninhabited islands called the
Marquesas Keys. They are part of the United States, between Key
West and the Dry Tortugas. You land there, you're in America.
You've succeeded, according to Bill Clinton's controversial wet
foot/dry foot Cuban Adjustment Act, in reaching our shores and
almost assuredly will not be repatriated. Therefore, more and more
are headed for the Marquesas as that is the shortest distance
between Cuba and the United States, about 80 miles. (Kleinberg, Cox

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ If the Texas governor were running
for ``Mr. Nice Guy,'' you would have to grade his effort as an
``A,'' as in affable, amenable, amiable and amicable. But is that
an adequate argument to assume the presidency in 2001? Once, Bush
glowed in the aura of an invincible winner. But that ended in the
dog days of August and it's unlikely to return even if he manages,
against high odds, to stitch together the 270 electoral votes he
needs to win. (Glass), Cox News Service).

   SAVING-CAVES _ Rusty's Cave is as quiet as a tomb and as artful
as a museum. As long as the clumsy, the malevolent or the profane
don't stumble upon it, it's safe. For Rusty's, while not a secret,
is not well known, which has protected the formations growing from
the floor and the ceiling. They took thousands of years to form.
They can shatter in seconds. In the darkness, Diane Cousineau of
Lafayette and Bill Putnam of Lawrenceville murmur about enjoying
quiet moments in the cool embrace of the earth. ``You know how some
people are beautiful and stunning and others are just as plain as
plain can be?'' Cousineau says. ``Caves are like that too. Every
one is different.'' Putnam is a director the Atlanta-based
Southeastern Cave Conservancy Inc., which Cousineau chairs. For the
past several years, the 600-member organization has rapidly
acquired caverns from West Virginia to Florida both to hold and to
protect. Most are near Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia border, a region
with perhaps more caves per square mile than anywhere in the United
States. ``Land acquisition is our mission,'' says Cousineau. ``We
just need to go out and buy most of the Southeast. It's a modest
goal.'' (Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS

   TRAVEL-FIRSTCOAST _ That well-traveled ribbon of asphalt known
as A1A _ which follows Florida's Atlantic coastline south all the
way to Key West _ takes on a different identity between Amelia
Island and St. Augustine. Here, the highway is known as the
Buccaneer Trail, and it makes a beeline into the past. The 52-mile
route where pirates, explorers and early settlers once roamed is as
scenic as it is historic. Florida's northeastern coast - including
the booming city of Jacksonville 10 miles inland on the St. Johns
River - offers Atlantans many vacation options within an easy drive
of each other. (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

You are spending a weekend, gratis, at a resort, sometimes with

presentation, and the salesmen have a quick retort for every reason
not to buy. But the salesmen probably never mention the inevitable

vacation adventure has turned into a financial nightmare. The

   ALABAMA _If you've been through Birmingham lately, you might

The cast-iron statue that for six decades crowned the ridge

Humpty Dumpty, the Roman god of the forge sits in pieces behind a
fence in Vulcan Park, awaiting the funds to repair his parts and
put him back together again. ``It's got to be the world's largest

Park Foundation, mentioning the bare metal bum that has spawned
many a joke and ``Buns of Iron'' T-shirt. ``We've had more than one

fertility drug pros and cons. The growing use of such drugs is
increasing the chances of multiple births like the once here, in

   POLIO _ This summer, world health officials - including the CDC
- acknowledged they would not meet an oft-stated goal of ridding
the world of polio by the end of this year. Next week, (Sept. 27),
many of those officials leading the fight will join Ted Turner and
other big spenders who are helping to fund the effort, in a ``polio
summit'' to explore why the fight is not being won on time. The NYC
meeting is intended to redirect attention away from the
public-health failure and focus media attention on the last push to
eradicate polio - which WHO hopes to accomplish shortly. To set up
the conference, we take a look at why 15-20 of the 30 countries
which had polio at the end of 1999 still do and ask ``What's taking

at New Hampshire International Speedway and injuries to drivers at

   The device, made of carbon fiber and kevlar, has a high-back

has straps that attach to the back of the driver's helmet. In a
sudden impact, the straps limit the forward movement of the
driver's head.

   DENNYS _ When Denny's was hit with racial discrimination charges

unveil a new ad campaign to reposition the 47-year-old restaurant
chain as ``America's Kitchen Table.'' The $10 million effort -
handled by a branch of Atlanta-based WestWayne - marks the latest
image overhaul for Denny's, which has changed its operations
greatly in the wake of racial discrimination problems. Dennys
campaign is an example of rehab advertising, and it's one of the

 &HT;    SENATE SETS SHOWDOWN ON VISA BILL
 &HT;    410&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By KAVITA KUMAR
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Friday set a showdown for next week
on a bill, long-sought by the U.S. technology industry, that would
expand the number of visas allotted to skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks left before the Senate is scheduled to
adjourn, the high-tech industry is pressing for passage of the
bill, which would nearly double the number of H-1B visas for
skilled foreigners, to 200,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says it is facing an extreme shortage of
high-skilled workers, and the only way to fill a shortfall of up to
400,000 jobs in the short term is to look abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., took two steps
Friday to force a decision.
</P>
<P>
   First, he filled the ``amendment tree'' _ the list of H-1B
amendments on which the Senate will vote _ with separate versions
of the main bill. that left no room for immigration-related
amendments backed by the White House and the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lott scheduled a cloture vote to cut off debate on the bill
itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the cloture vote fails to attract the needed 60 votes, Lott
said, the popular visa bill would be dead for the year and the
Democrats would be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is critical to our nation,'' Lott said. ``We need to get
this done.''
</P>
<P>
   If cloture is approved, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, the Democrats would seek another way to get the
immigration amendments passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fair to say we will work with the White House to
ensure that by the end of this session, there will be a provision
that includes the Latino Fairness Act,'' he said. ``Our first
choice, of course, is H-1B, but if there are other options we'll
look into those.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino Fairness Act that would offer permanent residence to
political refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti
_ a right already granted to people from Cuba and Nicaragua.
Another amendment would grant amnesty for as many as 2 million
undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States since
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of these provisions see a double standard in offering
visas to high-tech workers while the undocumented immigrants
already in this country are fighting for residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to do this for the high-tech workers, why
don't we do this for the Hispanics?'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
asked Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems, wrote in
USA Today this week that raising the cap on the number of skilled
workers allowed into the United States is necessary to keep the
economy on its high-tech roll.
</P>
<P>
   However, some contest whether there really is a shortage of
workers. James Lindsay, a senior fellow at the Washington-based
Brookings Institution, says there have been no high-quality studies
by objective observers done to support the claim there is a need
for immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real question as to whether the high-tech industry has
done all it can to recruit from the existing (domestic) job pool,''
Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay also points out there has been evidence that some firms
like using H-1B workers as a source of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (H-1B workers) are likely to be paid less than a
native-born worker. And their ability to hopscotch to a new job is
hurt by the fact that they can jeopardize their visa status by
doing so because they have to find a new sponsor and all that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether the market can continue to
absorb so many foreign workers. Intel, the biggest chip maker,
lowered its earnings estimates Thursday because of low demand. Some
may wonder whether the tech industry needs extra foreign workers if
it's heading into a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Connie Correll, a spokeswoman for the Information Technology
Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington, insists more
workers are still needed to fill the current demand. Correll points
out that the 115,000 H-1B visas allotted for this year ran out in
March, so there is a large backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure in the short-term we can fill those
jobs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Correll, along with many lawmakers, says the H-1B bill is only a
temporary solution to a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on a long-term solution and that is
strengthening the U.S. education system so we don't have these
types of shortages in the future,'' Correll said.

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 83-15, a bill by Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, to normalize trade relations with China. The
measure would end annual reviews of China's trade status.
Supporters said the bill would be a boon for U.S. companies,
increasing exports to China. Opponents said it would reward a
repressive regime. The bill now goes to the President for his
signature. A ``yes'' vote supports permanent normal trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SPENDING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 28-69, a conference report on
a bill to fund the Treasury Department, Postal Service, legislative
branch and other minor agencies. Supporters said the bill would
provide critical funding. Some opponents said it would allow
legislators to receive pay raises. Others said the Senate was
prevented from debating the bill. A ``yes'' vote supports the
conference report.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1 2

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PILL
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 250-170, a motion by Rep. Tom
Coburn, R-Okla., to urge conferees on an appropriations bill to
prohibit the use of funds to distribute the morning-after pill on
school premises. Supporters said the motion would prevent schools
from allowing children to have abortions without a parent's
consent. Opponents said it would block citizens from making local
decisions about the sensitive issue. A ``yes'' vote supports the
motion on morning-after pills.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 222-201, a motion by Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., to instruct legislators crafting the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill to reject a provision in the Senate version
denying the administration's request for funds to reduce class size
and build schools, instead giving education block grants to the
states. Supporters said the motion would give additional aid for
national educational priorities, including class-size reduction.
Opponents said it would allow federal officials to direct state
programs. A ``yes'' vote supports the education motion.

   Modo looks like a clam or a walnut or a beetle. It sits nicely
in your hand, and its rubber ``tongue'' untoggles from its hooked
carapace to reveal a little screen. Each Modo comes packaged in a
vacuum-sealed hard plastic and silver paper wrapper, and when you
open it, you can hear a whoosh. ``Like it's sealed for freshness,''
explained William Lynch, a Modo promoter. ``Like a pill, a
vitamin,'' he continued, encouragingly. ``Take your Modo.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is the vice president for marketing of Scoutmedia, Modo's
maker, a two-year old, San Francisco-based wireless company. Lynch
described Modo variously as a personal lifestyle device or a
synergistic linking of fashion, media and technology or,
breathlessly, a new paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   You might call Modo a rubber-and-plastic listings magazine, like
Time Out in a pager, because it displays over 1,000 reviews of
restaurants, stores, movies, concerts, clubs and bars. You don't
have to master anything to use one. There is no keypad, but little
dials help you navigate. Reviews are arranged by category. Or
choose ``Gambles,'' which randomly selects listings in all
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Modo also has magazine touches like bylines and tiny features _
100-word interviews with random New Yorkers in random bars, for
instance _ as well as a horoscope, gossip and columnists. The
writers are referred to as ``characters,'' local night life
celebrities, identified only by first names. They file weekly
dispatches, stream-of-consciousness riffs about the places they're
going to. If things go according to plan, there might be
advertising. Modo boasts an editorial office, with four editors and
twice as many grape and blueberry iMacs housed in start-up squalor
on West 17th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Modo has a cheeky, sometimes unfathomable, voice _ ``Sci-fi lily
pads perch on biomorphic chairs,'' it says cryptically in a review
of Rhone, a grim new restaurant on Gansevoort Street. All the
better to bait its hoped-for users, ``socially active urban people
18 to 34,'' according to press materials, or ``the 21-year-old Gap
manager,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Content will change when you go to another Modo city _ San
Francisco and Los Angeles by the middle of October; Chicago by
November; Atlanta, Boston and Miami by the first quarter of next
year; the year after, perhaps, the world. Since their debut in
Manhattan last week, Lynch said, over 2,800 Modos have been sold,
for $99 each and no subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feh!'' you say, just another adorable gadget, all gummy with
information. A Tamaguchi for grown-ups. Or worse, a new city
weekly? Your heart goes out to the four kids on 17th Street, and
you pray that they get a nice run.
</P>
<P>
   Can a wireless magazine be a player? Michael Wolff, the media
columnist for New York magazine and the author of ``Burnrate: How I
Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster),
told me that the future of the wireless business is in mobile
phones. ``To create a new device that bucks that, that exists in a
parallel universe from either a Palm Pilot or the cell phone, is
essentially quixotic,'' he said. Modo, its creators point out, has
no communications ability, and never will.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I don't have a Palm Pilot or a mobile phone. I've been
yearning for a handheld experience, and so I was eager to forge a
relationship with the thing. I liked the Modo manifesto, as told to
me by Daniel S. Bomze, 26, one of Scoutmedia's three founders.
</P>
<P>
   I met him at a Modo party two weeks ago, amid the chocolate
martinis and handpainted leather skirts at Nanette Lepore's SoHo
store. Lepore is a fashion designer and now, a Modo retailer. You
can buy glittering denim Modo bags appliqued with a bronze sequined
heart here for $25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modo is about improvisation and overcoming inertia,'' Bomze
said, vibrating ever so slightly in his pale-blue polo shirt.
``This is not a personal productivity tool, and we'll never make
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   I gave a Modo to Chee Pearlman, a design consultant and the
former editor of ID magazine, the design industry bible. She loved
it. ``There is something about it that's sexual,'' she said. ``It
has a really nice hand interface. It feels good, like a polished
stone, which the Palm does not. I would say that, given the sort of
intellectual property that's being delivered, this is a smart form
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   We discussed the Modo's tactile quality: You don't just click it
open or snap it shut, but really have to engage with it in a
physical way, stretching the rubber tongue toggle into place or
sliding it out again with your thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``That soft rubber feels organic, even anthropomorphic _ a soft
creature thing, like a clam,'' Pearlman mused. ``Or maybe it's an
eye, opening up. So this is a fashion object, too? That's a very
interesting trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Modos will have seasons. New colors will appear. Its little
``clothes'' _ that tongue and a plastic strap you can use to attach
the thing to your belt _ will change colors, too. David Shearer,
the owner of Totem, the modern furniture store in TriBeCa and a
Modo retailer, sees an opportunity here. ``They should do the
Swatch thing, and have limited editions,'' he said. ``You could buy
two and keep one in the plastic, as an investment.'' Totem was sold
out of its first shipment of 35 Modos by last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I've been using Modo like a divining toy _ the Gambles feature
makes it a sort of updated Magic 8 Ball. My friend Bob asked it for
a boyfriend, and it told him to go to Shea Stadium: ``Biggest
scoreboard in the majors,'' it said. (I swear I'm not making this
up.)
</P>
<P>
   One hot and rainy night last week, it sent me to Hell (``no
brimstone, but lots of red velvet'') for a drink, with this
koanlike preamble: ``Eighth deadly sin. Thou shalt not drink
chocolate martinis.'' I haven't yet, but people keep offering them
to me. Then it suggested Rhone for dinner. (``So very Y2K ...'')
Hell was very nice and clean, though empty, at 9:30 on a Tuesday
night. Rhone was mildly unpleasant and not at all clean: the table
was sticky, and a waitress wore a grubby white stretch tank with no
bra and draggy, dirty khakis.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, it sent me to Cherry on Orchard Street _ ``mod mod
whirl. Secondhand heap meets airy boutique'' _ which was heaven. I
tried on fringed leather jackets for half an hour and fondled the
Puccis, which were too expensive, at $300 and $400 for each skirt
and shirt. (Note to Modo editors: Cherry is not ``at Stanton.'' It
is between Stanton and Houston. You might write, ``nr Stanton,'' to
save space.) Modo tried to send me to the Apartment, ``just like
your pad, if it was featured in Surface magazine,'' and then to
Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   I started to balk at this point and went instead to buy fabric
at Zarin's. Modo wanted me to visit the Shaolin Temple, see ``Dark
Days,'' at Cinema Village and go bowling at Bowlmor. (``Those pins
are Day-Glo, baby _ they scream for late night partying.'') Bowlmor
is two blocks from my apartment, so I took that as a sign to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   I checked my horoscope (``Brutal Astrology'') while meandering
down University Place. ``Your soul has been sad. Paint your
toenails and speak Spanish while rolling all over yourself in
semi-darkness.'' Hmm, that doesn't seem like a social activity.
Then it hits me: personal ads.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's missing. I called Ken Miller, editor in chief of
Modo New York, to tell him. He was charmingly Sphinxlike when I
asked if there were any plans like that in the works. He explained
that in Japan they had adult Tamaguchis, which you could program
with personal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get close to someone who is also carrying one, and
who's programmed it with the same sort of affinities,'' he said,
``both Tamaguchis will beep.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine.

 &HT;    Kirk Cameron brings message of faith to teens
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Kirk Cameron, the charming actor who played
teen-idol Mike Seaver on the TV sitcom ``Growing Pains,'' will
bring his message of Christian faith to hundreds of students Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deflating the myth that Hollywood thespians are mostly wild,
Betty Ford Clinic-bound home-wreckers, the 27-year-old Cameron is
an artist with strong convictions and deep religious roots. When
he's not doing turns on Hollywood sound stages, he addresses youth
groups across the country, reminding them that their path to
success should be paved with smart choices and healthy lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time People's Choice Award winner practices what he
preaches. He was voted Father of the Year in 1999 by the National
Fatherhood Initiative and takes an active interest in his pet
project, the Firefly Foundation. The foundation is responsible for
Camp Firefly; an annual retreat for terminally ill children and
their families set in Calaway Gardens, Ga. Cameron also has a new
TV show in the works for the WB network titled ``Kirk'' and
co-starring his real-life wife, actress Chelsea Noble.
</P>
<P>
   And he stars in the film adaptation of the popular ``Left
Behind'' book series. The movie will be released to video later
this fall and will show at theaters this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's visit is being sponsored by the Greater Dayton
Pro-Life Education Foundation. The 20-year-old consortium
disseminates information on anti-abortion issues and child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year in October we bring in a pro-life speaker for the
Catholic high schools because the first week in October is Respect
For Life week for the archdiocese,'' said Julie Penno, the
foundation's executive director. ``Cameron feels like he can really
help young people and tells them to keep their eyes focused on
Christ in all areas of their lives.''

 &HT;    Faith-first efforts, taxes a bad mix
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some things are obvious even to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Faith-based social programs are more successful, less expensive
and less bureaucratic than either government or for-profit
services. Still, they are a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   But secular social programs organized and operated by faith
groups can be a winner for all concerned. There is a huge
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Faith-based social programs deliver meals to the hungry with a
sermon, give beds to the homeless with a prayer and teach sectarian
lessons with every program for the young. That's unconstitutional
and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   But both George W. Bush and Al Gore favor spending tax dollars
to do that. They recognize the clear benefits of religious faith as
a source of motivation and discipline. And they want people to have
a tax-paid opportunity to find that motivating power. Their
intentions are noble and naive.
</P>
<P>
   Both dismiss the clear danger of evangelical fervor perverting
the process. Some enthusiastic followers of Jesus genuinely believe
they must promote Jesus above and beyond any social need such as
food, shelter or reading skills. They cannot stop themselves
without violating their own faith.
</P>
<P>
   Some would require that people accept their version of God to
receive tax-paid services. That kind of litmus test is contrary to
both the Constitution and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the biblical imperative to care for the poor
without trying to convert them drives many of the faithful to good
works. Jesus taught his followers to visit the sick, clothe the
naked and feed the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   They have been doing that for centuries. They work to
rehabilitate people regardless of their religious status because
that's what Jesus did. They do not evangelize. They share God's
love through their actions, thereby demonstrating the faith that
motivates them.
</P>
<P>
   Inner-city churches are on the front line of caring for much of
the human debris left in the wake of a prosperous country. Many do
so today using tax dollars from federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Churches build and manage low-cost housing with public money.
They serve countless meals with government surplus food, run
tax-supported after-school programs and day-care centers for
youngsters in places of worship.
</P>
<P>
   They often add their own money to federal grants, giving the
public a bigger bang for their tax dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And people of faith do that with a sense of joy seldom found in
secular organizations. They are willing to take risks that
bureaucrats can't, and they do so with more initiative, efficiency
and compassion than seems possible with the rigid regulations of
most government programs.
</P>
<P>
   When churches, synagogues and mosques offer human services
unburdened by religious baggage, it's both a wonderful ministry and
a magnificent service to public well being.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the people who offer the ministry are
faith-based, and the programs are not.

PROFESSIONALS PLAY THE STOCK MANIPULATION GAME, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody does it.
</P>
<P>
   That was Jonathan Lebed's response to securities regulators last
week when they nabbed him for a stock manipulation scheme they said
he had conducted as an extracurricular activity. Regulators said
Lebed, a 15-year-old Cedar Grove, N.J., high school student, was
incredulous when told that he had done wrong when he touted nine
companies' stocks on the Internet and made $273,000 doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Between August 1999 and last February, regulators said, Lebed
bought thinly traded stocks, then promoted them in hundreds of
breathless e-mail messages sent to investing chat rooms. As other
investors bought, he sold, in a classic pump and dump scheme,
Securities and Exchange Commission officials said. It was the first
time the commission had sued a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed, neither admitting nor denying the allegations, agreed to
pay back what he had earned in the scheme, plus $12,000 in
interest. No fines or penalties were levied. Yet, in an interview
Wednesday when news of the settlement came out, Lebed's father
waved away the incident's seriousness with the words, ``So they
pick on a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan was definitely wrong to do what he did, and the SEC was
right to pursue him. But he and his father are surely right to feel
miffed. Everybody does do it. Manipulation of stocks is the name of
the game today.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Lebed's scheme was cruder than most. His e-mail
messages were short on facts and long on hype, as evanescent as the
medium on which they were transmitted. For example, a $2 stock
would be worth $20 ``very soon,'' Lebed wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebed is right to wonder exactly how his game differs from
those played by Wall Street equity analysts who place absurd
``price targets'' on stocks. Sure, Wall Street analysts have
degrees in finance, while Lebed as yet does not, and they
themselves may not be selling into the buying frenzy their calls
create. But if their firms benefit by underwriting stock offerings
that are sold to investors on the strength of rising share prices
that their ``targets'' have helped to propel, the analysts are
enriched with bigger bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   And how, precisely, do Lebed's activities differ from the
gunning of stocks by big investors at the end of each day or each
quarter, a practice widely known as window-dressing, to make their
performance look better and attract more investors?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, what about the accounting games that corporate
managements play to keep their stocks aloft? Lebed's alleged
manipulations involved misleading statements. Many of today's most
popular accounting tricks mislead too: For example, so-called pro
forma numbers that reflect only what companies want investors to
see, rather than the entire picture.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors can be misled only if they allow it. And as
long as stocks were skyrocketing, investors seemed happy to close
their eyes to manipulative practices on Wall Street or in corporate
boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are no longer rising, however. All three major indexes
are down for the year. So perhaps investors will begin to take
their blinders off.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they won't. But to a 20-year veteran of the Wall Street
scene, it comes as no surprise that Lebed thought he had done
nothing wrong in his scheme. The teen-ager's coming of age occurred
in a period of stock market mania, when hyping stocks was de
rigueur and when ridicule was showered on those who pointed out the
warts on a company's operations. Lebed is unaware that once upon a
time, Wall Street analysts occasionally uttered cautious views on
shares and did in-depth work to assess a stock's worth. And the
teen-age trader was not yet born when accounting standards were
dutifully followed, not flouted, by corporations. Finally, Lebed is
simply too young to remember the days when investor disbelief was
not in a state of permanent suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Lebed is not to be pitied. But neither is he to
be scorned. He is not just a symptom of our society's addiction to
ever-rising stock prices, he is a creation of it.

A BATTLE FOR ROLLS ROYCE DIVIDES THE LEGACY IN TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ Karl-Heinz Kalbfell carefully held a cast-iron
sculpture of the Rolls-Royce hood ornament, the ``flying lady'' who
reaches into the wind and whose feet seem to lift off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As director of Project Rolls-Royce at the German automaker
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Kalbfell is planning to introduce an
entirely new line of Britain's most prestigious name in cars. But
thanks to a stalemate between BMW and Volkswagen AG, which both
wanted to buy Rolls-Royce two years ago, he has to wait until 2003,
when Volkswagen will relinquish control over the celebrated name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little strange,'' he admitted. ``We came into a
situation which was indeed unique. But we have to cope with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unique does not begin to describe the challenge. Until BMW
acquires the name, Kalbfell is not supposed to even pose in front
of current Rolls-Royce models, much less promote them in any way.
And even when it gets the name, BMW will not be inheriting any
factories and will not be manufacturing current models like Silver
Seraph or Corniche. Instead, it has designed an entirely new car,
which has not been shown in public. The only things certain to
remain the same will be the flying lady, the distinctive Rolls
front grille, and price tags that begin at about $210,000.
</P>
<P>
   All this stems from a Solomon-like deal in which Volkswagen and
BMW essentially split the British company in two. Beginning in
2003, BMW will get rights to the Rolls-Royce name and its icons.
But Volkswagen acquired the factories and the entire operations of
Bentley Motor Cars, the sportier but equally expensive line of cars
that accounts for about two-thirds of Rolls-Royce sales.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear which company was more clever: Is it BMW,
which paid $65 million for the name, or Volkswagen, which paid $780
million for the company?
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that BMW plans to start Rolls-Royce as an entirely
new operation. It will not produce current models, though it may
well use the names. Nor will it use the same engines or chassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be starting from scratch,'' Kalbfell said in a recent
interview at BMW headquarters here. ``We want to make sure that the
way we market is in the good tradition of Rolls-Royce. But at the
same time, and this is very important, too, it has to be in a
direction that is right for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   To smooth the transition, Volkswagen has agreed to produce the
Silver Seraph after 2003 if there is demand. But Volkswagen is more
interested in competing with Rolls-Royce than supporting it, and
BMW does not want to pay Volkswagen for making its cars.
</P>
<P>
   Neither BMW nor Volkswagen wanted to split up Rolls-Royce. Both
wanted to buy the entire company when its former parent, Vickers
PLC, put it up for auction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the two essentially trapped each other. Volkswagen trumped
BMW's bid by offering $780 million for the company, which produces
fewer than 2,000 cars a year at prices of $210,000 to $360,000
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   BMW struck back by capturing claims on the name itself. It did
so by striking a deal with Rolls-Royce PLC, the aircraft engine
manufacturer that had split off from the car company years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Rolls-Royce PLC had the right to block a transfer of the coveted
name to non-British owners, and agreed to sell the right to BMW for
$65 million. After weeks of furtive negotiations, Volkswagen agreed
to surrender the name to BMW and focus on the Bentley as its lead
luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   Kalbfell is not the kind of person who would normally drive a
Rolls-Royce. He created BMW's motor sport division, which makes
racing versions of its road cars and other specialized sport
vehicles. He also orchestrated BMW's re-entry into Formula One
racing several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rolls-Royce's association with history and tradition,
BMW executives decided they had no choice but to build a new
company from the ground up. They say it would be impractical to
adopt what is essentially a built-by-hand production of the
existing models to a new line of cars. And they argue that
Rolls-Royce cars were due for a makeover anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vickers had rescued Rolls-Royce from bankruptcy, it kept
the company on a tight budget for developing new models. To keep
costs down, the company began buying engines and many other
components made by BMW.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW's engines were designed for speed and acceleration, not
for the silent smooth ride of a car created for people with
chauffeurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea to adapt BMW engines was something of a mistake, and
it was one that I think was recognized by executives in the
company,'' said Philip Hall, chief executive of the Sir Henry Royce
Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit organization that keeps extensive
archives on Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sales of Rolls-Royce cars dropped 26 percent in 1999,
from 600 cars to just 444. Part of the reason stemmed from the high
value of the British pound, which made the cars extremely expensive
on the Continent. But given that Bentley sales declined only 1.8
percent, the fall also reflected unhappiness among consumers and
lack of interest by Volkswagen.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   One of Kalbfells' first decisions was to stop using BMW engines,
and come up with something similar to the big V-8 engines that
powered Rolls-Royces for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we intend to do is integrate all the available competence
of the BMW group, but that doesn't mean that it will be made from
BMW parts,'' Kalbfell said.
</P>
<P>
   But engines are comparatively simple to select. Far more
delicate is coming up with a design that still evokes Rolls-Royce's
history while avoiding the cars' increasingly fusty image.
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking over Project Rolls-Royce, Kalbfell assembled a group
of designers from California, Britain and Germany under the
leadership of a Scottish engineer, Ian Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   The group was divided into competing teams and leased offices in
a bank building near Hyde Park. Kalbfell picked the location
because it has one of the highest rates of Rolls-Royce ownership in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to become immersed in the culture,'' Kalbfell
said. ``We needed to get away from the influence of the R&AMP;D Center
here in Munich.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW designers pored over archives at the Rolls-Royce foundation.
They also courted Rolls-Royce dealers and owners' clubs, especially
in England and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   BMW says it has now selected a design and built a prototype car,
but it has not shown it yet to people outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   Kalbfell has also laid plans for a new factory in Goodwood, in
the south of England far away from Rolls-Royce's old home in Derby,
central England. The company will employ about 350 people and be
able to produce about 1,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with Volkswagen, BMW's plans are cautious.
Volkswagen is spending several billion dollars on expansion and
plans to introduce new series of ``midpriced'' Bentleys.
Volkswagen's goal is to increase Bentley sales tenfold, to about
10,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW is still reeling from its last catastrophe in Britain,
the disastrous acquisition of Rover Cars. After losing $6 billion
over six years, BMW essentially gave away most of Rover last spring
and ignited widespread wrath in England for what was viewed as
reneging on its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Rolls-Royce is a much smaller challenge. Despite its reputation
as a producer of cars for royalty, rock stars and the simply rich,
Rolls-Royce is an infinitesimally small company that produces fewer
than 600 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be competition. DaimlerChrysler will be
introducing the Maybach limousine, bigger and more expensive than
even the biggest Mercedes, in 2003. And Volkswagen, in addition to
expanding Bentley, is also pushing high-end sports cars from
Lamborghini and Bugatti.
</P>
<P>
   Rolls-Royce enthusiasts are waiting to see what emerges. But
many Rolls-Royce car dealers have to decide whether to side with
Bentley or Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bentley and Rolls-Royce had already drifted apart in
distribution, as many as a quarter of Rolls-Royce dealers in
Britain still handle the Bentley as well.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the two biggest dealers in Rolls-Royce and Bentley _
H.R. Owen and Jack Barclay _ decided to merge this month. The
combined company will market both lines of luxury automobiles, but
it will separate them into two dealership operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see them being sold alongside one another,'' said
Nicholas Lancaster, the president of H.R. Owen.
</P>
<P>
   Other dealers will have to decide which way to go. But given
that Volkswagen's goal is to sell 10,000 Bentleys a year, compared
with BMW's goal of 1,000 Rolls-Royces, more are likely to stay with
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is ready for both rivals. ``We are in an age when more
people are becoming rich than ever before,'' he remarked. ``The
choices are so small at the very top range of these vehicles that
there is definitely room for more.''

SOUTH KOREA PLEDGES $44 BILLION MORE TO PROP UP AILING BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ South Korea will have to spend another 50
trillion won, or about $44 billion, to prop up domestic banks,
which were hit hard by the collapse of efforts last week to sell
off the nearly bankrupt Daewoo Motor Co., the nation's finance
minister, Jin Nyum, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While officials had anticipated that the $6.9 billion sale of
Daewoo Motor to Ford Motor Co. would reduce bank exposure to the
ailing carmaker, Ford unexpectedly walked away from its bid last
week, creating a sense of urgency for the South Korean government
to accelerate its restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As of December 1999, South Korean financial institutions held
64.5 trillion won of long- and short-term debt from 12 of the
Daewoo Group's largest affiliates, including Daewoo Motor,
according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize to the public and to the National Assembly for the
need to raise additional public funds,'' Jin said at a nationally
televised news conference. ``The economy is currently in a
difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the inauguration of President Kim Dae-jung in February of
1998, the government has pumped in 45.2 trillion won to bolster its
embattled banks, according to the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
The government has pushed financial institutions and companies to
lower debts under the guidelines of a $58 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The government is now seeking approval from the National
Assembly to raise an additional 40 trillion won through a bond
offering and to generate another 10 trillion won by recovering
funds from financial companies that had received earlier government
money, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
   On his appointment last month as finance minister, Jin vowed to
complete the government's overhaul of banking by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   To quell jittery investors, the ministry will release quarterly
progress reports on how the bailout is proceeding, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
   It is still uncertain, however, whether the new injection of
money will be sufficient in itself to bail out the troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the short term, the injection of public funds will be
effective,'' said Kim Dae Shik, an economics professor at Chung Ang
University. ``But over the longer term, bank debts will only
increase again unless the government becomes a tough traffic cop
and resolves corporate debts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korea composite stock price index, a barometer of the
nation's economic mood, fell more than 12 percent Friday,
accelerating a decline that began last week when Ford scrapped its
off to buy Daewoo Motor. South Korean stocks have now lost more
than one-third of their value this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Ford's withdrawal from the Daewoo Motor deal,
creditors of the carmaker have had to pump in more money to keep
operations going. Creditors said this week they would provide the
ailing company with another 100 billion won.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week of bad news, some analysts have hope that the
worst is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the cup as half full,'' said Paulo Rhee, a bank
industry analyst at HSBC Securities here. ``The important thing is
that the government came out publicly. Everything becomes
transparent now.''

 &HT;    Fans in Hidalgo County say blood thicker than bribery case &HT;    By JAMES PINKERTON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
EDINBURG, Texas _ When former Hidalgo County Sheriff Brig Marmolejo
returned to the Rio Grande Valley, longtime friend Al Ramirez was
there for the emotional homecoming.
<P>
   No matter that the 66-year-old Marmolejo had just come home from
almost six years in a federal prison in Florida for a bribery
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter the disgraceful and shocking details of the
sheriff's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in 1994 found Marmolejo guilty of accepting $151,000
worth of cash and merchandise, including an $8,500 designer watch
and a sports car, from a Mexican drug dealer locked up in the
sheriff's care in the Hidalgo County jail.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Marmolejo allowed the trafficker's wife _ and a
girlfriend _ to have conjugal visits in his private office,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A hidden government camera caught the sheriff stuffing into his
boot $10,000 handed over by the trafficker's brother, a Mexican
federal police officer. Marmolejo insisted it was a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a happy group of 50 to 60 friends and relatives of
Marmolejo, draped with yellow ribbons and holding yellow balloons,
swarmed around the ex-sheriff when he arrived at the McAllen
airport. There were the traditional abrazos, or back-slapping hugs,
laughter and tears.
</P>
<P>
   What matters in South Texas is family and the loyalty of
friends. And Marmolejo has plenty of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us welcome him back,'' explains Ramirez, who served as
mayor of this town in the 1960s and who helped think up slogans for
Marmolejo's countywide political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite was ``A Big Man for a Big Job'' splashed across
billboards with pictures of the barrel-chested lawman wearing a big
white cowboy hat, boots and a pistol strapped to his waist, Ramirez
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Marmolejo was first elected sheriff in 1976 and continued to
hold that office even after he was convicted of bribery _ finally
resigning more than three months after his July 27, 1994,
conviction, just days before he was led off to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who resent public officials using his office
and we don't like it. If any of that is true, we don't like anybody
doing that,'' said Ramirez. ``But he's a friend and a relative, and
from that standpoint, we don't care. We forgive him, and he's paid
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Marmolejo's friends and relatives remain convinced
today, as they were back during his 1994 trial, that the longtime
lawman was framed by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   And while few specifics are offered, they say government
officials reportedly were angered over Marmolejo's refusal to
rubber-stamp federal anti-drug efforts that often netted small-time
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brig believes the evidence against him was made up to convict
him,'' said Alex Moreno, an Edinburg attorney and former state
representative who is a cousin of Marmolejo's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of other disputes, these federal officials were mad at
him and were out to convict him of something,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney firmly rejects the accusation the drug trafficker's
trysts were held in the sheriff's office, noting it was in the
center of a busy office next to the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe there was sex going on in his office,''
Moreno said. ``There are so many people who were in close proximity
to his office.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said romantic liaisons also took place in the jail
clinic and law library.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno concedes it was ``poor judgment'' for Marmolejo to accept
a wad of cash from the trafficker's brother, but added it was only
an ``assumption'' it was a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   McAllen defense attorney Al Alvarez, who represented a witness
in Marmolejo's trial, said the exchange of money caught on
videotape sealed the sheriff's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're taking money and stuffing it in your boot, you're
not going to look innocent of taking a bribe,'' Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since his return home, Marmolejo has refused
interviews. At the federal halfway house where he lives, an
official declined an interview request on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-sheriff must check in each night at the Mid-Valley House
Community Corrections Center in Edinburg, a two-story metal
building that looks like a warehouse and shelters 66 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Marmolejo will continue to reside there, across the street from
a citrus processing plant and next door to a tortilla corn mill,
until he is allowed to go home, where he must serve three more
years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week, he works as a legal assistant at the office of
Javier Villalobos, a 34-year-old McAllen attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Villalobos was hired by Marmolejo in 1996 to contest the
government's largely unsuccessful attempt to enforce a $150,000
lien against the ex-sheriff's assets to recover the bribe money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was coming (back) and I knew he needed some
employment,'' Villalobos said. ``And whenever I talked to him, he
was always very gentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I thought it would benefit me to have somebody like him
around,'' said the attorney. ``He knows a lot of people so it's
been good for me, and it's good for business.''
</P>
<P>
   Villalobos, who serves as city attorney for the communities of
Donna and Progreso, said Marmolejo assists him with legal research
and administrative matters and may help investigate minor traffic
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great,'' Villalobos said. ``We're talking about the
most punctual man I've ever met and a straight shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit down and talk to the man, and he has so many
amazing stories, it's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   But to a government prosecutor who helped put Marmolejo behind
bars, the only story he finds incredible is the sheriff's continued
refusal to take responsibility for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now working as a runner for the attorney for the city of
Donna. Why am I not surprised?'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg
Surovic.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Donna has been rocked by police corruption scandals
of its own. A former police chief and other officers pleaded guilty
to escorting drug loads through the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad he hasn't come to terms with his guilt himself, but I
hope he overcomes his current attitude and becomes a productive
member of society,'' said Surovic.

   AUCTION-ANTITRUST (New York) _ Sotheby's and Christie's
tentatively agreed Friday to pay $512 million to settle claims that
the world's most powerful auction houses cheated buyers and sellers
in a price-fixing scheme that dates back to 1992. The proposed
civil settlement, reported by lawyers but not officially announced,

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT OPENS NEW WEB LINK TO ALL ITS SERVICES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government cranked up a new Internet
``home page'' Friday that will allow Americans to access all its
services from a single site.
</P>
<P>
   From this Web portal _ www.firstgov.gov _ citizens can check on
their Social Security benefits, read trial transcripts, reserve a
campsite at a national park, view an up-to-the-minute local weather
map, apply for a student loan or perform a myriad of other tasks
with a few clicks of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which includes a search engine and an extensive index,
provides a connection to 27 million federal agency Web pages on
20,000 separate sites, said David Barram, head of the General
Services Administration (GSA).
</P>
<P>
   The new system can search half a billion documents in less than
a quarter of a second and handle millions of such searches per day.
And unlike government offices, firstgov.gov never closes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By using the keyword search, a citizen can find the needed
information without knowing which federal agency is involved,
Barram explained. For instance, by typing in ``food stamps,'' a
needy mother could apply without needing to know that the
Agriculture Department administers the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, the problem has been finding the
information'' amid a profusion of federal Web sites, said Thomas
Kalil, special assistant to the president for economic policy. ``It
has been like a library without a card catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   However, firstgov.gov deals only with publicly available
documents and provides no private data. You can't look up your
brother-in-law's tax returns, or your own. Privacy is protected,
Barram said, and there will be no tracking of user information.
</P>
<P>
   The system includes all three branches of the federal government
_ executive, judicial and legislative _ as well as independent
agencies. It is also linked into state and local government sites.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Barram said firstgov.gov was made possible
by a powerful new search engine developed by Eric Brewer, who is
co-founder of Inktomi Corp., a Silicon Valley software development
company, and a professor of computer science at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Barram said Brewer created a non-profit organization called the
Federal Search Foundation that created the search engine. The
foundation is funded primarily by Brewer personally, but with
in-kind contributions from Inktomi and Sun Microsystems, the GSA
said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation will run firstgov.gov for three years and then
withdraw when the government hires a contractor through competitive
bidding, said Barram, a Silicon Valley veteran himself and former
chief financial officer of Apple Computers.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is ``having a government that understands and uses the
Internet,'' said Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the first step,'' he predicted. Already, federal
agencies care more ``about how they appear online'' and are paying
more attention to their Web sites, he said.
</P>

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 83-15, a bill by Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, to normalize trade relations with China. The
measure would end annual reviews of China's trade status.
Supporters said the bill would be a boon for U.S. companies,
increasing exports to China. Opponents said it would reward a
repressive regime. The bill now goes to the President for his
signature. A ``yes'' vote supports permanent normal trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SPENDING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 28-69, a conference report on
a bill to fund the Treasury Department, Postal Service, legislative
branch and other minor agencies. Supporters said the bill would
provide critical funding. Some opponents said it would allow
legislators to receive pay raises. Others said the Senate was
prevented from debating the bill. A ``yes'' vote supports the
conference report.

   The House on Tuesday approved, 250-170, a motion by Rep. Tom
Coburn, R-Okla., to urge conferees on an appropriations bill to
prohibit the use of funds to distribute the morning-after pill on
school premises. Supporters said the motion would prevent schools
from allowing children to have abortions without a parent's
consent. Opponents said it would block citizens from making local
decisions about the sensitive issue. A ``yes'' vote supports the
motion on morning-after pills.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 222-201, a motion by Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., to instruct legislators crafting the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill to reject a provision in the Senate version
denying the administration's request for funds to reduce class size
and build schools, instead giving education block grants to the
states. Supporters said the motion would give additional aid for
national educational priorities, including class-size reduction.
Opponents said it would allow federal officials to direct state
programs. A ``yes'' vote supports the education motion.

 &HT;    Strong and proud, Haworth is someone to see
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ As America's strongest woman stood next to the world's
strongest on the Olympic medal stand Friday, you wondered if they
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we were both too caught up in the moment,'' Cheryl
Haworth, the bronze medalist in the over-75 kilograms (165 pounds)
weight class said after listening to the Chinese national anthem
played in honor of gold medal winner Meiyuan Ding.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the 17-year-old, 307-pound high school senior from
Savannah, Ga. _ the girl they call Fun, as in tons of fun _ began
to smile. She knows a little Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know two things,'' she said. `` I can say, 'Here are your
eyes, sir!'' and 'You can't have enough slave laborers.' ``
</P>
<P>
   She learned the lingo watching ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means she can thank Bart for teaching her a phrase she
could have used Friday during the women's Olympic weightlifting
competition at the Sydney Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   As Ding, Haworth and Poland's Agata Wrobel put on a show in the
11-woman competition, fans got more bug-eyed with each massive
effort, four of which produced eight new world and Olympic records.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth especially stirred the imagination since she is _ in the
words of U.S. women's Olympic coach Mike Cohen _ ``just a child,
the youngest American ever to medal in weightlifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching her Friday was like watching a high school baseball
player hit home run after home run in the Major Leagues. While
figure skaters, gymnasts and tennis players reach the heights of
their sport as young girls, women lifters usually don't hit prime
until about 30.
</P>
<P>
   The never wavering Haworth snatched 275 pounds and clean and
jerked 319 pounds to finish third. Ding won with a pair of world
record lifts, a 297 snatch and a 363 clean and jerk. Wrobel
snatched 291.5 and jerked 357.5.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth never struggled on her lifts and afterward admitted she
could have lifted more, but followed her coach's advice to play
things safe and assure herself a medal. Although it was highly
unlikely she could have caught the other two, the strategy didn't
sit well with some Haworth family members. Cohen took the heat _''
I'm a dictator, I make all the decisions,'' _ and explained his
protective strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be careful with young lifters,'' he said. ``But
I'll tell you right now, by the time the 2004 Games roll around,
she's going to be something to see.''
</P>
<P>
   She already is _ so much so that teammate Tara Nott decided to
skip a last-minute gold medal ceremony cobbled together for her
Friday afternoon so she could watch Haworth compete. On Sunday, the
106-pound Nott won the silver medal in the 48kg competition.
Bulgaria's Izabela Dragneva won gold, but on Friday, officials
announced she had tested positive for use of diuretics. She was
stripped of the medal and IOC officials came to Nott just before
noon and told her they wanted to give her the medal in a ceremony
at the Athletes' Village on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Nott and Cohen _ like everyone else _ thought the ceremony
should take place at the weightlifting competition, so family
members and fans could be present for the first American gold medal
in weightlifting in 40 years. The IOC said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think twice about it then,'' Nott said. ``I
wasn't going to miss seeing Cheryl compete.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nott is the poster child of women's weightlifting in America,
then Haworth is the billboard. Heavier than most NFL linemen _ and
stronger than many, too _ this bountiful bar belle is 5-foot-9, has
17 inch biceps, 32-inch thighs, runs the 40 yard dash in 5.5
seconds and has a 30-inch vertical leap.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to one of the most impressive Olympic athletes
at these Games. And if she turns heads here, imagine what happens
back in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that a local high school coach refused to bring his
players into the weight room because he didn't want them
intimidated. In her three-hour daily practices, Haworth often lifts
25 tons of weight or the equivalent of five African elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Those capabilities kept her back in the weight room Friday as
eight of the women from around the world lifted to their limits.
Then the door opened and as the song ``She's A Brick House,''
blared from speakers in the convention center, Haworth came
lumbering toward the stage. Cohen was behind her massaging her
shoulders and giving her an animated pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is her personal coach, as well. He said he knew he had a
talent that first day Haworth's dad brought her into his Savannah
gym. Just 13, Haworth walked straight over to a bar with 110 pounds
on it and lifted it like a broom stick.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth put on a similar show Friday, but she said she was not
in the same league at the other medalists. ``I've never gotten
close to what they lifted today,'' she said. ``I just concentrated
on doing what I needed to do and I let China and Poland battle it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time women's weight lifting has been a medal
sport at the Olympics and Haworth said the spectacle gave a
valuable lesson to young girls who happen to be big.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an Olympic stereotype that you've got to be small,''
Haworth said. ``But we're not all little gymnasts. People need to
realize we're Olympic athletes no matter how we look.''
</P>
<P>
   Television has billed these as The Glamour Games _ concentrating
on feline sleek sprinters, rippled soccer players and pixie
gymnasts _ and Haworth believes she and her colleagues fit under
that same umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glamour is similar to beauty, it's in the eye of the
beholder,'' she said. ``Weightlifting can be glamorous. It's
something that's strong and beautiful and fun. It's a pretty nice
to see everyone can be special at something.''
</P>
<P>
   As she fingered the bronze medal she held in her hand, she
grinned: ``I'll willingly accept being the third strongest woman in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that an Ohio sportswriter asked if he could hold her
medal. She sized him up as if he were just another dumbbell, then
grinned ``Yeah okay, but I'm going to hold onto this end.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave him the medal, but kept hold of the the velvety blue
cord from which it hung. The writer didn't argue. He didn't want to
hear her Chinese. He didn't want her to hand him his eyes.

 &HT;    Adding bounce to the Olympics
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Haven't had the pleasure of meeting the man who
invented running, but then he got eaten and soon forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Just missed the first discus maker, Greek fellow, big for his
age, by a couple empires.
</P>
<P>
   Probably wouldn't want to make the acquaintance of whoever came
up with the shuttlecock.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the great Sydney Superdome hall was the biological
father of the newest sport on the already overcrowded Olympic menu.
Quite alive and receiving visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four years ago, back in Iowa, George Nissen stretched some
canvas taut, attached it by bedsprings to a metal frame and
starting bouncing. Now, what to call this plaything. He went over
some options: Bouncer, Magic Carpet, Aerialmat. Then Nissen settled
on a variation of what he had heard the Mexicans call a diving
board, and the trampoline was coined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 50 years to get this in the Olympics,'' said
Nissen, now 86 and still spry enough on a good day to rip off a
handstand. See, all one needs to get a hobby recognized by the
Olympic movement is a little patience. Whoever holds the patent on
the hula hoop and the tetherball must be heartened.
</P>
<P>
   Nissen would go around the world promoting his product. He'd
demonstrate in any school, any gym that would have him. Marketed it
to the armed forces during World War II as a part of preflight
training. He had his picture taken bouncing amid the pyramids. It
would take even greater salesmanship to sway the Olympic honchos.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the matter was up in the air for quite some while.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they bought it. Twelve women of various nationalities
marched into the hall this night, a certified part of the
gymnastics program.
</P>
<P>
   They bounced and soared 20 feet in the air and did pointy-toed
maneuvers while trying to hit the trampoline as perpendicular to
the floor as possible. Then three of them received medals, worth
just as much as any necklace Marion Jones is going to win.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, blame George. If only he had tried farming.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate to avoid the stigma of winning not a single
gymnastics medal in Sydney, the U.S. women were ready to claim
whatever could be negotiated on the trampoline. This was no time
for pride.
</P>
<P>
   But like everything else that involves flipping and spinning in
Sydney, the Americans weren't particularly spectacular at this
trampolining, no matter who invented it. Californian Jennifer
Parilla, 19, the youngest bouncer in the field, was the last hope.
But a sloppy optional exercise, in which she lost height and landed
outside one of the boundary lines doomed her to ninth in the
qualification. Eight advanced to the final. No American is in the
men's competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the only American the first time in the Olympics was the
biggest honor,'' she said. Like you wouldn't expect her to bounce
back quickly?
</P>
<P>
   And how did she think her sport was received? ``I think the
crowd likes it. And I think you guys (the media) are lovin' it.''
There goes Parilla's career as a media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those with no inner ear problems or fear of heights,
this could be a ticket to Olympic glory. The way it keeps adding
sports, the Olympic movement will not be satisfied until everyone
on the planet gets a chance to march in an opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   So, quit telling your kids to stop bouncing on the bed. You
might be costing them a medal.
</P>
<P>
   Gold this night was reserved for Irina Karavaeva, a world
champion since 1994 who claims on her bio to be listed among
Russia's top 10 athletes. How the mighty have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Her endorsement is clear. ``It is a particularly beautiful
sport,'' said trampoline's first Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
   With those kind words, let us place trampolining in the column
of quirky Olympic sports we have little time for. But an Olympic
sport nonetheless. George Nissen's invention is not just for
halftime shows anymore.

 &HT;    NBC's Olympic blues
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They're blaming everything from school to
football to baseball to the Internet to the International Date
Line. Even the U.S. gymnastics teams are getting some heat in NBC's
struggle to figure out why Olympics ratings are down _ about 10
percent lower than the numbers promised to advertisers. And that's
not good.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is in trouble with its Olympic coverage _ ratings aren't
bad, but they're about 32 percent lower than those earned in 1996,
when the Games were shown live from Atlanta. And there's the rub:
We're not seeing things as they happen, and it's difficult to keep
doing the 15-hour-time-difference math. Hardly anything's live this
year, save NBC's well-done Web site (www.nbcolympics.com), which
provides up-to-date results around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   What we're watching on television is chopped up, overdone,
overthought, overwrought and overedited hunks of taped footage that
can't hold our interest. So we send the kids to bed on time; switch
to baseball pennant races or ``Monday Night Football;'' and log on
to check out what happened in Australia yesterday, which is our
today.
</P>
<P>
   We've got Olympic ``moments'' on the Sydney Opera House, and Tom
Brokaw doing the ``Nightly News'' from Sydney _ why, again, is he
there? Brokaw did contribute one schmaltzy ``moment'' about an
Australian spy who saved John F. Kennedy's life. But it came in the
middle of the Games themselves, leaving us to wonder to what
lengths Brokaw will go to promote his ``Greatest Generation''
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric and Matt Lauer do their ``Today'' ``morning'' show
live from Sydney, where it's a quite dark 10 p.m. By that time,
another day's competition has been completed, and poor Katie and
Matt keep telling viewers to turn the sound down if they want to be
surprised while watching that evening's prime-time broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas Olympic television broadcasts usually get lower ratings
than those hosted by the United States, but Sydney's are doing even
worse than Seoul's, back in 1988, by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nobody's watching _ NBC won the week's ratings
race with an average of 16.5 million prime-time viewers per night,
topping ABC's 10.2 million and CBS' 8.3 million. But, taking Sunday
night as an example, 16.5 million folks watched Regis Philbin _
again _ and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' instead of the
Olympics, which had a not-too-shabby 24 million viewers
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The Games have had their share of ``moments'' and plenty of
personality _ Ian Thorpe, Lenny Krayzelburg, Eric Moussambani from
Equatorial Guinea, who flailed through his 100-meter freestyle
swim, setting a record for perseverance. It's been a pool party so
far, with Jenny Thompson proving she's a record-setting team
swimmer (7 gold medals, all in relays) who can't seem to do it
alone (a tie for bronze as an individual). Records are being set
with every splash, but on television, one 100-meter backstroke
looks pretty much like the rest, no matter how fast the swimmers
are going.
</P>
<P>
   Our national fascination with gymnastics is waning, but which
came first _ dwindling interest, or lousy U.S. performances?

   Television's not helping. The event commentators are failing to
distinguish themselves, save Andres Cantor, the soccer guy whose
signature ``Goooo(backslash)ooaal!!!'' is getting ooooold. Even Bob
Costas seems slightly bored, providing uninspired introductions to
competitions so highly edited they seem scripted.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Monday night's Olympics just barely beat Monday
Night Football, a Cowboy-Redskins game televised in real time, with
a result that happened as we saw it happen.
</P>
<P>
   A rare event these days.

   HALL (Undated) - Gary Hall Jr. has been called a phenom, a
loser, a drug user, a diabetic, and now an Olympic champion. In an
Olympics that truly tested his character -- he had a diabetic
reaction, and his father suffered toxic shock and had to be
hospitalized, while in the pool he was blamed for the 4x100 loss --
he put together the race of his life and won gold. By NORM
FRAUENHEIM. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``S'' categories.
</P>
<P>
   ERVIN (Undated) - It's a story line that Anthony Ervin despises,
yet can't escape. The Phoenix Swim Club member has become the first
African-American to win an Olympic medal of any kind. The fact it
was a gold, shared with his training partner Gary Hall Jr., is what
Ervin would rather have us focus on. But he can't escape being a
pioneer. By NORM FRAUENHEIM. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``S''
categories.

 &HT;    TEXAS SENATOR URGES ACCEPTANCE OF NEW IDEAS FROM MEXICO
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In contrast to the lukewarm reception he got in
Washington last month, Mexican
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vicente Fox was praised Friday as a
``visionary'' with worthy ideas by a visiting U.S.
</P>
<P>
   congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, a bipartisan
group of seven lawmakers _ three senators and four House members _
met with Fox and current Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Fox ``reminded me of a Texas entrepreneur. He had that
entrepreneurial spirit, the vision, the ideas and
</P>
<P>
   enthusiasm,'' Hutchinson said in a meeting with U.S. reporters
here.
</P>
<P>
   The group discussed with Fox a proposal pending in Congress that
calls for a moratorium on the
</P>
<P>
   U.S. certification of Mexico and other countries as reliable
drug fighting partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have two new presidents only next year for both of our
countries,'' Hutchinson, one of the
</P>
<P>
   proposal's sponsors, said. ``We wanted to give time to the two
new presidents to work together on mutual
</P>
<P>
   plans that would address the issue of this criminal element in
both our societies together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us in Congress have tried and would like to see our
certification law modified so that it is
</P>
<P>
   more of a mutual working relationship rather than what has been
perceived (by Mexico) to be a grading,''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so looking forward to the next six years,'' she added,
referring to Fox's six-year term, which
</P>
<P>
   begins in December.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with U.S. reporters, Hutchinson said Fox explained
an idea for an ``infrastructure
</P>
<P>
   partnership'' to boost the pace of commercial traffic on the
border with more roads, bridges and entry
</P>
<P>
   points between Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During meetings in Canada, Washington, D.C. and Dallas last
month, Fox proposed creating a
</P>
<P>
   North American development fund with billions of U.S. and
Canadian dollars that could help Mexico develop
</P>
<P>
   employment in impoverished areas. The idea, which Fox said would
curb illegal migration, was not immediately embraced by Canadian
leaders or President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also met with Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic Party
presidential nominee, and Texas Gov.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the Republican Party nominee. Neither endorsed the
development fund idea either.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks Friday, Hutchinson and other delegates stopped short
of approving Fox's idea, which resembles
</P>
<P>
   a European Union fund for poor member countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegates urged serious consideration of a fund for
improving border infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the border infrastructure idea has a lot of merit. I
don't necessarily want to throw cold water
</P>
<P>
   on a very visionary idea,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said, ``There's probably more goodwill
in the United States right now,
</P>
<P>
   particularly in the U.S. Congress, toward Mexico than there has
been at any other time, certainly in my
</P>
<P>
   memory, in my 16 years there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president of Mexico, President Fox, wants to boldly
suggest ideas like . . . funding mechanisms, now is the time to do
it, early in his administration,'' he said.

   Got a script you want to send to an agent, but nervous (given
the blood, sweat, toil and tears you've invested) about your
precious baby actually arriving? Go to Final Draft's Web site
(www.finaldraft.com) and with a click, you can set up an account
through UPS to securely e-mail your precious product to whomever
you want.
</P>
<P>
   The price, charged monthly, is relatively cheap _ $2.50 for the
first 120 pages (that's a two-hour movie, too short for David Lean
but fine for the rest of us). If the recipient doesn't have Final
Draft, which is one of the big scriptwriting programs, they can
download a free reader program from the Web site to check out the
script.
</P>
<P>
   Is the service worth the price? Well, a company spokeswoman says
the main benefits are that it's secure (literally
industrial-strength 128-bit encryption through UPS) and trackable,
so you can make sure it was received by only the person you sent it
to. And it's a lot quicker and cheaper than printing and delivering
a hard-copy version of your masterwork.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's interesting that UPS is involved in this high-tech
delivery system, the real question is whether an even more
hidebound institution, Hollywood, is ready to receive scripts that
can't easily be read while sitting by the pool at the Beverly Hills
Hotel. &QL; 
GADGETS DU JOUR &QL; 
Those with small children or small hands will appreciate Datadesk
Technologies' new LittleFingers computer keyboard. Datadesk
``smushed'' the keys together so the entire contraption is only
12.5 inches long, even though it also includes a full array of
function keys and a built-in three-button trackball. The company
says the keys are sized and spaced to improve children's typing
performance.
</P>
<P>
   I like the fact that Datadesk has made the keyboard compatible
with both older Macintoshes (those with ADB ports) and PCs (those
with PS/2 ports), though I hope to see a model that uses the USB
port found on newer Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also rigged the keyboard to allow both it and an
adult-size keyboard and mouse to be attached to the same port on a
Windows-based PC, a small but useful trick for parents who want to
work with their children, or who also use the same computer. Go to
www.data- desk.com for more information.
</P>
<P>
   I also recommend Belkin Components' great USB BusStation, which
quells the most annoying part of USB connectivity: trying to manage
all the devices you want to connect through these ports.
</P>
<P>
   The BusStation gives you seven new USB ports (your computer
probably comes with two, and some keyboards and monitors will give
you another one or two).
</P>
<P>
   If, somehow, being able to connect your scanner, printer, PDA
docking station, videocamera, joystick, external hard drive and
rewritable CD-ROM drive isn't enough, or you have other kinds of
devices, you can buy additional interchangeable modules. BusStation
currently offers modules, in several colors, to add not only more
USB ports but also Ethernet, serial-port and SCSI devices for
either Apple Power Macintosh or Windows-based PCs. Go to
www.belkin.com for more information. &QL;

DISCONNECTING THE ALARM? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 24, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Al Gore wants to do something about oil prices by tapping
into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. George Bush says it's a bad
idea. ``The Strategic Reserve is an insurance policy meant for a
sudden disruption of our energy supply or for war,'' says Bush.
``These reserves should not be used as an attempt to drive down oil
prices right before an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Do-Something vs. Mr. Stand-There. We'll see which stance
fares better in the general election. Then we'll see what happens
next _ what part of the economic landscape remains the same and
what part of it has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it's ironic that Republicans are shocked and
surprised that Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has neglected his
job, which includes keeping tabs on the oil cartel known as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. (After all, it was
the GOP who laid siege to Richardson for the last two years over
alleged espionage by China.) With oil approaching $38 a barrel,
Richardson is embarrassed, as is his boss Bill Clinton _ but so is
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Equally ironic, however, is the situation in which the Democrats
find themselves on the eve of the election. Last week a fierce
disagreement loomed between Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and
candidate Gore, until both sides stepped back a little. The day
before Gore was to deliver a major policy speech on the use of the
oil reserve to halt rising prices, a Summers memo to President
Clinton was leaked to The Wall Street Journal. It sharply
criticized the outlines of the position the candidate was expected
to take.
</P>
<P>
   In unusually strong language, Summers described government oil
sales as ``a major and substantial policy mistake'' and added that
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan concurred. The problem was
that such sales easily might backfire. Such interventions were hard
enough in currency markets; in commodity markets they easily could
make matters worse. The next day Gore called only for ``test
sales'' from the oil reserve. Summers in turn described the plan as
a ``prudent use'' of government resources which ``could be
appropriate in current circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of thing that people worry about with Al Gore _
that he has no instinctive appreciation for the fundamental,
intricate interconnectedness of economic institutions. Witness his
recent attacks on big pharmaceutical companies and international
oil firms. Gore's vulnerability to this point has been handled by
tying him to Summers, whom financial markets would expect to see
reappointed to the Treasury should Gore win. Like his mentor Robert
Rubin, Summers is thought to be the markets' friend. (His run-in
with the vice president in 1993 on issues of pollution and African
development, when he was just coming aboard from the World Bank, is
said to be long forgotten. Perhaps it is.)
</P>
<P>
   So it is at least a further irony _ perhaps it is something to
worry about _ that, for all his intuition, Summers himself is
committed to discarding a far more potent tool for the management
of the economy than the oil reserve. I mean, of course, the market
for government debt.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a couple of years ago that President Clinton
proposed that the govenment pay down its debt, as improbable as
that sounds, if projected budget surpluses hold up. Gore has
proposed eliminating government borrowing by 2012; George Bush
would take until 2016.
</P>
<P>
   There's a huge demand for Treasury debt on the part of
investors, of course: government bonds are the lowest-risk
interest-bearing securities around. But conservative investors
presumably would turn to other instruments to serve as benchmarks,
high-quality corporate issues and government agency debt. The
disappearance of the huge, highly liquid market for government
obligations bonds would make it harder for the Federal Reserve
Board to conduct monetary policy. The Fed, too, could learn to
cope. After all, it managed nicely in the 1950s, when there was
relatively little government debt.
</P>
<P>
   But why turn out the lights on a market which has served in the
recent past as a kind of governor on the American economy? ``Bond
market vigilantes'' on various occasions have heavily influenced
the conduct of policy by selling bonds and driving up interest
rates _ never more so than when inflation fears forced the
appoinment of Paul Volcker by President Carter in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But then maybe that's exactly the point. In the current New York
Review of Books, the distinguished Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economist Robert Solow lists the pros and cons of paying
the debt. The decline of the bond market in the end might have the
advantage of ``making government decisions less vulnerable to the
whims of financial operators'' at times when ``more expert opinion
thinks faster economic growth entirely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that ``more expert opinion'' that worries me.

WILSON'S SPIRITUAL SYMPHONY
</HEADLINE>
  Brian Wilson back in harmonious form with `Pet Sounds' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sunday, Sept. 24) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ITAL)And if you want to find me, I'll be
</P>
<P>
   Out in my sandbox,
</P>
<P>
   Wondering where the hell
</P>
<P>
   All the love has gone.
</P>
<P>
   Playing my piano and building
</P>
<P>
   Castles in the sun,
</P>
<P>
   And singing `Fun, Fun, Fun'.(ENDITAL)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Barenaked Ladies, from their song ``Brian Wilson''
</P>
<P>
   It's telling that Beach Boys genius Brian Wilson performs this
good- natured song himself these days, addressing his own myth with
a shy smile.
</P>
<P>
   That Wilson is performing at all is something of a miracle, but
we'll get to that later. The fact is, Wilson is finding out where
the love has gone when he looks out at the adoring audiences
gathered to hear him sing the classic songs from his cherished 1966
Beach Boys masterpiece, ``Pet Sounds,'' backed by an orchestra and
his longtime touring unit, the Wondermints.
</P>
<P>
   The Pet Sounds Symphonic Tour comes to the Hollywood Bowl on
Sunday and moves to Humphrey's in San Diego on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're picking up orchestras in every city,'' Wilson explained.
``I thought it was time to try an experiment. It was suggested to
me by my wife and manager, who said it might be a good idea to do
'Pet Sounds' with strings. I said, 'No, no, no.' They said, 'You
know damn well it'll go over great.'''
</P>
<P>
   The early signs were promising. A few months ago, Wilson and the
10-piece Wondermints did two sold-out nights at the Sunset Strip's
intimate Roxy, where they recorded a 26-track live album that
included note-for-note reproductions of such ``Pet Sounds'' gems as
``Caroline, No,'' ``Sloop John B.'' and ``God Only Knows''
(available at www.brianwilson.com).
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the recording was the idea of Wilson's wife,
Melinda, whom he married in 1995. Laughing and joking with the
crowd, Wilson was a strong and rejuvenated presence on those
nights, easily navigating the legendary intricacies of his
34-year-old arrangements, which include complex voicings,
meticulous harmonies and subtle melodic shifts.
</P>
<P>
   As Wilson put it: ``It wasn't as easy as it sounds. I had to
keep drilling them until they got it right. Eventually, it all came
together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often said the highly influential ``Pet Sounds'' is more a
Wilson solo project than a Beach Boys album. Session musicians,
including bassist Carol Kaye and drummer Hal Blaine, played most of
the parts even while the spiritual quality of the material is
enhanced by the gorgeous upper-register vocals of Brian and younger
brother Carl Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   When Brian wasn't singing during the 1965-66 ``Pet Sounds''
sessions at such legendary Hollywood studios as Western, Sunset
Sound and Gold Star, he was conducting a 23-piece orchestra,
creating lush, dense arrangements that were cut live, giving the
album its unusual intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   To musicians such as Paul McCartney, ``Pet Sounds'' is an
emotional touchstone, the first real concept album.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote out all the bass lines,'' recalled Kaye, who played
bass on all but three tracks on the album. ``You could tell he
wasn't educated in music but had a great natural talent. We had no
sense it would be a classic. I knew at the time it was great music
for the kind of pop it was. It was probably the greatest pop music
we were recording at that time, and we were cutting records with
lots of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian had some very unusual ideas _ they were symphonic ideas
for bass lines. I would come up with my own bass lines for other
records, but with Brian, it was different. He heard bass in a very
different way.''
</P>
<P>
   During the making of ``Pet Sounds'' _ which was a relatively low
seller in the United States compared to previous Beach Boys albums
but went to No. 2 in Britain _ Wilson, then 24, combined
conventional keyboards and guitars with the exotic sounds of
strings, bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, the Theremin,
Coke cans, barking dogs and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a kid then,'' Wilson, 58, said recently. ``How
could I know what it would become? I didn't know what I was getting
into. But it's good for people to hear that album. A lot of love
went into making it. It was disappointing when it didn't sell, but
I realized it was pretty arty for the public at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the 1967 recording of the follow-up to ``Pet
Sounds,'' the aborted ``Smile'' project _ which was supposed to
take the innovations of ``Pet Sounds'' to new heights and top that
album, the Beatles' ``Revolver'' and ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band'' combined _ that Wilson began showing signs of the
strain and psychological damage that would derail his career for
the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through times that were so scary that I wasn't sure I'd
make it through,'' he says today.
</P>
<P>
   Whether due to pressure to top himself and compete with the
Beatles (whose ``Rubber Soul'' sparked Wilson to create ``Pet
Sounds''), internal disagreements within the Beach Boys, mental
illness or drug abuse, Wilson ceded leadership of the Beach Boys
and came off the road for good, retiring to his Hollywood home.
</P>
<P>
   As the Barenaked Ladies refer to it in their ``Brian Wilson''
song, Wilson at one point placed a sand box beneath the piano in
his living room for inspiration. Eventually, the sand box was
dragged back outside _ the cats were using it as a litter box.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson couldn't be dragged outside, or anywhere else for
that matter, although in the years that followed he remained a key
contributor to the Beach Boys' albums, writing some of their most
affecting work, including hit singles like ``Do It Again'' and
``Sail on Sailor'' and the album cuts ``Til I Die'' and ``Add Some
Music to Your Day.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1988 that Wilson's first solo album was issued,
but the self-titled disc was mired in controversy over live-in
therapist Eugene Landy's unorthodox techniques in caring for
Wilson. Many felt the album was artistically compromised and Wilson
was not calling his own shots.
</P>
<P>
   With his marriage to Melinda and the addition of daughters Daria
and Delanie, however, Wilson began to make dramatic, positive
changes in his life.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed to an album project with an old friend,
composer-arranger-producer Van Dyke Parks, who was initially
enlisted by Wilson to write lyrics for the never-released ``Smile''
(considered one of the legendary lost albums of the '60s). He
participated in the documentary film and soundtrack ``I Just Wasn't
Made for These Times'' and helped with ``The Wilsons,'' an album on
which Brian joined daughters Carnie and Wendy for a few tracks and
reunited with ``Pet Sounds'' lyricist Tony Asher on one cut.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of activity that gave fans hope that Wilson
would again attempt a genuine solo album on which every note was
the way he wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 after years of sporadic activity, Wilson recorded
``Imagination,'' which included songs co-written with the likes of
Carole Bayer Sager, J.D. Souther and Jimmy Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, Wilson, the last of the Wilson brothers who
founded the Beach Boys in Hawthorne in 1961 (Dennis drowned in 1985
and Carl succumbed to cancer in 1998) had returned.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it seemed Wilson could handle a concert tour. The
Wilson- obsessive Wondermints were brought in and shows took place
in several cities, including Los Angeles at the Wiltern Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to reinterpret the tracks,'' remembered
Chicago-based saxophonist-flutist Paul Mertens, who plays with the
Wondermints on the Wilson ``Pet Sounds'' tour. ``We set out to
re-create the spirit and sound of the original recordings as much
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later came the Roxy shows, and talks began about a
``Pet Sounds'' symphonic trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of excitement about it immediately,'' observed
Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert industry weekly Pollstar.
``It wasn't that huge a tour, and most of the venues outside of the
Hollywood Bowl have been intimate, but Brian didn't set out to do
an amphitheater tour. I think he accomplished what he wanted to do
_ and that's connect with his fans using some of his greatest, most
beautiful music.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks, the ``Smile'' collaborator and lyricist of the Beach Boys
hit ``Heroes &AMP; Villains,'' who will conduct the Hollywood Bowl
Orchestra tonight in a 20-minute suite of some of Wilson's major
musical themes outside of ``Pet Sounds,'' agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That album, those songs ... it was the first sophisticated
approach to pop music,'' he said. ``It was like a Chinese box: The
more you hear, the more it opens up. This piece I'm conducting _ it
was my tribute to a man and a music I love.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Beverly Hills-based Wilson, he's no longer wondering
where all the love has gone. He sees it in front of him each night
he performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the people scream 'I love you,' it pumps me up,'' he
reflects. ``It's good for my ego and good for my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   And anything that's good for Brian Wilson's heart and ego is
ultimately good for everyone. &QL;

  Rockabilly legends strut their stuff for new generation 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Sunday' refers to Sept. 25, 2000) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was Elvis' right-hand man before the ``King of Rock `n'
Roll'' went Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   And now Scotty Moore, rockabilly's guitar pioneer, is reliving
his musical past alongside former Stray Cats bass player Lee Rocker
on Sunday at the Troubadour.
</P>
<P>
   The show is the brainchild of Rocker, who credits Moore's early
work on Elvis Presley's Sun recordings as one of his major
influences.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker recalls that even before he helped found the Stray Cats
in 1979, he was drawn to Moore's style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing his guitar playing was just a tremendous experience
for all of us,'' he says. ``Just for some reason, it hit me right
between the eyes what they did with that trio.''
</P>
<P>
   That trio was Presley, Moore and Bill Black on bass.
</P>
<P>
   They were teamed up by Sun founder Sam Phillips in the summer of
1954 to record ``That's All Right,'' the first of five singles on
the label.
</P>
<P>
   It was on those Sun recordings _ including ``Good Rockin'
Tonight,'' ``Baby Let's Play House'' and ``Mystery Train'' _ that
Moore established the rockabilly guitar style.
</P>
<P>
   His riffs coupled with Presley's vocals and Black's bass playing
was groundbreaking in its day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that it still is,'' says Rocker, 39. ``But at that
point, it really was combining black r&AMP;b and white hillbilly music.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were musically true rebels by doing that,'' he
says. ``It was really the first breaths of rock 'n' roll that took
place in Memphis.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who is now 68 and living in Nashville, is less wowed by
what went on at the Sun studios.
</P>
<P>
   He says it just came out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all came up hearing the same kinds of music, so I think
what we ended up doing was a mixture of all of it together,'' he
says. ``We just stretched out and did what we felt like doing and I
think that was one of the biggest ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Sun recordings are his most famous, Moore actually
went on to play with Presley until the late 1960s. His guitar work
can be heard on ``Hound Dog,'' ``Jailhouse Rock'' and ``Too Much,''
among other songs.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they performed together was on the TV special now
known as ``The '68 Comeback,'' although then it was just called
``Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
   When the show was over, Presley went on with his career, and
Moore returned home to Nashville. There he ran a recording studio
working as an engineer, producer and studio musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make a living,'' Moore says. ``I wasn't on the
payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   As Moore's work began steering toward the technical side of
music, he gave up playing guitar all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got rid of everything,'' he says. ``I decided, 'Well, I
guess I'm through. So why bother with it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years passed before Moore decided to have at it
again. And it was all thanks to Carl Perkins, who he had run into
at a party.
</P>
<P>
   The two men got to talking about how they had never recorded a
song together, and by the end of the night, they had agreed to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Moore says they recorded ``706 Reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance there was the address of Sun records was 706
Union Ave.,'' he says. ``So we just kind of stole that and made it
706 Reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get my fingers back to moving just a little bit,'' he
says. ``But I'll tell you, I really enjoy playing now better than I
ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as the kind of guitarist who likes to sit and
noodle, Moore has gotten back to the business of making records.
</P>
<P>
   His last record was the 1997 tribute to Presley called ``All the
King's Men,'' which included appearances by Keith Richards, Jeff
Beck and Ronnie Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just everybody getting into the studio at the same time
and doing it,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's concert with Rocker will work in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes songs from Rocker's solo work, including
selections from his 1994 album ``Big Blue'' that featured Moore,
the Stray Cats and the Presley Sun recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's really about is rock 'n' roll,'' says Rocker. ``It's
about playing with some heart and some soul and some energy and
having fun with it.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Think pink and save a life.
</P>
<P>
   October is pink ribbon month, officially known as National
Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but there are already a number of
ways you can contribute to breast cancer research. Breast cancer is
the leading cause of death in women age 40-55 in the United States.
Here are a few ways to shop for the cause, and, in coming weeks,
Pulse will include other activities and information for the
awareness month.
</P>
<P>
   -AVON CALLING &QL; 
Avon Products, best-known for cosmetics at your door, has a new
collection of Avon Crusade pink ribbon products, including the
popular pens and newer rhinestone pins, and candles. The pearlized
pink pen, priced at $3, is oh-so-dainty with a pink ribbon design
that fits neatly into a handbag _ even one of those really tiny
evening totes. And all proceeds benefit the Avon Breast Cancer
Crusade, which provides women with direct access to breast cancer
education and early detection services at little or no cost, as
well as funds for cancer research. To order any of the products,
call (800) 367-2866 or go to www.avoncrusade.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-SHOE SHOPPING &QL; 
There's nothing like a new pair of shoes to make you look taller,
thinner and more fashion-savvy. And for one day only, a pair of
Ferragamo pumps (or Donald Pliner, Charles Jourdan or Nine West
designs) could help in the fight against breast cancer. It's the
seventh annual ``QVC Presents FFANY Shoes on Sale'' event at 4 p.m.
Oct. 4, hosted by Joan Rivers. For Imelda Marcos wanna-bes, this is
a dream come true. According to the Fashion Footwear Association of
New York (FFANY), there will be 80,000 pairs of designer shoes sold
at half the retail price with all proceeds going to breast cancer
charities, including the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa
Monica. For more information, call (800) 345-1515 or check out the
QVC Web site at www.qvc.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-SAVE THE LIDS &QL; 
All year round you're busy tossing your trash into the proper
recycling bins, but this month and throughout October, take a
closer look at your lids. Yoplait pink lids, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The company's annual ``Save Lids to Save Lives'' redemption
program will donate 10 cents to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation for each pink lid sent to them by Dec. 1, for a maximum
contribution of $1,050,000. To participate, send the lids to Save
Lids to Save Lives, P.O. Box 2202, Milaca, MN 56353-2202 and get
updates on breast cancer survivor stories at www.YoplaitUSA.com.
You can also register a collection team there and compete with
others. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-PJ PARTY &QL; 
Flannel pajama queen Karen Neuburger and her staff have vowed to
wear pajamas with a pink ribbon design in the San Francisco Race
for the Cure in October, and they're hoping other women will join
them.
</P>
<P>
   Her newest design called ``Wake up and Smell the Roses,''
features roses and pink breast cancer awareness ribbons and is now
on sale at Macy's and Nordstrom stores in several styles including
plus sizes, priced from $48 to $60. So, not only will you be comfy
and ready for your next gal-pal sleepover, but proceeds will be
donated to cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-FAST FACT &QL; 
About 98 million adults have used the Internet to find
health-related material, according to a Harris Interactive poll.
The number of ``cyberchondriacs'' has grown from 54 million since
1998 and accounts for roughly 86 percent of all Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-ON TV &QL; 
Discovery Channel _ taking advantage of the public's fascination
with real medical dramas _ premieres a 13-part weekly series on
Thursday filmed at Duke University Medical Center. ``Hospital,''
produced by Advanced Medical Productions, was given unprecedented
access to this teaching hospital and the stories that unfolded
there. ``We've been able to capture some of the most poignant and
compelling moments that people experience in a hospital no matter
whether they're on staff, accompanying a sick loved one, or
arriving for treatment,'' said series producer Bill Hayes. ``I
think viewers will find that this series is as much about humanity
as it is about medicine.'' To judge for yourself, tune in at 9 p.m.
Thursday, 1 a.m. Friday or 6 p.m. Saturday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-RESOURCE &QL; 
Heartburn, while a common malady, is also one that is not
understood. According to a recent study by the National Heartburn
Alliance (NHBA), 60 million Americans suffer from heartburn monthly
and 65 percent of sufferers are not aware heartburn can lead to
serious complications if left untreated. Now, NHBA is offering a
free educational brochure, ``Get Heartburn Smart'' that consumers
can get by calling (877) 642-2463 toll-free or by logging on to
www.heartburnalliance.org. &QL;

AD-FREE SCHOOLS

<P>
   HAVE A PEPSI WITH that education _ or a Coca-Cola, or a Reebok
book cover. According to a new report from the General Accounting
Office, advertising in schools nationwide is on the rise, pelting
students with consumer come-ons in the very place where they ought
to be free of pesky commercial marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Company money can be a benefit when it finances sports uniforms
or the yearbook in return for small ads.
</P>
<P>
   But other marketing is disturbingly direct. It might be a soda
vending machine in a school hallway that doubles as a billboard.
One school pushed students and staff to buy vending machine soda,
because the school got a small cut of the revenues. States like New
Mexico allow advertising on school buses. Other schools have let
market researchers enter classrooms to survey students.
</P>
<P>
   The Campbell's Soup Co. has a ``Labels for Education'' program
in which clipped labels of some products can be traded in for
computers, art supplies, and other materials. The program's Web
site advises: ``To get your students involved, print out the list
of Eligible Products page and give it to them to give to their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar problem. In 1995 the Consumers Union issued
``Captive Kids: A Report on Commercial Pressures on Kids at
School'' _ updating a 1990 analysis. In addition to ads, the report
criticized corporate-sponsored school materials with ``plugs for a
company or its product, or worse, biased information.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the programs are voluntary. A Coca-Cola official says
the company wants to be where thirsty people are, and that includes
schools. But Coke ``is happy to abide by any and all local rules.''
In other words, the company does no more than what schools allow.
</P>
<P>
   This gets to the heart of the matter: Some schools can't say no
to marketers. They're too hungry. Some administrators admit that
they turned to advertising because they were tired of begging for
public money. Some crave computers and other equipment and are
willing to get them by putting up with ads.
</P>
<P>
   Companies frequently offer, but the sound policy of Boston's
public schools is not to allow commercial advertising. Vending
machines are in cafeterias, but schools do not get a cut of
revenues. Recently, dot-com companies have approached Boston
offering deals such as a percent of revenues if students buy
through a Web site. School officials have declined.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, local and national governments must make sure
schools have enough public funding so that administrators can
freely choose whether and how to work with private companies.
Ideally, schools should be ad-free. Minimally, they shouldn't be
under marketing duress.

<P>
   TIME AND AGAIN, geneticists have made attempts to reach out to
society for help and understanding as the science of genetics heads
into deeper ethical waters. The scientists want lawmakers, clergy,
judges, primary-care doctors, journalists, and John Q. Public to
know what they are up to and what choices we will face as they
learn more about the genetic building blocks of life. If they are
going to play god, they don't want to do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Artists might even contribute to the discussion, but that's when
the give and take can get weird, as it has in the case of the bunny
that glows in the dark. An artist from Chicago, Eduardo Kac,
thought it would be provocative to have a dog bred with a gene for
fluorescence that would make it glow. He couldn't get a dog, but
scientists in France agreed to put DNA from a fluorescent jellyfish
into the fertilized egg of a rabbit. The bunny, Alba, now emits a
green glow under black lights of the sort used in night clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Kac has succeeded in confronting the public with the fact that
researchers are doing astonishing things in moving genes from one
species into another. In the case of fluorescence, researchers
insert such genes into the tumors of laboratory rats or mice,
letting the scientists watch the growth or shrinkage of the tumor
without doing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the drama of Kac's experiment in ``transgenic art,''
as he calls it, the end does not justify the means. No one can know
whether the fluorescence causes Alba pain. Admittedly, it might
also cause the rats and mice pain, but that at least can be
balanced against the gains in medical research.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the risk that Alba will get free, multiply, and
start a line of rabbits that are fluorescent and perhaps aberrant
in some other way as well. One of the gambles of fiddling with a
gene is that we often don't know what else it does. The classic
example is the gene that causes sickle-cell anemia _ it also offers
protection against malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns like this and others, a committee of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science issued a report
Sept. 18 advising against making any inheritable genetic changes in
human beings. The report called for establishment of a special
committee to monitor and oversee any research that wanders into
``designer children'' territory.
</P>
<P>
   Kac describes his transgenic art as ``based on the use of
genetic engineering to transfer natural or synthetic genes to an
organism, to create unique living beings.'' When university
scientists do experiments of this kind in the United States they
must first get permission of review boards. Whatever value his work
has in awakening the public to genetic issues, Kac is crossing a
line from art to the rogue science that causes him concern.

DEATH OF AMERICAN JEWRY EXAGGERATED, JEWISH EDITOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers
can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or
888-346-9867.) (Eds: Robert Leiter is the literary editor of The
Jewish Exponent, a Philadelphia weekly) 
 By ROBERT LEITER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rumors of the death of American Jewry have been greatly
exaggerated, despite such recent signs as the 1990 National Jewish
Population Survey indicating a 52 percent intermarriage rate.
</P>
<P>
   These days Jewish life is showing renewed vigor. This is the
judgment of several longtime commentators as well as front-line
workers in the field _ rabbis and Jewish professionals _ who have
gone about doing their statistical and spiritual work despite the
dour predictions. For these individuals, even factoring
intermarriage in, the glass is at least half-full.
</P>
<P>
   Several synagogue leaders, for example, have begun to rethink
their policies of excluding the intermarried from active
participation in Jewish life, reversing a 30-year trend of being
unwelcoming or dismissive. Indicative of the change is that
instruction for interfaith spouses used to be called conversion
classes; now it's called ``Introduction to Judaism.'' It's a minor
alteration of language that bespeaks a deep shift in perception.
</P>
<P>
   Certain scholars, among them Sylvia Barak Fishman, an associate
professor of contemporary Jewish life at Brandeis University, warn
that it is too early to judge the impact of the more liberal
attitude toward intermarriage, especially when the non-Jewish
spouse does not convert. Fishman, who spent the last year
intensively studying intermarriage, said that many non-Jewish
husbands she had interviewed expressed ``considerable resentment
about being frozen out of the religious lives of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is a good deal more complicated than we
thought,'' she said. ``There are lots of nuances we have to be
alert to.''
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists about the future of American Jewry come in many
forms. Among them must be counted Samuel Freedman, a former
reporter for The New York Times and occasional contributor to it.
In his new book, ``Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for the Soul of
American Jewry,'' he looks at six incidents of serious strife among
Jews, incidents that illustrate his thesis that civil war is
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   But generally, one's expectations rest on how data from the 1990
survey is interpreted. Two of the most prominent commentators on
the intermarriage statistics were Elliott Abrams and Alan
Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Both published much-discussed books on the crisis facing
American Jews in the late 1990s; Abrams' was titled ``Faith or
Fear'' and Dershowitz's ``The Vanishing American Jew.'' The
pictures they painted were not encouraging to those concerned about
recent trends. Dershowitz argued that secular Judaism, bolstered by
a strong educational basis in Jewish texts, was the solution to the
issue of ``the vanishing American Jew.'' Abrams suggested that only
a return to traditional Judaism would stave off doom.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after publication, neither author has moved much
beyond his initial position, but Dershowitz, the high-profile
Harvard law professor, seems a good deal more optimistic than
Abrams, the president of the Washington-based Ethics and Public
Policy Center. Both writers agree on one thing: two opposing trends
are at work in Jewish life right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible renaissance of Jewish culture going on
for some, and at the other extreme there's increasing assimilation,
withdrawal and intermarriage,'' Dershowitz said. ``What this means
is that the Jewish community, which used to be a continuum of
involvement, has become a dichotomy. More and more people are more
active than ever before in things Jewish and more are also
vanishing. But the Jewish activity that is taking place is truly
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another guarded optimist is J.J. Goldberg, the author of
``Jewish Power,'' who was recently appointed the editor of the
English-language Forward newspaper. As a reporter, Goldberg was one
of the first to write with skepticism about the 52 percent
intermarriage figure, and he is still ``appalled'' that people
regard it as legitimate. His research, as well as that of others he
interviewed, led him to believe that the rate was no more than 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the number, Goldberg agrees that intermarriage is
having a profound effect on American Jewry. It is his contention
that a whole new Judaism is being born in reaction to
intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Jews now who live in both the Jewish and gentile
worlds,'' he said. ``And nobody knows what the implications of this
are. I'm a traditional Jew, and this is a Judaism that I wouldn't
particularly want in my life. But it is a part of my people. It's
where we're going. I might as well complain about the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That something is going on in the Jewish community is
undeniable,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Wertheimer of the Jewish Theological Seminary told him, he
said, ``that $9 billion a year is flowing through the treasuries of
the Jewish institutions in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than the gross national product of some member
countries at the U.N.,'' said Goldberg. ``The vitality in the
community, by virtue of the level of the money available, is
staggering. Then there are the art forms that have been created _
the klezmer revival, which is becoming a legitimate form of pop
music in America, and the novels and stories. Twenty years ago,
people were mourning the death of American Jewish writing, that
after Roth and Malamud and Ozick, that would be it. Now you have
all these writers _ Allegra Goodman and Nathan Englander, and whole
new ones younger than they are. It's a very Jewish literature and
very American.''
</P>
<P>
   Another optimist _ who has been called a visionary by many of
his colleagues _ is Barry Shrage, the president of the Combined
Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston. He said that ``all of a
sudden, there's a huge hunger for Jewish learning.'' But he added:
``It's also clear that the Jewish community is hungry for a vision
that will make sense in their lives. What we lack are the leaders
who can articulate that vision and create a real community of
learners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the baby boomers have aged,'' Shrage said, ``they've had a
great interest in spirituality. Now that can go two ways. One way
is the `studying Kabbalah with Madonna' way, which will be gone in
a matter of years. Or we can really work to create a community of
serious learners.'' Shrage also contends that every intermarriage
is a great opportunity: ``What has to be said to the non-Jewish
spouse is, `We have a gorgeous tradition. Come learn with us.'''
</P>
<P>
   A recent book that articulates a way to use the potential of
Jewish seekers and, in turn, reanimate one of the fundamental
institutions of Jewish life is Rabbi Sidney Schwarz's ``Finding a
Spiritual Home.'' The author argues that if Jewish leaders can tap
into the great spiritual energy fermenting among disaffected Jews,
they can remake the synagogue and form the kind of ``community of
learners'' that Shrage speaks of.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Schwarz profiles four synagogues that he sees as
models for the future. Each of these ``synagogue-communities,'' as
he calls them, is led by a ``visionary'' rabbi; has an egalitarian
spirit; is based on a carefully articulated viewpoint; has imbued
its congregants with a sense of empowerment; and is deeply
committed to scholarship and worship.
</P>
<P>
   But even after creating such a synagogue, which is no small
accomplishment, the problem remains: how to attract the mass of
Jewish seekers, who often are looking for enlightenment everywhere
but in the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community would call these people `lost Jews'
rather than `Jews that we lost,''' Schwarz said. ``I'm talking
about Jews who seek spiritual answers in alternative settings,
whether it's through Buddhism or meditation. So many people stand
ready. You go to such settings and the number of Jews there dwarf
the number that are active in Jewish-sponsored programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to these places and you listen, what you see and
hear are Jews hungering to get connected with their tradition. It's
then you realize that we're sitting on a gold mine called
Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz laments that the reintroduction to Jewish life for many
of these seekers is rarely handled well: ``Let's take somebody
who's, say, 30 years old and has been to Jews for Jesus and has
spent time in an ashram. And he shows up at a synagogue on Yom
Kippur. In a typical synagogue, how would he be greeted? `You've
strayed,' the rabbi might say, `but we're happy to have you back.'
That's the wrong way to do it. What should be said is: `You've
explored truth in many ways, some that really touched your soul.
We'd love to learn from you about what you saw and heard.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbis have to relearn what touches the souls of Jews,''
Schwarz said, ``and not assume that doing the same service we've
done for centuries is going to do the job.''

SPECTER OVER SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHADOW IS BEING cast over the Sydney Olympics far more serious
than NBC's disappointing audience ratings: Athletes persist in
using performance-enhancing drugs, and officials lag in their
ability to catch them. It is a threat to these games, future
Olympics, and all of sport.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee has done a better job this
time than in the past at testing and disqualifying violators _ a
total of almost 50 so far, if 27 left at home by China for drug use
are included. Still, no one believes that officials are catching
more than a fraction of those breaking the rules.
</P>
<P>
   A US-government funded study estimated that as many as 90
percent of Olympic athletes use performance-enhancing drugs. The
result is that virtually every performance by an athlete that
greatly eclipses his or her previous personal best is met with the
nagging suspicion that the gain comes not through relentless
practice but through use of a prohibited substance.
</P>
<P>
   As articles in Thursday's Globe by Larry Tye and John Powers
make clear, these are usually prescription pharmaceuticals that,
while originally developed to heal the sick or injured, give
healthy athletes an advantage in stamina, strength, or even fluid
loss to help them stay within weight categories. And no one knows
what to do about the looming possibility of athletes using genetic
therapies to enhance muscle groups, which would leave even less
trace than the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Olympics are not to become a test of pharmaceutical
inventiveness more than of physical prowess, something has to be
done. And that will require more than the $25 million that the IOC
is committing to a new World Anti-Doping Agency. Charles Yesalis,
an expert on sports drug use at Pennsylvania State University,
believes $100 million is needed to develop effective tests. In
addition, the battle should be joined in a more organized way by
other sports, from professional cycling to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Medical professional organizations also have a role to play.
Clearly, doctors and biochemical scientists are helping the
athletes misuse these substances. Their willingness to do so might
waver if a few were to lose their licenses or their university
appointments and be identified publicly as sports-drug pushers.
Doctors also have to get the word out more strongly that habitual
use of many of these substances could have harmful and
unpredictable long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   Only with this kind of concerted action will the specter of drug
misuse be lifted from the Olympics and other highly competitive
sports.

GAS TAX CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 24, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE WORLDWIDE escalation of petroleum prices, particularly
gasoline, has set off a rash of protests over taxes that threaten
to undermine solid environmental and revenue policies. American
political leaders will do well to avoid any temptation to join in.
</P>
<P>
   Americans grouse about gasoline taxes even though they are very
low by international standards _ so low that other countries
complain about the profligate use of petroleum in this country.
Americans, who constitute about 5 percent of the world population,
consume about 25 percent of the petroleum, encouraged in part by
those low taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans pay from a little more than twice (Portugal) to nearly
four times as much (Great Britain) at the pump. The difference is
attributable to tax policies that in the case of the British
account for about three-quarters of the price at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The history of European tax policies is very different from that
in the United States. After World War II, Europeans were
hard-pressed to meet the costs of reconstruction, much of it based
on purchases of capital equipment from America. They had to import
virtually all of their petroleum until discovery of large deposits
in the North Sea in the 1970s, and they wanted to hold imports to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile ownership, taken for granted as a birthright in this
country, was far rarer elsewhere. In 1949, of the total of 106
million motor vehicles worldwide, 44 million were in this country.
Because cars elsewhere were owned by people with higher incomes,
the regressive nature of gasoline taxes was far less socially
important.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery has changed dramatically since then. Today,
according to Federal Highway Administration figures, Germans are
slightly more apt to own cars than Americans _ 490 per 1,000
compared with 484. French and British trail slightly at 337 and 360
but are clearly in the same league.
</P>
<P>
   While the current round of protests has been spawned by the rise
in oil prices, they have been directed primarily at taxes, on the
assumption that those costs are controllable through domestic
politics. Pressure to lower them has been intense and may continue
even if the underlying price of oil declines.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should avoid the question. Gasoline taxes here, both
state and federal, are earmarked for transportation projects. The
American infrastructure needs all the resources it can get for
maintenance and improvements, along with major projects like the
Big Dig. Dismantling or even temporarily suspending the gasoline
tax, as some politicians have already tried to do, would undercut
necessary support for essential facilities.

&HT;     GORE PRESSES ATTACK ON BIG OIL; BUSH DENOUNCES `POLITICAL FIX 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore received a helping hand Friday when
President Clinton ordered the release of up to 30 million barrels
of oil from the government's stockpile just one day after Gore
called for tapping federal reserves to bring down oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced
the release, Gore was in oil-dependent Western Pennsylvania
defending his call for ``several releases'' of 5 million barrels on
Thursday. On Friday the vice president was more specific. He called
for 30 million to 35 million barrels from the reserves ``over the
next month'' to stem increases in home-heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to stand up to the apologists for Big Oil,''
Gore told voters in Vanport, 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. ``I
reject an agenda that is of Big Oil, by Big Oil and for Big Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, insisting the release was ``not political,'' told
reporters, ``The president wants to help the American people get
home heating oil and have enough heat in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, were just as insistent in contending the
release was political.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush said in Florida that government
reserves ``should not be used as a short-term political fix for
somebody whose administration has been asleep at the switch'' on
energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters that by releasing oil reserves, Clinton and
Gore were working together to ``achieve short-term political
gain.'' The governor has said he supports expanding domestic oil
production and refining as well as opening the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration, a move opposed by
Gore and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   In Chesterfield, Mo., Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney repeated
his charge that the administration has failed to boost U.S. oil and
gas production.
</P>
<P>
   ``So having done absolutely nothing for seven years, with seven
weeks to go (before the election), they all of a sudden get
religion and want to tap the reserves to help Al Gore's political
problems at the polls,'' Cheney said. He also called the release a
``crass political move.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Clifford May said that
Gore ``as recently as February said it was a bad idea to release
oil except in times of emergency, such as war.'' May called the
release ``a campaign contribution from Clinton to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil controversy overshadowed Bush's announcement of a plan
he termed a ``medical moonshot'' _ doubling the budget of the
National Institutes of Health for research on cancer, Alzheimer's
disease and other crippling or fatal ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an investment in the hope of Americans and of people
</P>
<P>
   across the world,'' Bush said told a group of senior citizens in
Sarasota, Fla. ``The goal of my proposal is to accelerate (progress
in research) even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls continued to show a competitive race nationwide. The
latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed Gore leading Bush among
likely voters by 51 percent to 41 percent. The poll's margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But a poll by the Web site Voter.com showed Bush leading Gore 42
percent to 39 percent in a four-way matchup with Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader and Reform Party candidate Patrick Buchanan.
However, in a two-way race, the poll found Bush leading Gore 43
percent to 42 percent _ a statistical dead heat. The Voter.com
poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In getting out front on the release of federal oil reserves,
Gore appeared to be playing the same populist card he has
consistently dealt since the Democratic National Convention last
month, saying he was the man of the people against the Republican
Party and big corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a former oil company executive and Cheney recently
headed a Texas company, Halliburton, that services the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore's press office called Bush and Cheney a ``Big
Oil dream ticket.'' It also accused Cheney of telling officials in
Middle Eastern OPEC nations to decrease production ``so his company
would profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington-based think tank, said it is not clear
</P>
<P>
   whether the Clinton-Gore strategy of releasing oil will prove to
be politically shrewd or ham-fisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the decision helps bring down the price of oil, I don't
think the American people will care very much that it was a crass
political move,'' Hess said. ``On the other hand, if it doesn't do
any good, what people will remember was that Gore played politics
with something important to them.''

BUSH PROMISES MEDICAL ADVANCES IF HE'S ELECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUN CITY, Fla. _ George W. Bush employed the rhetoric of John F.
Kennedy on the campaign trail Friday, promising to lead ``a medical
moonshot'' as president by increasing spending for cancer and
disease research by $67 billion this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cures and treatments are not just a hope for future
generations. They are the hope of men and women and children who
live and sometimes suffer today,'' the Republican told an audience
of about 750 senior citizens at the Sun City Center retirement
community.
</P>
<P>
   Harking back to Kennedy's call to put a man on the moon before
the end of the '60s, Bush said: ``Our nation must meet these hopes
with new focus and new spending. As president, I will fund and lead
a medical moonshot to reach far beyond what seems possible today
and discover new cures for age-old afflictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore continued to focus on oil
prices during a campaign swing in Western Pennsylvania, urging the
release of 30 to 35 million barrels of oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve just before the Clinton administration announced
it will do so.
</P>
<P>
   Oil was also a leading topic at Gore's first full-scale press
conference in more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   At a union hall in Vanport, Pa., Gore said the race for the
White House is ``a jump ball.'' He also rejected suggestions that
he will have the advantage as a debater when he faces Bush next
month, saying ``this ought to be a fresh slate, even-steven going
in.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, Friday marked his sixth visit to Florida since
securing the GOP nomination. He told a crowd greeting him on his
arrival at Sarasota International Airport he felt confident he
would win the state and its 25 electoral votes even though polls
show a neck-and-neck race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came to Florida to begin wrapping up his weeklong focus on
how his policies affect middle-class families. The ``Real Plans for
Real People'' tour will have covered 6,076 miles and nine states
between since Monday. It concludes Saturday morning with a rally at
Orlando International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   With a pink breast-cancer awareness pin stuck to his lapel, Bush
repeated his vow to more than double funding for the National
Institutes of Health and double the budget at the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH is the primary element of the federal government to
conduct and support biomedical and behavioral research. In 1998,
Congress committed to the goal of doubling its funding from $13.6
billion to $27.3 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Bush not only committed to that goal, but pledged to surpass
projected budget growth for the agency. In 2002, he would seek $2.2
billion more than the projected budget growth, and starting the
next year, he would seek to surpass the projection by $8.1 billion
annually until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Congressional Budget Office projects that with
annual increases, the NIH budget will grow to $22.8 billion by
2010. Over that time, the annual increases will total $204.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's proposal, the NIH budget would reach $30.9 billion
by 2010. Over that time, the annual increases would total $271.4
billion _ $67 billion more than the CBO projection.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that funding is a pledge to increase the budget of
National Cancer Institute from $3.3 billion to $5.7 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also proposed to more than double NIH funding.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after his speech, one woman
told Bush that all women are not for Gore, even though polls show
his standing has risen since he gave his wife, Tipper, a lusty kiss
at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little shocked that the polls are moving because of `The
Kiss' as well,'' Bush said. ``I think what matters more is
leadership capability and positions you're running on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also renewed its criticism of Gore for
withholding details to back up his claim last month that his
mother-in-law pays nearly three times as much for the same
prescription arthritis medication used by the family dog.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe questioned the validity of the story, and
afterward the Gore campaign admitted it used figures from a
congressional study _ not the family's medical bills _ when the
vice president made the claim. The Globe subsequently reported that
only a few drugs are prescribed for both humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said: ``The reason this is
relevant is because the vice president used his own mother-in-law
in an attempt to win votes. He made up facts in an attempt to win
votes in Florida. . . . And I think the vice president owes you all
an answer: Did he make it up completely?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's veracity also came into question this week when he said
that his mother had sung to him ``Look for the Union Label'' as a
lullaby. The song was written when Gore was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that Friday, Gore laughed and said he was just
joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody sings a lullaby to a baby about the union label,'' said
Gore, adding, ``I'm not talking about my mother-in-law any more. I
may talk about my dog.''

SHREWD INVESTING ENRICHENS HARVARD, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard, already the world's richest university by far,
last year added significantly to its fantastic wealth: the school's
endowment jumped more than 30 percent, from $14.4 billion to $19.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's larger than the annual budgets of 142 countries,
including Cuba, Jordan, and Lithuania. The $5 billion increase
alone is larger than the total endowments reported last year by
some of the nation's other top universities, including the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology ($4.3 billion), Columbia
University ($3.6 billion), and Dartmouth College ($1.7 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Although many institutions expect to see a significant rise in
their endowments this year, Harvard's will likely extend its
financial lead over other top universities.
</P>
<P>
   What does such a significant increase in cash mean for Harvard's
18,000 students and 2,000 faculty members?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this should signal any kind of sea change,''
said Joe Wrinn, a Harvard spokesman. ``A university has to think
long term and about the cyclical nature of the economy. We don't
know what our future needs will be. But we're very appreciative of
what the management company has accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32 percent return on the university's more than 8,600
investments was higher than any year since 1983. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose just 7.3 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The principle reason for the jump was a 155 percent return in
private equity investments, which includes venture capital. Harvard
is one of the few colleges that has enough money to invest in such
accounts, which are considered speculative. Still, those
investments represent only 15 percent of Harvard's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always maintained a well-diversified portfolio,'' said
Jack R. Meyer, president of Harvard Management Co., which oversees
the endowment. ``We're happy about where it is and we'll be happy
if venture capital does well again. But we're not planning any
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most schools have yet to report their endowment returns. Last
year, 34 colleges reported endowments above the billion-dollar mark
and the average rate of return was 11 percent, with the highest
return about 29 percent, according to an annual study of the
National Association of College and University Business Officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Harvard has done extremely well,'' said Damon
Manetta, spokesman for the association. ``That's probably an
indication of how the rest of the institutions are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The real question now for Harvard deans is what percentage of
the endowment they will devote to the university's operating
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the average spending rate for colleges is about
5.5 percent. Harvard, which provides generous amounts of financial
aid but now costs students $33,110 per year in tuition, devotes
between 4 percent and 5 percent of its endowment to its operating
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical question for Harvard is what is its priorities,''
said Gordon Winston, an economics professor at Williams College and
the director of the school's Project on the Economics of Higher
Education. ``If they use it to significantly increase access to a
superb education like Harvard, that's not faulting them. But it's
also questionable whether children of the wealthy should get a
Harvard education for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's endowment comes from donations as well as investment
income. In December 1999, the university ended a seven-year capital
campaign that set a record in higher education philanthropy by
raising $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In total through fiscal 2000, the endowment surpassed investment
benchmarks in almost every account. Returns failed to beat
benchmarks only in emerging markets investments and
inflation-indexed bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Last fiscal year's 30 percent increase more than doubled the
previous year's 12.2 percent return and is higher than the 23
percent average return between 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Harvard officials say they don't expect their success
will change next year's investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After such a good year, I would say it's hard to draw
lessons,'' Meyer said. ``The lesson, I would say, is that it's
possible to earn substantial returns while still maintaining a
pretty diversified portfolio.''

INTEL SUFFERING SLOW SALES, CURRENCY PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year or two ago, Intel Corp. was the company that could do no
wrong. The world's largest chip maker raked in vast profits from
its Pentium line of microprocessors, while easily fending off
competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But 2000 has brought a series of missteps and misfortunes. So
far, none has been worse than Intel's announcement on Thursday that
slow sales in Europe would push third-quarter sales below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The report sent the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite index
down 214 in the first minutes of trading Friday. But cooler heads
prevailed as the day wore on, and the index closed down just 25.14.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares didn't fare nearly as well. The stock dropped 22
percent, to $47.94, on record-setting volume of 308 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts had predicted Intel's third-quarter revenue would
be 10 percent higher than the $8.3 billion in the second quarter.
But on Thursday, the company said European woes would limit the
increase to between 3 and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now seeing, now that we're 2 to 3 months into the month
of September, that revenues will not be up as high as we had
anticipated,'' said Intel spokesman Tom Beermann. He also said the
problem was confined to Europe; chip sales in North America and
Asia, Intel's other two leading markets, are meeting expectations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, an economic
consulting firm in Westchester, Pa., said continued weakness in the
euro and other European currencies is causing problems for Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger dollar would affect the price that they could
charge on their products in Europe, and that might affect demand,''
he said. The stronger the dollar, the more euros are needed to buy
American products. That can make Intel-based computers more
expensive for Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Zandi also noted that Intel must convert its European earnings
to dollars for accounting purposes. This again leads to a
devaluation because it takes more euros, francs, or deutschemarks
to equal one dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's European problem is just the latest in a string of bad
breaks for a company that once seemed invincible. Late last year,
Intel's biggest customers, such as Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway
2000 Inc., complained publicly of weaker earnings, because they
couldn't get enough Pentium processors to meet production goals.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Intel recalled a large quantity of malfunctioning
motherboard chip sets.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, Intel had to halt production of its fastest
Pentium chip when users complained of serious defects that would
cause computers to stop working.
</P>
<P>
   All this has allowed a rival, Advanced Micro Devices, to gain a
foothold in the high-end chip market with its well-received Athlon
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kay, research manager at International Data Corp., said
Intel has been investing in a massive effort to increase chip
output. For instance, the company is investing $800 million at its
plant in Hudson, so that it can begin producing Pentium chips next
year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Intel is upgrading manufacturing processes. As
a result, said Kay, quality control has slipped. ``They've admitted
to having execution problems,'' said Kay, ``which is rare for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay thinks Intel has fixed most of its manufacturing
difficulties. But just as those problems were squared away, the
European economy dealt a staggering blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems,'' Kay said, ``that they've been having some bad luck
or something.''

SPURRING RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO WORK TOGETHER FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conversion is an individual experience, but those who have
undergone it share in a basic story of how something unexpected
worked a great change in their lives, either on the spot or over
time.
</P>
<P>
   For William E. Swing, the bishop of California of the Episcopal
Church, it started with a telephone call in 1993 from a U.N.
official, an incident that led him into the highly ambitious
mission of trying to create a global organization in which
religious groups might work together for peace.
</P>
<P>
   His caller, the bishop said, merely wanted his help in arranging
an interfaith service for U.N. delegates at Grace Cathedral, the
elegant neo-Gothic building atop San Francisco's Nob Hill. It was
1995, and the event was to commemorate the United Nations' 50th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But the request got him thinking. Hours later, Swing lay in bed
reflecting on the fact that while nations had a forum to discuss
cooperation, religious faiths had no such thing. ``There were 40
wars going on in the world that night,'' Swing said in an
interview, ``most of them fueled _ not caused, but fueled _ by
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   When he rose the next morning, Swing said, he decided he would
dedicate himself to trying to create such a forum. ``It was a
conversion, absolutely,'' he said. ``It was a conversion to how
we're going to have to live together.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, his project is called the United Religions
Initiative. It is a work in progress, but recently passed a
symbolic milestone, bringing together 300 people from around the
world who have become involved in the project to sign its charter.
</P>
<P>
   The document pledges participants to building bridges among
faith groups, respecting one another's religious differences,
organizing and making decisions locally, and agreeing that no one
in the effort will be subjected to religious proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   The signing ceremony, in June, was the first in an unusual
series of events that have cast a spotlight on how people in
different faiths are to relate to one another, an ever more
pressing issue in a world made smaller by advances in mass
communications.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 10,000 Protestant evangelists met in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, under the auspices of the Rev. Billy Graham's
organization and issued a declaration that while evangelists must
be respectful of other believers, they are obliged to share the
Gospel so that those others may hear and convert.
</P>
<P>
   In September the Vatican released its own statement, saying that
the Christian message, of salvation coming only through Jesus, is
most fully expressed in the Roman Catholic Church, so Catholic
participation in interfaith discussions should consider conversion
its ultimate aim.
</P>
<P>
   On a different note, hundreds of men and women from religious
groups worldwide met in New York in late August and pledged to work
for peace, reducing poverty and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody,'' said Swing, ``is wrestling at some level with the
same question.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The idea of having a global forum for religious groups has been
around for a century but has come up against major complicating
factors _ questions of authority, of how to deal with conflicting
ideas about ultimate truth, and of what to do about proselytism.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Swing traveled around the world, seeking ideas
on how to proceed from leaders in Christianity, Judaism, Islam,
Hinduism and Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice, he said, came from the Swiss Catholic
theologian Hans Kueng, who pressed him to define his objectives
more clearly and also warned him against focusing on the people at
the top. The heads of organizations would go to a conference, give
a speech and then depart with their entourages _ leaving Swing with
what, Kueng asked.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the bishop and his fellow organizers have focused on
enlisting people at the local level, involving women as well as
men, and being open to those from tribal groups and broad spiritual
perspectives, not just the major faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The result is decentralized, about 100 of what Swing calls
``cooperation circles,'' autonomous, interfaith groups around the
globe. During a 72-hour period that overlapped Jan. 1, 2000, these
groups prayed, marched or ran social-service projects. The next
step, he said, was to create a ``global council'' to support them,
by June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, 64, who is married with two adult children, has
presided since 1979 over a jurisdiction in the Episcopal Church
that encompasses five counties around San Francisco Bay, from Napa
Valley to Silicon Valley, a region of vast economic, ethnic and
religious diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he spoke again of his meeting with Kueng, whom
he paraphrased as saying there would never be peace among nations
without peace among religions, and there would be no peace among
religions with dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets that,'' Swing said. ``When I give a talk, in
any city, to any age group, they always get that.''

SHREWD INVESTING ENRICHENS HARVARD, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard, already the world's richest university by far,
last year added significantly to its fantastic wealth: the school's
endowment jumped more than 30 percent, from $14.4 billion to $19.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's larger than the annual budgets of 142 countries,
including Cuba, Jordan, and Lithuania. The $5 billion increase
alone is larger than the total endowments reported last year by
some of the nation's other top universities, including the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology ($4.3 billion), Columbia
University ($3.6 billion), and Dartmouth College ($1.7 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Although many institutions expect to see a significant rise in
their endowments this year, Harvard's will likely extend its
financial lead over other top universities.
</P>
<P>
   What does such a significant increase in cash mean for Harvard's
18,000 students and 2,000 faculty members?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this should signal any kind of sea change,''
said Joe Wrinn, a Harvard spokesman. ``A university has to think
long term and about the cyclical nature of the economy. We don't
know what our future needs will be. But we're very appreciative of
what the management company has accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32 percent return on the university's more than 8,600
investments was higher than any year since 1983. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose just 7.3 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The principle reason for the jump was a 155 percent return in
private equity investments, which includes venture capital. Harvard
is one of the few colleges that has enough money to invest in such
accounts, which are considered speculative. Still, those
investments represent only 15 percent of Harvard's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always maintained a well-diversified portfolio,'' said
Jack R. Meyer, president of Harvard Management Co., which oversees
the endowment. ``We're happy about where it is and we'll be happy
if venture capital does well again. But we're not planning any
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most schools have yet to report their endowment returns. Last
year, 34 colleges reported endowments above the billion-dollar mark
and the average rate of return was 11 percent, with the highest
return about 29 percent, according to an annual study of the
National Association of College and University Business Officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Harvard has done extremely well,'' said Damon
Manetta, spokesman for the association. ``That's probably an
indication of how the rest of the institutions are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The real question now for Harvard deans is what percentage of
the endowment they will devote to the university's operating
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the average spending rate for colleges is about
5.5 percent. Harvard, which provides generous amounts of financial
aid but now costs students $33,110 per year in tuition, devotes
between 4 percent and 5 percent of its endowment to its operating
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical question for Harvard is what is its priorities,''
said Gordon Winston, an economics professor at Williams College and
the director of the school's Project on the Economics of Higher
Education. ``If they use it to significantly increase access to a
superb education like Harvard, that's not faulting them. But it's
also questionable whether children of the wealthy should get a
Harvard education for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's endowment comes from donations as well as investment
income. In December 1999, the university ended a seven-year capital
campaign that set a record in higher education philanthropy by
raising $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In total through fiscal 2000, the endowment surpassed investment
benchmarks in almost every account. Returns failed to beat
benchmarks only in emerging markets investments and
inflation-indexed bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Last fiscal year's 30 percent increase more than doubled the
previous year's 12.2 percent return and is higher than the 23
percent average return between 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Harvard officials say they don't expect their success
will change next year's investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After such a good year, I would say it's hard to draw
lessons,'' Meyer said. ``The lesson, I would say, is that it's
possible to earn substantial returns while still maintaining a
pretty diversified portfolio.''

CLINTON ORDERS RELEASE OF 30M GALLONS OF RESERVE OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in a move that could help the
presidential candidacy of Al Gore and provide relief to consumers
of heating oil, reversed policy Friday and ordered the release of
30 million barrels from the government's emergency reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that American families are warm this
winter,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said. The administration
let Richardson announce the move, which previously had been by some
other top Clinton aides, including Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the oil, which Gore had proposed on the campaign
trail just a day earlier, was promptly attacked by Republican
George W. Bush as a crass political act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be used a
short-term political fix for somebody whose administration has been
asleep at the switch,'' Bush said while campaigning in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential candidates battled over whether the
release was needed, the impact was being assessed in New England,
where many homeowners rely on heating oil and are deeply affected
by any price increases. Richardson said that home heating oil
inventories are 19 percent lower than last year and 65 percent
lower in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Quint, senior vice president of Global Companies LLC of
Waltham, Mass., one of the biggest heating oil wholesalers in the
Northeast, said some of the impact has already been felt because
oil prices have fallen in the last couple of days in anticipation
of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But it will probably be well after Election Day before consumers
learn whether the move has a significant impact on their home
heating oil bills. That is because the price of home heating oil
depends on many market conditions, including foreign supply and
local weather. Moreover, Quint said, there is not enough refining
capacity in the country to turn much of the additional capacity
quickly into heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know until winter'' whether home heating oil prices
will decrease significantly, Quint said. ``The capacity is not
there to refine it.''
</P>
<P>
   New England members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat,
had long sought the move and applauded the decision. But some
cautioned not to expect too much benefit unless foreign producers
begin to release more oil at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what OPEC will do,'' said Representative John
Olver of Massachusetts, referring to the foreign oil-producing
cartel. ``One has to wait and see, whether this might have an
effect on domestic or foreign producers of what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore earlier this year opposed such a move, but said Friday that
he changed his mind because foreign oil producers didn't follow
through on requests to increase their supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time we had pledges from OPEC that they would increase
production to bring down the price and stabilize it at lower
levels,'' Gore told reporters in Vanport, Pa. ``They have not
followed through on those pledges. The situation is very different
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The 571 million-barrel oil reserve was established near the
Texas-Louisiana border in the 1970s, during the height of an energy
crisis and amid concern about the ability of foreign oil producers
to dominate the world market. The United States consumes 16 million
to 20 million barrels of oil a day. Under the plan, the government
would add 1 million barrels per day to the US supply for a month
and then reassess the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the oil would be loaned to oil companies,
which then would sell the oil on the open market. The companies
would replace the oil later, when prices drop, with more barrels
than they borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the move, the issue of oil has been a major campaign
issue. Gore is an ardent environmentalist and author of ``Earth in
the Balance,'' which warns of impending oil crises and calls for
the elimination of the internal combustion engine in automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices low for most of the Clinton-Gore administration,
Gore made little progress in his effort to cut oil consumption. But
this year, world demand has soared, pushing oil prices to their
highest level in a decade and returning energy policy to the
forefront of the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, are both former oil men,
with Cheney having run a worldwide oil-related company called
Halliburton Corp. Gore has portrayed Bush and Cheney as protectors
of the oil industry and thus unconcerned about cutting oil prices.
But the Republican presidential team has responded that other
measures can be taken to increase supply, such as drilling for oil
in a huge Alaska wildlife preserve, a step that Gore opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to reporters after the administration's decision
was announced, blasted Clinton and Gore for changing course on the
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten months ago the president and vice president thought it was
a bad idea to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,''
Bush said. ``Now that we are 46 days away from the election,
they've changed their minds. I agreed with them that it was a bad
idea in the past, and I still think that it's a bad idea today. The
Strategic Petroleum Reserve needs to be used in case of war and in
case of major disruption of supply. This is an administration that
has had no energy plan...I believe the vice president has made this
decision, with the support of the president, for short-term
political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman noted that the 30 million-barrel release
exceeded the 21 million barrel release that occurred during the
Persian Gulf War.

SEPARATISTS STEP UP ANTI-ENGLISH ARSON ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A splinter group of Quebec separatists has
intensified a campaign of arson attacks against English businesses
and organizations, including a church, in the only city in the
province with a large English-speaking population.
</P>
<P>
   The radicals, whose actions are disavowed by mainstream
separatists, issued a statement describing the campaign as
``Operation Linguistic Cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has been hurt, but police Friday attributed a string of
firebombings in recent months to an outfit calling itself the
French Language Self-Defense Brigade. Alarmed by the escalation,
police have created a task force to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks occurred as the province's official French language
advisory board this week upheld the right of corporations to
operate in Quebec under their English trademark names. Thus, Burger
King, Second Cup, Toys ``R'' Us, Wal-Mart, and other businesses are
free to display their logos as boldly as they please despite a
Quebec law banning English-language signs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Premier Lucien Bouchard, a separatist stalwart who still
hopes to lead the province to independence from Canada, conceded
the futility of trying to make multinationals adopt French names
just to operate in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can legislate to an organization: From now on
in Quebec you will use a name different from the one you have used
throughout your existence and throughout the world,'' Bouchard
said. ``At some points there are limits _ Wal-Mart exists, Toys `R'
Us exists.''
</P>
<P>
   That conciliatory stance infuriates linguistic hard-liners. But
despite the often bitter passions underlying the province's
language divide, political violence in Quebec is rare. That has
made the firebombings all the more alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the self-styled French Language Self-Defense Brigade
is behind at least five bombings and a larger number of vandalism
attacks against Anglophone businesses and institutions in Montreal
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unknown splinter group that has gone from mischief,
spray-painting, threats, and so on, to incendiary devices,'' said
Police Commander Douglas Hurley, head of the arson squad. ``It's
dangerous. One of these days someone is going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the businesses targeted have English-sounding names _
Le Bargain Shop, Green Stop restaurant, for example _ although none
has been a multinational corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message sent to Montreal newspapers and radio
stations, the group warned that ``companies that use their English
trade names . . . their days are numbered.''
</P>
<P>
   It went on: ``Second Cup coffee shops. . . are very tempting.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent attack was on Wednesday, when a Montreal church
with a predominantly English-speaking congregation was set ablaze
by an incendiary bomb. St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church
suffered smoke and flame damage before firefighters extinguished
the early morning blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The firebombing occurred on the day the church's basement social
hall was to have been used for a fund-raiser for an Anglophone
rights group, Alliance Quebec. The group's challenges to Quebec's
language laws _ which enshrine French as the province's sole
official language _ have won it the enmity of separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the bombing, the Brigade took credit in a
statement sent by e-mail to news organizations. ``From now on, hall
owners who rent to Alliance Quebec must know that by associating
with these anti-Quebec racists, they expose themselves to
reprisal.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's large English-speaking community, although dominated
by Quebecers of British and Jewish descent, includes Chinese,
Caribbean blacks, East Indians, Greeks, and other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was held at another location under heavy police
protection. Ironically, what would have been an obscure event
receiving little or no media attention drew heavy coverage because
of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an attempt by terrorists to intimidate us,'' said
Brent Tyler, a Montreal lawyer. ``But we will not be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even hard-core elements of the secessionist movement condemned
the firebombings and vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know nothing about this group,'' said a spokesman for the
Societe St.-Jean Baptiste, an organization that vociferously
advocates independence for Quebec.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps I'm showing my age (50 next month), but it seems like
only yesterday that the Democratic Party wholeheartedly championed
government stimulus as necessary to promote economic growth, while
Republicans backed fiscal rectitude as the best policy to ensure a
healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   John Maynard Keynes, who developed the theory that increasing
government deficits stimulate a sluggish economy, was long the
guiding light of liberal economists; Milton Friedman, who said the
government should limit spending to the bare minimum and blamed ups
and downs in the money supply for economic disruptions, inspired
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1993, when economic advisers of the newly elected
Bill Clinton recommended that he present a budget calling for tax
increases and spending cuts, he moaned: Did we get elected only to
become Eisenhower Republicans?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the answer was yes. But while a Democratic
president found himself, much against his initial desires, turning
his back on Keynes and championing budgetary restraint, Republicans
united behind big, Ronald Reagan-style tax cuts as the solution to
whatever might be ailing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this 180-degree reversal of traditional party positions
on fiscal policy is firmly enshrined in the presidential election
campaigns of Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in presenting his own budget blueprint, called for paying
off more than $3 trillion in federal debt over the next 10 years.
By contrast, the centerpiece of Bush's campaign is a 10-year, $1.3
trillion tax cut that would reduce debt by a much smaller $1.7
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Economic thinkers have switched roles, too. ``Fiscal policy, as
a tool of macroeconomic policy, is dead,'' says Robert Litan,
director of economic studies at the moderately liberal Brookings
Institution. ``The thinking now is that any fine-tuning should be
left to the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lawrence Lindsey, Bush's principal economic adviser, has
said he fears that the economy may soon stumble badly, and he
argues that an across-the-board tax cut is the best way to ward off
a recession. ``You can hear in Larry's argument a kind of
anticipatory Keynesianism,'' Litan said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the parties have not abandoned their governing
philosophies entirely. For Democrats, relying on much of the annual
surpluses to pay down the national debt is a popular way to win
support for spending on particular programs that benefit their
prime constituencies. The Republicans' tax cuts would go mainly to
the wealthy and would help prevent higher spending by starving the
government of extra tax money rolling in from the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by trading places on economic policy, Republicans and
Democrats have created all kinds of paradoxes. Many Wall Street
economists, for example, are more worried about Bush becoming
president than they are about Gore. A recent report from Goldman,
Sachs warned that the Federal Reserve, already fearing that the
economy cannot grow any faster without prompting higher inflation,
would probably respond to a big package of stimulative tax
reductions by pushing up interest rates sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysis strongly suggests that the economy is more likely
to be hurt than helped by a tax cut,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the views of Robert Solow, the liberal economist and
Nobel laureate who long taught at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. While he favors budget surpluses for now as a tool to
help increase investment and productivity, he wrote recently in The
New York Review of Books that Gore was making a mistake by calling
for elimination of the federal debt as an end in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, it is no surprise that many
economists contend that the best way to ensure continued American
prosperity is to have one party control the White House and the
other the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote for gridlock,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at
Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. ``It's good for Wall Street, and for
Main Street, too. If we get gridlock in November, then tax cuts
will be limited and so will new spending programs. We will have no
choice but to continue paying off the federal debt.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be a narrow perspective, but it could also prove a
popular one right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are good, incomes are rising, unemployment is low,''
said Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a
former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ``These days,
the American people aren't looking to Washington to solve their
problems.''

<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines _ Residents fleeing a military campaign
to wipe out a rebel group in the southern Philippines arrived here
exhausted and shaken Friday, some crying as they greeted relatives,
others bearing tales of civilian deaths and torture by government
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials acknowledged that 4,823 families _ an
estimated 15,000 people _ had been displaced in rebel strongholds
and are in 30 evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado and Armed Forces Joint Chief
of Staff General Angelo Reyes said, however, that only two
civilians had died as a result of the operation that began a week
ago to wipe out a band of Muslim extremists who have made millions
of dollars in a revolving door of hostage-takings this year. The
Abu Sayyaf rebels are still holding 17 hostages, including a
24-year-old American, Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling and his captors contacted a radio station here from an
undisclosed location and appealed to the government to halt the
risky military operation on southern Jolo Island and free him
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military operation doesn't have any effect'' on the Abu
Sayyaf rebels, Schilling said. ``Those who are affected are
civilians and their farm animals. We are here, very much alive, and
nothing has happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with Radio Mindanao Network, on a conference call with
a reporter; his mother, Carol, in Oakland, Calif.; and his captor,
rebel leader Abu Sabaya.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have arisen about Schilling's whereabouts during
Friday's interview, since mobile and fixed telephone lines from
Jolo Island have been suspended. Asked if the rebels could have
evaded a naval blockade and slipped past 4,000 troops swarming the
tiny island to escape to the neighboring island of Basilan, another
rebel stronghold, Reyes said he believed the rebels used a
satellite phone, but would not say where he thought they were.
</P>
<P>
   Recriminations followed Schilling's interview, with a senior
government official in Manila saying Schilling is ``not the
ordinary kind of hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, a convert to Islam, visited an Abu Sayyaf camp on
Aug. 28 with his Filipina wife, Ivy, a cousin of the rebel leader,
purportedly to learn more about the group's ideas, but later argued
with the rebels about religion and was not allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the tone of what he is saying,'' government Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said. ``Very clearly, if he is not
involved, he has fallen for his kidnappers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in an interview with a French magazine, the son of
Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy, who recently bankrolled the release
of eight European and two South African hostages, said he could not
assist in securing the American's release, and accused the
University of California-Berkeley graduate of being an arms dealer
selling weapons to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity dismissed
the charge, saying Schilling appears to be as idealistic Muslim
convert and perhaps naive, but said there is no evidence he was
involved in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the southern command military headquarters, defense
secretary Mercado denied that Schilling had been written off by the
government as an Abu Sayyaf collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still a hostage,'' Mercado said, suggesting that
Schilling's comments were likely made under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the seventh day of the operation in which General
Reyes had vowed to wipe out the rebels. His original deadline was a
week. ``Admittedly, we are sort of behind schedule,'' said Reyes,
but he added that two hostages had come out unharmed and the
military has ``demonstrated that other further acts (of terrorism)
will be met with firm action.''
</P>
<P>
   The two French hostages who fled their captors and walked to
freedom Wednesday morning criticized the Philippine government
Friday, saying that the military assault is endangering civilians
and the hostages, while the rebels who were holding them had
suffered no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, witnesses in Jolo reported two bodies with gunshot
wounds to the head were found, one dumped near an army base and one
near a municipal government office in Jolo. One of the men had been
blindfolded and his hands tied behind his back, while the other two
had been hogtied. A fourth body of a woman believed to be the
daughter of a suspected Abu Sayyaf member was found shot dead in
another part of town.
</P>
<P>
   Samsula Adju, a university chancellor who came from Jolo Friday,
said, ``We do not know how many ... but one thing is sure: that
civilians have been killed and houses burned. . . . I favor the
military operation, but only against the Abu Sayyaf, not against
innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The military said that police reports indicated the four
apparently executed bodies were the result of family feuds and a
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor from a government medical team sent to Jolo said that
two injured men from a town that is a base for the rebels told him
that soldiers had burned them and other civilians civilians with
cigarettes and beat them with sticks, according to the Philippine
Daily Inquirer, one of a very few news organizations that managed
to enter Jolo despite a ban on media there.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado said people making such allegations must prove them, but
added: ``If evidence comes, we will not spare any soldier or
officer ... we will prosecute any human rights violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports also emerged that a boat carrying 10 people believed to
be Abu Sayyaf relatives was hit by a helicopter gunship last
Sunday, killing all aboard. A female refugee who arrived from Jolo
Thursday said she was at a wedding last where 10 people were killed
by a government bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Officials they had no evidence to back up these reports, with
Mercado insisting, ``We do not doctor casualty lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdusakur Tan, governor of Sulu province, of which Jolo is the
capital, defended the military, saying, ``There is overwhelming
support by people _ even those who are affected in evacuation
centers are willing to do a little sacrifice in order to give the
military operation a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   With reporters banned from the battle zones, it is impossible to
reconcile the contradictory accounts of the military assault.
Officials said reports of civilian casualties might be referring to
25 suspected Abu Sayyaf members who are confirmed dead as well as
an estimated 50 to 60 more whose bodies have not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abu Sayyaf are civilians...lawless civlians,'' Reyes said.

   Got a script you want to send to an agent, but nervous (given
the blood, sweat, toil and tears you've invested) about your
precious baby actually arriving? Go to Final Draft's Web site
(www.finaldraft.com) and with a click, you can set up an account
through UPS to securely e-mail your precious product to whomever
you want.
</P>
<P>
   The price, charged monthly, is relatively cheap -- $2.50 for the
first 120 pages (that's a two-hour movie, too short for David Lean
but fine for the rest of us). If the recipient doesn't have Final
Draft, which is one of the big scriptwriting programs, they can
download a free reader program from the Web site to check out the
script.
</P>
<P>
   Is the service worth the price? Well, a company spokeswoman says
the main benefits are that it's secure (literally
industrial-strength 128-bit encryption through UPS) and trackable,
so you can make sure it was received by only the person you sent it
to. And it's a lot quicker and cheaper than printing and delivering
a hard-copy version of your masterwork.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's interesting that UPS is involved in this high-tech
delivery system, the real question is whether an even more
hidebound institution, Hollywood, is ready to receive scripts that
can't easily be read while sitting by the pool at the Beverly Hills
Hotel. &QL; 
GADGETS DU JOUR &QL; 
Those with small children or small hands will appreciate Datadesk
Technologies' new LittleFingers computer keyboard. Datadesk
``smushed'' the keys together so the entire contraption is only
12.5 inches long, even though it also includes a full array of
function keys and a built-in three-button trackball. The company
says the keys are sized and spaced to improve children's typing
performance.
</P>
<P>
   I like the fact that Datadesk has made the keyboard compatible
with both older Macintoshes (those with ADB ports) and PCs (those
with PS/2 ports), though I hope to see a model that uses the USB
port found on newer Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also rigged the keyboard to allow both it and an
adult-size keyboard and mouse to be attached to the same port on a
Windows-based PC, a small but useful trick for parents who want to
work with their children, or who also use the same computer. Go to
www.data-desk.com for more information.
</P>
<P>
   I also recommend Belkin Components' great USB BusStation, which
quells the most annoying part of USB connectivity: trying to manage
all the devices you want to connect through these ports.
</P>
<P>
   The BusStation gives you seven new USB ports (your computer
probably comes with two, and some keyboards and monitors will give
you another one or two).
</P>
<P>
   If, somehow, being able to connect your scanner, printer, PDA
docking station, videocamera, joystick, external hard drive and
rewritable CD-ROM drive isn't enough, or you have other kinds of
devices, you can buy additional interchangeable modules. BusStation
currently offers modules, in several colors, to add not only more
USB ports but also Ethernet, serial-port and SCSI devices for
either Apple Power Macintosh or Windows-based PCs. Go to
www.belkin.com for more information. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON RELEASES OIL FROM STRATEGIC RESERVE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton authorized a limited release of
oil from the government's emergency stockpile Friday amid growing
concern of a winter home heating crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The decision immediately heated up one thing _ the political
dialogue between presidential rivals Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices rising and heating oil inventories shrinking,
the president directed the release of 30 million barrels of oil
from the 571 million-barrel stockpile created after the Arab oil
embargoes of the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not political,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said
Friday in announcing Clinton's action. ``The president wants to
help the American people get home heating oil and have enough heat
in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, charged that the
administration had authorized tapping the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve solely to help Gore escape voters' anger for high energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten months ago, the president and vice president thought it
was a bad idea to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve,'' the Texas governor said at a campaign stop in Tampa,
Fla. ``Now that we are 46 days away from the election, they changed
their minds. I agree with them that it was a bad idea in the past,
and I still think it's a bad idea today.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Gore opposed tapping the oil reserves. But on
Thursday, Gore said ``the situation has changed'' over the past
eight months. Oil-producing countries ``have not followed through''
on pledges to increase production, a step that would have eased
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision came less than 24 hours after Gore made
a public plea for such action, and on the same day that Gore was
campaigning in Pennsylvania, accusing Bush, a former oil company
executive, of being an ``apologist'' for big oil interests.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, rising gasoline prices are becoming an
issue in the presidential campaign after months of undirected
grumbling by consumers. And in the Northeast and Midwest, key
regions in the presidential contest, the escalating cost of heating
oil adds another dimension to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, home heating oil inventories are 19 percent lower
than a year ago, Richardson said, and in New England, they are 65
percent lower. Additionally, wholesale home heating oil prices have
risen 38 percent to $1.04 a gallon over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that American families are warm this
winter,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary said oil from the strategic reserve would
be made available over the next 30 days, with the first bids to be
issued Monday. Refineries that get the oil would have to replenish
the strategic reserve at a later date, when oil prices would
presumably be lower.
</P>
<P>
   Oil was last released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
1991, when the United States led a United Nations coalition to
repel Iraqi military forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   However, oil in the reserve has been used several other times in
temporary swap arrangements to help specific refiners with brief
supply or pipeline problems. Most recently, Conoco and Citgo
borrowed 1 million barrels in July when a shipping channel was
blocked, and the two refineries later restocked the reserve with
1.03 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the relatively modest release of 1 million
barrels a day over the next 30 months would have on the price of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices will fall, but the effect will be temporary,'' Al
Rodriguez, president of the Organization of Petroleum Countries
(OPEC), said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu news conference in Pennsylvania, Gore told
reporters that he believes there are ``disagreements within OPEC,''
and that releasing oil from the U.S. reserves would prompt the
cartel to hike production.
</P>
<P>
   It is equally unclear what the political consequences could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the decision helps bring down the price of oil, I don't
think the American people will care very much that it was a crass
political move,'' said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution
political analyst. ``On the other hand, if it doesn't do any good,
what people will remember was that Gore played politics with
something important to them.''

AS POLLS IN YUGOSLAVIA SHOW MILOSEVIC TRAILING, FEARS OF VOTE FRAUD
RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ With Yugoslavs preparing to vote on
Sunday, final opinion polls show that President Slobodan Milosevic
continues to trail his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, but by
a margin that may just be narrow enough to overcome through
election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Poll results vary widely here, partly because of the uncertainty
about how votes in Montenegro and Kosovo will be cast and counted.
The Montenegrin government has said it is staying out of the
election. But supporters of Milosevic there will probably vote,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the Serb community probably numbers barely 100,000
people, and the Albanian majority will continue their decade-old
boycott of any Yugoslav election. But Milosevic may try, as he has
in previous elections, to fake the results by claiming hundreds of
thousands of votes from Kosovo, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition insists that Milosevic will attempt widespread
vote manipulation. He and his government say that the elections
will be free and fair, and counter-charging that the opposition is
preparing vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting assertions may allow Milosevic, if he chooses,
to invalidate the election on Sunday and call a rerun at a later
date, when interest and passions may have cooled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most reliable polls of Serbia without Kosovo,
completed a week ago, shows Kostunica with 32.5 percent of the vote
compared with Milosevic's 26.6 percent, with 20.2 percent undecided
and 8 percent saying they will not vote at all. Among those who say
they are sure to vote, Kostunica receives 45.3 percent compared to
Milosevic's 37.1 percent, with the candidate of the Serbian Radical
Party, led by Vojislav Seselj, receiving 10.1 percent and the
candidate of the Serbian Renewal Movement, a party led by Vuk
Draskovic, receiving 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Srdjan Bogosavljevic, director of the Strategic Marketing and
Media Research Institute, which conducted the poll, said that ``in
a free and fair counting'' no one candidate would be able to win
more than 50 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   To win in the first round, Bogosavljevic said, Milosevic would
have to find, steal or manufacture an additional 700,000 votes or
manage to disqualify large numbers of votes for his opponents, an
almost impossible task without widespread and obvious faking in
Kosovo. A high turnout would also make vote fraud much harder to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Even opposition leaders expect that Milosevic will declare
victory in the first round, avoiding a runoff, a fatalism explicit
in Bogosavljevic's poll. When asked who will win the elections,
nearly 41 percent of Serbs said Milosevic, compared with 30 percent
for Kostunica, with 25 percent unsure or unwilling to say.
</P>
<P>
   People will also be voting for the upper and lower house of the
federal Parliament and for local government. In 1996, the
opposition won most of Serbia's largest cities. But a split between
the Serbian Renewal Movement and the rest of the opposition may
lead to the loss of some cities this time, including Kragujevac and
possibly even Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a nongovernmental
organization that is trying to monitor the fairness of the poll,
said it already has evidence of fraud in the presidential race. The
director of the center, Slobodanka Nedovic, was given a genuine
ballot already filled out for Milosevic. Some state workers have
reported that they expect to be handed such filled-out ballots,
with instructions to return the blank ones that they receive at the
polling stations to their supervisors on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition here has published newspaper advertisements that
urge such workers, if they fear for their jobs, to pretend to go
along but to invalidate their ballots by circling the names of all
five presidential candidates rather than casting an unwanted vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most opposition leaders and experts said they thought that
stealing more than 10 percent or 15 percent of the vote in Serbia
would be extremely difficult, because polling stations will be
monitored by party officials, including members of the Serbian
Radical Party. Its leader, Seselj, although in a coalition with
Milosevic, has accused him of unfair media practices and preparing
to steal the election.
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for Milosevic to claim more than 150,000
votes from Montenegro, which has 440,000 voters, at most.
</P>
<P>
   The two main potential areas for fraud, the experts said, are
Kosovo and the security services. For the first time in Yugoslavia,
the police as well as the military will be allowed to vote at their
barracks, where there will be no monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The main source for possibly fraudulent votes will be Kosovo and
those who live or used to live there. Because it is run by the
United Nations and patrolled by NATO-led troops, Serbian officials
have extended two Serbian constituencies, Vranje and Prokuplje, to
cover the territory and population of Kosovo, including more than 1
million ethnic Albanian voters.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and the Yugoslavian Federal Election Commission that
he controls have announced several hundred polling stations
throughout Kosovo. State-controlled media have been quoting a few
Kosovar Albanians as saying they will vote for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious case of electoral fraud was in the 1997 Serbian
presidential elections, when 200,000 Kosovo Albanians were listed
as voting for Milosevic's candidate, Milan Milutinovic, providing a
margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj, a strident nationalist who has fallen in and out of
favor with Milosevic over the last decade, was widely considered
the real victor. But the round in which he triumphed was declared
invalid because of fraud, buying Milosevic time in which to conjure
up a victory. In the end, there were four rounds of voting, and
that may be a model for Milosevic this time.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may have left himself another option, with the
declaration by his federal prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, that
Milosevic's mandate as president runs through its original term of
July 2001, no matter what happens in these elections. The
constitution, amended in a day in July to allow for direct
presidential elections, is unclear on the point. But applicable
laws would indicate that his mandate should end within 10 days if
he loses the election.

REGGIE LEWIS WIDOW PURSUES MALPRACTICE CASE APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ Returning to court to ask a judge to reopen her appeal
of a jury verdict clearing her late husband's chief cardiologist of
medical malpractice, Donna Harris-Lewis testified Friday against
one of her former attorneys, who she says failed to pursue the
appeal and never told her it was at risk of being dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Neil Rossman, who represented Harris-Lewis in the
retrial of the lawsuit she brought against Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge
Jr., has said he searched for issues to appeal but found none.
Rossman also maintains that he delayed filing appellate documents
to give Harris-Lewis time to find a new lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith dismissed
Harris-Lewis's appeal in July after she missed a filing deadline
required to continue it.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's hearing, at which Harris-Lewis was represented by a new
team of lawyers -- a lead attorney from New Jersey, Anthony J.
Macri, and two others from Boston, Pamela Harris-Daley and Krista
M. Larsen -- made clear the extent to which Rossman and
Harris-Lewis's relationship has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the witness stand, Harris-Lewis said Rossman initially
told her he would handle the appeal, ``but that it would cost
$100,000 and that I'd be wasting my money.'' Yet several weeks
later, Harris-Lewis said, Rossman told her she should hire a
different attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questioning from Mudge's attorney, William J.
Dailey Jr., Harris-Lewis insisted that Rossman had given her ``no
definitive date'' as a deadline for continuing the appeal.
Harris-Lewis also said she wasn't aware the appeal had been
dismissed until she heard it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Rossman, represented by his brother, Boston attorney Jeffrey
Rossman, will take the stand Tuesday to offer his version of
events.

 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday.
 &HT;    Bush is back on track while Gore backtracks
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUN CITY CENTER, Fla. _ For Gov. George W. Bush last week was a
welcome reversal of fortune: Al Gore had to play defense for the
first time since the August Democratic convention while Bush basked
in good reviews on the daytime talk show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took his new ``Real Plans for Real People'' pitch to middle
class voters in nine states. He talked tax cuts, education, and
Social Security. And he promised to double the budget for the
National Institutes of Health and spend more on cancer research _
longstanding proposals repackaged for residents of this retirement
community near Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, Bush teared up on the Oprah Winfrey Show, sat
for interviews with Diane Sawyer, Brian Williams and Paula Zahn and
traded his usual white oxford shirt and conservative tie for the
Regis Philbin look as he jousted with Philbin Thursday on ``Live
with Regis!''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on bread-and-butter issues and regular guy TV
appearances helped staunch the campaign's recent self-inflicted
wounds, said pollster John Zogby, who released a survey this week
showing Gore ahead by four percentage points, down from seven
points in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore spent the early part of last week defending
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He and Lieberman, attended a Hollywood fundraiser a week after
blasting the entertainment industry as too sexy and violent. The
Boston Globe reported that Gore misrepresented a story he told
senior citizens about the cost of an arthritis drug. And questions
were raised when he told a Teamsters audience in Las Vegas that he
grew up listening to union lullabies and then sang, ``Look for the
Union Label,'' a song written when Gore was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest it's becoming a test of which candidate
can stay on message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got back on track, back to the basic message,'' the
pollster Zogby said of Bush. ``All he needed to do was get on
track. This is a competitive race and, barring something
unforeseen, I think it will continue to be. ``
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Tracking Poll, released Thursday, showed
Bush's Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore ahead 51 percent to
41 percent, in a poll with a four point margin of error. At the
same time, a Voter.com- Battleground 2000 daily tracking poll
through Tuesday showed Bush up 42 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever significance the conflicting surveys hold, this week
went well enough to at least dim troubles that plagued a Bush
campaign once so smooth it practically hummed, Zogby and others
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a series of campaign trail potholes forcing Bush to
spend day after day responding to questions about his use of a
vulgarity to describe a New York Times reporter, a Republican
National Committee campaign ad that flashed the word ``RATS'' _
part of the word bureaucrats _and his trouble pronouncing the word
``subliminal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff wasn't important,'' Zogby said. ``What it was was a
block to his message.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 White House bid, agreed
that Bush was back on his game. Right now, Reed said the only polls
that matter are in Midwestern battleground states and Florida,
where Bush and Gore are engaged in hand -to- hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important is that Bush be getting his legs back,''
he said. ``He's in the battleground states. National polls are more
mood enhancers right now. They set the tone but they don't effect
the electoral college.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, warns
that Bush still has a hard fight ahead. Buchanan isn't sure, for
example, that wavering Democrats and independents will buy Bush's
proposals, especially his 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut plan that
critics say favors the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not preaching to the choir,'' Buchanan said. ``He's got
to convince people in swing states who already think Gore's plans
are better.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was Bush's 10th visit to Florida since he began
campaigning, his third since the Republican National Convention in
August. He also campaigned in Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois,
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, was
also in Florida Friday and Gore will be here Monday. Gore has been
to Florida nine times, including three trips since the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Bush's campaign plane Friday, spokeswoman Karen Hughes
called the week, ``very strong and substantive,'' and took a shot
at Gore's veracity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore started this week changing his tune in
Hollywood,'' she said. ``He made up facts about his mother-in-law
and dog's prescription drugs. Then he remembered a childhood
lullaby that hadn't been written until he was 27. ``
</P>
<P>
   Bush also intensified his attacks on Gore over oil and gas
prices. Gore this week called on President Clinton to tap the
nation's emergency oil supply in the wake of skyrocketing gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponent yesterday proposed an idea that said he was going
to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,'' Bush told a crowd in
Sarasota. ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is meant for a national
war. That's what it's meant for. It's meant for a major disruption
of supply. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be used as a
short-term political fix for somebody whose administration has been
asleep at the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   He later told Sun City Center residents that Gore, ``did a
political somersault,'' on the oil issue and took direct aim at his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard you say it's somebody else's fault,'' Bush said.
``It's a major oil company's fault. It's so and so's fault. No, Mr.
Vice President, you need to take responsibility for your
administration. ``
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp fired back, criticizing Bush's running mate, Dick
Cheney, for last spring urging OPEC leaders to deal with a glutted
market by cutting production. Cheney resigned as CEO of Halliburton
Co., the Dallas oil services giant, when he joined the Bush ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush and Dick Cheney have told us that they are going
to stand with the big oil companies at the expense of average
working families,'' Gore spokeswoman Kym Spell said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said it's unclear yet what effect the oil and gas issue
will have and he called the race, ``unsettled.'' Even with the
persistent questions about his relationship to the truth, Buchanan
said Gore's got the edge at a time of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say (the polls) indicate a fluid state of affairs,'' he
said. ``But I would still say that Gore has the momentum at the
moment.''

TINY TEGLA LORUOPE SEEKS MEDAL IN MARATHON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ At 4 feet 11 inches and 84 pounds, Tegla Loroupe is so
tiny that a size-0 petite is a little big on her, but she's a woman
with a huge mission: winning the first Olympic marathon gold medal
for her native Kenya. It is astounding that a country whose men
have dominated the 26.2-mile distance for more than a decade have
been able to produce neither a male world record-holder nor an
Olympic champion. Come Sunday morning, it could have one woman who
is both.
</P>
<P>
   `That would be very special,'' said Loroupe.
</P>
<P>
   She owns the world record of 2 hours 20 minutes 43 seconds, but
the second half of the battle will be as difficult as it would be
unique. Of the 58 women entered in Sunday's event, at least 11 have
personal bests of under 2 hours 25 minutes and 20 more have run
under 2:30, making it almost certainly the fastest women's field in
history. So while Loroupe may be the world-record holder, she
should have plenty of company. Add to that a course similar to that
of the Boston Marathon _ plenty of hills and a net elevation drop
that starts with a sharp downhill of about 1 1/2 miles _ and the
2000 Olympic women's marathon is not exactly playing into Loroupe's
hands, despite her status as world record-holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too hilly and too slopey,'' said the fastest woman in the
world. ``I think Boston is easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe was second in Boston in 1996, leading for much of the
race before she twisted her side reaching for fluid at a water
table, allowing Uta Pippig to stage an amazing come-from-behind
win.
</P>
<P>
   Her German coach and manager, Volker Wagner, states his concerns
about the Sydney course more forcefully. ``When I saw it I thought,
how crazy are the people who choose the course?'' he said angrily.
``(They) don't care about athletes. I think it will affect Tegla
more than others. She doesn't like to run downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Loroupe, 27, is philosophical. ``I have to accept everything
or it will be a psychological disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, for the things she refuses to accept for the
same reason. Such as heeding her father's wishes that, as a
schoolgirl, she not run. Such as listening to the New York doctor
who told her a few years ago that she had a serious back condition
and might have to stop running. Such as obeying the Kenyan
athletics federation, which does not always seem to act with her
best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't fight,'' she said, ``no one will help you.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Loroupe began to emerge on the world stage, finishing
10th at 10,000 meters at Barcelona, but it was her back-to-back New
York City Marathon wins in 1994 and 1995 that propelled her to its
center, giving her a platform to jab at the Kenyan federation's
lack of support for female athletes. She sticks up for herself, as
well: At the country's recent Olympic Trials, the federation had
inexplicably scheduled Loroupe to run the 1,500 meters instead of
the 10,000. When she heard that, she said she would run the 10,000
meters without a bib number if she had to, but she was running it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so tiny, and she'll go toe to toe with those guys,''
said Anne Roberts, the elite athlete coordinator who has become
like a mother to Loroupe. ``They're not used to having women fight
back.''
</P>
<P>
   She ran the 10,000 and she won it, paving the way _ in case
there wasn't already the potential for enough history _ for a
possible, daring marathon/10,000 meter double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided this a long time ago, so I will just do it,'' said
Loroupe. ``I know it's only three days (of recovery time) but we
will see. I think it's better sometimes to try things. I hope I
will not be the last person!''
</P>
<P>
   The marathon is Sunday, with the first round of the 10,000
meters Wednesday afternoon. Although Loroupe is still hopeful,
Wagner is less so.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing the course, the chances to be good in the 10,000
are almost impossible,'' he said, although he said he won't rule it
out until seeing how Loroupe recovers after the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Her history of quick recoveries is a good one. Last year, she
set a world-best in the Berlin Marathon and a week later won the
World Half-Marathon Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney marathon course, however, is a lot tougher than
Berlin, with the downhills beating up the thigh muscles in much the
same way Boston does. It will tend to favor the stronger runners,
such as defending Olympic champion and three-time Boston winner
Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, and a three-woman contingent from Japan of
Naoko Takahashi (2:21:47 personal best), Ari Ichihashi (2:27:02),
and Eri Yamaguchi (2:22:12), who are rumored to be planning an
assault on the 2:20 barrier. Add Lidia Simon of Romania, who does
especially well in women-only races, to the list of challengers.
Then again, add just about everyone: Few had heard of Roba when she
won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to expect anything,'' said Loroupe.
</P>
<P>
   Especially from her.

MORE DETAILS EMERGE OF VIDEOTAPE CONFESSION IN FRENCH KICKBACK
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ More details were made public Friday from the videotaped
confession of a former aide to President Jacques Chirac who
described how he collected kickbacks from contractors installing
elevators and painting hallways in city housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who is accused on the tape of masterminding a
multimillion dollar slush fund in the 1980s, issued a vehement
denial Thursday suggesting that the release of the tape made by the
aide, who died last year, was the work of his political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But he ignored the matter Friday as the daily Le Monde ran
another two pages of transcripts from the aide's detailed account
of how he collected millions of dollars in kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Jean-Claude Mery, a former official in Chirac's party,
discusses how he helped companies win construction contracts, and
in return, usually got about 1.5 percent of the value of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sums were staggering,'' the transcript in Le Monde reads.
``I transferred more than $1 million in less than a year to certain
banks in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mery said the money had gone only to further Chirac's
political ambitions and that of his allies in the party, the Rally
for the Republic, and had not been for Chirac's personal use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you we were working for Chirac's benefit,'' Mery says
on the tape. ``Not for Chirac's pocket personally, let me make that
clear right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Socialists called on the judicial system Friday to
get to the bottom of the allegations, but their remarks were low
key. On the tape, Mery says that kickbacks the party collected were
shared with the Socialist and Communist parties, though Chirac's
party kept by far the biggest cut.
</P>
<P>
   The tape surfaced Thursday when the newspaper ran the first two
pages of transcript. It reported that the tape had been recorded in
1996, when Mery was under investigation for illicit fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Mery, a developer and a member of the party's steering
committee, says on the tape that he is recording his confessions
because unspecified promises had been made to him but were being
ignored. He said he had been told by some friends to make the tape
and spread the word that it existed. He hoped that it would
guarantee his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who has been dogged for years by hints of corruption
during his terms as mayor and as leader of his conservative
Gaullist party, took the highly unusual step of going on television
Thursday night to dismiss Mery's accusations as a ``fantastic
story.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the tape amounted to no more than producing ``a man who
had been dead more than a year, laying out implausible events that
supposedly happened more than 14 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday he made his scheduled appearance in the southwest of
France, including campaigning in favor of Sunday's referendum to
reduce the term of the French president to five years from seven.
He did not discuss the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   After Mery made the hourlong recording, which shows him sitting
on a couch in his shirtsleeves, he gave the tape to the journalist
who had set up the video camera for him and occasionally prodded
him with questions.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Arnaud Hamelin, said he had been told to make
the tape public if Mery died under mysterious circumstances. But
Mery died of cancer last year. This, Hamelin said, left him free to
do what he pleased, unless he heard otherwise from the dead man's
family.
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin said he waited a year to come forward with the tape
because he considered a year a reasonable delay. Friday, two
magistrates already investigating various members of the party for
illicit fund raising, job scams and election fraud searched
Hamelin's offices with police officers and seized a copy of the
tape. It is unlikely to be valuable evidence in the courts, but it
could help the magistrates _ who are the equivalent of prosecutors
_ understand the overall picture of what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, however, can not be prosecuted for anything other than
high treason. Last year, France's constitutional court ruled that
Chirac can't face criminal charges as long as he is president.

FREEMAN HOLDS CONTINENTAL-SIZED HOPES ON HER SHOULDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ American athletes sometimes think they have pressure
placed on them. Try having to please a whole continent.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, Australia is the only land mass that's officially
labeled both a country and a continent, but, semantics aside, there
is no doubt that Cathy Freeman has more at stake in these Olympics
than any athlete not facing the consequences of failure while
living in a totalitarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Her Olympic competition began on a breezy Friday evening before
close to 100,000 spectators, a vast majority of whom were
professing some sort of loyalty to her as the new queen of
Australian sport. It was time to qualify in the women's 400 meters,
and she did so in a not-too-taxing jaunt of 51.63, the fifth-best
time.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was a somewhat controversial choice to light the flame
at the opening ceremonies and now she'd better deliver what
Australians want. She does have a dazzling resume, and she
certainly is the favorite in her race, but in the matter of Olympic
medals the best she can claim is a silver four years ago. There'll
be none of that Baron de Coubertin stuff this time about taking
part being an end in itself. After the way she's been canonized,
she's simply got to deliver a gold as a proper ``Thank You'' for
the honor she's already been given.
</P>
<P>
   And as if the pressure wasn't already enormous enough, the
stakes were raised even higher Thursday with the shocking
revelation that defending 400-meter champion Maria-Jose Perec of
France (via Guadaloupe) had bolted from her hotel room and fled to
Europe. Perec had been painted as Freeman's archrival, even though
the tortured runner has barely raced during the past four years due
to injury, illness, and her perpetually battered psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Perec had been a mystery, yes, but a powerful one, and even
though hardly anyone has laid eyes on her in competition these past
few years she was still regarded as the person with the best chance
of beating Freeman, who has won 41 of her last 42 races since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With Perec absent, the Australian public now perceives that the
major threat to Freeman is gone. As usual, perception is much more
in play than reality that a field including America's La Tasha
Colander-Richardson, Mexico's Gabriela Guereva-Espinoza, and Great
Britain's Katherine Merry could pose any problems for the suddenly
sainted Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   As an Aborigine, she knows a little something about pressure in
Australian daily life. Her heritage clearly had something to do
with her selection to light the flame _ too much, say some
Australian naysayers, who are busy mumbling about rampant political
correctedness on the part of the Australian Olympic officials while
maintaining that the honor should have gone to someone with at
least one gold medal in his or her possession.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure, therefore, swirls all about. She's got people adoring
her by the millions. That would include just about every breathing
Aborigine, plus women and fair-minded sportsmen of the male
persuasion. They are expecting her to deliver for Australia. She
also has people not on her side, people who continue to regard
Aborigines as subhuman, people adamant about this no-gold medal
situation, and people who just don't like what they perceive as the
big PC quotient involved with her selection as the focal point of
the opening ceremony. But they still want her to win _ for
Australia. And God have mercy on her soul if she doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tremendous burden for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, says Chris Wardlaw, the Australian head track
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be an inspiration or an overwhelming pressure,'' he
declares. ``But she's not as good as she is by getting wobbly at
those sort of things.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wardlaw sees it, Freeman, like so many of these great
athletes on display here, has a superior capacity to internalize.
``That's because she has a pretty cool purpose _ to run well,'' he
says. `` `We' all think about those things, but she thinks about
running. That's all she's thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   She seemed oblivious to the pressure as she walked onto the
Olympic Stadium track Friday night to the chants of ``Ca-thy!''
When she was introduced as the competitor from lane 3, a great roar
that surely might have disturbed a dinner party in Canberra went up
from the crowd. She settled nicely into the starting blocks, took
off nicely, and ran a patently controlled race, making no attempt
to do anything more than run well enough to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Her work done, she walked through the media mob in the Mixed
Zone. ``Cathy, Cathy, please!'' they called out, but she kept on
walking. As she made her final turn toward the locker room, she
glanced back over her right shoulder and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly looked like a professional athlete in complete
control of her situation.

PATRIOTS' FAULK HAS HIS EYE ON COUSIN MARSHALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ During his years at Louisiana State University,
second-year Patriots running back Kevin Faulk often wondered if he
was related to Marshall Faulk. After all, he grew up in Lafayette,
La., just a two-hour drive from Marshall Faulk's hometown of New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first met about three years ago back home in Louisiana and
at that time we told each other we were going to find out whether
we were related or not,'' said Kevin Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, after tracing their lineage, they discovered
they were cousins (actually second cousins).
</P>
<P>
   ``May dad was Marshall's dad's cousin,'' said Faulk. ``That
makes us cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Faulk, an All-American at San Diego State who rushed
for 1,282 yards and 1,978 yards his first two seasons in the NFL
with the Colts, now runs and catches the ball for the Super Bowl
champion St. Louis Rams. If there's one player the Patriots' Faulk
would love to emulate it's the Rams' Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can just do so many things,'' said Kevin Faulk. ``He runs
the ball as good as anyone in the league. And all of those catches!
He's a great player. He does all of the things that I like to do
and I hope I have a chance to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Faulk (5 feet 10 inches, 218 pounds) rushed for 1,381
yards on 253 carries for a 5.5-yard average last season. He also
caught 87 passes for 1,048 yards and scored 14 touchdowns. The Rams
gave up a second- and fifth-round draft pick to acquire Faulk from
Colts. Now in his seventh year, he has rushed for more than 1,200
yards three times and more than 1,000 yards five times.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a football gene, Kevin Faulk certainly hopes he
shares one with Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be as involved in this offense as Marshall is in
theirs,'' said Faulk. ``I'm just trying to do the best I can,
contributing on special teams, running back kicks, punts, running
it, catching it. I'll do it all. I'm not tired. I can do all of
those things and carry the ball more on a regular basis. I feel
great. I'm in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Faulk has had two consecutive impressive games, rushing
for 82 yards against the Jets Sept. 11 and 80 last week against the
Vikings. He's averaging 4.2 yards a carry, enabling the Patriots to
carry a 4.0-yard average into Sunday's game with the Dolphins. The
Patriots have not finished a season with 4-yard average since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   As defenses focus on him more and as the season's wear and tear
takes its toll, can Faulk keep running the ball effectively?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's what everybody wants to know,'' said Faulk. ``I
have to have a chance to do it. I did it in college. I've done it
all my life. It's not like I haven't carried the ball a lot in my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Faulk ranks fifth all-time in NCAA history in all-purpose
yards with 6,833. He had 53 touchdowns and trails only Herschel
Walker in Southeastern Conference history in rushing yards (4,557)
and rushing touchdowns (46).
</P>
<P>
   At 5-8, 200 pounds, Kevin Faulk is shorter and not as quick as
his cousin, but he's just as strong and elusive. One of his best
moments as a rookie was a 43-yard run against the Dolphins Nov. 21
(he had 182 all-purpose yards in the game).
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have called Faulk's number a lot more this season
(44 carries). He has had to pick up the slack because rookie J.R.
Redmond was late getting up to the speed and veteran Raymont Harris
was released. He is now the primary rusher, no longer just a
third-down back. Two weeks ago he had 21 carries and got through it
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk sees every week as another chance to prove himself. He
understands the Patriots will need a good running game against the
Dolphins. He wants to run the ball when the Patriots need it most
so that there''ll be no doubts that he's an every-down back. Just
like Marshall.

<P>
   Defensive end Willie McGinest practiced Thursday and Friday and
his status against the Dolphins will likely be decided at game
time. Coach Bill Belichick said Friday that McGinest's injury isn't
in his hamstring but higher on the leg . . . The coach said safety
and special teams player Larry Whigham (leg) will not play against
the Dolphins. It appears linebacker Olrick Johnson will be actived
and used on special teams . . . Look for Tebucky Jones to get a
start at free safety and play a more prominent role than he has the
past two weeks . . . The Patriots put four players on the inactive
list for the Miami game: wide receiver Dane Looker, defensive end
Reggie Grimes, linebacker Matt Chatham, and Whigham. The Dolphins
will be without wide receiver Tony Martin (foot) and defensive
lineman Daryl Gardener (back).

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    YET MORE TALES FROM DEEPEST, DARKEST ARKANSAS
 &HT;

<P>
   Of course special counsel Robert Ray did not get an indictment
against the Clintons in the Whitewater case. The murky Ozarks land
deal was never the central issue in the first family's sleazing
about in Arkansas before they came to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of the petty practices of William Jefferson Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton can argue long into the night about
which of the couple's various pre-White House shenanigans is most
odiferous. But I've always been drawn to the missus and her
representing various scumbags before state regulators appointed by
her then-governor husband.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, scumbags deserve lawyers, but they ought not to be the
governor's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   This point was passed over lightly in about the 400th paragraph
of the original New York Times article on Whitewater in 1992 and
has bubbled up periodically as additional tentacles of the story
were wrestled with. But the angle has rarely been the focus of the
eight-year media, political and legal fascination with the case.
Even now, New York Republicans say voters are so sick of _ or have
so discounted _ Clinton scandals that there is zero mileage for
them in raising the issue against HRC as she runs for the U.S.
Senate from her recently adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton also appears to have escaped any threat of
sanction in Arkansas, unlike the president, who faces leaving the
White House with one less law license than he arrived with eight
years ago. Surely there's a big question about whether a
lawyer-spouse of the governor of New York would have gotten off so
lightly. HRC appears to have chosen her states and her political
timing with exquisite care.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton appears in instances to have attempted to
intentionally cloak her involvement as the lawyer for some
cretinous commercial clients. In writing regulators, she would
sometimes simply have letters signed The Rose Firm, the prestigious
Little Rock legal stable where she practiced. But at least one
commission official, herself politically well-connected, wrote
right back, ``Dear Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   (Full disclosure: An attorney then in the Rose firm, who has
since gone on to other legal scrapes tangentially related to the
Whitewater investigation, was briefly my tax lawyer in the late
1960s when I was a reporter in Little Rock.)
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Hillary Clinton seems always to have been at the heart
of many of the couple's funny-money maneuvers. And, according to
very close associates of the Clintons, there was a good reason:
Hillary's father.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Rodham, an up-from-little (solidly Republican) draper in
Chicago, was not impressed with his daughter's Dogpatch boy friend.
No matter that young Clinton was a Rhodes scholar and, like
Hillary, a Yalie lawyer. In Rodham's view, Clinton was a politician
and, therefore, condemned to a life of relative penury if limited
to his government paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Rodham emphasized _ harped and harped and harped, according to
Clinton intimates _ that Hillary would have to build whatever
financial security the couple was to have. And in her lawyering
days, HRC did have the superior earning ability. When Rodham, who
died in 1993, and his wife moved to Little Rock in retirement he
kept up this barrage, family friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton apparently never has been driven by money.
Political power and the quest for personal adulation and approval
seems to be what gets him up in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton by himself probably would never have gotten into
business dealings with Whitewater figure James McDougal, a
fast-talking promoter whom he'd known at least since Sen. J.
William Fulbright's 1968 re-election campaign. The wealthy
Fulbright subsequently invested (and lost) some money with
McDougal, but it seems to have been a flyer from an old boss who
could afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there are no direct Bill Clinton fingerprints on the
cattle futures deal, in which over nine months in 1978-79 an
account traded in Hillary Rodham's name turned a $1,000 investment
into a $100,000 cash-out. It must be said, of course, that HRC was
steered to the deal by a close political friend of Clinton and that
she made a lot of money at the same time as others were losing
piles with the same shady commodities trader.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be an assuredly fresh take on the Clintons' mess;
perhaps it has been the major subplot of some Whitewater tome I've
mercifully missed. But even given the president's intervening
scandal with Monica Lewinsky, recalling these points makes Hillary
Clinton's current political profiting from her carefully nurtured
``victimhood'' all the more incredible.

 &HT;    AirTran mechanics union attributes delays, cancellations to
inspections
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a week of delays and cancellations, officials at
AirTran Airways' mechanics union said Friday that there was no
organized work slowdown at the discount airline.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, workers began conducting more thorough walk-around
inspections of planes that had previously been dropped, a union
leader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through several months of not giving the aircraft
fine-tuned examinations, and small details were overlooked,'' said
Ken Hilbish, president of Teamsters Local 528.
</P>
<P>
   ``These planes are safe, but things need to get done or they
will slowly get worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cancellations at the airline, which is based in Orlando and
operates an Atlanta hub, peaked Thursday when it scratched 23
flights in and out of Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, AirTran canceled nine flights. Six of those were
pre-canceled on Thursday, and three were canceled Friday because of
stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad day yesterday, but we are recovering,'' said
Marketing Director Tad Hutcheson. He added that the airline follows
all government regulations for aircraft inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The operational problems arise as AirTran and its mechanics
union, the Teamsters, prepare to officially start negotiating on
Oct. 1, when the workers' contract becomes amendable. The two
groups have talked informally since the spring, and some workers
are frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   While no official date has been set, AirTran said it may meet
with the Teamsters as early as next week to continue the informal
talks.

 &HT;    Market catches Intel's drop
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shareholders of Coca-Cola, McDonald's and a host of other ``old
economy'' stocks won't complain because Intel's stock went in the
tank Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The $85 billion in market value lost by the world's biggest
computer-chip maker simply flowed into other stocks, giving the
overall market an essentially up-day except for very early losses.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts regarded Intel's 22 percent share price decline as
an unabashed buying opportunity, not only for Intel but for other
stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend taking advantage of the weakness to buy leading
tech names with strong fundamentals,'' said Megan Graham-Hackett,
director of technology research at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Her take was that the market overreacted to Intel's announcement
late Thursday that its third-quarter sales will fall short of
forecasts due to weaker demand in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Ward, manager of the Gabelli Growth Fund, told Bloomberg
News that ``long-term investors should be taking advantage of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are no further adjustments to this year, earnings
will still be up nicely year-over-year for Intel,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is a member of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average,
but its $13.55 share price decline to $47.94 did not prevent the
blue-chip index from posting a 81.90 point gain to close at
10,847.40.
</P>
<P>
   At its lowest, the Dow was off by 144 points, or 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Dow winners was Coca-Cola, up $3.31 to $52.88; Boeing,
$4 to $64; Hewlett-Packard, $9.25 to $104.25 and even IBM, $2.50 to
$124.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, of which Intel is also one of the biggest
members, rallied from an early decline of 214 points, or 5.6
percent, to close at 3,803.76, down 25.11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts regarded the market's initial reaction to Intel's
third-quarter pre-announcement as a sign of extreme nervousness
among investors in a year of steep ups and downs _ when it's not
totally clear the downs are over.
</P>
<P>
   On reflection, they noted that conditions at Intel may not be as
bad as they seemed at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third quarter is always a tough seasonal quarter for tech
demand, due to the summer holiday season, which especially hits
Europe,'' said Graham-Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that Europe has been weak for most of the year,
and yet personal computer demand was still up 18 percent in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the weak euro is certainly a concern, the dramatic
sell-off has overcompensated for it, and we suggest a longer-term
view,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   September was already a disappointment for the market _ although
it has a tradition of weakness _ which many strategists are
beginning to view as a temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Acampora, senior market technician for Prudential
Securities, told clients on Friday the market's behavior suggests
it is getting close to a bottom, probably in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into the fourth quarter of 2000, we look for the
equity markets to establish a significant low, setting up a much
better buying opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, market analysts are still concerned about the
potential impact on Wall Street of rising oil prices, weak foreign
currencies and the barrage of bad news about earnings that are
coming out in advance of official financial releases next month.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said this week that the
recent surge in oil prices to a 10-year high could threaten the
U.S. economy _ which would also be a disaster for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The euro currency crisis is also cited by analysts as a reason
for investor concern, especially about the performance of
multi-national corporations such as Coca-Cola that gate a big share
of sales in Europe.

President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on the battlefield and
in the negotiating room, the Clinton administration is making one
last stand against him: in the voting booth. In a high-profile
strategy that began a year ago, the administration has helped
finance an opposition movement that is backing Vojislav Kostunica
in his campaign to unseat Milosevic from from the Yugoslav
presidency in Sunday's vote. The strategy largely reflects the
thinking of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has made
democracy a centerpiece of her tenure and has cast Milosevic as her

AS QUANDARY OVER JERUSALEM CONTINUES, MORE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS
EMERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It would have been unthinkable just several years
ago for Israel to contemplate entrusting anything to the United
Nations, much less control of the most holy site in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   But in the endgame of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort,
Israel is allowing a full buffet of formerly unthinkable ideas to
be spread on the negotiating table as food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Israel has been deliberating on an American
proposal that would grant the U.N. Security Council control over
the Temple Mount as a way to break the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock
over the sacred site. That deadlock emerged at the Camp David talks
in July as the major obstacle to a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
   According to Friday's edition of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
Israeli diplomats are working assiduously to promote the idea that
only international control of the 35-acre holy zone would resolve _
by rising above _ competing Israeli and Palestinians claims on the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials confirmed only that Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben Ami had discussed the idea with French and Egyptian leaders
this week. They noted, however, that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, had not shown any interest in the proposal: He is seeking
full Palestinian sovereignty over what is known in Arabic as Haram
al Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary, which is the third holiest site in
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Arafat is willing to consider this, or any other
alternative, we can't really consider any idea seriously
ourselves,'' said Gadi Baltiansky, a spokesman for Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   While meetings between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators did
occur here this week _ despite Israeli flip-flopping about whether
to proceed _ the talks appeared to be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Channel Two television news, however, reported Friday
night that efforts were under way to arrange a meeting between
Barak and Arafat for Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are looking for the United States to break the
stalemate by as early as next week, either by issuing a draft
treaty with bridging proposals or by convening another summit
meeting, or both.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Barak are trying to impart a sense of
urgency _ Clinton because his months in office are numbered and
Barak because he is likely to face a call for new elections when
the Israeli Parliament reconvenes at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians say they are not willing to be rushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the wish to reach an agreement before the American
elections, this need is not absolute,'' Nabil Shaath, the
Palestinian minister of planning and international cooperation,
said early this week in a speech in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations are going to continue with whoever is elected,
Gore or Bush,'' he said. ``Secondly, lame-duck presidents have
managed in the past to accomplish great things in the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. control of the Temple Mount is the latest in a series of
proposals for resolving the status of the site, which more than any
other issue, stands in the way of a peace accord that would
formally end the 52-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Old City was occupied by Israel in the aftermath of
the Six Day War in 1967, Israel has claimed sovereignty over the
entire massive stone structure, but permitted the Islamic
authorities to exercise control over the two ancient mosques and
great stone plaza on top. The Western Wall beneath, guarded by
Israeli soldiers, is the most sacred site of worship for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Gershom Gorenberg, an expert on the mount, said the site had
predictably ended up as the core of the conflict not only because
of its religious importance to both sides, but also because of its
``mythic value'' in their historical narratives.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   For secular Israelis, capturing the mount was a pinnacle of
Zionism, which made the Jewish homeland more solid by reclaiming
the sacred center of Judaism after two millennia. Religious Jews
saw it as the first step toward redemption. For the Palestinians,
in contrast, losing the mount became emblematic of all the other
losses; regaining it became a driving goal of their nationalist
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The myths, though, never squared with the reality on the ground.
The Israelis never really took over the mount, and the Palestinians
never really lost it. The Israelis claimed the Western Wall and an
adjacent Arab neighborhood that they razed to created the wall's
plaza. But they have allowed the Muslim authorities continued
control over Al Aksa mosque and the Dome of the Rock to this day,
backed up the country's chief rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   There has been what Gorenberg _ whose book, ``The End of Days:
Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount'' will be
published by The Free Press in December _ calls ``a de facto
division of holy space'' that has prevented a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   But the Camp David talks, which for the first time in seven
years of peace talks, dealt with the previously taboo subject of
contested Jerusalem, forced decades of ambiguity into the open. It
provoked some Israelis to admit aloud, as a Haaretz editorial did
last week, ``The Temple Mount is not really in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial called on Barak ``to enshrine'' the existing
arrangement in a permanent agreement, saying it is ``not in
Israel's interest to impose its sovereignty over a Muslim place of
worship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak and his associates insisted on such sovereignty, which
even many secular, moderate Israelis consider important.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, refused to enter into a long-term
lease arrangement for their holy space. They also questioned
Israeli historical claims that the site was home to the First and
Second Temple as well as Jewish traditional beliefs that Adam was
created there and that Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac there.
</P>
<P>
   No Arab leader, Arafat said, could give away the rock from which
Muhammad is said to have leapt to heaven. No Jewish leader, Barak
said, could give away the rock that more or less marks where the
temple once stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an agreement is reached, then in religious and national
terms, the two sides will have agreed to the idea of more than one
truth existing in Jerusalem _ that there's more than one way up
God's mountain,'' Gorenberg said. ``But that's a big if.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest proposal, the U.N. Security Council would
assume sovereignty, granting control over the Islamic sites to the
Palestinians while the Israelis kept the Western Wall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The apparent Israeli willingness to seek Security Council
guarantees for such an arrangement is seen here as a sign of how
Israel's relations with the United Nations has improved since it
withdrew from southern Lebanon and advertised a new willingness to
surrender much of East Jerusalem in a peace pact with the
Palestinians. For more than three decades, Israel has been the
target of regular condemnation by the United Nations for its
occupation of lands seized in Arab-Israeli wars.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Arafat had proposed assigning control of the site to
an Islamic committee, which the Israelis rejected. Academic experts
suggested recognizing divine sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   And the Americans proposed split-level sovereignty: The
Palestinians would control the upper level and the Israelis the
subterranean space, where the remains of the temple are believed to
be. That prompted the Palestinians to say this week that if they
would promise to prevent excavations under the site if they got
sovereignty.

 &HT;    Analysts try to make order out of sea of changing tides
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the Federal Reserve pushed the envelope in engineering a
soft economic landing with higher interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   That depends on whom you ask. Right now, the only thing
economists seem to agree on is that the Fed has managed to rein in
the economy somewhat amid a lot of chaos: rising energy prices, a
rotten euro and a reckless stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Fed goes from here, however, is anyone's guess.
Predictions among economists are all over the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``When economists start to disagree with what the Feds are going
to do, that suggests the Fed is pursuing the correct course,'' said
Jeffrey Humphreys, director of Economic Forecasting at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys, standing alone, believes Federal Reserve
policy-makers didn't go far enough in slowing the economy. He says
the country could use another rate hike or two, albeit small ones.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what other economists had to say about corporate profits,
the economic outlook and other concerns on investors' minds:
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits: Humphreys said they will remain flat, with
gains of about 2 to 3 percent at best _ for the next few years.
``Investors have been accustomed to gains of 10 to 12 percent,''
Humphreys said. ``So this will be a real shock.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G.
Edwards, corporate earning-- will still be up nicely: 15 percent
this year and 12 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Economic outlook: According to Roger Tutterow, co-director of
the Econometric Center at Kennesaw State University, the real
question mark has been oil prices, which jumped up higher than
people expected and stayed there. Those higher energy prices will
cut into consumers' buying power later this year. The other
problem, Tutterow said, is the euro. The weak currency already
threatens profits of U.S. companies doing business in Europe, such
as Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys believes the economy and job market will remain
strong. The gross domestic product's growth will be 5.2 percent
this year and 3.7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldman, GDP will grow about 3 to 3 1/4 percent
next year. And First Union economist Mark Vitner expects strong GDP
growth in the last half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market: Tutterow expects ``considerable volatility
over the next couple of months. If some of the concerns hanging
over the market now _ such as the euro and high energy prices _
ease, cash may move into the market, and we could get a bit of a
rally at year's end.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys said, ``I don't expect a collapse in the stock
valuations, but it's a possibility. It's been true for a while now.
But I'm not worried about the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next move: Humphreys said he expects the Fed to have
``one more small increase'' in interest rates after the
presidential election in November, and possibly another one in the
first few months of next year. He said they are needed to curb
consumer spending, which threatens to push inflation higher.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldman, Fed policy-makers are going to ``do
nothing and stay with a tightening bias just because they don't
want anybody to relax. The Fed's job is to keep people nervous.
Their next big step will be to lower rates in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tutterow, short-term interest rates ``will stay
where they are for the rest of the year. There's enough evidence to
suggest the economy's slowing. So those Fed members who oppose an
interest rate increase will have evidence in their favor.''

PITINO, WALKER ON SAME WAVELENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Pitino and Antoine Walker are cool. For the present, at
least. Walker went public a few weeks back saying he was upset
about being constantly involved in trade rumors and wondered why
Pitino was so intent on getting rid of him. When Pitino returned to
Boston this week, he and Walker had discussions on following days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antoine told me he was bothered by the trade rumors and I told
him this: Since I have been here, no team has ever talked to us
about trading for him, until Indiana recently. No team,'' Pitino
said. ``And I explained to him that the lack of interest in him
isn't because he isn't a good ballplayer. He is. The lack of
interest is because of the money he is making ($12 million per
year). This year, when Indiana discussed possibly making a trade,
the first thing I did was call him and tell him. I asked him if he
would rather play in Indiana or Boston. He said he would rather
play here. So I said OK, we're keeping you. His problem is that he
has two or three people whispering in his ear all the time and he
listens to them. And his agent (David Falk) is telling him stuff
(about possible trades) that just isn't true. So I told Antoine at
the end of our talks, just come in great shape and play as hard as
you can, and everthing will be fine. So I hope that takes care of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino says his team will be better, but not of championship
caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power is still out in the West. That's where the beat
teams are,'' he said. ``Miami will be the team to beat in the East.
After that, it's a scramble. If we play the way we are capable of
playing, we should get to the playoffs. Last year we played well at
home and played tough against the better teams. What killed us was
playing poorly against the weaker teams. If we win the games we
should win, our record will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino on the state of the NBA: ``We are seeing that (top-level)
free agents do not want to play in the North. Chicago had all of
that money to spend (under the salary cap) and no one wanted to go
there. What happened with the Celtics in the past (16
championships) and Bulls (Michael Jordan era) doesn't mean anything
to these guys. We had a verbal agreement with Ron Mercer to come
back here for $2.2 million a year, and when Chicago couldn't get
the guys they were going after in free agency, they gave him $5
million a year to get him out there. If a great player has a
choice, he'll go someplace where it is warm and fun to live. The
only (Northern) exception is New York. They'll go there because
it's New York. So the only way the rest of us are going to get a
big-time player is in the draft, and in the draft, you have to get
lucky with a lottery pick. That's a big part of why we made the
trade to get draft picks from Denver for Danny Fortson. Over the
next three years, that pick might get us into the lottery and into
position to get a great player.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Plugging the leak &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are pointing toward former head coach Pete Carroll
as the ``source'' behind the story that owner Bob Kraft has become
disenchanted with quarterback Drew Bledsoe and may trade him before
next season. Kraft reportedly is upset about the connection because
he gave Carroll a good settlement on the final two years of the
contract, with the proviso that Carroll does nothing to discredit
either the Kraft family or the Patriots organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, personally, likes Bledsoe as much as any player who has
ever played for him. He is not going to trade Bledsoe. Kraft has
been around long enough to realize that you have no chance in the
NFL to win without a quarterback who can throw the ball. Kraft
wants to sign Bledsoe to a new long-term contract (the present deal
is up after 2001), but one that is favorable to the team and
doesn't handcuff the Patriots from going after free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Steinberg, Bledsoe's agent, naturally wants to get as much
as possible for Bledsoe. Steinberg has fathered the domino effect
in the league. As the agent of the star quarterbacks, he leverages
the deal of one of his players against the next contract
negotiation with another one of his players with another team. The
delay in getting Bledsoe signed is that Kraft does not want to
become a part of the leverage game if it keeps him from building a
better team. As was written in this space a couple of weeks back,
if Kraft has to put the franchise label on Bledsoe to keep him for
the future, he will. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burns plays it safe &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered why Bruins coach Pat Burns didn't travel with the
team to its exhibition game in Montreal last Saturday night. There
was nothing sinister about it. Burns, and the Bruins, felt he might
be served a subpoena to appear at the Marty McSorley trial in
Vancouver next week, so he avoided that by staying south of the
border. The Bruins will send one of their attorneys to the trial to
represent the organization on McSorley's behalf . . . There was a
tremendous salute to Fran Toland at Harvard last week and rightly
so. Fran was the ``Mr. Chips'' of Harvard, so to speak, even though
he was the business manager/assistant vice president and not a
teacher. ``There are only a handful of people there, out of 40,000
(students, faculty, and workers) who can be identified by their
first name. Fran, he was one of them,'' said former Harvard athlete
Joe O'Donnell, who served as master of ceremonies for Toland's
retirement celebration, which drew more than 500 former Harvard
athletes/friends from across the country. ``We can't replace this
man,'' said athletic director Bill Cleary. ``I'm learning that now.
It would take more than 20 people to do what he did. Fran came here
in 1959 and leaves this year. Six decades. During that time we have
gone from a few (12) varsity programs to more than any other
Division 1 school in America. We have 41 now. Twenty-one for men
and 20 for women. Fran is the man largely responsible for that, and
for the other nonvarsity programs that thousands of our students
participate in.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   Feathering the nest &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A Boston businessman, who once came close to purchasing the
Celtics, is trying to put together a group to buy the team from the
present owners, the Gaston family. Larry Bird would come in as the
basketball leader of this group. Bird, speaking at the Foxwords
Resort Casino last week ($100,000 for two hours), told the heavy
rollers he was brought in to address that he would ``run from here
to Boston'' at the chance to take over the Celtics' basketball
fortune. Reportedly, the Gastons want $300 million for the team,
which is a lot of green, especially when the team is heading toward
a large dive at the gate this season. Rumor has it, the Celtics
have lost 20 percent of their season-ticket base, about 2,000 fans
per game. Multiply that by $50 a head, which is $100,000 per game,
which is $4.1 million over a 41-game home schedule. The Bruins are
on a pace to lose about 1,500 season ticket-holders. General
manager Harry Sinden got a message from old friend Mike Milbury
recently, which read, in gist, ``Seen what you are offering (Joe)
Thornton and (Sergei) Samsonov. It's too much.'' Thornton,
Samsonov, and Anson Carter are holding out because they don't think
they are being offered enough. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Professional relationship &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite what some would like you to believe, there are not major
problems between manager Jimy Williams and general manager Dan
Duquette. They are no buddies either, but the do coexist. Duquette
gets the players; Williams calls the shots. Duquette doesn't give
him any edicts on which players to put in the lineup. Williams
manages the team the way he wants to. Because the Red Sox did not
live up to promise as hoped, the buzz is that they will now dump
Williams. That's not going to happen unless Williams, who makes $1
million a year, and is one of the highest-paid managers in the
game, wants to call it quits . . . The game in Miami will tell a
lot about how the Patriots play the rest of the season. Through the
first three games, the Patriots' offense hasn't been able to run
three plays in succession with everyone in the lineup doing the
right thing. Much of the mistakes are mental. Linemen blocking the
wrong person. Backs not picking up blitzers. Receivers not running
the right routes. Bledsoe, on occasion, not getting the ball to the
right reciever, by his own admission. What will happen, if the same
mistakes occur again, is the coaching staff will most likely have a
dumbing-down of the offense. In other words, it will be simplified
in order to make it easier to run the plays properly. If this
happens, it is going to make it easier for the opposition to
defend, but the mistakes can't go on. The biggest problem in the
passing game is that the receivers aren't getting open fast enough.
What's amazing is that Bledsoe has been hit approximately 30 times
a game, perhaps more than any other player in the league, and
hasn't fumbled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Belichick on the Patriots' ``defensive'' problems:
``Our timing isn't there. The way defense works is that that the
rush on the passer has to be coordinated with the coverage on the
receivers. You can't have your defensive guys jump on the receivers
right away because the pass rush won't be there, and they won't be
able to stay close to the receivers for that long a time. It all
happens together. The defensive backs closing at about the same
time the rushers get after the passer. We haven't had that happen
for us enough. In each of the last two games we have played better
on defense, but it is not where it has to be for us to win
consistently.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   Holovak hits 81 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday to Mike Holovak, 81 years young this week. The
former BC football great and Patriots head coach/GM during the
vital growing stages of the team in the first decade, is living in
Florida and trying his hand of at golf. Speaking of BC and golf,
how would you like to do this? At the Boston College clubs' annual
golf tournament at Wollaston recently, Bob Pierce, an 18
handicapper, had holes-in-one on the sixth and 11th _ and didn't
get a car. No one bought the insurance. Instead he was given (get
this) a driver. Not the kind that has four wheels, which you
usually get for a hole-in-one at a charity tournament . . .
Duquette says he will have enough money available to spend on free
agents and to use in making trades in the offseason . . . The NFL
has a league meeting in Chicago next week that could pave the way
for an extension of the current collective bargaining agreement,
which runs through 2003. The owners want to get the agreement to
extend to 2005, to parallel the current television deals . . . John
Cornish, a key figure in the great success The Country Club in
Brookline had running the Ryder Cup a year ago, got a surprising
letter from Mark James, captain of the European team. Even though
James reportedly ripped the US team in his latest book, James thank
Cornish and the Country Club for putting on a great event. Which
they did.

``Aqui.'' And it has the 29-year-old Mexican singer-songwriter
touring the United States, including a few stops in California.
</P>
<P>
   Today she appears on KCRW's music program ``Morning Becomes
Eclectic'' during the 11 a.m. hour (89.9 FM). She headlines a show
at the El Rey Theatre on Tuesday. And come Nov. 1, Venegas will
open for Mexican rock giant Jaguares at the Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Los Angeles last time to do a show, I had to go
by myself because my musicians couldn't get visas,'' she says, her
English sounding like that of a teen-age girl hanging out on
Ventura Boulevard. ``So this time is really going to be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Venegas' new album, released Sept. 12, has
received only thumbs up from American music critics probably has
something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote The New York Times: ``Julieta Venegas' songs have the
clear melodies and emotional impact that could make listeners sing
along before they worry about the words.''
</P>
<P>
   And CMJ New Music Report wrote that the album ``is as
unfalteringly good and inventive as the title suggests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bueninvento'' was produced by Mexico's hottest alternative
rock producer, Gustavo Santaolalla (Molotov, Cafe Tacuba and Puya).
Also lending a hand on production duties were members of rock en
espanol icons Cafe Tacuba and Control Machete.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that backing musicians borrowed from Beck, Tom Waits and
Los Lobos, and the result is a smoldering mix of art rock, bossa
nova, go-go and electronic music that has Venegas being likened to
a Spanish mix of PJ Harvey, Fiona Apple and the Violent Femmes.
</P>
<P>
   Venegas was influenced by such artists growing up in the border
town of Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tijuana, you're not really completely Mexican,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Venegas remembers watching network television, reading books in
English and even tuning in to an alternative radio station based in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really listening to rock en espanol when I was in
Tijuana,'' Venegas says. ``I was listening more to Anglo music. My
brother got me into Madness and Depeche Mode and I liked listening
to Lou Reed, to Susan Vega, to Los Lobos.''
</P>
<P>
   She duplicated what she heard on the piano for almost every rock
band in her high school. Then Venegas joined hard-core ska band
Tijuana No and helped write its breakthrough hit ``Pobre de Ti.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very style oriented,'' Venegas says. ``It was like,
we're a reggae band and we're supposed to talk about important
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always tried to have so much control over what they were
writing about, and to me it was just the opposite,'' she says.
``What I like about music in general is when it starts to sound
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Venegas left Tijuana No in 1994 for Mexico City, where she got
work playing at small clubs with just her accordion and drum
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, she was signed to BMG.
</P>
<P>
   And now she's touring the States in support of her critically
acclaimed new album.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Venegas says. ``When my first record came out in
the U.S., nobody really cared, you know? The only people who knew
about it was whoever was in the rock en espanol circuit. So we'll
see how this time goes.'' ---JULIETA VENEGAS &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than seven years opposing President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on the battlefield and in the
negotiating room, the Clinton administration is making one last
stand against him _ among the voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a high-profile strategy that began a year ago, the
administration has helped finance an opposition movement that is
backing Vojislav Kostunica in his campaign to unseat Milosevic from
the Yugoslav presidency in voting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, as almost everyone expects, Milosevic simply declares
himself the victor, Washington is hoping that angry voters will
take to the streets in a way that eventually drives the leader from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy largely reflects the thinking of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who has cast Milosevic as her most bitter
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan has its risks.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Kostunica is a Serbian nationalist who would not
necessarily support NATO policies in Kosovo. Without an official
American presence in Serbia, it is difficult to gauge how much of
the $25 million spent on the opposition over the last year has been
fruitfully used. In fact, the blatant American campaign against
Milosevic has given him a powerful theme for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials who devised the strategy said they
believed that Milosevic, regardless of the vote tallies, would
manipulate the results and declare victory. In the best case, the
officials said, they hoped that opposition protests would
eventually lead Milosevic's all-important army and security forces
to turn against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Yugoslavia are standing up,'' said James C.
O'Brien, special adviser to Clinton and Albright on democracy in
the Balkans. ``There is the potential for seismic change in
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration, O'Brien suggested, hopes that the elections
would provide a ``crucial moment, like the Berlin Wall falling.''
But he said Washington would settle for a ``tide turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials acknowledged, however, that it was unclear how
motivated the opposition would be to protest, whether it could
rouse a weary population to rally in great numbers and whether the
security forces would turn against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage opposition activities in Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, the United States has spent $25 million in
the last year, according to Donald L. Pressley, the assistant
administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Nearly half of the money, $11 million, was spent on helping unions,
media organizations and civic associations, Pressley said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Washington-based groups, the National Democratic Institute
and the International Republican Institute, were allocated $4
million for helping groups in Serbia conduct door-to-door
campaigning and to develop other get-out-the-vote techniques,
Pressley said. Much of the remaining money went to Serbian cities,
such as Nis and Novi Sad, which are run by independent mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, following usual policy, refused to
confirm or deny the existence of covert operations within
Yugoslavia ahead of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons for the optimism within the
administration is that officials believe that their carefully
devised democracy-building effort has helped magnify interest in
the opposition candidate, Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely in more than seven years of dealing with Milosevic has
the Clinton administration sounded so upbeat; nor have officials
been so willing to advertise their policy. One official said this
week that he had to warn about too much ``euphoria'' inside the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has had little to do with Kostunica, a law
professor who has maintained a fierce independence from American
policy and who has said that if he came to power he would not send
Milosevic to the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has watched enthusiastically as more than a dozen
parties in Serbia's famously fractured opposition decided to back
Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   But the unanswered question in the administration's strategy is
what happens after the vote. In his 13 years in power, Milosevic
has repeatedly shown his ability to maneuver, manipulating allies
and rivals in order to maintain his grip.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials believe that, if Milosevic does
not lose by a wide margin and therefore does not resort to massive
fraud, there will be a less compelling case for protest.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions concern whether the police and soldiers are
prepared to use massive force against fellow Serbs. If they are,
then there is a question about how much the administration should
encourage protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this going to be like 1956?'' asked one senior
administration official, recalling the Western hints to the
Hungarians that help would be on the way if the Soviet Union
quashed the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several days, Bratislav Grubacic, a Serbian
journalist who is read widely among the Western diplomatic
community, has warned that Milosevic will attempt to stay in power
at any cost. ``The bigger danger for the Serbs is that the
authorities could apply repressive measures such as those in
Beijing's Tianamen Square,'' Grubacic wrote.

ECONOMIC SUMMIT IN PRAGUE SPURS DEMONSTRATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Authorities are telling locals to stock
up on food, lock their doors, and stay inside as much as possible.
Schools have temporarily closed, and many businesses have boarded
up their windows. The US State Department is advising American
citizens to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this is neither war, pestilence, nor a
nuclear meltdown. It is next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 20,000 demonstrators are expected to descend on the
Czech capital over the next several days to protest the poverty,
injustice, and ecological damage they blame on global capitalism,
perpetuated by the IMF and World Bank. And suddenly, this graceful
city, known for its winding cobblestone streets, gothic
architecture, and laid-back cafe culture, resembles a city under
siege.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a repeat of the violence that erupted at the World Trade
Organization's meetings in Seattle last year, when demonstrators
clashed with poorly-prepared police, Czech authorities have beefed
up security massively. Some 11,000 police officers are patrolling
the streets, checking IDs of anybody they deem suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   But Prague is also going to unusual lengths to accommodate the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   President Vaclav Havel, a playwright and former anti-communist
dissident, has called for ``a civilized dialogue on globalization''
during the meetings. He invited activists to meet with him in the
historic Prague Castle Saturday to air their grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal authorities allowed a local tent manufacturer to turn
Prague's giant Strahov Stadium into a campground for the
demonstrators. Dubbed ``Camp Strahov,'' the stadium has
accommodations for 15,000 people, 280 portable toilets, food
vendors, a medical tent, legal advisors and an Internet cafe. But
as of Friday, just over 100 people had checked into the camp, which
charges $37 for a nine-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who have been trickling in from far and near,
say they want the IMF and the World Bank, the world's premier
lending institutions, abolished. An Internet site called
destroyimf.org has called on activists to ``turn Prague into
Seattle'' and ``shut down the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   But protest leaders say most are committed to non-violence and
do not want a repeat of the chaos that engulfed Seattle, when
demonstrators tried to shut down the WTO meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything we can to discourage violence. We want
to do this Prague-style, not Seattle-style,'' said Chelsea Mozen,
spokeswoman for the Initiative Against Economic Globalization, an
umbrella-group uniting many of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Mozen said her group wants to follow the examples of the 1968
Prague Spring democratic movement, which began peacefully before it
was crushed by Soviet tanks, and the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which
brought down communism here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has a history of peaceful protest,'' said Mozen, a
native of Atlanta, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that her group cannot control all of the
protesters _ a diverse collection of human rights activists,
environmentalists, anarchists, communists, and right-wing
skinheads. And Czech authorities aren't taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic has been backed up at border crossings all week as
officials carefully screened out potential troublemakers. Hundreds
have been turned away.
</P>
<P>
   So far, demonstrations have been small. On Thursday, there were
only a few dozen at an anti-automobile rally on Prague's Old Town
Square. They demanded that IMF and World Bank delegates use public
transportation during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of right-wing skinheads and anarchists are planning
separate demonstrations Saturday, but the largest protests are
expected Tuesday when the meetings begin. Organizers say they plan
to try to block the exits from the Prague Congress Center to
prevent delegates from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and World Bank, meanwhile, are taking steps to counter
their reputations as old-boy clubs of global financiers. The World
Bank's meeting schedule reads like an activist's workshop, with
seminars titled ``Poverty and Inequality'' and ``The Environment
Matters.''
</P>
<P>
   And local bankers are taking their own precautions. Several
advised employes not to wear suits to work during the meetings,
lest they be mistaken for IMF delegates by the protesters.

   AUSTIN _ Al Gore can really be an entertaining guy, and I'm not
talking about ``The Kiss'' or the alleged personality remake he
underwent about the time he started bouncing upward in the
presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about the soft-shoe routine he has been performing
with his buddies in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   First, he schmoozes with as many Hollywood stars and production
moguls as he can round up, his hand firmly extended, raking in tons
of campaign dough for himself and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as the Federal Trade Commission prepares to release a
report that is highly critical of the film, recording and video
industries for marketing violent, adult-rated material to children,
Gore publicly chastises his benefactors _ to the point of
threatening government sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But, lest his friends quit writing their checks, the vice
president only a few days later dances across the stage again,
assuring industry contributors with a wink and a nod _ and another
outstretched hand _ that they have nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose most famous performance occurred at a Buddhist
temple, already had qualified for the title role in a remake of
``The Great Impostor'' by claiming earlier this year that
campaign-finance reform was a priority of his presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe two or three Americans _ tops _ actually believed him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a chameleon.
</P>
<P>
   And his mixed signals highlight the lack of public trust endemic
to our money-driven campaign system. The concerns that Gore
expressed about the entertainment industry may have been sincere,
but how in the world can anyone be expected to take his words at
face value?
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Democrats, of course, have no monopoly on
aggressive fund-raising. George W. Bush and the Republicans also
have raised millions of dollars from individuals and special
interests all over the country, including from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have snagged the largest share of entertainment
industry-related contributions. And Bush, unlike Gore, has never
threatened the industry with governmental sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, instead, has called for parents to exercise more control
over the movies and TV shows their children watch and the video
games they play. He has promised to use persuasion, rather than a
governmental hammer, to convince entertainment executives to be
more responsible in his ``responsibility era.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report on violent movies was the result of a study that
President Clinton requested last year after a series of school
shootings, including the massacre by two teen-agers at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC concluded that, despite voluntary labeling and rating
systems, the entertainment industry advertises adult-rated movies,
recordings and video games in publications and TV broadcasts
appealing to youth.
</P>
<P>
   The agency didn't advocate new laws or tougher regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But the day before the report was released, Gore, in an
interview with The New York Times, said that if he were elected
president he would propose new laws or regulatory authority if
industry officials didn't ``clean up their act'' within six months.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, if necessary, he would encourage the FTC to use
its power to prohibit false and deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Gore had suggested governmental
restrictions on media marketing, although his running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, a longtime critic of children's access to media
violence, had warned last year that entertainment executives would
``invite legal restrictions on their freedom'' if they didn't
voluntarily address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would seek to ensure that governmental restrictions
didn't violate First Amendment protections of free speech, although
that may be difficult to do.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few days later, Gore and Lieberman had softened their
rhetoric as they attended a $5 million Democratic fund-raiser in
New York, which included numerous entertainers. And just last week,
they soft-pedaled their concerns at a $4.2 million fund-raiser in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by the way, distanced himself from the FTC entertainment
study when it was initiated last year. According to The Los Angeles
Times, Gore made it clear to potential donors at a private meeting
in Los Angeles in the summer of 1999 that the study was Clinton's
idea, not his, and was started without his input.

THE SECOND-HOME BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing you can say about us baby boomers is that there sure
are a lot of us. Some people say that's the only thing that makes
us special, but I suspect that they are just sick of hearing about
us. Still, when we lock onto a trend, we make it ours, whether it
was having the children who are now packing our schools to bursting
or, eventually, when we begin dying in droves. In life or death, we
make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   If you have tried, as I have, to buy a second home, you know
what I mean. It is another of life's pleasures that boomers have
discovered, taken over and bid up to the stratosphere. The National
Association of Realtors says that about 377,000 such homes were
bought last year, up 31 percent from 1989. Prices have jumped 29
percent over the same period, with the median for a second home
climbing from $99,200 to $127,800, though the increase may vary by
region.
</P>
<P>
   No one should have to ask who is driving this. Goaded by the
continuing promise of the expanding economy, boomers are buying the
majority of second homes _ 63 percent of the total last year,
according to the real estate group. And the median age of buyers
was 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that purchases are at three or four times the rate
of the previous generation,'' said Gary W. Eldred, the author of
``The Complete Guide to Second Homes for Vacation, Retirement, and
Investment'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1999). ``There are many people
with small children who are far wealthier than other generations
were at a comparable age. These kinds of salaries were unheard-of
in previous generations. This second-home phenomenon didn't exist
then, because people didn't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   All this buying has soaked up the supply and raised the prices
of second homes in many areas. When I tried to jump on the trend
last year and began looking for a weekend place in northwestern
Connecticut, I was surprised to find prices almost as high as that
of my primary residence. After weeks of looking, my wife and I gave
up, realizing that we could not afford much more than a cabin in
the woods. There went my dream of becoming a gentleman farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go back to the '60s to get this kind of robust
economic expansion and low mortgage rates,'' said David Lereah,
chief economist for the Realtors group. ``Take the strong economy
and the fact that there are 75 million boomers entering their peak
earning years _ that is giving rise to the increased demand for
second homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than new wealth is driving boomers into second homes,
Eldred said. Previous generations tended to buy second homes as
they neared retirement or when the children were grown, he said.
Boomers, too, are looking to retirement, but they are planning for
it earlier, buying second homes in their 40s in anticipation of
retiring, say, at 55. They are also buying them to give their young
children a place to play and to gain a sanctuary from a stressful
world.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Whitby, 50, who works for Salomon Smith Barney, said that
she and her husband, Paul, 53, a lawyer, bought their second home
at Woodridge Lake in Goshen, Conn., to be able to get away from
city life for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both agreed that we wanted a place to go where we could
completely relax,'' she said. ``We needed a break. We needed a
change of scenery because of what we do five days a week. As much
as we love Manhattan, we need to spend time away from it on the
weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine LaRoche, also from Manhattan, isn't waiting for 55. Now
in her late 40s, she recently retired as a managing director at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and bought a summer home in Connecticut
to get away from the city. ``Quite frankly, with three children,
the ability for them to be outside, have a circle of friends and be
able to walk out the door without any issues is part of the family
cycle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then here is the eternal pursuit of status, a stereotypical
boomer trait. ``In my own conversations, people always want to drop
where they have their second home _ `I have a home in Siesta Key or
Longboat Key''' in Florida, Eldred said. ``They just love to drop
the name _ `Our home on the Vineyard' or in Aspen. They're all the
cachet, name-brand locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, maybe families had an Airstream parked by
the lake somewhere,'' he said. ``That was their vacation home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a retro trend. I'm sure Airstream prices have
skyrocketed already.

UN SOVEREIGNTY OVER JERUSALEM'S HOLY SITES DISCUSSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A proposal to break the deadlock over Jerusalem's
Jewish and Muslim holy sites by putting them under United Nations'
sovereignty is being discussed anew by the United States, France,
Egypt, and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, according to press
reports and a Western diplomat close to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for a 35-acre plot of land in Jerusalem's Old
City _ refered to by Jews as ``he Temple Mount'' and Muslims as the
``Noble Sanctuary'' _ to be placed under the legal authority of the
UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomatic source said Israel is considered likely to accept
the proposal as a way around the current stalemate in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and has been working back channels
to push it forward.
</P>
<P>
   However, senior Palestinian spokesmen warned they intend to
reject the proposal out of hand and will continue to insist on full
control over Haram al Sharif and all of East Jerusalem, the Los
Angeles Times reported. In a Cabinet meeting Friday night, the
Palestinian leadership said there is no room for compromise on
Muslim and Christian holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington a US diplomat expressed skepticism that the
proposal would fare any better than past schemes along the same
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear either the Israelis or the Palestinians want to
go anything near that idea,'' said the diplomat. ``People here are
still trying to decide the best ways to proceed on this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Clinton met with his senior advisers to
talk about the possibilities of a last-ditch effort toward a
Israeli-Palestinian deal. The White House meeting included National
Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright and Mideast mediator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is reported to back the idea of
UN sovereignty, according to the Los Angeles newspaper, and may
eventually have the task of persuading Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, carried a front page
article spelling out some details of talks it said were ongoing
between Israel and France to give the proposal shape.
</P>
<P>
   The article quoted unnamed sources saying that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak had asked French President Jacques Chirac to
participate in the effort because France is the current president
of the European Union as well as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel now believes bringing the Temple Mount under the aegis
of the international community could be the best way to safeguard
the rights and interests of both faiths, while retaining the status
quo on the ground,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, told Israeli
radio he had discussed the proposal with the Americans, with
Egyptian envoys and with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton renewed the idea of international sovereignty
over the Old City during the talks at Camp David this July. The
concept of international sovereignty was first raised by the United
Nations in 1947 as part of the partition of Palestine, which at the
time the Arab world rejected and the leaders of what would become
the Jewish state accepted.

 &HT;    WHAT ISN'T SO OBVIOUS ABOUT VOTER TURNOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Obviously, the key to any election is voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, it's so obvious, even old ragtag political
writers almost always are embarrassed to write it. But, if one is
in mind to coin a cliche this political year, the absolute
importance of turnout is a super good one to spend for political
consumption about now.
</P>
<P>
   If any doubt the special importance of turnout efforts for the
Nov. 7 general election, they have only to read the letters to the
editor running in a slew of newspapers, magazines and political
publications of most any sort, published most anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Far and away, the passions expressed publicly _ or, trust me, in
e-mail to political writers _ is more anti than it is pro, no
matter which presidential contenders wind up the correspondents'
ultimate choices.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a fair number of Texans who are just flat
for their Republican governor, George W. Bush. They genuinely like
GWB enough to be counted on to make the effort to turn out to vote
(BEG ITAL)for(END ITAL) him. Indeed, there likely are some pro-Bush
voters in every state in the union. For one thing, he has relatives
in just about every one.
</P>
<P>
   And, surely, there are similar bands of voters around the land
who are (BEG ITAL)for (END ITAL) Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee. If we use only one writer's e-mail as the
sample, none are in Gore's home state of Tennessee _ though, of
course, Gore must follow Bush in having gung-ho, die-hard backers
in every state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, here we are, down to about six weeks out from the Nov. 7
presidential election, and the electorate gives little clue of
being wildly turned on by either of these candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Though some professional political operatives and pundits like
to talk about Bush and/or Gore political coattails and whether they
exist or could by the time of the election, most observers are more
likely to suggest the two major-party candidates are going to wind
up wearing short jackets when Americans go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is a year when the presidential contenders are more
likely to get a shove from hotly contested races down the ballot
than they are to pull any down-balloters in with them.
</P>
<P>
   The extra importance of voter turnout efforts this year expands
the presidential political vista for the drawing of new political
scenarios, an opportunity too good for at least one old ragtagger
to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   In one view, Bush would seem to have the greater advantage. The
Associated Press has reported the Republican National Committee
entered September with $63 million in the bank, ``establishing a
huge financial advantage over the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dems declined to say how much less their party has in hand
until they release their fund-raising figures on Oct. 15. But, the
party reportedly has taken in $26 million in the four weeks since
its national convention, with $11.6 mil coming from just two
big-ticket concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, no one questions the RNC has more money than the
Dems. And, while the GOPers expect to spend a great slug of that
money on advertising for Bush, they also are hoping to spend as
much as $50 mil on get-out-the-vote efforts for the entire
Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   That the Democrats have less money in hand than the GOP cannot
be taken at face value, however, in terms of traditional politics.
And, absolutely, the Dems intend to be as traditional as all
get-out this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gore has succeeded in getting the endorsement of all
the big labor unions, and it is on them he is relying for his major
get-out-the-vote push. Also, the NAACP National Voter Fund has
announced it is spending $9 million on issue ads and local efforts
to increase black voter turnout in 12 target states.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
is considered strongly Democratic and can be expected to devote its
efforts to the elections of Dems, obviously including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the labor unions go, certainly they are skilled in
such political efforts as voter turnout. Indeed, the Democratic
Party long has depended on the unions to do the bulk of its turnout
work.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of a devil's advocate here, it is easy to
point out that great numbers of union members have appeared less
than passionate _ that word again _ in their support for Gore. A
scenario of the union leaders having to exert most of labor's
efforts to turning out union members to vote for Gore is easily
drawn on the presidential political vista.
</P>
<P>
   Proof, perhaps, that while, on the whole, some things about
politics are painfully obvious, all aspects of the obvious often
aren't obvious at all. &QL;

YEHUDA AMICHAI, 76; ISRAEL POET LAUREATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yehuda Amichai, Israel's poet laureate, a Polish
refugee who put words into the soul of Jerusalem, died Friday of
cancer. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   His passion as a writer _ mostly of poems but also of novels and
short stories _ had been for all the holy city's residents, Arab,
Christian and Jew.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his last interviews, below the flowering trees in his
yard on an August afternoon, he told The Boston Globe that he
dwelled in ``the small corners,'' as he puts it, of Jerusalem, the
human moments, the contact _ and the lack of it _ between people.
</P>
<P>
   During a particularly tense period in the seemingly unending
peace process, he was asked how his city's residents will fare
after negotiations end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopeful means nothing. Hopeful is too big a word. I have cut
it down to little hopes. One peaceful day with a breeze,'' he said.
``I don't look high, I look down. On a dish in a restaurant. Buying
vegetables from a woman in the Old City. At this bougainvillea
plant. My hopes are not like big stones, but little stones ground
up and made of cement that will support a whole house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked every little corner of Jerusalem,'' he said. ``I
walked every little corner of hope. And somewhere in there, that's
where peace will come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Amichai was born in Wurzburg, Germany, in 1924, and his family
immigrated to what was then Palestine in 1936, when it was under
the rule of the British Mandate of the League of Nations after
World War I. The family landed at the port of Haifa, and Amichai's
life has been woven into the history of this land ever since. He
has been part of Israel's struggle to exist, then to survive, and
now, as he put it, to overcome the past and ``just live'' in the
``complicated mess'' that is Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He fought with the Jewish Brigade of the British Army in World
War II, and after discharge in 1946 he joined the Palmach, an elite
fighting unit of the emerging Jewish state. He fought in Israel's
1948 War of Independence on the southern front, in the Negev
region.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, he attended Hebrew University and studied
biblical texts and Hebrew literature. He held a series of teaching
positions, and through it all he sat down every day at an old
wooden desk, one he still has in his office, and wrote poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and in Other Days,'' his first volume of poetry, was
published in 1955 to very good reviews, and he has been a prominent
figure on Israel's literary landscape ever since. He was published
in 37 languages, including Arabic and Chinese, and was awarded the
prestigious Israel Prize. His most recent collection of poems,
``Open Closed Open,'' was recently published in English.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai expressed ``the bitter consequences of wars and the
heavy price of bereavement,'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai was perhaps the only poet among a people famous for
renouncing sentimentality who could get away it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a love of Jerusalem that I accept more than from other
poets. . . . He loved it as the city where he lived,'' Meir Shalev,
a satirist and novelist, told Israel radio. ``I can't imagine my
life without his poetry,'' he said, breaking into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai is survived by his wife, Hana Sokolov-Amichai, their son
and daughter, and a son from his first marriage. He will be buried
Sunday after lying in state at Jerusalem's town hall.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You had to look twice, so transformed were her
features, but yes, that was Maggie Rizer gliding down the runway at
Oscar de la Renta's spring 2001 fashion show on Tuesday. Her eyes,
just visible between layers of bright paint, seemed to be spearing
onlookers with their gimlet stare.
</P>
<P>
   Rizer's glazed perfection, like that of every other model in de
la Renta's show, began at the top, with hair teased and swept off
her forehead in a modified pompadour. It extended to those eyes,
heavily outlined in shrill blue; the lips, patent-leather slick;
and the skin, polished to a marmoreal sheen.
</P>
<P>
   The look _ glossy, remote and rigidly controlled _ conjured up
the patinated beauties and social icons of the 1960s and early
'70s. The lacquered style of Judy Peabody, Isabel Eberstadt and
Charlotte Ford Niarchos lives on with a vengeance today in the
artfully contrived maquillage of Nina Griscom and Princess
Marie-Chantal of Greece. It is just as vivid in the current Versace
ad campaign, in which a pale blond plutocrat sits forlornly in the
vestibule of a spacious Palm Beach villa. It resides in the
well-maintained features of Catherine Deneuve, whose ``Belle de
Jour'' character has gone ever so gently to seed in her recent
movie ``Place Vendome.''
</P>
<P>
   Part Stepford wife, part drag queen, part icy society diva, this
mannered ideal of beauty suggested in its original heyday a glamour
as polished as it was impenetrable. It still does. ``It represents
the other end of the semantic of grunge,'' said Paul Wilmot, a
fashion publicist, who has seen both extremes come and go in
countless incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   The lacquered look is by no means dominant on the catwalks this
season, where lanky ``pool hair'' and subtle paint prevail. But it
is easily the most provocative beauty statement, suggesting both
compulsion and restraint. ``It represents a kind of sublimated
erotic,'' said Harold Koda, curator of the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum. ``Beyond the icy surface is something that has
to do with sexual availability _ like Hitchcock's blondes, blue
diamonds with a fiery heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous this fall in fashion ads and editorials, this sultry
but disciplined style is also the beauty world's expression of a
new formality, evinced of late in peplum suits and structured bags,
and in the penchant of Manhattan's bright young things for
elaborate dining out.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmot associates the look with soignee evenings spent at fabled
Manhattan restaurants like La Cote Basque and La Caravelle, which
are enjoying a revival. He also maintains that it denotes an
expressly urban beauty, one likely to be embraced by women ``who
work and want to look vital and successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is doubtful that the downtown set will strain to
emulate a stylized beauty their mothers disowned, the style does
work as hip metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much about a kind of regal composure, about lunch
more than dinner, about a certain kind of glacial hospitality,''
said Wayne Koestenbaum, who exhumed and laboriously examined the
puffed-out hair and haut bourgeois accouterments of Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis in ``Jackie Under My Skin'' (1995). ``I do feel
this style represents the return of the repressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Glazed hair and a face to match can also be viewed as an
aesthetic corrective, a gauntlet in the face of slatternly,
overheated starlet glamour trumpeted as chic in the pages of In
Style, Us Weekly and other red-carpet magazines. By contrast, the
look of de la Renta's show ``is a cold beauty,'' said Tom Pecheux,
the makeup artist who created it. More important, he noted, its
precise and polished quality changes the manner of the woman who
wears it. ``She drinks and she eats differently,'' Pecheux said.
Suddenly she has a certain rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it is so studied and confining, the look was
first taken up as an antidote to the prevailing laid-back chic by a
group of photographers and performance artists who have influenced
fashion. Photographers like Philip-Lorca diCorcia and Tina Barney
have examined the style with a mix of revulsion and lurid
fascination.
</P>
<P>
   The two modes also alternate in a current performance by
Lypsinka at the Westbeth Theater Center in Greenwich Village.
Lypsinka, the cabaret artist, revels in impersonating chanteuses
and old-Hollywood divas, wearing a boned bustier and architected
hair. At times she seems desperate to shake off the stiff trappings
that define _ and confine _ the characters.
</P>
<P>
   Malerie Marder, an art photographer whose subjects are
hypergroomed upper-middle-class women, also seems both captor and
captive of her muse. Her photographs, currently at Lawrence Rubin,
Greenberg Van Doren Fine Art, often portray women who appear
isolated amid haut bourgeois surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Such alienated types, with their not-of-this-world glassiness,
exert a powerful pull on some of fashion's youngest devotees.
``These images are dramatic, but they are also frightening,'' Koda
said. ``If they projected a wholesome beauty, a younger generation
would find them banal. It's their slightly noirish character which
gives them edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These subjects are not dolls. They are mannequins, and that
implies a certain toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, their enameled chic makes them alluring to the newly
rich. The hard and glossy look will find its way to a wide popular
audience next week in the person of Yasmine Bleeth in the latest
Aaron Spelling series, ``Titans,'' which makes its debut on NBC on
Oct. 4. As an Internet entrepreneur who has married above her
station, Bleeth vamps it up in crystal-studded Versace, her frosty
makeup and backswept hair a cartoonish variation on the familiar
genre.
</P>
<P>
   For countless viewers who identify with her upward-striving
character, Bleeth will doubtless be an avatar of a kind of
Champagne and black-pearl stylishness.
</P>
<P>
   More worldly women, however, might be tempted to identify with
one of Marder's images: a slightly weathered type who stands,
immaculately made up, in one corner of her bedroom, while in
another, a young man is glimpsed showering off. The woman is
pensive, perhaps because her lover is about to leave.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, though, she is impatient to slip more fully inside
her fastidious shell. ``She can't wait,'' suggested Koda, who has
seen the image, ``for her friend to dry off and get going.''

<P>
   It's the start of the 21st century and Classic Rock radio is 15
years old, but that doesn't mean well-crafted guitar rock is
gathering dust.
</P>
<P>
   One example of a band that still makes good songs a priority is
Collective Soul, a Georgia quintet that's scored eight No. 1 rock
hits in less than 10 years by bridging alternative and mainstream
rock.
</P>
<P>
   The group's catchy, riff-driven new single, ``Why Pt. 2,''
topped rock and alternative radio's most-added lists last week,
following earlier smashes such as ``Shine,'' ``December'' and
``Heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a band that initially drew no interest whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought there was no way I could get anyone at a
label to even listen to my band,'' recalled Collective Soul
singer-songwriter Ed Roland. ``I figured I'd only get a shot if I
put together a songwriting demo.''
</P>
<P>
   A demo version of the then-fashionably grungy 1994 hit,
``Shine,'' in fact, caught the attention of radio first, leading to
a deal with Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Collective Soul's fifth album, ``Blender'' (in stores Oct. 10),
the follow-up to 1998's million-selling ``Dosage,'' carries on the
band's tradition of potent midtempo rockers powered by heavy
riffage from the group's two guitarists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved good, solid guitar rock,'' Roland said. ``I
think the people I grew up on, the so-called classic rock of the
'60s and '70s, is still the best. Music has gotten so
trend-conscious today. It's like the look of the video and the
band's haircuts are way more important than the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Collective Soul which also includes Dean Roland (guitar), Ross
Childress (guitar), Will Turpin (bass, vocals) and Shane Evans
(drums) opens for Creed tonight at the Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   During the making of ``Blender,'' Roland was surprised when
Atlanta-based superstar Elton John, one of Roland's lifelong
heroes, was so taken with the band he ended up singing a duet with
Roland on the soulful ``Perfect Day,'' a track on the forthcoming
album.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' Roland said. ``He really liked the song. It
was incredible to sing with him. I mean, I've been such a major fan
all my life. He just listened to the song once and ran through it.
That was the first and final take. We spent the rest of the time
talking about new music we both like. Elton's a real music fan. He
buys everything and he's turned me on to some pretty cool new stuff
from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so easy for Roland to keep up with the scene.
Raised in a strict religious household, he was forbidden by his
parents to listen to rock.
</P>
<P>
   He originally founded Collective Soul in the mid-'80s after
dropping out of Boston's Berklee School of Music. The band was
roundly ignored and Roland called it quits in '92 to record his
demo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was I going to do?'' he said. ``I couldn't pay the guys
to rehearse. There weren't any gigs. I was on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Shine'' caught on, Roland quickly put together another
version of the group just as the song became an inescapable hit on
MTV and radio during '94, helping Collective Soul's debut album,
``Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid,'' sell more than a
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Roland's knack for arena-ready, hard-rocking anthems
and the vast airplay they receive, Collective Soul has developed a
large, loyal fan base. In fact, the new album's title, ``Blender,''
was chosen out of more than 12,000 suggestions from fans
participating in a contest sponsored by an Atlanta radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up with some pretty goofy names,'' Roland said.
``But some were really good. We were seriously considering 'Nickel'
or 'All of the Above.' Finally, we thought 'Blender' was a
winner.''

   DETROIT _ The fallout from the Firestone tire recall is rattling
many of the biggest automotive parts suppliers, who are already
dealing with weaker sales, cost-cutting demands and other
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The sector was beset by earnings warnings last week from several
major players, all of which count Ford Motor, which had many of the
recalled tires on its sport utility vehicles, as a major customer.
Dana, TRW, Visteon, Tower Automotive, Eaton, Lear, ArvinMeritor and
Dura Automotive all said third-quarter profits would be reduced
from earlier estimates, partly because Ford halted production for
three weeks in August and September at three truck plants.
</P>
<P>
   Ford took the action to divert tires that would have been
installed on SUV's and pickup trucks built at the plants to dealers
for use as replacements for some of the 6.5 million tires Firestone
recalled on Aug. 9 for possible defective tread.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker collected 100,000 tires by shutting plants in
Edison, N.J., Hazelwood, Ky., and St. Paul. Operations at the
factories resumed last Monday. Ford expects to make up production
of the 23,500 Ford Ranger pickups lost to the shutdown but will not
recover production of 15,000 Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   The production cuts, although hardly severe in themselves, were
enough to hurt many parts suppliers, forcing them to trim their
output in turn.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is always costly for parts makers and auto companies
because they make big investments in changeovers for the new model
year, which begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, there have been other complications. Companies
with European operations, like Dana and TRW, have been hurt by the
weak euro and currency fluctuations. Companies that supply
manufacturers of heavy-duty trucks, like ArvinMeritor and
Borg-Warner, have seen a drop in business as the market softened.
Federal Mogul, which makes engine parts, has felt the heat in both
areas. Last week, it announced that its chief executive, Richard
Snell, had resigned and that third-quarter earnings would fall
below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And all the companies are facing pressure from the major
automakers to keep a lid on prices. General Motors and
DaimlerChrysler, in particular, have started extensive cost-cutting
drives in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's move only heightened suppliers' misery, said Joseph
Phillippi, an analyst at PaineWebber. ``It's a horrific confluence
of economic events,'' he said. Gary Corrigan, a Dana spokesman,
added: ``Generally bad news comes in threes. This time it didn't
come in three, it came in four.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the Ford situation will probably have only minor
effects on suppliers' stock prices. But it highlights how dependent
those companies still are on their key customers.
</P>
<P>
   Phillippi said the Ford cutback magnified the pitfalls of the
industry's shift in the 1990s to just-in-time delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 20th century, parts makers generally kept plants
humming year-round, filling orders from the automakers that were
placed before the start of each model year. Deliveries were made
daily or weekly. Any parts not needed immediately were kept in auto
company warehouses or at the parts makers' own depots.
</P>
<P>
   But following the lead of Japanese rivals, American automakers
changed their factories over the last 10 years to align production
more closely with sales. They now depend on frequent supplies of
parts _ like seats, steering wheels and engines _ which often
arrive at factories only hours before they are to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have saved billions of dollars over the years by not
having excess inventory. But if production stops at an auto plant,
parts shipments stop, too, and parts production ceases almost
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The brief Ford shutdown forced Dana to curtail production at
plants in Fort Wayne, Ind., Cape Girardeau, Mo., and Pottstown,
Pa., resulting in the layoff of 2,000 workers. Dana does not keep
its parts plants running for more than a week after a closing at an
auto factory it supplies, Corrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are watching the Firestone recall to see if Ford plans
more closures, which could then affect fourth-quarter earnings. But
Darren Kimball, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said he was not
expecting the company to take further action, now that tire
companies like Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Michelin have stepped
up production of replacements for Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are speculating as to where the next piece of bad news
will come from,'' Kimball said. But he said he thought most of the
announcements had already been made.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some company executives privately attribute the flood of
warnings last week to the idea of safety in numbers. They theorize
that investors are less likely to punish any one company for
acknowledging that its results will fall short if many companies in
the sector are affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the storm clouds pass, you'll see some companies trading
at extremely cheap valuations,'' Kimball said. His top pick is
Delphi Automotive Systems, which was part of GM until its spinoff
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of Delphi's business came from GM this year,
versus 76 percent in 1999, according to Steve Gaut, a Delphi
spokesman. He said Delphi was pushing to diversify beyond GM and
the auto industry in general. It now sells cellular phone
components to Ericsson of Sweden, speedometers to Harley-Davidson
and wiring harnesses to Boeing. Delphi has said it expects to meet
analysts' third-quarter projections.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Blaschke, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, said
he sees strong growth potential for Johnson Controls, a maker of
seats and auto interiors, which said last week that its fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings, to be reported in October, would exceed
analysts' estimates by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Controls' business is divided almost evenly among Ford,
GM and DaimlerChrysler. Phillippi of PaineWebber sees that as a
strong selling point for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   With the Ford situation seemingly past, Phillippi said he
expected to see many parts makers bounce back later this year.
``This is very much of a short-term issue,'' he said. ``Generally,
we think we're through the worst of that.''

   NEW YORK _ Eddie Irvine, winner of four Formula One Grand Prix
races, left no doubt at Saks Fifth Avenue's breast cancer benefit
on Tuesday night that he is one of the fastest men on earth. In
less than 20 minutes, he hit on Christy Turlington and Miss
Universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Miss World?'' asked Irvine, who is Irish and not shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm Miss Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I was a judge at the last Miss World,'' he said. ``I'm
Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine, 34, was without a doubt the biggest celebrity at the
Saks party whom nobody knew. The 17 Formula One Grand Prix races
this year will be watched by a cumulative audience of five billion
people. But here in this fishbowl of New York media and society he
went virtually unrecognized. Turlington knew who he was:
supermodels and Formula One drivers belong to the same global VIP
club. They had met once, in Dublin eight years ago. Irvine elicited
a promise from her to watch him race his Jaguar in the first Grand
Prix in the United States since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The race is Sunday. A sinuous Formula One track has been cut
into the big oval of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where a
sold-out crowd of more than 200,000 will fill the stands. Cable's
Speedvision and the Fox Sports Network will cover the event live at
2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   How many viewers will tune in is another question. Will a
country that let Grand Prix racing fizzle out nine years ago and
that has no American-born Formula One drivers care?
</P>
<P>
   Irvine's appearance at Saks during Fashion Week and on ``The
Late Show With David Letterman'' the previous week are part of a
promotional push by Jaguar, Formula One and some of its major
sponsors into the only market that has eluded them: the United
States. Auto racing has never been bigger in the United States, but
NASCAR and Indy-style ovals have eclipsed road racing.
</P>
<P>
   Strange. Formula One may be the most glamorous, extreme and
richest sport around, and yet it is literally foreign to a nation
that prizes all those things. These are the most technologically
sophisticated race cars. Their screaming roar is the unforgettable
sound of engines running at 19,000 revolutions per minute, that go
from 0 to 125 miles an hour in less than seven seconds and
decelerate so fast the carbon brakes glow red. In 200-mile-an-hour
turns, drivers sustain a G-force almost as great as a fighter
pilot's. A Village Voice article on the death of the great
Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna in 1994 noted that Formula One cars
generate enough downforce in theory to be driven upside-down across
a ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers' heart rates can pound at more than 200 beats a
minute; a driver can lose 10 pounds in a 90-minute race. Like
bullfighters, drivers chance death every time they step in front of
a crowd. Michael Schumacher of the Ferrari team, considered by many
the sport's best driver, was listed in March by Forbes magazine as
the highest paid athlete in the world, at $49 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   What more, a Formula One proselytizer might ask, do you want
from a sport?
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish itself from NASCAR's good-old-boy following, the
current Formula One campaign in the United States has been very
high end. Luxury brands are pushing the Grand Prix as the LMVH of
motor racing, polo on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Tag Heuer, the official timekeeper for Formula One, took out a
six-page advertising spread in the September issue of Vanity Fair,
juxtaposing images of its sports watches with the McLaren-Mercedes
racing car. At this year's Oscars, Tag Heuer gave out 100 of its
$1,700 Formula One 2000 Grand Prix Chronogaphs to performers and
presenters. And this summer, Tag Heuer, Hugo Boss and Mercedes were
the hosts of parties at the Guggenheim Museum and in Southhampton.
The guest list aimed at the kind of young, rich, beautiful people
who have always been moths to the Formula One flame in Europe. A
McLaren show car was on display, so people could gawk and marvel at
the surprising smallness and coolness of the fastest car on the
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's race, Ferrari, the only serious competitor for
McLaren, will run its usual exhibition race with amateur drivers
wealthy enough to own Ferrari sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most aggressive campaign to raise Formula One
awareness in this country has been Jaguar's, which is in its first
year of competition. On the morning of the Saks party, Irvine drove
a Formula One Jag down Broadway _ traffic had been cleared from
48th Street to 44th. A Formula One team can cost $200 million to
$300 million a year to run. For Jaguar _ and its parent company,
Ford _ the expense is part of a long-term plan to build a winning
team. For the moment, it's a loss leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving Jaguar toward a performance-oriented brand,
trying to appeal to a slightly younger customer,'' said Simon
Sproule, vice president of public affairs for Jaguar North America.
``There's no better platform than Formula One, with the caveat that
the U.S. is the best market for our cars but the one that knows the
least about Formula One.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Jaguar, Mercedes and Honda, companies that use
Formula One as a platform to promote their consumer lines, is to
penetrate beyond ``the guys who are watching Speedvision at 3
a.m.,'' said Sproule. ``What we as a car manufacturer are concerned
with is the nonpetrolheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Irvine's appearance on the Letterman show. David
Letterman declined to be interviewed for this article, but he's the
only late-night talk-show host who books Formula One drivers. David
Cronenberg, the film director and a fellow racing fanatic, said
Letterman once told him, ``I only care about two things:
broadcasting and Formula One.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Irvine's Irish accent and offhand jokes about a sport
most viewers haven't a clue about, he and his host seemed almost to
be speaking in code. Irvine said his father was such a racing nut
that he had almost named his son ``Moss Irvine.'' Letterman
chuckled, getting a reference to the legendary British driver,
Stirling Moss, that probably sailed clear over his millions of
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Cocky, charming and stylish in his black suits and bleached
hair, Irvine is an America-friendly celebrity. At Ferrari, he
publicly complained that being the No. 2 driver to the exacting,
teutonic Schumacher was like being hit every day on the head with a
cricket bat. He seems like the kind of bad-boy toy Madonna might
seek out to father a love-child.
</P>
<P>
   Sexy stars aside, there are still a few roadblocks to winning
over the United States market. Aside from the Letterman show,
mainstream media coverage has been minimal. Most fans of
international sport are more likely to watch the Olympics right
now, especially with a local hero to root for.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Andretti, who raced Formula One from 1968 to 1982, was the
last American champion, but he was born in Trieste and never fully
lost his Italian accent. Michael Andretti, Mario's son, competed in
1993, unsuccessfully. The last United States Grand Prix was held in
Phoenix in the dead of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally the wrong place,'' said Thomas L. Bryant, the editor
in chief for Road &AMP; Track. The Indy speedway ``is probably the best
place to do it,'' he said. ``It's the mecca of automobile racing in
America.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   Roger Werner, the president of Speedvision, said his channel
usually gets 150,000 to 300,000 viewers for a live Grand Prix
telecast. Sunday's race, he said, could attract 400,000 to a
million. ``It's never going to be as large an audience as NASCAR,''
he said. But it is a desirable audience for advertisers because
Formula One fans have higher income and education levels and ``tend
to be skewed toward the major metropolitan markets _ its more
cosmopolitan.''
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, Formula One is not the most accessible of
sports. Two teams, Ferrari and McLaren, are laps ahead of the pack
technologically, and their drivers almost always win. (After 14
races, Mika Hakkinen of Finland, who drives a McLaren, leads
Schumacher by 2 points in the drivers' standings.) Passing is too
difficult, and too dangerous, and so the car that starts out in
front, in the pole position, which is determined by time trials,
and wins the drag race into the first turn, frequently finishes in
the same position.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR drivers, like country music stars, spend hours signing
autographs. Formula One drivers are hermetically sequestered from
their fans. Entry to the Paddock Club, the equivalent of box
seating, is restricted to corporate sponsors or the very rich.
Admittance to the paddock itself, the sanctum sanctorum of the
drivers and their teams, is akin to a papal audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even media access can be difficult. This restrictiveness is a
deliberate strategy of Bernie Ecclestone, the man who runs Formula
One racing, to enhance its exclusive aura. Ecclestone controls
Formula One Management, which in June was granted all commercial
rights to Formula One by the Federation Internationale de
l'Automobile (of which he is vice president) until the year 2110
for about $360 million. This is roughly his company's revenues in a
single year. There were no other bidders, according a recent
article in The Economist about Formula One's murky finances, which
can make professional boxing, by comparison, look like a union
shop. (The European Union is investigating whether racing concerns
owned by Ecclestone broke competition laws.)
</P>
<P>
   Ecclestone has a reputation as an obscure and eccentric figure.
In a telephone interview from London, he started whistling when
asked about The Economist story, calling journalists ``fiction
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that he has monopolistic control over Formula One
is ``probably true,'' he said, adding, ``What it amounts to in
reality is that I've been able to do the things I want to do with
the sport.'' But, he said, ``I'm not a criminal, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester Stallone alluded to Ecclestone's controlling influence
as the reason he changed the hero of his next movie, ``Champs,''
from a Formula One driver to an Indy-style driver. ``There is a
certain person in charge of that series who has his own agenda,''
Stallone said in February. ``Making an F1 movie has become
impossible.'' Ecclestone offered no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg, the film director, has written a script called ``Red
Cars,'' about the American driver Phil Hill's championship season
for rrari in 1961, but he can't find anyone to produce it. ``People
seem to love to read it,'' he said on the phone from his home in
Toronto. ``I've been asked to turn it into a novel.'' But not a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg, who raced cars as an amateur, named Jeff Goldblum's
scientist in ``The Fly'' after the British driver Martin Brundle.
</P>
<P>
   How does he rate the sport's chances of finding an audience in
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   ``America likes extremes and Formula One is the most extreme
sport there is,'' he said. ``The missing piece of the puzzle is a
brilliant American driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Irvine offers another reason to watch Sunday's race:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the thrill, isn't it?''

bc-MORGAN-FREEMAN But Morgan Freeman hopes others see his softer side 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morgan Freeman radiates authority and knows it.
</P>
<P>
   The widely admired actor employs his commanding voice, imposing
presence and tall, trim frame for maximum control of any room he
enters. And he clearly enjoys his power to intimidate, seemingly
considering it an adjunct to the respect he's inarguably earned for
a long train of excellent performances on stage, television and in
such films as ``Street Smart,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ``Shawshank
Redemption,'' ``Seven,'' ``Unforgiven,'' ``Glory,'' ``Amistad'' and
``Lean on Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Morgan Freeman can be quite a handful. Nice, then, that
he's even more of an incorrigible joker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, you've gotta be careful with that kind of talk,'' the
63-year-old admonishes in his stern schoolmaster voice when praised
for his consistent excellence. ``I might start walking through them
and thinking, 'They're going to like me anyway, so I don't have to
work too hard here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't take your work for granted,'' he quickly adds
with a warm smile and a chuckle, as if anyone could possibly
believe he neither likes compliments nor ever intends to coast
through his chosen profession. ``You either give it its due or
don't do it, it's as simple as that. In a job situation like this,
when you've worked and struggled to get where you are, you don't
want to pretend it's not important to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's eager, ongoing engagement with his craft is evident in
two current movie releases, ``Nurse Betty'' and ``Under
Suspicion.'' The former, controversial director Neil Labute's (``In
the Company of Men'') acclaimed dark comedy features Freeman in an
uncharacteristically playful mode as a veteran hit man who falls
deeper in love with his delusional target (Renee Zellweger's title
soap opera believer) the longer he pursues her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspicion,'' which Freeman executive produced through his
company Revelations, is a taut psychological thriller in which he
plays a Puerto Rico police detective relentlessly interrogating a
powerful citizen, played by ``Unforgiven'' co-star Gene Hackman, he
suspects of a series of schoolgirl sex murders. Taking place in one
emotion-charged, constricted night, the mystery is as grimly
intense and focused as road picture ``Betty'' is goofily,
unpredictably freewheeling.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Freeman liked about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that attracts me about any group of roles is
their difference,'' he explains. ``The joy, of course, in acting is
to be as many different people as you can, and the even greater joy
is to be as many different people as you can in the shortest
possible time. That's why actors enjoy repertory theater so much.
You know, we all want to hide; I don't want to be me in any role at
all. The more obfuscation I can find for this Morgan Freeman, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors too, of course. While, like any working
actor, Freeman has appeared in many projects that weren't exactly
worthy of his talents (``Chain Reaction,'' anyone?), the high
percentage of quality films on his resume speaks to his shrewd
selectivity. Although ``Betty,'' for example, has been criticized
for its similarities to both other Tarantino-esque crime comedies
and ``Truman Show''-style blendings of TV and reality, the actor
instantly perceived what was original about the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those cases when you say, 'OK, I've seen this
and I've seen this,' but together you have not,'' he says. ``At no
time can you be able to predict what's coming next in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the character himself, he takes this incredibly bizarre
path through the picture,'' Freeman adds. ``It's such a sly, slow
transformation he has; it was just one of those things where, given
the chance to pull it off, you have to see if you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspicion'' offered altogether different inducements. The
project was actually Hackman's idea; he'd wanted to do an American
remake of ``Garde a Vue,'' the French film it's based on, for the
better part of two decades. Freeman, whose company's first feature
film this is, had the means to get that job done. When the two
master actors' schedules permitted, they were thrilled to pick up
and really fly from where their few ``Unforgiven'' scenes together
left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very intense piece, and much more like a play than
a film,'' says Freeman, whose extensive stage credits include the
long-running ``Miss Daisy'' and an acclaimed, all African-American
``Hello, Dolly.'' ``But Gene Hackman is just one of those icons of
excellence that actors have, so having that to work with was
exciting. But the challenge in situations like that is to carry
your weight. Gene's at the crux of the emotional impact of this
piece; he's the one taking the hard fall, the heavy line. So, the
question for me was how successful was I going to be in bringing
out the emotional baggage I needed to, because both characters have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Freeman often speaks of the uncertainty he brings to every
new role, that feeling should not be confused with anxiety. Indeed,
the tension that's so evident in the movie only struck the San Juan
set when director Stephen Hopkins said ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with these guys was like swordfighting with Jedi
masters,'' notes Thomas Jane, who plays Benezet's hotheaded
assistant investigator in ``Suspicion.'' ``But Gene and Morgan are
two very different actors in terms of style. Hackman is a real
logical guy, into very detailed analysis of the truism that action
equals character. And Morgan ... took a lot of naps. That's funny,
and I mean that literally, but I also mean that he's very relaxed,
a highly intuitive actor. I don't think he ever took a lesson, but
he keeps it so simple, it's just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman admits that theory and technique are highly abstract
notions to him and play little part in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a joyous worker,'' he explains. ``I have an awful lot of
fun, doing one thing or another. But I don't really know a lot
about how it works. Intellectualizing about the choices you make
and how you get them in terms of acting is really just a lot of
bull. I just find it all, usually, so easy to do that I don't know
what the mechanisms are.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying that he's got them so down that
training long ago became second nature. Freeman, who was raised in
Chicago and rural Mississippi (where he still lives near land his
family worked for generations, when he's not sailing around the
Caribbean from a home base on Grenada), studied acting at Los
Angeles City College after a five-year tour of duty with the Air
Force. He made his Broadway debut in 1968 and, as Easy Reader on
television's ``The Electric Company,'' helped a generation of '70s
tykes learn their ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   Although a wide range of heroic, villainous and compelling
characters have come out of the movie career that took off in the
mid-1980s, Freeman's role on the educational program was an apt
one. As noted earlier, there is something of the stern but
committed teacher embedded in his personality, buttressed by a
warmth the child in everyone can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   For example, asked how he feels about the remarkable, recent
mainstream success of African-American cinema and his own current
run of racially neutral roles, Freeman corrects, then enlightens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we are and you've got to stop talking about
it,'' he says, then smiles. ``Really, this is our society, and we
can just go on now and do this. When I read (the novel) 'Hawaii,'
it said the Chinese had this term for America, called it the Golden
Mountain. And I look now at a lot of young people, and the thing
that distinguishes them as Americans is this kind of golden color,
from all of the races coming together. We have a kind of golden
youth from this Golden Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason, obviously, why Morgan Freeman is regarded with
great seriousness. Lighthearted as he'd like to be, in this time of
disposable cinema, he also realizes that his palpable
thoughtfulness is more of a gift than a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, they keep using the term gravitas; 'You're an actor
whose work always has dignity and gravitas,''' he says. ``Oh-kaay,
I've got that, now how do I get out of that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about being bracketed. But I also realize that
all of these roles are ones that I chose to do, so I have to take
the responsibility for these choices. Yeah, I like roles that make
statements about American life and history, and I always wanted to
have that kind of impact. I'm drawn to these kinds of things, and I
admit it. But still, I don't want to be shut out of other kinds of
roles that don't have quite the ... gravitas.''

HERE COMES THE SPONSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., Fla.)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Natasha Allen recalls her wedding, in a historic village
outside Cincinnati last fall, she breathlessly describes arriving
in a horse-drawn carriage, the way her satin gown trailed through
the autumn leaves _ and the table at the reception with her
sponsors' brochures laid out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we placed the table a pinch off to the side, so it
wouldn't be obtrusive,'' Allen said in a honey-sweet voice
suggestive of an overconsumption of bridal magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 22, a financial broker in Cincinnati, convinced 15 local
businesses to supply free goods and services _ a $250 wedding gown
from Bridal Discount Warehouse, a $200 cake from Patricia's
Weddings and Custom Cakes, and $400 matching bands plus an
engagement ring from Mr. Bill's Family Jewels _ in exchange for
advertizing at what was once the most intimate and commercial-free
of occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise was touted, subtly, to guests. Allen drew up a
contract guaranteeing her sponsors a five-tiered ``presence'' at
her nuptials: their names were listed in the invitations, they were
thanked in the programs and on the couple's Web site, 4-by-6-inch
placards were placed beside their products, and brochures were
displayed on a table. Needless to say, they were all invited to the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people if they want to have their wedding sponsored,
they have to be thick skinned and treat it like a business
endeavor,'' said Allen, who used tricks she learned in sales
training classes required for her job to solicit services.
</P>
<P>
   As weddings become increasingly expensive, and some couples feel
pressure to live up to the lavish spreads in bridal magazines, they
are considering the drastic measure of seeking sponsors on their
path to holy matrimony. Weddings are a $70 billion annual business,
up 230 percent from 1982, according to a Bride's magazine study
this year. Fewer parents can afford all the bills, and young
couples are increasingly paying a share.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional wedding authorities say it strikes them as crass,
but sponsorship seems to make obvious sense to some members of a
younger generation, who recognize the commercialization of nearly
every aspect of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Martha Stewart's wedding magazine all the time and
see photo spreads of other people's weddings right next to
advertisements,'' said Sybil Smith, 24, a technology associate in
Tallahassee, Fla., who is recruiting sponsors for her wedding next
June. ``It's a modern reality. Why should it be different for me?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the sponsored wedding can be traced to Tom Anderson,
an entrepreneur living outside Philadelphia, who was trying to
raise money for a fledgling animation company last year at the same
time he was planning his wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me that a startup company and a startup couple
both need launch money,'' Anderson said. He put together a detailed
sales package, donned a suit and hit the streets, approaching 80
local businesses over several months. Eventually, he persuaded 24
to foot almost the entire $30,000 bill for his wedding to Sabrina
Root, including the use of a castle in Glenside, Pa., and a white
stretch limousine. ``I made them realize that for a couple hundred
dollars they were putting in for their product, they were going to
get a ton of exposure,'' Anderson said. ``It was incredibly easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's story made a national news wire, which led to an
appearance on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' setting off a chain
reaction with many other couples soliciting sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   What's in it for the businesses who supply their goods and
services free or at a discount? A young, captive demographic, whose
attention is increasingly difficult to win in a media-saturated
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the radio in Cincinnati it seems like every other 30
seconds there's another ad for some jeweler offering a 75 percent
discount,'' said Bill Wickemeier, who supplied the rings for
Allen's wedding. ``There's too many. But at a wedding you can reach
a whole new group of people, at a time and place when they don't
have their guard up against advertising. Now, I'm not just going to
give away free jewelry to anyone who walks through my door, but I
might sponsor another wedding if the couple were from a different
area of town and had a different group of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, traditional wedding authorities disapprove.
Theirs is a world of conventions and longstanding etiquette, where
debates over skin-baring gowns or different bouquet shades take on
the gravity of a U.N. peace conference. ``We give it a firm thumbs
down,'' said Sally Kilbridge, the managing editor of Bride's,
likening the practice to giving a dinner party with a
representative from the beef council pitching steak to the guests.
``It's a party that you are inviting people to, and there shouldn't
be any strings attached.''
</P>
<P>
   Carley Roney, a co-founder of theknot.com, a Web site for
wedding services, agreed. ``It's like selling a videotape of your
birth to a local TV station,'' she said. ``The names of the family
that raised you should be on the back of the invitations, not the
names of local companies that gave you four boutonnieres.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roney admits that it may be a sign of the times for a
generation that has been raised with omnipresent awareness of brand
identities. ``It does seem like younger people feel like brands owe
them,'' she said. ``And while I'm appalled by this trend, I'm
always surprised at how marketing-savvy they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Messmear, a homemaker in her early 20s from Warren, Ohio,
who claims to have approached over 200 businesses since she began
seeking sponsorship last July for a ceremony to renew her vows,
says she has had some luck but has also endured harsh criticism.
One bridal shop owner wrote in an e-mail to her: ``Poor taste is
available at any price and you just put an all-time low on a
wedding. May I suggest that you go to the library and get an
etiquette book and read a little?''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, defending those who go the sponsorship route, said, ``If
anything is immoral, it's spending $30,000 on a wedding and putting
themselves into debt.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A 26-year-old woman who works at a leading accounting company in
Manhattan and attends business school at night began the process of
selling her wedding three weeks ago. ``I thought it would be
interesting to see if I could implement the marketing techniques
I've learned in business school to form a strategic alliance,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She researched her favorite companies and sent them letters
offering ``complete creative freedom'' as sponsors, pointing out
that she and her future husband had an ``attractive list'' of
friends from business school and dot-coms who are ``likely to be
married in the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   She was crestfallen when Vera Wang rejected her request for a
free bridal gown. ``I've always loved Vera Wang dresses, and so do
all my friends,'' the bride-to-be said, requesting anonymity out of
fear that prospective employers might disapprove. ``It seemed odd
that they wouldn't be interested in sponsoring me, because I'm
exactly their target market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when I was in college, I used the Apple computers
that had been donated by the company to our training lab,'' she
said. ``So of course, as soon as I graduated that's what I ended up
buying. That same brand-loyalty principle applies to weddings.''

 &HT;    CLINTON RELEASES OIL FROM STRATEGIC RESERVE
 &HT;    EDs: Corrects first name of OPEC president in 4th from last graf
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton authorized a limited release of
oil from the government's emergency stockpile Friday amid growing
concern of a winter home heating crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The decision immediately heated up one thing _ the political
dialogue between presidential rivals Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices rising and heating oil inventories shrinking,
the president directed the release of 30 million barrels of oil
from the 571 million-barrel stockpile created after the Arab oil
embargoes of the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not political,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said
Friday in announcing Clinton's action. ``The president wants to
help the American people get home heating oil and have enough heat
in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, charged that the
administration had authorized tapping the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve solely to help Gore escape voters' anger for high energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten months ago, the president and vice president thought it
was a bad idea to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve,'' the Texas governor said at a campaign stop in Tampa,
Fla. ``Now that we are 46 days away from the election, they changed
their minds. I agree with them that it was a bad idea in the past,
and I still think it's a bad idea today.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Gore opposed tapping the oil reserves. But on
Thursday, Gore said ``the situation has changed'' over the past
eight months. Oil-producing countries ``have not followed through''
on pledges to increase production, a step that would have eased
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision came less than 24 hours after Gore made
a public plea for such action, and on the same day that Gore was
campaigning in Pennsylvania, accusing Bush, a former oil company
executive, of being an ``apologist'' for big oil interests.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, rising gasoline prices are becoming an
issue in the presidential campaign after months of undirected
grumbling by consumers. And in the Northeast and Midwest, key
regions in the presidential contest, the escalating cost of heating
oil adds another dimension to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, home heating oil inventories are 19 percent lower
than a year ago, Richardson said, and in New England, they are 65
percent lower. Additionally, wholesale home heating oil prices have
risen 38 percent to $1.04 a gallon over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that American families are warm this
winter,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary said oil from the strategic reserve would
be made available over the next 30 days, with the first bids to be
issued Monday. Refineries that get the oil would have to replenish
the strategic reserve at a later date, when oil prices would
presumably be lower.
</P>
<P>
   Oil was last released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
1991, when the United States led a United Nations coalition to
repel Iraqi military forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   However, oil in the reserve has been used several other times in
temporary swap arrangements to help specific refiners with brief
supply or pipeline problems. Most recently, Conoco and Citgo
borrowed 1 million barrels in July when a shipping channel was
blocked, and the two refineries later restocked the reserve with
1.03 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the relatively modest release of 1 million
barrels a day over the next 30 months would have on the price of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices will fall, but the effect will be temporary,'' Ali
Rodriguez, president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu news conference in Pennsylvania, Gore told
reporters that he believes there are ``disagreements within OPEC,''
and that releasing oil from the U.S. reserves would prompt the
cartel to hike production.
</P>
<P>
   It is equally unclear what the political consequences could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the decision helps bring down the price of oil, I don't
think the American people will care very much that it was a crass
political move,'' said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution
political analyst. ``On the other hand, if it doesn't do any good,
what people will remember was that Gore played politics with
something important to them.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 24, will move Saturday.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-PROTEST-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Say
``anti-globalization'' and a stormy image tends to come to mind:
ransackers of McDonald's restaurants in France, smashers of Seattle
store-front windows. The police on every corner here and the
shuttered shops reflect the power of such specters. But they
deceive. The deeper reality is more significant: that of an
increasingly sophisticated, intellectually robust protest movement,
mixing idealism with pragmatism, that is fast playing catch-up with
the forces of multinational capital. By Roger Cohen. (Moved in `i'
category.)
</P>
<P>
   FUEL-CRISIS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Listening to Al Gore's
warnings last week that America was being ``manipulated by foreign
oil and big oil,'' or watching President Clinton's top aides argue
their way to a decision to start tapping the country's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve for only the second time in history, it would
have been easy to conclude that the country was in the midst of
another energy crisis. Actually, it isn't. At least not yet. But
whether or not there is an oil crisis, there is no question there
is a political crisis. By David E. Sanger. (Moved in `a' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-FICTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's the point of writing
fiction in a world like this? These are the days of miracles and
wonder, as Paul Simon wrote in 1986: We are living closer than ever
to the future, having already been 20,000 leagues under the sea and
up to the moon. We own personal computers. The Internet has made
its way into more than half of America's homes; the geeks did
inherit the earth. Open any given newspaper and the day's events
outpace most fiction on the weird-o-meter. Science fiction writers
create the literature of escape, but are scrambling to outrun the
present. By John Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ More than 80 percent of
American adults tell pollsters that they think that violence in the
culture contributes to violent acts by young people. Even though
the evidence of a relationship between culture and actual violence
is highly uncertain, it is good politics to wax indignant about
entertainment corrupting the nation's youth. Of course, the First
Amendment makes it almost impossible to draft a law that would
place meaningful restrictions on entertainment. Besides, the
entertainment industry is a big source of campaign money for both
major parties, especially for Democrats. By David E. Rosenbaum.

<P>
   GUNS-DECISION-TEXT (Undated) _ A federal judge in Texas gave gun
groups a startling victory last year and set off an appeals battle
that legal experts say could be the most important dispute over the
constitutional right to firearms in recent memory. The judge, Sam
R. Cummings, held that history proves that the right ``to keep and
bear arms'' in the Second Amendment gave individual citizens a
right to weapons. His decision, with its emotional resonance for
gun supporters, was in conflict with the vast weight of modern
rulings, which have held that the amendment merely gave the states
a right to keep armed militia units.
</P>
<P>
   KISSING-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In politics, the Y2K bug has
turned out to be kissing, and by all evidence, it's catching. First
Al Gore planted a big one on his wife, Tipper, at the Democratic
Convention. Then, after Oprah Winfrey jokingly complained that Gore
had failed to kiss her in a cheery appearance on her talk show,
George W. Bush wasted no time in planting a smooch on Winfrey's
cheek. What's going on? By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   UNWED-MOTHERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Four years ago, as the whole
debate over ``family values,'' single mothers and welfare
dependency reached its peak, Congress plopped a $400 million bonus
program into the welfare reform act. The so-called ``illegitimacy
bonus'' promised $100 million a year, for four years, to be split
among the five states that produced the largest decrease in
out-of-wedlock births, with no increase in abortion rates. Last
week, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala
announced the second round of winners. But what the bonus really
rewards remains murky. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Much has been made in the
presidential campaign about Vice President Al Gore's stint with the
Army in Vietnam, but one striking fact has gone largely unnoted: If
elected, Gore would be the first president in a century to have
served as an enlisted man and one of only four ever. By Steven Lee
Myers.

<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   PUTIN-MEDIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ In Russia, rulers don't just fight
to take or keep power. They also fight to make sure they don't have
to share it. This was true for the czars, it was true for the
Communist Party and, so far, it seems to be true for President
Vladimir Putin, who came to the Kremlin by way of the KGB. This
trait has been most apparent in his dealings with the media, which
Putin, more than his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, seems determined
to bring onto his team. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-CHAVEZ-REVIEW (Caracas, Venezuela) _ Hugo Chavez spent
his first 18 months as president of Venezuela consolidating his
power on the domestic front. Now, with the price of oil nearing $40
a barrel and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
scheduled to gather here this week for a conference of its heads of
state, he is about to step out onto the world stage in a big way.
For those unfamiliar with Venezuela's president, a 46-year-old
former paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt,
the experience promises to be overwhelming. By Larry Rohter.

</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-PROTEST-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Say
``anti-globalization'' and a stormy image tends to come to mind:
ransackers of McDonald's restaurants in France, smashers of Seattle
store-front windows. The police on every corner here and the
shuttered shops reflect the power of such specters. But they
deceive. The deeper reality is more significant: that of an
increasingly sophisticated, intellectually robust protest movement,
mixing idealism with pragmatism, that is fast playing catch-up with
the forces of multinational capital. By Roger Cohen. (Moved in `i'
category.)
</P>
<P>
   FUEL-CRISIS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Listening to Al Gore's
warnings last week that America was being ``manipulated by foreign
oil and big oil,'' or watching President Clinton's top aides argue
their way to a decision to start tapping the country's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve for only the second time in history, it would
have been easy to conclude that the country was in the midst of
another energy crisis. Actually, it isn't. At least not yet. But
whether or not there is an oil crisis, there is no question there
is a political crisis. By David E. Sanger. (Moved in `a' category.)

<P>
   SCIENCE-FICTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's the point of writing
fiction in a world like this? These are the days of miracles and
wonder, as Paul Simon wrote in 1986: We are living closer than ever
to the future, having already been 20,000 leagues under the sea and
up to the moon. We own personal computers. The Internet has made
its way into more than half of America's homes; the geeks did
inherit the earth. Open any given newspaper and the day's events
outpace most fiction on the weird-o-meter. Science fiction writers
create the literature of escape, but are scrambling to outrun the
present. By John Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ More than 80 percent of
American adults tell pollsters that they think that violence in the
culture contributes to violent acts by young people. Even though
the evidence of a relationship between culture and actual violence
is highly uncertain, it is good politics to wax indignant about
entertainment corrupting the nation's youth. Of course, the First
Amendment makes it almost impossible to draft a law that would
place meaningful restrictions on entertainment. Besides, the
entertainment industry is a big source of campaign money for both
major parties, especially for Democrats. By David E. Rosenbaum.

ROB FRIEDMAN OF MUTUAL EUROPEAN FUND: LOOKING FOR CLUES BEYOND THE
EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One man's poison is another man's meat. At least that's what
they say.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a certain logic to it. Just now, for example, some
big American multinational corporations are moaning that the weak
euro will crimp profits. Shouldn't it follow, then, that big
companies based on the other side of the pond would see a
corresponding increase in earnings when the dollars they make here
are turned into cheaper euros?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But maybe not. Rob Friedman, portfolio manager of the
Mutual European fund, part of Franklin Templeton Investments, took
time last week to discuss the weak euro, the strong dollar and
investing. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A number of companies have said that the weakness in the euro
will hamper their profitability. Are they telling the truth?
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether you are talking about strong dollars or weak euros,
there is a difference between a transactional gain or loss and a
translational gain or loss. In other words, there is a difference
between something that really hurts you and an accounting
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, for example, is not selling less or more soda based
on what the value of the euro is. That should have a minimal impact
on sales. And the cash those sales generate is probably not
repatriated. But for accounting purposes it has to come back. So
that is a purely translational loss.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Corrus, the old British Steel, probably has
80 percent of its business on the Continent. Now, the British pound
is very weak against the dollar, but it is strong against the euro.
That will really hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   So companies that export are going to be truly impacted by the
weakness of other currencies against the dollar. On the other hand,
if you are a multinational and manufacture in local markets, in my
view the weakness of the currency is an excuse to cover up some
fundamental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But doesn't it follow that if American-based companies are
going to book lower profits because of the euro, European companies
should book higher profits because of the strong dollar?
</P>
<P>
   A. They will indeed report better numbers. But I would look
beyond that and ask if they are telling you the business is better.
</P>
<P>
   Take Nestle, for example. They are a Swiss company in name only
and probably don't repatriate a lot of cash. And when a consumer
products company analyst looks at the company, he or she is not
looking at currency fluctuations but at how unit sales are doing
and how pricing per unit is doing. That will truly tell you how
business is doing. The strength of the U.S. economy, not the strong
dollar, is what has aided the companies that do lots of business
over here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you worry about currency fluctuations?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have hedged our currency positions since 1993, so I pay
minimal attention to currency movements. Also, a lot of the
companies we are interested in are midcap companies that tend to
have localized businesses, which means they do most of their
business either inside their own borders or in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do most mutual funds hedge currency positions? What made you
start to hedge?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are about 157 European funds in the United States right
now, and of those I believe most do not hedge. Some may feel it is
an added expense or that the fluctuations in currency values will
even out over time.
</P>
<P>
   We started hedging based on our experience with SmithKline
Beecham, a stock we bought in late 1992 and early 1993. At the
time, the stock was trading at 11 times earnings, which was
ridiculously cheap.
</P>
<P>
   It went up nicely, only to give back a huge chunk of the gain
due to the strength of the dollar relative to the pound. Since then
we have largely hedged currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has hedging helped your performance?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have retained our profits by hedging. But we haven't made
money that way. If I thought I was going to buy a stock and hold it
for 20 years, I wouldn't hedge my position, because the cost of
hedging might more than evaporate the savings I might realize.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What stocks are you buying now?
</P>
<P>
   A. About 20 percent of the European fund is in cash right now,
which is higher than usual because most of the big-cap names are
much too expensive at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But we have been putting some money into some of the British
engineering companies that have been beaten up, like Spirax. We
have bought into a U.K. chemical company called Ellis &AMP; Everard, as
well as Cardo, a Swedish general engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Irish financial firms, like Irish Life and Anglo
Irish Bank, have been beaten up. And some Spanish construction
companies, like ACS and Acciona.
</P>
<P>
   We own a lot of French companies, like Vivendi and Total. But
the only company we own in Germany is Dickerhof, a building
materials company.

BROADENING THE BASE OF DECISION-MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BOOK-HARLEY) 
(For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By FRED ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Ozley, co-author of ``More Than a Motorcycle,'' is an
organizational consultant who has worked with Harley-Davidson since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Ozley helped Rich Teerlink, his co-author and Harley-Davidson's
former chief executive, transform the company into one in which
workers, rather than merely carrying out edicts from above, took
responsibility for decisions that were reached by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a recent conversation with Ozley.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has there been any retreat from worker participation at
Harley?
</P>
<P>
   A. I do not think it's retreated at all. The level of
implementation, as one would expect, has increased. If you view it
objectively from the level of activity and shared decision-making
and all those things three years ago, it is much higher today.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has this technique enabled Harley to make better decisions?
</P>
<P>
   A. Harley has been able to come to market with more new products
in recent years than they've ever been able to do before. This
collegial, consensual decision-making involves people early on in
the product design, so the manufacturability is thought about at
the time of design. People from the plant work very early on with
product development to say, ``That's a wonderful design but it's
not possible to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would this way of decision-making serve Harley in bad times
as well as good?
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely. We have to compete in a global marketplace. The
issue here is for employees to be committed, versus compliant.
Committed employees will deal with whatever comes at them better
than those people who in the past relied on one or two people to
make decisions and they would salute them for it. In this way of
decision-making, you get a much broader base of employees who
understand the global competitive situation. They understand costs;
they understand why they have to do what they do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does this way of decision-making attract people?
</P>
<P>
   A. The turnover rate at Harley-Davidson is much, much below the
national average for manufacturing. In the case of the information
services department, they are substantially below what you would
expect. In fact, they just got an award from an information
services magazine _ they were considered the best place to work in
the information services field.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is this more difficult because unions are in the picture?
</P>
<P>
   A. Frankly, no. The union organizations, when they first hear
about this, will be a little bit apprehensive, they will be
suspicious. But once they get on board and are active participants
in the decision-making process, they can be very, very helpful.
They are able to help communicate the need, to marshal the
collective will of the workers. You have two sets of leaders
helping the employee get his or her head around what the issues
are. &QL;

   TACO-RECALL (Undated) _ Kraft Foods said Friday that it was
recalling its Taco Bell brand taco shells after confirming that the
products contained a genetically engineered corn that has not been
approved for human consumption. The recall is the first in this
country of a food made from a genetically engineered crop, and is
expected to increase the pressure on the biotechnology industry and
on the government to put in place tougher regulations on
agricultural biotechnology. Stung by its experience, Kraft itself
Friday issued some recommendations for tougher guidelines. By

   ROLLS-ROYCE (Munich, Germany) _ As director of Project
Rolls-Royce at the German automaker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG,
Karl-Heinz Kalbfell is planning to introduce an entirely new line
of Britain's most prestigious name in cars. But thanks to a
stalemate between BMW and Volkswagen AG, which both wanted to buy
Rolls-Royce two years ago, he has to wait until 2003, when
Volkswagen will relinquish control over the celebrated name. Until
BMW acquires the name, Kalbfell is not supposed to even pose in
front of current Rolls-Royce models, much less promote them in any
way. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   MARKET (New York) _ A steep tumble in shares of Intel dragged
the stock market lower Friday, after the company's warning late on
Thursday that its sales in the third quarter would grow much less

than 300 million shares, but investors proved to be resilient,
seeming to see more buying opportunities than problems in the Intel
news, and the market shed nearly all its losses by the closing

in the music and Internet industries and among consumer

   The man who by many accounts was the most innovative, respected

   In 1981, Crandall oversaw development of the first
frequent-flier program as president of American Airlines, where he
later became chairman and chief executive. The program, an
immediate hit, went on to transform airline marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the mile has become a sort of shadow currency, awarded or
honored by many businesses, including hotels, car rental agencies
and even phone companies and credit card issuers. With the boom in
travel, the number of unredeemed miles outstanding has shot up into
the trillions, by some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall, 64, is now affiliated, as an investor and adviser,
with MilePoint.com, a new venture meant to help mop up some of
those miles. The service, due to start next month, lets
participants in the loyalty programs of Delta, Northwest,
Continental, US Airways, America West, TWA and Hilton Hotels redeem
their miles for discounts on merchandise instead of airline tickets
or hotel rooms. MilePoint will earn fees from both the loyalty
program sponsors and participating retailers. (American Airlines,
part of AMR, plans its own miles-for-merchandise offering with
America Online.)
</P>
<P>
   In a series of telephone conversations, Crandall spoke from his
homes in Gloucester, Mass., and in Dallas about the evolution of
frequent-flier programs and the future of travel marketing. Here
are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How have mileage programs changed the way people fly?
</P>
<P>
   A. For infrequent fliers, miles continue to be an enormously
powerful incentive to travel on a particular airline; by putting
all their travel in a single place, they can accumulate enough
miles for a trip. However, for frequent fliers who belong to lots
of plans, it's less important to be on airline A or airline B for a
particular trip. But the concept of getting something for nothing
continues to have a great fascination and is a powerful incentive
for people to join programs.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have the accumulations of unredeemed miles taken airlines by
surprise? Are they a serious problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think anyone anticipated the overwhelming success of
the plans. I don't think airlines are concerned about it. But I do
think they're anxious to find ways to liquidate their liability.
</P>
<P>
   MilePoint charges airlines to liquidate their miles much less
than it would cost them to deliver seats. And the commission that
retailers pay us is a whole lot less than they would have to spend
on advertising to find qualified customers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Programs run by American Express, Diners Club and others let
customers redeem points or miles for the full price of goods. So
will American and AOL in their new joint program. Why would
consumers use MilePoint and settle for just a discount?
</P>
<P>
   A. Those programs have a catalog approach _ you can trade in
your miles only for items in their catalogs, and you have to pay a
lot more for them than you otherwise would. With MilePoint, you use
miles as real dollars to buy things for publicly stated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the Internet transforming the marketing of travel the way
loyalty programs did?
</P>
<P>
   A. As the Internet gets faster and more reliable and becomes
easier to use, as Internet-access appliances get more reliable and
cheaper, people will buy more and more of what they buy online.
Travel is likely to be a category of consumption where virtually
all transactions will be online; it's hard to imagine why anyone
would use paper.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you miss running an airline?
</P>
<P>
   A. I had a terrific time running American. I was very fond of
the high energy level and of the rapid pace of change of the
airline business. But it was a very consuming kind of thing. I grew
very weary of the conflicts with the unions and of the uninformed,
politically-inspired commentary of folks in Washington. I reached a
point where I'd rather be doing this than that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Shaken by the relentless decline of
Europe's unified currency, the euro, the European, American and
Japanese central banks undertook a surprise rescue attempt on
Friday to fight what they called a threat to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Their move, announced as financial ministers from the Group of
Seven industrialized nations arrived here in advance of a meeting
Saturday, was the first time in two years that central banks had
staged a coordinated currency intervention _ and the first time
ever that they had done so in support of a European currency.
</P>
<P>
   It also marked a shift by the U.S. Treasury secretary, Lawrence
Summers, who had consistently opposed calls for intervention and as
recently as Thursday had reiterated support for a strong dollar.
His comments were widely interpreted at the time as ruling out U.S.
participation in any attempt to strengthen the euro against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The banks bought billions of euros with dollars, yen and British
pounds in the intervention, pushing the euro's value up to 90 cents
from 85 cents. The euro later slipped back to settle at 87.87
cents.
</P>
<P>
   The currency had fallen below 85 cents from its initial price of
$1.17 in January 1999, a decline of almost 30 percent that
disheartened euro supporters, who had seen the new currency as a
symbol of their broader ambitions for European unity.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention underlined fears that Europe faces a potential
economic shock from the combination of a sinking common currency
and soaring oil prices. Because oil is bought and sold in dollars,
the recent rise in the price of oil has hurt consumers in Europe
much more than those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This has heightened inflation pressure across Europe and could
force the European Central Bank to raise interest rates enough to
slow the European economy. Robust European growth, in turn, has
helped extend the record-long U.S. expansion, so any slowdown in
Europe could directly hurt the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining U.S. participation in the currency action Friday,
Summers cited risks to the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Japan joined with the European Central
Bank in concerted intervention in exchange markets because of their
shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements
in the euro for the world economy,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank released an almost identical statement
to explain its action.
</P>
<P>
   None of the central banks disclosed how much they spent to buy
euros, but some currency-market analysts speculated that the total
was as much as $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Friday's intervention will depend on whether the
euro resumes its decline, and that may not be clear for weeks or
even months. But the banks as a group have much more money at their
disposal to buy euros, and the action on Friday raised the prospect
that they could swoop in again if they decided the euro was too
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a particular level in mind,'' said Otmar
Issing, the European Central Bank's chief economist. ``That wasn't
the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the U.S. decision to come to the aid of the Europeans
made the joint action far more likely to restore some luster to the
tarnished euro, several traders and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States so rarely seeks to interfere with currency
markets that it carries considerable clout when it does. The global
action also is the first time that central banks of Japan, Canada
and Britain have joined the new European Central Bank in defending
the euro, a vote of support as the European bank faces the toughest
test of its short existence.
</P>
<P>
   The move is risky for the Clinton administration. The strong
dollar has been an important ingredient of the record-breaking U.S.
economic expansion by helping keep imports relatively inexpensive
and inflation low.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's market action were to help restore the euro to what
many economists consider its value based on economic fundamentals,
that would mean an increase of at least 15 percent, making a euro
roughly equivalent to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Any sharp decline in the dollar would raise the cost of imports
in the United States, add to the already enormous trade deficit,
and possibly force the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest
rates faster or higher than it otherwise would.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that international financial officials had considered
active U.S. support for the euro unlikely is that the Clinton
administration has generally avoided taking actions that might
prove detrimental to Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign, which depends in part on the continued robustness of the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Washington on Friday, Summers sought to
navigate an apparent contradiction between his often-repeated
stance in favor of a strong dollar and the decision to sell dollars
and buy euros on the global market. He said there had been no
change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said many times, a strong dollar is in the national
interest of the United States,'' he said. Currency-market analysts
generally viewed the intervention as a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute of International
Economics in Washington, said he expected at least a modest rebound
in the euro but did not foresee a serious threat to the dollar's
long-term strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that you want a stronger euro is not to say that you
want a weak dollar,'' he said, noting the prolonged rise of the
dollar versus the currencies of all of the United States' major
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the euro, which has been adopted by 11 European
countries and will soon replace national currencies like the German
mark and the French franc, had political as well as economic
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark is holding a national referendum on Sept. 28 on adopting
the euro, and the currency's weakness has seriously eroded popular
support for the measure. In Britain, which has not adopted the
euro, opposition to possible future participation has intensified.
Numerous European officials have said that the euro's weakness
threatens to undermine the trend toward economic integration and a
more politically unified Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a Ph.D. in political sciences to figure out
that populist parties all across Europe will jump on the anti-euro
bandwagon,'' said Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in London. He said the euro project had become engulfed in a
``confidence crisis.''

<P>
   The last time central banks cooperated to intervene in currency
markets was in 1998, when the United States and Japan rescued the
tumbling Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, financial panic had spread around Asia, and U.S.
officials were worried that any further deterioration in the yen
could force China to devalue its currency. That was seen as likely
to set off a fresh round of turmoil across the region, where the
International Monetary Fund had just committed about $100 billion
in emergency financing to shore up South Korea, Indonesia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention worked. The yen regained about 30 percent
against the dollar. Giant investment funds and banks that had been
betting on a further deterioration of the Japanese currency were
caught off guard, and many were forced to abandon their positions
with heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has not always had success in influencing
the price of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the United States, Japan and European banks agreed on
what became known as the Plaza Accord to jointly intervene in and
reverse what at the time was a sustained dollar surge. The dollar
traded at the time at over 3 German marks, its all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention pushed the dollar down _ but by far more than
authorities had anticipated. They subsequently sealed a second
pact, known as the Louvre Accord, this time to buy dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That intervention fell short of its goal, bankers said. It took
many years, until the sharp rise in the U.S. economy in the
mid-1990s, for the dollar to fully regain its footing.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of that mixed record, Summers has often
expressed a reluctance to intervene in currency markets. His
reputation was so well known that most currency traders and
analysts had considered it highly unlikely that the United States
would join any effort to strengthen the euro even if European
nations and Japan tried to do so on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention also caught the market off guard because even
European officials appeared almost hopelessly disunited about
whether there was a need for intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Italian, Spanish and German officials in recent days had argued
that a weak exchange rate for the euro is not necessarily bad,
because it helps promote exports and stimulate growth. ``The weak
euro makes our enterprises very happy,'' said Giuliano Amato,
Italy's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the European Central Bank had clearly been trying to shore
up the euro. The bank raised interest rates six times in the last
year, moves that the market interpreted as supporting the currency
by making bank deposits and other assets denominated in euros more
valuable. And the bank last week bought a modest amount of euros
with some of its own foreign-exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
   None of those actions did much to support the currency, however,
until Friday's joint intervention, which traders said had a
profound effect for its sheer shock value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am astonished,'' said Axel Siedenberg, head of economic
research at Deutsche Bank AG. ``We always had the impression that
there was no awareness of the problem on the other side of the
Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of the United States won praise from numerous
bankers, many of whom had gathered in Prague for the annual meeting
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as
Saturday's meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very good thing, and it is good because it was a
coordinated intervention,'' said Martin Kohlhaussen, president of
Germany's Commerzbank AG. ``I hope it is enough to give the euro
the necessary push that it needs.''

CLEARER PICTURE EMERGES OF EVENTS THAT LED TO MAN'S DEATH ON PLANE

</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In his upscale neighborhood of ranch-style houses in
Las Vegas, Jonathan Burton was known as a model citizen. He helped
young children learn to ride bicycles and play video games. He
carried groceries for elderly people. ``I wish he was my son,''
said Mary Mahoney, who lives next door to the Burton family.
</P>
<P>
   But on a Southwest Airlines flight last month from Las Vegas to
Salt Lake City, where Burton was planning to visit relatives, a
different side of him emerged _ a wild and frantic side, according
to passengers on the plane. His behavior cost him his life at the
hands of fellow travelers who restrained him after he tried to kick
down the door of the cockpit. He was 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind that that young man threw away
his life as a direct consequence of his own actions,'' said Adam P.
Bradshaw, who was sitting in an aisle seat toward the rear of the
Boeing 737 and watched events unfold. ``I feel profoundly sad over
this, but the reaction of the passengers trying to restrain him
came in direct proportion to the violence he was causing.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities in Salt Lake City say they have closed their
investigation. The U.S. attorney for Utah ruled Burton's death a
homicide, but concluded there was no ``criminal intent'' by those
involved and declined to prosecute anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting accounts emerged in the days following the incident,
but interviews this week with witnesses paint a more consistent
picture of what happened on the flight, which had 121 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the authorities refusing to discuss details of the
case, a central question remains: Why did a likable young man
suddenly try to break down the doors of a cockpit in midflight,
argue with flight attendants and fight with passengers?
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that the Aug. 11 flight was routine until about
20 minutes before landing.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Bradshaw _ who is the news director at KTVX, the
ABC affiliate in Salt Lake _ said he saw Burton walk toward the
rear of the plane, take a drink off a cart and walk back. Over the
next few minutes, Burton walked up and down the aisle several
times, once pausing at Bradshaw's seat. ``He had very frantic
eyes,'' Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitaker, a retired Army officer and construction project
manager, said he told his business partner in the seat beside him,
``That dude's trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton then returned to his seat, the passengers recalled.
Christy Gibson, a Las Vegas resident sitting across the aisle from
Burton, said she then heard the attendant ask if he needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said Burton responded ``No, I'm fine. It's just the
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said, ``That scared me. I figured he was on drugs, but I
had no idea what his intentions were.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, passengers said, Burton bolted toward the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``About five feet from the cockpit door, he leaped into the air
with both feet at the door, like a long jump,'' Bradshaw said. ``He
hit with both feet. Then, with one foot against the wall, he tried
to pull the door open, wildly jerking around, then beating the door
with his fists and yelling, although I couldn't understand what he
was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian passenger, Dean Harvey, told The Edmonton Journal
that he heard Burton yelling, ``I can fly this plane!'' Other
passengers said they did not hear that.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Burton attacked the cockpit doors, breaking the
center panel, several male passengers tried to calm him down,
Bradshaw said. He and others disagreed with Harvey, who told the
Journal that Burton reached into the cockpit, grabbing the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But as the men began escorting Burton back to his seat, Whitaker
said, he scrambled for the emergency-row exit in the middle of the
plane. ``He was saying something like `I've got to go, I've got to
get out of here,''' Whitaker said.
</P>
<P>
   People in the row had moved, giving the men a chance to surround
Burton, and try calming him, Whitaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said the men asked Burton simple questions, like ``What's
your name?'' and ``Where are you from?'' to get his mind off the
flight. ``Then he calmed down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the plane was starting its approach into the Salt
Lake airport. Gibson said that, given Burton's behavior, attendants
did not want him in an emergency-exit row so they asked some men to
help move him to another seat. One man asked to help, Gibson said,
was an off-duty police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started to move him down the aisle to the back of the
plane,'' Gibson said, ``but when he heard police officer, he
freaked. He went ballistic. He punched the police officer in the
face, split open his lip and blood was all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw said that pandemonium broke out. As six to eight men
tried to control Burton, Bradshaw said, he was ``whaling on
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a violent fight, no doubt,'' he said. ``They finally
got him face down on the floor, but he was still kicking, screaming
at the top of his lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his account, Harvey said the men were excessively aggressive,
with one man jumping onto Burton's chest repeatedly after the young
man was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any mob mentality,'' Bradshaw said. ``And I
don't care what any other passenger says, I'm convinced nobody
wanted to hurt that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were scared,'' Gibson said. ``Women were crying.''
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes before the plane landed, with the men still
holding Burton down, the screaming stopped, passengers said. When
the plane reached the gate, airport police officers and paramedics
boarded, handcuffed Burton and carried him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came off the plane, they were tending to him in the
jetway,'' Bradshaw said. ``They had the paddles out, ready to use.
But I think he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was pronounced dead at a Salt Lake hospital. The cause of
death was first reported to be cardiac arrest, but the autopsy
report said he died of asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy report said that Burton had traces of cocaine and
THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in his system.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's mother, Janet Burton, told reporters in Las Vegas this
week that she did not believe her son used illegal drugs. Janet
Burton, a widow, did not respond to messages left for her, and no
one answered the door Friday at her Las Vegas home. Her lawyer,
Kent Spence, did not respond to repeated messages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the death still reverberate on Marrow Road
in Las Vegas, where Burton lived with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors described him as a joy to know; not one
said she ever knew him to act violently or use drugs. ``He was too
smart for that,'' said Martha Ford, who lived across the street
from the Burtons until three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ken Young, an information officer for the Clark County
School District, said officers who worked at Cheyenne High School,
from which Burton graduated, had no idea who he was, a sign that he
had never been in trouble. A computer search found no evidence that
Burton had ever committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a retired police officer,'' said Mahoney, the neighbor.
``I'd know a rotten kid if I saw one.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Orvis, Jonathan Burton's supervisor at the Life Care
Center of Las Vegas, a nursing home where he had worked the last
three years as a housekeeper, praised him for helping the elderly
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would stop what he was doing and go take care of their
needs,'' she said. ``You need to be so patient to care for them,
and he really cared about them. He never lost his temper; he never
had an attitude with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Burton was just as patient with children; Jennifer
Yonesawa, another neighbor, recalled him teaching her daughter how
to play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good example to my own boys,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one was more distraught over what happened than
Burton's grandmother, Jean Tiltson. Yonesawa said that when she and
family members were planning funeral arrangements, Tiltson suffered
a heart attack. She was unable to attend the services.

   Big publishers dream about first-time authors like Benjamin
Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, Kaplan, 23, has sold an impressive 25,000 copies
of his book, ``How to Go to College Almost for Free: The Secrets of
Winning Scholarship Money.'' He has become a talk-show and
bookstore favorite and is starting a 25-city book tour. And he has
basically done it all himself.
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional publishers will have to keep dreaming, at
least for now. Despite lucrative offers for book deals, Kaplan, who
received an economics degree from Harvard in 1999, bypassed them
last year to start his own company, Waggle Dancer Books, so he can
publish more books and expand into audio and video tapes and
electronic reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about self-publishing is that if you succeed, you
succeed on your own merits,'' said Kaplan, who wrote his 316-page
book after receiving almost $90,000 in scholarship money. ``If you
fail, you fail on your own merits as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-publishing of successful books is nothing new. Many best
sellers, like ``The Celestine Prophecy'' and ``The Christmas Box,''
ended up with major publishers but were first published without
book deals. But Kaplan's bold approach demonstrates what some
people in the industry say is a growing challenge to traditional
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Stephen King sidestepped his longtime
publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, and began putting his new book, ``The
Plant,'' up for sale on the Internet. New ventures like Versaware,
iUniverse.com, eNovel.com and iVillage also draw large numbers of
self-publishing writers. And with help from companies like
Amazon.com, unknown authors with shoestring budgets can share
virtual shelf space with the blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are turning to self-publishing,'' said
Marilyn Ross, executive director of the Small Publishers
Association of North America, which represents 1,300 independent
presses, self-publishers and authors.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Pressnell, an assistant vice president at the Ingram Book
Group, a leading wholesaler, said her company had seen a slight
increase in the number of self-published titles. ``It's so easy
now,'' she said. ``People can practically publish from their
desks.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers have been seeking new outlets for various reasons. As
publishing houses consolidate, fewer new writers can get in the
door; media-wise authors, meanwhile, are able to mount their own
promotional campaigns. And while e-publishing sites typically offer
no advances, they give more generous royalties _ often about 40
percent. (Major publishers typically offer 10 to 15 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The large houses say the self-publishers pose no threat. ``It's
no secret that if you publish yourself, you can make more than a 15
percent royalty,'' said David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon &AMP;
Schuster trade books, a division of Viacom. ``But everything has
its price.'' He said major publishing houses could offer authors
more sophisticated design, editing, promotion and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview, Rosenthal began tapping at his
computer to check out Kaplan's sales. (On Friday afternoon, the
book ranked No. 201 on Amazon.) ``Clearly, he's doing something
right,'' he said. ``But I think a traditional publisher could do as
well if not better for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It sounds like the kind of book we should think of
buying.''
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, a unit of the News Corp., has already tried.
</P>
<P>
   During the spring, after his mother-in-law sent him a news
clipping about Kaplan, Adrian Zackheim, an associate publisher at
HarperCollins, invited him to his New York office to talk deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just listened,'' Kaplan said. ``But I felt it was more
important for me to follow through with my plans to self-publish.''
HarperCollins said he turned down two six-figure offers.
</P>
<P>
   For a busy young man like Kaplan _ a former star tennis player
in high school and an overachiever who has been known to stay awake
60 hours to finish a project _ the writing, publishing and
promotion of his book have required the same kind of zeal he showed
in applying for scholarships. (He won more than 20.)
</P>
<P>
   Having turned down publishers' queries because he felt they
``didn't get what the book was about,'' Kaplan finished writing
``How to Go to College'' in the summer of 1999 while living with
his parents in Gleneden Beach, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan hired a friend from Harvard to draw the book's cartoons,
but he and his parents did everything else. Kaplan taught himself
how to format the entire book on his computer. His mother, Patana,
and his father, Gary, helped with the editing. And his parents, who
once published a small computer magazine, also contracted with a
local printer for 5,000 copies, paying the bill with money from the
family's unused college savings.
</P>
<P>
   With the books stacked in the garage, the family began the slow
process of distributing copies two by two. Then four by four.
Kaplan's relentless promotion ran from high school appearances to
bookstore signings to television and radio appearances. Citing the
early sales of his book, priced at a relatively high $23.95, he
persuaded Ingram, the wholesaler, as well as other distributors
including Amazon.com and Baker &AMP; Taylor, of Charlotte, N.C., to
pick up his book.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan still lives at his parents' home, pouring all his
earnings back into publishing. ``I don't own a car,'' he said.
``And quite frankly, I've been too busy and haven't had a chance to
figure out how much money we have or have not made so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he ever sign with a major publisher? Kaplan has not ruled
out such a move, but he is looking for partnerships that are in
tune with his mission of providing books to help families through
milestones, like college and high school.
</P>
<P>
   Known on the Internet as ``the Scholarship Coach,'' he maintains
several Web sites, including www.waggledancer.com. (A waggle dancer
is a kind of scout bee that performs an informative dance that
helps other bees find new food sources.)
</P>
<P>
   To finance his tour, a cross-country trek in a 40-foot-long bus,
Kaplan received backing from Sallie Mae, the student-loan giant,
which has introduced a free financial aid Web site,
Wiredscholar.com. He also hired a publicity firm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the irrepressible Kaplan spent an hour in a
Borders bookstore cafe in Mount Kisco, N.Y., bouncing around a
stage discussing his book.
</P>
<P>
   Mondays usually yield tiny audiences at signings. But Kaplan's
talk drew 35 people, who sat crowded at little tables. The book has
12 chapters, with titles like ``Acing the Interview'' and ``Show Me
the Money'' and includes samples of winning scholarship essays as
well as a listing of scholarships. But Kaplan says the most
important factor is to be willing to work hard, whether in shaping
a letter or preparing book shipments with foam filler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen King, Michael Crichton and John Grisham are all great
authors,'' he said. ``But I can pack books in peanuts better than
anyone.''

SPURRING RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO WORK TOGETHER FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``with'' to ``without'' at end of 2nd-last graf.) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conversion is an individual experience, but those who have
undergone it share in a basic story of how something unexpected
worked a great change in their lives, either on the spot or over
time.
</P>
<P>
   For William E. Swing, the bishop of California of the Episcopal
Church, it started with a telephone call in 1993 from a U.N.
official, an incident that led him into the highly ambitious
mission of trying to create a global organization in which
religious groups might work together for peace.
</P>
<P>
   His caller, the bishop said, merely wanted his help in arranging
an interfaith service for U.N. delegates at Grace Cathedral, the
elegant neo-Gothic building atop San Francisco's Nob Hill. It was
1995, and the event was to commemorate the United Nations' 50th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But the request got him thinking. Hours later, Swing lay in bed
reflecting on the fact that while nations had a forum to discuss
cooperation, religious faiths had no such thing. ``There were 40
wars going on in the world that night,'' Swing said in an
interview, ``most of them fueled _ not caused, but fueled _ by
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   When he rose the next morning, Swing said, he decided he would
dedicate himself to trying to create such a forum. ``It was a
conversion, absolutely,'' he said. ``It was a conversion to how
we're going to have to live together.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, his project is called the United Religions
Initiative. It is a work in progress, but recently passed a
symbolic milestone, bringing together 300 people from around the
world who have become involved in the project to sign its charter.
</P>
<P>
   The document pledges participants to building bridges among
faith groups, respecting one another's religious differences,
organizing and making decisions locally, and agreeing that no one
in the effort will be subjected to religious proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   The signing ceremony, in June, was the first in an unusual
series of events that have cast a spotlight on how people in
different faiths are to relate to one another, an ever more
pressing issue in a world made smaller by advances in mass
communications.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 10,000 Protestant evangelists met in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, under the auspices of the Rev. Billy Graham's
organization and issued a declaration that while evangelists must
be respectful of other believers, they are obliged to share the
Gospel so that those others may hear and convert.
</P>
<P>
   In September the Vatican released its own statement, saying that
the Christian message, of salvation coming only through Jesus, is
most fully expressed in the Roman Catholic Church, so Catholic
participation in interfaith discussions should consider conversion
its ultimate aim.
</P>
<P>
   On a different note, hundreds of men and women from religious
groups worldwide met in New York in late August and pledged to work
for peace, reducing poverty and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody,'' said Swing, ``is wrestling at some level with the
same question.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The idea of having a global forum for religious groups has been
around for a century but has come up against major complicating
factors _ questions of authority, of how to deal with conflicting
ideas about ultimate truth, and of what to do about proselytism.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Swing traveled around the world, seeking ideas
on how to proceed from leaders in Christianity, Judaism, Islam,
Hinduism and Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice, he said, came from the Swiss Catholic
theologian Hans Kueng, who pressed him to define his objectives
more clearly and also warned him against focusing on the people at
the top. The heads of organizations would go to a conference, give
a speech and then depart with their entourages _ leaving Swing with
what, Kueng asked.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the bishop and his fellow organizers have focused on
enlisting people at the local level, involving women as well as
men, and being open to those from tribal groups and broad spiritual
perspectives, not just the major faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The result is decentralized, about 100 of what Swing calls
``cooperation circles,'' autonomous, interfaith groups around the
globe. During a 72-hour period that overlapped Jan. 1, 2000, these
groups prayed, marched or ran social-service projects. The next
step, he said, was to create a ``global council'' to support them,
by June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, 64, who is married with two adult children, has
presided since 1979 over a jurisdiction in the Episcopal Church
that encompasses five counties around San Francisco Bay, from Napa
Valley to Silicon Valley, a region of vast economic, ethnic and
religious diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he spoke again of his meeting with Kueng, whom
he paraphrased as saying there would never be peace among nations
without peace among religions, and there would be no peace among
religions without dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets that,'' Swing said. ``When I give a talk, in
any city, to any age group, they always get that.''

WANTED: NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a striking illustration of the eroding interest in
police careers, New York City has fallen far short of finding
enough recruits to fill its next Police Academy class, which is
scheduled to begin training in just a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters will continue to try to find candidates right up to
Sept. 29, when the new class is scheduled to be hired. But as of
Friday, the city expected to enlist only about 1,300 new officers,
not the 1,589 it had planned on adding to the force, according to
police officials who have been told of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said it was the first time in memory that the
Police Department had been unable to fill openings for what has
long been considered a secure, respected job, with decent pay and
good benefits. In recent years, however, the luster of the job has
dulled as public criticism of officers has risen and the pay scale
has stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has flagged despite unprecedented spending on
advertising _ $20 million in the last two years _ to attract new
candidates. Police union officials predict that if current
conditions persist, the force will inevitably shrink. Indeed,
police managers are concerned enough to be reviewing a host of
measures to lure applicants, like allowing rookies more time to
earn the 60 college credits required for the job, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a police spokesman said it was premature to discuss the size
of the incoming class or any steps that might be taken to address
the recruiting issue. ``While the process is going on, the
department does not comment on personnel decisions,'' said Thomas
Antenen, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   New York is far from alone in its difficulty in finding new
officers. Los Angeles, Chicago and Phoenix are among the dozens of
American cities where police agencies have struggled in recent
years to compete for candidates with a booming private economy that
often offers safer, better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem in New York has grown particularly acute. The
city is already facing a possible wave of retirements in the next
five years when 10,000 veteran officers will become eligible to
leave with full pensions. If a majority of those officers retire,
as many expect, it will be essential to fill recruiting classes
just to keep pace with attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't make this class,'' said John Driscoll, president
of the Captain's Endowment Association, the union representing many
supervisory officers, ``and we have no one signing up to take the
tests, we will eventually reach a point where we will have no one
to make up the shortages and the department will have to shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, there is little danger New York will find
itself with too few police officers. The 40,000-member force is
already the largest in city history, with roughly 8,000 more
officers than a decade ago. On a per capita basis, the department
has 54 officers for every 10,000 residents, more than any other
large American municipality, according to the city's Independent
Budget Office. In fact, when the new class of rookies hits the
streets after seven months of academy training, the force will grow
to 41,000 officers at a time when the city is enjoying the lowest
crime levels in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the long-term prospects for police recruiters do appear
daunting. For five years, the number of people signing up to take
the police exam has been dropping. While 31,986 applicants signed
up for the test in 1996, only 8,381 applied for the test last May.
The next test, to be given in November, has drawn a meager 1,896
candidates, with only two weeks left in the application period. If
history holds, as many as one-third of those who sign up for the
test will not show up when it is given.
</P>
<P>
   Given their predicament, police officials have not been pleased
with an $800,000 ad campaign sponsored by the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association that has juxtaposed a graphic picture of a
fallen officer with the message that officers are paid far too
little. Currently, police officers in the city with five years on
the job earn $54,000, a salary that lags behind that paid by Nassau
and Suffolk Counties, where officers with equivalent experience
earn $76,000 and $78,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not create this problem,'' said the union's president,
Patrick J. Lynch. ``But we are giving them a solution and the
solution is to pay police officers a livable wage.''

 &HT;    Denzel Washington talks of `Titans,' Oscar, time in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than two months last fall, Denzel Washington had a
problem with being stuck in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that rich food,'' the Oscar-winning actor says with a
laugh. ``I sort of gained weight.''
</P>
<P>
   He chowed down more than a few times at the Palm restaurant in
the Swissotel. ``I was what you'd call a regular,'' he says. He
also ``just had to go to Puffy's place.'' That meant devouring the
Caribbean and soul food at Sean ``Puffy'' Combs' upscale Atlanta
restaurant, Justin's.
</P>
<P>
   Washington spent most of the last few months of 1999 in metro
Atlanta and North Georgia, filming Disney's PG-rated high school
football flick ``Remember the Titans.'' Locations included
Covington, Clarkston High School's practice field, Druid Hills High
in DeKalb County, Grady High in Atlanta and Berry College in Rome,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Washington plays Herman Boone, the real-life coach of a Virginia
high school football team that, during integration in the early
1970s, overcame racial strife to win the AAA state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Boone teamed up with Bill Yoast (portrayed in ``Titans'' by Will
Patton), a former coach at Roswell High School here, to challenge
their players not only to master football but to learn more about
each other's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real audience-participation movie,'' Washington says in
a recent phone call from New York, where he's promoting ``Titans.''
``But it's about more than just football. It's about kids and
adults of different races learning to work with and respect each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor also talked about meeting Coach Boone, losing out on
the Oscar many expected him to win this year for ``The Hurricane,''
and working with Anne Heche in Toronto, where they're filming
``John Q,'' the story of a father who takes over an emergency room
to force a heart transplant for his young son.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell us a little about getting the ``Titans'' script
and deciding to do the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wasn't ready to do another film about a real person. I had
``The Hurricane.'' But it was Jerry Bruckheimer who brought it to
me. I had worked with him on ``Crimson Tide.'' He knows how to make
movies that people like. So I said, ``Let me give it a read.'' And
I read it and thought, ``Hmmmmm. Interesting story. Interesting
character.'' What really nailed it for me was meeting Coach Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And how did that go?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was great. He's a really engaging and interesting person.
He was very tough and has his own opinion about things. He's a
determined fellow. Of course, he's mellowed a bit since the '70s.
His wife told me he's about a third as feisty as he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you adopt his physical style, or were you looking to
illustrate his psyche?
</P>
<P>
   A: I told him basically that I wasn't going to try to do that
entire-person thing but get a sense of his spirit and coaching
style. I wasn't trying to do his imitation. It can't be like
Malcolm X. Nobody out there knows what Boone looks like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about your own coaching life? You've got four kids.
</P>
<P>
   A: I've coached it all. Football. Basketball. T-ball. My oldest
son (John David) is 15, and I've coached him all along. He now
coaches his younger brother in flag football. I've coached my
daughter's basketball team. All that made it a lot easier in doing
``Titans.'' But my strength is more as a motivator. I'm not an
X's-and-O's guy. My whole thing is teaching good sportsmanship and
fair play and working hard as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is your older son a better athlete than you were at his age?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only time will tell. He's getting there. He'll have to score
six touchdowns in one game first. But he works at it a whole lot
harder than I did. You know, lifting weights and things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You spent 15 months training to play boxer Rubin Carter in
``The Hurricane.'' Do you still box?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. It's a good workout. But I had to do rehabilitation on
my shoulder after that training. I'm not sparring. That's where
you're trying to give each other concussions. It gave me headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anne Heche went through her breakup with Ellen DeGeneres just
before coming to Toronto to work with you on ``John Q.'' What is
working with Heche like?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's very good and quite professional. I had heard about all
that stuff going on in her life. She didn't bring any of that to
the set. She's a very fine actress, and I can tell you she's a very
fine person.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you do after the Oscars this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: I went home. But first I stole a plate of shrimp from the
Governor's Ball. Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You know, many people thought you deserved to win for ``The
Hurricane'' and were quite angry when you didn't. What did your
wife, Pauletta, say after the best actor award went to Kevin
Spacey?
</P>
<P>
   A: She was more surprised than I was. You know, I was around
town then, and I got a sense a few weeks before about how things
were going. I said, ``They are not going to give it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You know, Norman Jewison (director of ``Hurricane'') is very
passionate, and he blames the whole Miramax vs. DreamWorks feud.
All those millions they spend to campaign in a Weinstein-Spielberg
fistfight each year.
</P>
<P>
   A: Each year it looks like more and more money is being spent on
campaigns. I don't want to say that's the reason why I didn't get
one this year. But from now on, you're going to see more and more
pressure to spend more money on Oscar campaigns. I'm just content
with what my mama says: ``Man gives the award. God gives the
reward.''

PROFESSIONALS PLAY THE STOCK MANIPULATION GAME, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: subs 2nd graf to correct impression that Lebed was
arrested.) 
 For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody does it.
</P>
<P>
   That was Jonathan G. Lebed's response to securities regulators
last week after they said he had run a stock manipulation scheme as
an extracurricular activity. Regulators said Jonathan, a
15-year-old high school student in Cedar Grove, N.J., was
incredulous when told that he had done wrong touting nine
companies' stocks on the Internet and making $273,000 doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Between August 1999 and last February, regulators said, Lebed
bought thinly traded stocks, then promoted them in hundreds of
breathless e-mail messages sent to investing chat rooms. As other
investors bought, he sold, in a classic pump and dump scheme,
Securities and Exchange Commission officials said. It was the first
time the commission had sued a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed, neither admitting nor denying the allegations, agreed to
pay back what he had earned in the scheme, plus $12,000 in
interest. No fines or penalties were levied. Yet, in an interview
Wednesday when news of the settlement came out, Lebed's father
waved away the incident's seriousness with the words, ``So they
pick on a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan was definitely wrong to do what he did, and the SEC was
right to pursue him. But he and his father are surely right to feel
miffed. Everybody does do it. Manipulation of stocks is the name of
the game today.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Lebed's scheme was cruder than most. His e-mail
messages were short on facts and long on hype, as evanescent as the
medium on which they were transmitted. For example, a $2 stock
would be worth $20 ``very soon,'' Lebed wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebed is right to wonder exactly how his game differs from
those played by Wall Street equity analysts who place absurd
``price targets'' on stocks. Sure, Wall Street analysts have
degrees in finance, while Lebed as yet does not, and they
themselves may not be selling into the buying frenzy their calls
create. But if their firms benefit by underwriting stock offerings
that are sold to investors on the strength of rising share prices
that their ``targets'' have helped to propel, the analysts are
enriched with bigger bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   And how, precisely, do Lebed's activities differ from the
gunning of stocks by big investors at the end of each day or each
quarter, a practice widely known as window-dressing, to make their
performance look better and attract more investors?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, what about the accounting games that corporate
managements play to keep their stocks aloft? Lebed's alleged
manipulations involved misleading statements. Many of today's most
popular accounting tricks mislead too: For example, so-called pro
forma numbers that reflect only what companies want investors to
see, rather than the entire picture.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors can be misled only if they allow it. And as
long as stocks were skyrocketing, investors seemed happy to close
their eyes to manipulative practices on Wall Street or in corporate
boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are no longer rising, however. All three major indexes
are down for the year. So perhaps investors will begin to take
their blinders off.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they won't. But to a 20-year veteran of the Wall Street
scene, it comes as no surprise that Lebed thought he had done
nothing wrong in his scheme. The teen-ager's coming of age occurred
in a period of stock market mania, when hyping stocks was de
rigueur and when ridicule was showered on those who pointed out the
warts on a company's operations. Lebed is unaware that once upon a
time, Wall Street analysts occasionally uttered cautious views on
shares and did in-depth work to assess a stock's worth. And the
teen-age trader was not yet born when accounting standards were
dutifully followed, not flouted, by corporations. Finally, Lebed is
simply too young to remember the days when investor disbelief was
not in a state of permanent suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Lebed is not to be pitied. But neither is he to
be scorned. He is not just a symptom of our society's addiction to
ever-rising stock prices, he is a creation of it.

   NOT ENOUGH PUFF: Apparently Sean ``Puffy'' Combs' new
partnership with urban entertainment portal hookt.com was formed
before the artist, producer, record label president and king of
hype could fully stock it with Puffness. While the face of his new
artist Shyne greets you on the home page of this site (which
debuted in December), you can't get an advance listen to the
thick-tongued rapper's debut. In fact, you won't even be able to
purchase it from its exclusive e-tailer by its Tuesday release
date. The music link won't be complete until Oct. 15, says CEO
Peter Griffith. And the games and movies links? Under construction,
too. The only place you could find any Puffy-related merchandise
was at the link marked Gear, where there was one Sean John denim
jacket ($74) in the outerwear category, one nylon pant ($122) and
nylon V-neck ($112) in the activewear category, and a whopping two
pairs of pants offered _ cotton ($88) and faux suede ($180). One
color only. _Sonia Murray

   CLASSICAL GAS: Lebrecht.Live takes a familiar idea and gives it
a highbrow twist: an Internet chat show devoted to classical music,
modeled on loud-mouthed sports-talk radio. Its host and driving
force is British journalist, author and muckraker Norman Lebrecht,
who covers the international business of classical music in
adrenalin-pumped, sky-is-falling tones. Talking heads from both
sides of the Atlantic participate, fans get to spout off, and all
the world's cultural problems get solved in a half-hour every other
Wednesday at 2 p.m. (It debuted Sept. 13; next show this week.)

   In September 1994, Susan Farrell, then a graduate student and
research faculty member at Georgia Tech, put a handful of
photographs of graffiti on the Net. She had taken the pictures in
Atlanta and Prague, Czech Republic, as a hobby. Thus began
Artcrimes.com, your worldwide headquarters for images of (and
information and Web links about) this notorious art form. The site
offers access to 3,000 pics from 205 cities _ Atlanta is
well-represented, especially on a wild page called ``Atlanta's
Little Horrors'' _ and an index of artists, from the Aerosol
Warriors to Zombie. ``Art Crimes was one of the very first art
sites on the Internet, and it remains one of the Net's favorites,''
says Farrell. ``We enjoy more than 10,000 visitors per day now.''

 &HT;    Relax amid history along state's `First Coast'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In search of the Fountain of Youth, Spanish explorer and
treasure hunter Ponce de Leon landed on the northeast Florida coast
somewhere in the vicinity of St. Augustine in 1513 _ the Sunshine
State's first tourist.
</P>
<P>
   He really started something.
</P>
<P>
   While we've pretty much given up the notion of an age-defying
wellspring _ and we've come to realize that Florida's real riches
are found in nature _ the strand known as the First Coast continues
to draw vacationers to its beaches, golf courses, historic sites
and natural attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Come along on a whirlwind tour to Amelia Island, St. Augustine,
Ponte Vedra Beach and Jacksonville _ places that have invited
exploration since the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   AMELIA ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Some still come to the First Coast looking for treasure. This
turn-of-the-century fishing village in Florida's northernmost
corner is a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to check out the shops downtown,'' says Stephanie
Hudkins, dashing off with her friend Lanie Joseph after breakfast
at the Florida House Inn on Fernandina Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The twentysomethings, both employees at Borders Books and Music
in Tampa, were enjoying a long weekend getaway. Besides scoping out
Fernandina's tree-shaded and shop-lined Centre Street, they were
planning some beach time _ if the rain stopped _ and a trip to an
outlet mall they'd seen advertised on the way in.
</P>
<P>
   The laid-back island offers a variety of accommodations,
including several fine bed-and-breakfast inns in the 50-block
Victorian-era National Historic District and on the beach in
Fernandina, rental houses and motels along the 13 miles of
coastline, and the upscale Amelia Island Plantation, the Summer
Beach Resort and the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island. Also, a Hampton
Inn and Suites that opened on the harborfront in Fernandina earlier
this year was designed to evoke the historic buildings of Centre
Street a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a brochure for the walking or driving tour of the
historic district at the Chamber of Commerce in the 1899 Depot just
across the railroad tracks from the docks. Along the way, you'll
see such buildings as the 1878 Palace Saloon, Florida's oldest
saloon in the same location, and the 1891 Trinity United Methodist
Church. You can also see many of these sites during a horse-drawn
carriage ride with Old Towne Carriage Company, which operates from
the waterfront at the end of Centre Street.
</P>
<P>
   While Centre Street and its varied shops are worth prowling, be
sure to wander down to the marina (Brett's Waterway Cafe offers a
nice view) and visit the Amelia Island Museum of History downtown
and Fort Clinch at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Amelia Island Museum of History: Here's where you'll learn
about the eight flags that have flown over the island, whose first
visitor was Frenchman Jean Ribault in 1562. The eight banners are
the French, Spanish, English, the Patriots of Amelia Island (for
one day only), Green Cross of Florida, the Mexican rebel flag, the
Confederate and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1986, the museum is housed in the 1875 Nassau County
Jail. The tour, led by volunteer Jim Snyder, provides a lot of
background to help you assemble the puzzle of history as you
continue down the First Coast. You'll learn that the Timucua
Indians succumbed to diseases brought to these shores by European
settlers. You'll also learn about Amelia Island's Golden Age in the
1880s and why the town claims to be the birthplace of the modern
shrimping industry. The museum also has displays of objects
unearthed in archaeological digs and undersea salvage operations.
Guided tours are offered at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays.
(Centre Street tours are at 3 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, departing
from the Depot.) 233 S. Third St., 904-261-7378.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fort Clinch State Park: The well-preserved masonry fort, begun
in 1847 by the federal government and deactivated 20 years later
with construction still incomplete, is the centerpiece of the park,
which offers nature trails, camping and beach access. Occupied by
Confederate forces in 1861, it was taken by Union troops a year
later. Today, the fort appears as it did in 1864. Park rangers in
Union uniforms perform the daily chores of garrison soldiers. The
1,121-acre park, on a peninsula surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean,
Cumberland Sound and the Amelia River, is maintained to appear as
it did when the first European settlers arrived; the plant and
animal life is strictly protected. The visitors' center features
exhibits about the fort. Garrison weekends are staged on the first
full weekend of each month, with candlelight viewing on those
evenings. Upcoming events: Confederate garrison weekend, Oct.
28-29; Union Thanksgiving encampment, Nov. 25-26; and Confederate
Christmas garrison weekend, Dec. 9-10. 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. $3.25
per car (up to eight people); $1 extra to visit the fort ($2 during
special events). 904-277-7274.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kingsley Plantation: Before crossing the St. Johns River and
continuing southward on A1A, take a three-mile detour through the
moss-draped live oaks and palms to visit Scottish-born planter
Zephaniah Kingsley's plantation overlooking the Fort George River.
Kingsley moved to the island in 1814 with his wife and three
children (a fourth child was born on the island). What is
remarkable is that his wife, Anna Madgigine Jai, was born in
Senegal, West Africa, and purchased by Kingsley as a slave. Having
been freed by Kingsley in 1811, she helped manage the plantation,
which produced Sea Island cotton, citrus, sugar cane and corn with
an enslaved work force. Located on the 40,000-acre Timucuan
Ecological and Historic Preserve, the circa 1798 plantation house
and its detached kitchen, barn and stables and 23 tabby slave
houses are operated by the National Park Service. The Kingsley
Heritage Celebration on Oct. 7-8 will feature costumed craft
demonstrators, and interpreters will re-enact activities of the
plantation period. Among the activities are performances by the
McIntosh County Shouters and the Georgia Sea Island Singers and a
presentation by Kingsley descendants MaVyne Betsch and Peri Frances
Betsch. Free. 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. 904-251-3537.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  St. Johns River Ferry: From Fort George Island, there is daily
service to Mayport Village on the ferry named for Jean Ribault on
the quarter after and quarter before the hour from about 6 a.m.,
with the last depature at 10:15 p.m. (From Mayport to Fort George,
departures are on the hour and half-hour.) $2.75 per car.
904-241-9969, Ext. 13.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Florida House Inn: The eight flags that have flown over Amelia
Island wave from the veranda of this homey 1857 inn, painted green
with accents of white and deep plum. A photograph in one of the
scrapbooks in the parlor shows the ramshackle inn that Karen and
Bob Warner purchased in 1990. The original 25 rooms with no indoor
plumbing became nine rooms and two suites, all with private
bathrooms. In the original part of the house, the rooms are
decorated with antiques and quilts; the larger rooms in the new
wing sport the lodge look and Jacuzzi tubs. An English-style pub
with fireplace provides a cozy gathering place for drinks and a
game of darts. The dining room, decorated with a poultry motif,
serves family-style lunches and dinners, with fried chicken and
lots more. Guests are served a full breakfast in the sunny
breakfast room. A lush courtyard with fountain has been developed
in the back. Rates are $69-$169, double occupancy. 20 and 22 S.
Third St. 1-800-258-3301.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Who's on Fourth: Poring over menus of local restaurants at the
Florida House Inn, I found myself in a quandary. Would it be
Mayport Scamp Grouper with macadamia nut crust and curried citrus
cream and mango chili salsa ($20.50) at the Beech Street Grill?
Almond and Pepper Crusted Tilapa with mimosa sauce and mango-jimaca
slaw ($19.95) at Joe's Second Street Bistro? Or Crisp Sweet Diver
Scallops with bacon-speckled risotto, fried leeks and lemon saffron
broth ($19) at Who's on Fourth? What a delicious decision. The
scallops won. We also tried the sesame seared swordfish with Thai
chili sauce with coconut curried rice, snow peas and shiitake
mushrooms ($19). This newcomer on the dining scene has a classical
guitarist playing nightly on the screened porch. 22 S. Fourth St.
Open 5:30 p.m. Tuesdays-Sundays. 904-261-7700.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  La Bodega: A great little lunch spot across from the Florida
House Inn. Dine inside or in the courtyard. Recommended are the
grouper sandwich, grilled or blackened, with lime-cilantro
mayonnaise ($6.95) and the garlic pork sandwich ($6.95). Dinner
served Thursdays-Saturdays. 19 S. Third St. 904-321-1922.

   JACKSONVILLE
</P>
<P>
   Cowford has come a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in 1763, at a narrow spot where cattle crossed the St.
Johns River at King's Road, an English-style village called Cowford
was established.
</P>
<P>
   In 1822, the village's settlers founded a town and named it for
Andrew Jackson, the first governor of the Florida Territory and a
future president. When Florida gained statehood in 1845,
Jacksonville was already an important port for the cotton and
timber trade.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid- to late 19th century, it was a bustling city.
Railroads and steamboats brought visitors seeking sunny climes.
Tourism boomed. In 1888, Jacksonville hosted the Florida
Sub-Tropical Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the fire. On May 3, 1901, a blaze started by a chimney
spark landing on Spanish moss drying outside a fiber factory
destroyed downtown Jacksonville. The toll: seven lives, 2,368
buildings and $15 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding began the next day _ and it hasn't stopped since, as
hotels and office high-rises continue to sprout along the river.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the ``River City by the Sea,'' as the tourism
folks like to call it, has positioned itself to become a first-tier
city. The once-polluted St. Johns River is a source of pride. The
rusty-orange-roofed Jacksonville Landing, a Rouse-developed
festival marketplace similar to Baltimore's Harborplace, anchors
the Northbank Riverwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, on the 1.2-mile Southbank Riverwalk, are the
Museum of Science and History, the Jacksonville Maritime Museum,
the River City Brewing Co. and the Chart House restaurant, designed
to resemble Captain Nemo's submarine in ``20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Two water taxi services zigzag back and forth. On football game
days, you can even hop a ride to the stadium from your favorite
riverfront watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   The old Gator Bowl has been completely retooled and is now
Alltel Stadium, home of the Jacksonville Jaguars, the NFL team the
city landed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As we motor across the St. Johns in a water taxi, attendant Bill
Ziriak points out landmarks: ``That's Maxwell House, as you can
tell,'' he says as the aroma of coffee wafts over the river. ``And
that's the new Adams Mark Hotel going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he directs our attention to the attractive Duval County
Jail, on prime real estate on the north side of the river, not far
from the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's too good for our prisoners,'' says Ziriak.
``Waterfront property.''
</P>
<P>
   It figures. Jacksonville isn't about to be outdone, even when it
comes to its pokey.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens: Landscape artist Thomas
Moran's monumental painting ``Ponce de Leon in Florida'' may not be
the most important piece of art in the museum's impressive
collection, but it certainly has the most interesting story. Museum
docent Rachael Gabbert calls it ``the painting that couldn't be
given away.'' The 1878 work is a romanticized depiction of the
Spanish explorer's arrival among indigenous people in the dense
forest along the St. Johns River. Moran wanted to give the painting
to the U.S. House of Representatives, to hang behind the speaker of
the House. Thanks, but no thanks. He managed to sell it at auction
for $2,500 in 1886. Later it was owned by Henry Flagler, who
displayed it at the Ponce de Leon Hotel in St. Augustine. Through
the years the painting was sold and resold, and in 1972 it ended up
in the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Tulsa, Okla. In 1996, the
Cummer acquired the work, whose value may be close to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other significant works in the museum include the 4,000-year-old
Stela of Iku and Mer-imat, an Egyptian tombstone; gold Etruscan
earrings from the fourth or third century B.C.; a 1598 marble bust
of France's Cardinal Richelieu by Giovanni Bernini; ``The
Lamentation of Christ,'' a 1605 painting on copper by Peter Paul
Rubens; and 750 pieces of rare Meissen china. Be sure to stroll the
Italian and English gardens along the St. Johns River. 829

Whales, Dolphins and Manatees of Northeast Florida,'' and a new
exhibit on the Jacksonville Jaguars if you're so inclined. But if
you want to immerse yourself in First Coast history, head for the
second floor to see ``Currents of Time: A History of Jacksonville
and Northeast Florida,'' which provides an enlightening
walk-through history of the area from the Timucuans to the Jaguars.
The well-conceived exhibit _ divided into 10 eras _ uses artifacts,
period furnishings, costumed mannequins, ambient sounds, murals and
architectural facades to tell a story that dates back to 10,000
B.C. Baby boomers will love the 1950s house, which may remind them
of their childhoods (remember when TVs had rabbit-ear antennas?).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes overlooked is that during World War II, Jacksonville
was a major military center, with the Jacksonville Naval Air
Station and the U.S. Army's Camp Blanding, which was a prisoner of
war camp. But perhaps the most surprising bit of trivia: The first
Technicolor movie ever made was ``The Gulf Between,'' shot in Jax
in 1917, when the city experienced a heyday of filmmaking that
outpaced Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ribbon of Life: The Story of the St. Johns River,'' a
timeline on a curved panel on the second floor, provides insight
into the river that runs through Jacksonville. It's one of the few
major rivers in the world that flows north.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also has a special children's area, called Kidspace;
an exhibit on the Maple Leaf, a Union steamship sunk by a mine in
the St. Johns in 1864; the Living Room, featuring live animals of
the region; and a planetarium. 1025 Museum Circle (on the
Southbank), 904-396-7062.

   &QR;  Plantation-Manor Inn: It's hard to imagine that, a decade ago,
this 1905 Greek Revival home two blocks from the river in the
Riverside-Avondale neighborhood was condemned. Jerry and Kathy Ray
bought it in 1991 and set about restoring it, including replacing
the grand Doric columns. Today, it's listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. Antique furnishings and Oriental
carpets fill the mansion, which includes the original pine floors
and cypress woodwork. The romantic decor is a Laura Ashley vision,
with lots of English rose fabric. Guests are welcome to relax in
the private courtyard garden, where there is a lap pool. A nice
touch: A refrigerator is always filled with complimentary beer and
soft drinks. For breakfast, the choice is yours: fresh fruit,
pastries, eggs, grits, bacon, sausage, pancakes or whatever else
the Rays have cooked up. Rates are $145-$175, double occupancy;
single rates also available. 904-384-4630,
www.plantationmanorinn.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other lodging: Nearby is the House of Cherry Street. The
Colonial-style home was built in 1912 and moved to its present
location overlooking the St. Johns in 1919. 1844 Cherry St.,
904-384-1999.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gene's Seafood Restaurant: Gene's Incredible Combo for Two
($20.95) was a platter heaped with fried grouper, shrimp, scallops,
oysters and clams. A side plate comes with a deviled crab, hush
puppies and your choice of potato. Slaw starts it off. The only
disappointment: the Key lime pie ($2.25). 4000 St. John's Ave. (in
the Avondale neighborhood).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  River City Brewing Co.: Located on the Southbank Riverwalk,
this white-tablecloth microbrewery and restaurant has a great view
of Jacksonville Landing and the downtown high-rises. We lunched on
crab cakes atop mango salsa and fried spinach, Thai chicken salad
and coconut shrimp with brandy-Dijon mustard dipping sauce ($7.75
each), with pints of Jackson Pale Ale and Riptide Porter ($3). Open
for lunch and dinner. 835 Museum Circle. 904-398-2299.

   PONTE VEDRA BEACH
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a golfer or tennis player to appreciate
this fashionable playground of the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   You can simply be a sybarite looking for a bit of the good life.
We found it at the Ponte Vedra Inn &AMP; Club, where we spent one brief
but memorable night.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the only place to stay in town. There's the inn's
sister resort, the Ponte Vedra Lodge &AMP; Club a mile down the beach,
the Marriott Sawgrass Resort and the more affordable Country Inn
and Suites inland _ all excellent accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Inn &AMP; Club bears the pedigree. It has defined grandeur
since 1928 and raised the bar through the years with ongoing
enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   The best is yet to come: A four-story main inn with an old
Florida architectural scheme, including an airy two-story lobby
with exposed cypress wood and 20 upscale rooms, will be complete by
next spring. While the 300-acre resort isn't exactly a hard-hat
zone, there'll be plenty of construction afoot for the next year or
so as the gym is renovated, the spa is expanded and guest rooms are
added at Island House, one of the resort's guesthouses.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Golf: Ponte Vedra's 135 professional golf holes inspire the
nickname ``the Pebble Beach of the East Coast.'' After all, the
Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass _ the first of 17 TPCs _ is
here. The Sawgrass Stadium Course, designed by Pete Dye and ranked
seventh among ``America's Best Resort Courses'' by Golf Digest
magazine, is recognized worldwide for its island par-three 17th
hole (904-273-3233, www.playatpc). The Players Championship held at
TPC Sawgrass in March is one of the PGA's most prestigious events.
A more affordable (but still not inexpensive) option is TPC
Sawgrass' Valley Course (904-273-3233). Rates vary through the
year, but, for example, a Sawgrass guest pays $252 in season and
$127 off season per round at the Stadium Course (October to January
is ``shoulder season,'' when rates fall somewhere in between); at
the Valley Course, it's $142 in season, $97 off. Other courses
include Marsh Landing Country Club (904-285-6514), Oak Bridge Club
at Sawgrass (904-285-0204) and the Sawgrass Course t Sawgrass
Country Club (904-285-2261).

<P>
   &QR;  Shopping: The upscale Sawgrass Village Shopping Center offers
two dozen specialty shops and restaurants. A1A, four miles south of
J.T. Butler Boulevard, 904-285-6620.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ponte Vedra Inn &AMP; Club: A typical day at this Mobil four-star,
AAA four-diamond resort starts with indoor cycling at the gym,
followed by a tennis clinic at the Racquet Club, a golf clinic at
the golf pro shop at the Ocean Course, and exercise classes. Dinner
in the Seafoam Room and dancing in the Seahorse Lounge cap the day.
Perhaps you wish to indulge yourself in the spa _ why not go for
the ``Day of Pampering'' package at $295? Or just loll by one of
the four swimming pools. Go ahead _ you've paid dearly for the
privilege. Rates are $235-$335 per room per night through November;
several multinight packages are also available. Our beachfront room
in the Atlantic House had two queen beds, a large bathroom and a
sitting area. The room was decorated in light woods, marble, glass
and wrought iron, with a soothing color palette of seafoam green,
pink coral and yellow. 200 Ponte Vedra Blvd., Ponte Vedra Beach.

   ST. AUGUSTINE
</P>
<P>
   ``Oldest'' is the key word in this city that dates to 1565, when
Pedro de Menendez de Aviles planted the flag of Spain and launched
a thriving colony. There's the Oldest House, the Oldest Wooden
Schoolhouse and the Oldest Store Museum.
</P>
<P>
   You want old? Then visit the Old Senator, the oldest city's
oldest resident. It's a massive, 600-year-old live oak enshrined in
the Howard Johnson's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to see the Old City is on a seven-mile sightseeing
train tour. You can get off and on at more than 20 stops along the
loop, and tickets are good for three consecutive days. Sure, it's
touristy _ but what are you here for? At $12 for adults and $5 for
children 6-12, it's an inexpensive if not speedy way to get around
(one loop takes about an hour).
</P>
<P>
   The must-see attractions for first-time tourists are the
Castillo de San Marcos (built in the late 1600s), the Fountain of
Youth Archaeological Park and _ no kidding _ the Ripley's Believe
It or Not Museum (the original one) in the historic Castle Warden.
Just for fun, check out Potter's Wax Museum, where wax sculptor
Peter Carsillo was recently working on Britney Spears. (I saw her
smiling head in the window of his workshop facing King Street.)
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally speaking, one of the prettiest corners in the
city is the intersection of King and Cordova streets. Here stands a
trio of Spanish-influenced structures built in the late 19th
century: financier and railroad builder Henry Flagler's Ponce de
Leon Hotel (now Flagler College) and Alcazar Hotel (now the
Lightner Museum), along with Franklin W. Smith's Casa Monica, which
Flagler bought just months after it opened and renamed the Hotel
Cordova. The Casa Monica is back as the city's finest hotel after
extensive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   A block south of the Casa Monica is the newest attraction in the
Ancient City. Coming in November is Old St. Augustine Village, a
city block encompassing nine historic houses dating from the 1700s,
10 exhibition galleries, historic gardens and courtyards. Costumed
interpreters will bring the past alive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Spanish Quarter Village on St. George Street,
interpreter Charlie Bremer, who has been on the job a little over
three weeks, explains why he left Orlando to come to work in St.
Augustine after visiting for 20 years. ``There's something about
this town,'' he says. ``It just called me the first time I saw
it.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spanish Quarter Village: In a wood-fenced enclave off busy St.
George Street, a pedestrian walk jammed with tourists poking
through dozens of shops, is a world three centuries old. Even on a
rainy Saturday afternoon, visitors with umbrellas trudged through
puddles to see the 18th-century military garrison community that
includes one original house and other homes and buildings
reconstructed on their original foundations, along with gardens,
blacksmith and woodworking shops, and a ``taberna'' (tavern).
</P>
<P>
   Formerly overseen by a state commission, the old village was
taken over by the city's Department of Historic Preservation &AMP;
Heritage Tourism about three years ago, and ongoing improvements
are being made to ensure an authentic experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're correcting things as we find them,'' Bremer says. ``We
are constantly trying to improve. Things are coming to light as we
do more research.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Usina Brown, whose Minorcan ancestors came to St.
Augustine from New Smyrna in 1777, leads a tour of the Casa de
Mesa, a rambling, two-story dwelling that began as two rooms.

operates the Victory III, an excursion boat on Matanzas Bay. 9

St. George St. 904-825-6830.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lightner Museum: The 1888 Hotel Alcazar is an elegant
repository for the wondrous objects in Otto C. Lightner's
collection of decorative arts and remarkable oddities. Give
yourself several hours to take it all in. Lightner, a Chicagoan who
founded Hobbies Magazine, opened the museum in 1948. Four floors
hold a vast array of antique furniture, china and porcelain, cut
glassware, oil paintings, marble statues, a Jurassic-era dinosaur
egg, an Egyptian mummy, stained glass from Tiffany's New York
studios and an 8-foot-tall malachite urn from the czar's winter
palace in St. Petersburg, which was first shown in the United
States at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The restored
ballroom overlooking the indoor swimming pool holds ornate relics
of the Gilded Age, including a desk once owned by Napoleon's
brother. On the first level is a Victorian streetscape with
storefronts displaying clothing, toys and dolls, cameras, quilts,
clocks, barber's equipment and such. Also interesting is the
collection of collections, from buttons to matchbox covers. Look
for a 12-foot grandfather clock with carvings depicting scenes from
the story of Dick Whittington and his cat dominates the copy. $6
adults; children under 12 free with paying adult. Cordova and King

   &QR;  Casa Monica: More than a century after it was built by
Franklin Smith, this sumptuous, Moorish-style hotel is once again
welcoming guests. Opened in January 1888, it was sold three months
later by Smith to his friend Henry Flagler, who renamed the hotel
the Cordova. By 1900 it had been converted to an apartment house,
and in the 1920s it became a low-budget hotel. In 1932 it closed
until the 1960s, when it housed the St. Johns County Courthouse.
Extensive restoration began in 1997, after it was bought by Orlando
developer Richard Kessler and became one of Kessler's Grand Theme
Hotels. The luxurious lobby includes a fountain, mahogany columns,
arched doorways with gold tie-back sheers, stenciled beams,
filigreed brass chandeliers, iron wall sconces, a rich brown
leather sofa and Spanish sculptures. Throughout the hotel, a navy,
gold and deep-red color scheme unifies the decor. Our low-end
``superior'' room, while well-appointed, was small with a poor
view; presumably the ``deluxe'' and ``premium'' rooms, promising
pool or city views, are more spacious. Rates are $169-$199. 95

($3.95), which I ordered with a Porpoise Point Pale Ale. We also
give thumbs-up to the Ragtime Shrimp Dinner ($11.50), which

frittata ($8) and shrimp and blue crab omelette topped with a

was worth it. Our selections included El Combo de Cuba, with roast
pork, eye of round and a beef-filled empanada served with black
beans, yellow rice and plantains ($9), as well as Empanada de
Cangrejo, a pastry stuffed with crab meat ($8.50) and sangria
served in a hand-painted Spanish pottery pitcher ($12.95). 98 St.

to Tallahassee. From the wooded bluffs overlooking Pensacola Bay,
the road wanders through picturesque burgs such as DeFuniak
Springs, with its Folk Victorian homes and spring-fed lake, and by
such eco-tourist attractions as Vortex Spring, where scuba
enthusiasts can book a cave diving trip.
</P>
<P>
   Other tours take travelers down the Tamiami Trail _ U.S. 41 from
Tampa to Miami _ and down Fla. A1A on the Atlantic coast from
Daytona Beach to Jensen Beach.

 &HT;    Learn those timeshare tradeoffs
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By David Beasley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can be hard to say no to a timeshare salesman.
</P>
<P>
   You are spending a weekend, gratis, at a resort, sometimes with
spending money or half-price Disney World or dinner theater tickets
thrown in to boot. There is an obligation to at least listen to the
presentation, and the salesmen have a quick retort for every reason
not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you afford to take a vacation every year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is less expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the salesmen probably never mention the inevitable day when
you try to sell the timeshare. Then you may find that your vacation
adventure has turned into a financial nightmare. You may feel
fortunate to even retrieve a fraction of the timeshare's original
value and perhaps relieved to be out from under the yearly
maintenance fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, however, is providing some relief. Online auctions
have provided strapped timeshare owners a new way to sell _ and a
place for buyers to get timeshares at fire-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   The timeshare concept took hold in the 1970s, and its lure has
always been based on this notion: Instead of buying an expensive
vacation condo that will likely remain unused for a large portion
of the year, why not just buy a piece of it for much less, say
around $10,000? That amount is low enough for some buyers to pay
cash outright, others to finance it on a credit card or obtain
financing through the developer, usually for terms of 10 years or
less.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the purchase price, which usually gives the buyer
the right to use the timeshare for one specific week, owners are
committed to paying annual maintenance fees, which cover upkeep and
taxes on the unit. This is usually several hundred dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when inflation was raging in
the double digits, timeshares were pitched as hedges against high
hotel room rates, which could eventually become unaffordable,
salesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, timeshares were lucrative for developers. A
$100,000 condo could be spliced into 52 pieces at $10,000 a week.
That has contributed to a glut of timeshares on the market, making
resales chronically difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But a major portion of the price of a timeshare, sometimes more
than 40 percent, is marketing cost _ the money spent by the
developer to send out mass mailings, pay for those free weekends,
spending money and reduced-price Disney tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Although some name-brand timeshares, such as those offered by
Walt Disney Co. and Marriott, hold much of their value and can sell
quickly, many timeshares fetch typically less than half the
original price at resale and can be very difficult to unload.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought your timeshare through a developer, it's almost
impossible'' to recoup all your money in a resale, says Bill
Rogers, founder of an organization for timeshare owners, the
Timeshare Users Group.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, timeshares can be so hard to get rid of, some people
are now donating them to charity. That way, they at least get a tax
writeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, timeshare owners have flocked to Internet
auc-tions to unload their weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of paying $446.90 a year in maintenance fees for a Hawaii
timeshare he no longer used, Dean Crist was recently prepared to
give it up to foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   He had considered listing the two-bedroom Kauai unit with a
company that specializes in selling timeshares. But the firm wanted
$500 in fees upfront, with no guarantee it would be sold.
</P>
<P>
   With foreclosure looming, Crist, a northern Wisconsin restaurant
owner, decided instead to sell the timeshare on eBay, an Internet
auction company.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, the emails and bids started pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 100 responses,'' Crist said. ``It just about got to the
point where I needed a secretary to answer them.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction ended with 58 bids, the highest at $4,200. That was
only about half of what Crist had paid for the timeshare nearly 20
years ago. But it was $4,200 more than he would have received had
the timeshare gone to foreclosure. And he is forever free of the
maintenance fee that he was required to pay whether he used the
timeshare or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I only got $100, it was $100 more than I would have
gotten,'' Crist says.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kopa, a 70-year-old resident of Scotia, N.Y., purchased the
timeshare from Crist. Kopa, who owned three racehorses, is getting
out of that business and plans to travel extensively. He now owns
nine timeshares and plans to use them or trade them for others all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kopa recently bought one Florida timeshare through an online
auction for only $450. He hopes to resell it, also online, for a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, timeshare owners trying to sell their units
had limited options. Many real estate agencies handling timeshares
either charged upfront, nonrefundable fees or commissions in the 30
percent range. All this for a timeshare that most likely could
fetch no more than half its original price.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet allows resellers to reach wider audiences directly,
without using a real estate agent. It allows buyers the chance to
shop with no sales pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bargains in the resale area are incredible,'' says Rogers,
who owns two timeshares. He bought the first one, in Hilton Head
Island, S.C., from the developer. He bought the second one in
Florida as a resale for about one-fifth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the worldwide exposure of the Internet, many
timeshares get no bids.
</P>
<P>
   When Gwinnett resident George Lipsky moved to metro Atlanta from
Charlottesville, Va., his timeshare in Duck, N.C., became a lot
less attractive, because instead of a five-hour drive, it was 12.
He put the unit on eBay with a starting price of $4,250 _ about a
third of the purchase price _ but still got no bids.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried advertising in The Washington Post and on the
Timeshare Users Group Web site, and he even paid upfront fees to a
real estate listing agent, but got no offers.
</P>
<P>
   He now plans to keep the timeshare and trade it for stays at
other timeshares.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a major component of the value of a timeshare is its
trading value. That is all the more reason why buyers should
carefully research timeshares before buying one, even at bargain
</P>
<P>
   prices, Rogers says.
</P>
<P>
   Timeshares can be traded worldwide through exchange programs.
The trading value is based on supply and demand and is governed by
the same factors that determine rental rates at all resorts: the
quality of the resort, the season and the desirability of the
location. Timeshares are actually color coded by the exchange
programs so you can determine trading value before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tybrisa Beach Resort on Georgia's Tybee Island has
a red rating _ the highest trading value _ from March 25 to Oct.
28. Alii Kai resort on Kauai, Hawaii, is red rated year-round, as
are many of the resorts in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the traditional method of selling timeshares in
weekly units, some sellers, including heavy hitter Disney, now use
a point system. A buyer purchases a block of points rather than a
specific week of the year. The points provide more flexibility by
allowing the owner to make reservations for a timeshare unit any
time during the year, not just one specific week, with more points
required for larger units. With a point system, you can use the
timeshare for vacations of less than a week's duration.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for buyers to learn these and other nuances,
Rogers says. ``Educate yourself ahead of, not after, the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE INFORMATION ON TIMESHARES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Timeshare Users Group (www.tug2.net) is for anyone who
owns a timeshare or is thinking of buying one. Its goal is to
provide unbiased information about timeshares by allowing users to
share their experiences. Membership is $15, with a $10 renewal fee.
The Web site features classified ads, timeshare reviews and an
advice section that lists charitable organizations that take
timeshares as donations. Much of the information on the site can be
accessed without joining.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Online auctions: You can buy and sell timeshares on several
auction Web sites, including www.ebay.com, www.yahoo.com and
www.amazon.com. You may be surprised at how many timeshares are for
sale, how low the prices are and how many still get no bids. In
addition to buying timeshares outright, you can also bid on renting
a unit for a one-time vacation, often at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Timeshare resales: The Web is filled with companies
specializing in timeshare resales, where buyers can find bargains
but sellers often face the reality of taking a big loss. ``In most
cases you should be able to recover from 30 percent to 60 percent
of the original developer sales price,'' advises one site, Hotel
Timeshare Resales (www.htr4timeshare.com). Some companies charge
upfront fees to handle timeshare resales, whether or not the unit
sells.
</P>
<P>
   Even without upfront fees, sales commissions can be steep. One
company charges 15 percent, with a minimum of $1,500. If your
timeshare is worth less than $1,500, the company offers to ``get
rid of it for you,'' taking whatever the timeshare brings as the
commission. In other words, you end up with a 100 percent loss, but
are free of the yearly maintenance fees.

 &HT;    Past meets future along historic northeast Florida trail of
unspoiled beauty and city bustle
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That well-traveled ribbon of asphalt known as A1A _ which hugs
Florida's Atlantic coastline from Fernandina Beach to Miami Beach _
makes a beeline into the past on the aptly named First Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Here, along a 52-mile stretch between Amelia Island and St.
Augustine, the state highway is known as the Buccaneer Trail.
Following this heritage route, travelers enter what was once the
domain of native Timucuan tribes, explorers, early settlers and,
yes, treasure-seeking pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The trail is as scenic as it is historic.
</P>
<P>
   The northeast Florida coast, much of it unspoiled by time and
man, offers up remnants of the ages in the marshes, swamps and
hammocks, the broad St. Johns River and its winding estuaries, and
vast stretches of barrier islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneer Trail leads to museums, state parks, nature
preserves with excellent birding, dune-protected beaches, old
forts, early plantations, recreation areas and thriving _ but so
far not condo-choked _ beach towns. There's even a car ferry across
the St. Johns River linking Fort George Island and Mayport Village.
(It's the only way to continue north or south without detouring
inland.) At trail's end is the tourist haven of St. Augustine, the
oldest continually occupied European settlement in the United
States, founded in 1565 by Pedro Menendez for Spain.
</P>
<P>
   While history buffs have a field day along the trail, the
outdoors-oriented can try horseback riding on the beach, sailing,
coastal kayaking and fishing. At day's end, vacationers can choose
among lodgings that range from quaint B&AMP;Bs and beach houses to
sprawling, lushly landscaped resorts like Amelia Island Plantation
and the Ponte Vedra Inn &AMP; Club.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500 years after Ponce de Leon's arrival in the land he
called La Florida (Land of Flowers), preserving the past remains a
priority. At the same time, the First Coast is girding itself for
the challenges of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the region is this more apparent than in
Jacksonville, which lies 16 miles inland from the Buccaneer Trail,
straddling the majestic St. Johns.
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with growth and its consequences, the brash port city
barrels headlong into the 21st century _ with direction. Voters
recently approved a half-cent sales tax to finance a $2 billion
``Better Jacksonville Plan.'' In support of the proposal, Mayor
John Delaney raised the ire of some Atlantans when he held Atlanta
up as an example of congestion, unchecked growth, traffic, smog and
sprawl. By now, it's old news _ but the topic still makes for an
interesting conversation starter with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   With a metro population of more than 1.3 million, Jacksonville
makes a legitimate claim for major-city status with several fine
museums, a zoo, the Jacksonville Landing entertainment complex and
Alltel Stadium, home of the NFL Jaguars, the annual Georgia-Florida
college football game and the Gator Bowl. Taking advantage of the
river, which cuts an impressive swath through the heart of the
city, riverwalks have been built on both sides of the water.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to northeast Florida, I spent nights at an
elegant B&AMP;B in a re-emerging Jacksonville residential neighborhood,
an 1857 inn in Fernandina Beach at the north end of Amelia Island,
a grandly restored Moorish-style hotel in St. Augustine and ritzy
seaside digs in Ponte Vedra Beach.
</P>
<P>
   I dined on fat grilled diver scallops in Fernandina, filet
mignon in Ponte Vedra and an enormous platter of fried seafood in
Jacksonville. I sipped local microbrews in St. Augustine and
Jacksonville and quaffed a McEwen's Scottish ale at an Irish pub in
Fernandina.
</P>
<P>
   I hit as many attractions as time permitted. And even I learned
to pronounce Timucuan (TEE-muh-kwan).
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Florida's story begins not with European explorers but
with the Timucuans, who lived in harmony with nature on these
shores for thousands of years, farming and fishing. Even so, the
Europeans had no respect for the natives' claim on the land and no
qualms about asserting their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Six Spanish expeditions between 1513 and 1563 failed before
Menendez prevailed in St. Augustine in 1565. Meanwhile, in 1564,
France had established Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River, but
Menendez quickly dispatched the French Huguenots.
</P>
<P>
   With France out of the picture, Spain and Britain battled for
control for three centuries. Not until 1821, when Spain ceded
Florida to the United States, did the conflict end.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's easy to see what the fight was about. The First
Coast is a place worth discovering.

 &HT;    Sultans' treasures surface at Fort Lauderdale museum
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enter the royal residence that was home of the Ottoman sultans
for 400 years as you visit ``Palace of Gold &AMP; Light: Treasures From
Topkapi, Istanbul'' at the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, Oct.
15-Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 200 imperial Turkish delights, many of which
have never left the seaside palace, is the Topkapi dagger
(1746-47). Adorned with three large emeralds and lined with
diamonds, the dagger was made famous by the 1964 Jules Dassin film
``Topkapi.'' The dagger was intended to be a gift for the shah of
Iran Nadir, who was assassinated before it could be presented.
</P>
<P>
   Treasures from the 15th to 19th centuries will be featured,
including jewel-encrusted ceremonial objects; intricately designed
wood and silk carpets from imperial looms; finely crafted armor and
weaponry; Chinese porcelains; sultans' costumes and courtly
ornaments; Ottoman textiles and royal robes; musical instruments;
and religious and literary manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Another highlight is the exquisitely crafted ebony, ivory and
mother-of-pearl campaign throne of Sultan Suleiman I from the
mid-16th century. It is thought to have accompanied the sultan on
his many military campaigns in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit was brought to Fort Lauderdale through the
collaboration of seven cultural organizations that joined forces as
Topkapi Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Admission is $12; $10 senior citizens and students.
The museum is at the northeast corner of Las Olas Boulevard and
Andrews Avenue in downtown Fort Lauderdale. 954-525-5500,

 &HT;    Ethical concerns raised in Orkin suit
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Edward Carder, a triathlete, couldn't figure out what
was wrong with him. Neither could his doctors. He was suffering
from a mysterious blend of aches and pains, skin lesions and
rashes.
</P>
<P>
   Carder was referred to Dr. Howard Frumkin, of Emory University's
Rollins School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Frumkin, an environmental and occupational health expert, said
he determined that Carder was highly sensitive to at least one of
three pesticides, which included Dursban. Use of that chemical
recently was restricted by the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   That patient-doctor visit lies at the center of a lawsuit Carder
filed against Atlanta-based Orkin Exterminating Co. It alleges that
a negligent spraying of pesticides at his Marietta, Ga., workplace
caused him permanent injury. Orkin denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the suit was filed, trial is set for next week
in Fulton County State Court.
</P>
<P>
   But Carder's medical visit also has raised ethical questions
involving Frumkin's employer, Emory, and the family that controls
Orkin's parent company _a family that's a major donor to Emory and
includes a university trustee.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 deposition in the Carder case, Frumkin describes
pressure from his Emory superiors not to testify against Orkin in
future cases.
</P>
<P>
   Orkin is run by Rollins Inc., a company controlled by the
Rollins family. Randall Rollins, the company's chairman and chief
executive officer, is an Emory trustee.
</P>
<P>
   The Rollins family donated $10 million in the late 1980s to help
fund construction of what's now called the O. Wayne Rollins
Research Building at Emory, named after Randall Rollins' father _
the co-founder of Rollins Inc. The family gave another $10 million
in 1992 to construct the School of Public Health building, named
after Grace Crum Rollins, Wayne Rollins' wife.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, Emory announced the Rollins family gave
another $5 million to the Rollins School of Public Health, to
underwrite the O. Wayne and Grace Crum Rollins Endowment Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Emory, through spokesman Curt Carlson, says that no university
official cited by Frumkin can recall a conversation with him about
Orkin. But Carlson also says Emory isn't questioning Frumkin's
truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   As described in the deposition, the pressure exerted on Frumkin
amounted to an attempt ''to squelch the free speech of a faculty
member,'' says a nationally known expert in university ethics,
Sheldon Krimsky of Tufts Such influence, if it occurred, ''would
not be consistent with university policy,'' Emory's Carlson says.
</P>
<P>
   Frumkin now declines to comment on the Carder case. He only
says: ``My medical practice style here at Emory has never changed
since my arrival, and my career progression, including promotion
and tenure, has been right on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1994 deposition, Frumkin testified that his superior,
Dr. Ray Greenberg, then the dean of the School of Public Health,
told him that ''Mr. Rollins had expressed some unhappiness with the
fact that I was testifying in this (Carder) case.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frumkin added: ``I was instructed not to evaluate any
patients in the future who might potentially have claims against
Orkin.'' The instructions, Frumkin said, came from Greenberg and
from Dr. Charles Hatcher, who had discussed the matter with
Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher refuses to answer questions about the matter. Randall
Rollins, through an Orkin spokeswoman, would not answer questions
about Frumkin's statements about pressure exerted on him.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Martha May says Randall Rollins did not contact
Emory leaders about the Carder litigation. But she says Gary
Rollins, Randall's brother and president of Rollins Inc., did
approach Greenberg about Frumkin's testing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   May says that Frumkin's tests didn't follow standard procedure
to verify pesticide exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Frumkin testified, ``I'm aware that Rollins has been a
generous donor to Emory, for which I'm grateful. I'm aware that my
superiors do not wish me to reach opinions that are unfavorable to
Rollins or its subsidiaries, and I feel that I have no choice when
I see a patient but to reach an honest opinion and to express it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rollins also declined an interview. Greenberg, now
president of the Medical University of South Carolina, says he
doesn't recall the conversation with Frumkin. ``It may well have
taken place,'' Greenberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened, Emory's Carlson says the university doesn't
plan to investigate the matter. He notes that Frumkin has stuck to
his original medical opinion in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emory is always concerned about the opinions and the comfort
level of our friends and donors,'' Carlson says. ``But university
policy demands that medical and research and other academic
decisions are completely independent of issues involving donors and
other friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Krimsky, the Tufts ethics expert, says he suspects that
influence by donors and trustees occurs more often than is
reported. But he adds the Emory case is striking. The deposition,
he says, describes an overt case of influence by a trustee or donor
''trying to squelch'' a faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has an absolute obligation to protect the free
speech of its faculty,'' Krimsky says. Frumkin is scheduled to
testify in a second local case, which alleges that an Orkin
misapplication of a pesticide caused a chronic health problem. That
case, involving Linda Moritz of Peachtree City, is also expected to
be tried this fall. Orkin denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Moritz's lawyer, Philip Casto, says Frumkin ''is the key'' to
the case.

 &HT;    At the High Holidays, Jews from many backgrounds will reclaim
the ancient rituals of an ancient people.
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judy Marx was raised in a strongly identified Reform Jewish home
and has a full-time job working in a Jewish organization. But she's
not a member of a congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a synagogue in town that meets my needs,'' said
Marx, 38, who is assistant area director of the American Jewish
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Marx wouldn't miss worship for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur,
the upcoming High Holidays of the Jewish calendar. She'll be
attending Atlanta Yad, a nondenominational congregation near Emory
University, where she occasionally goes to Sabbath services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holidays mean something to me,'' said Marx, who is single
and lives in Virginia-Highland. ``It's like reconnecting with
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Jews in metro Atlanta who seldom enter synagogues
are lining up tickets for services and taking time off work to make
sure they are not left out at the holiest time of the year.
Synagogues are borrowing space and bringing in folding chairs to
accommodate the swelled crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana, which begins at sundown Friday, is the first day
of the month of Tishri in the Jewish calendar and literally means
``head of the year.'' According to Jewish tradition, Rosh Hashana
marks the anniversary of the creation of the world and is the day
on which God opens the Book of Life to record one's deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secular New Year is just the time when I mess up checks,''
said Marx. ``The Jewish New Year for me is really an opportunity to
see where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana ushers in a 10-day period of examination known as
the Days of Awe, which end with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
On this day, Jews believe, God once again closes the Book of Life.
It is a time when Jews must face themselves, those they have
wronged, and God to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is an agnostic, Dave Savage, 49, is helping to plan
holiday services as a leader in Kol Chaim, literally Voice of Life,
an organization of humanist Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Days of Awe are a time of making amends and looking in new
directions, said Savage, a marketing professional who lives in the
Northlake area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living a Jewish life provides several opportunities throughout
the year to think about things beyond yourself, issues of being
part of the human race,'' he said. ``We do it because it works,
because it's important in order for society to function, and to
clear the air.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Temple's packed worship services during these holidays,
Rabbi Alvin Sugarman will be talking to his Midtown congregation
about Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my dad, God rest his soul,'' said Sugarman. ``He
was a traveling salesman, and not a religious Jew in any sense of
keeping kosher and such. But I remember him telling me as a little
child, `Alvin, wherever I am, I make sure that at the High Holidays
I will be in synagogue.' He never told me why.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Sugarman, he understands his father's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something in the message of the holidays themselves
that almost transcends theology in many ways,'' he said. ``The idea
of new beginnings, of taking stock of your life, has the same
appeal to the secularist as it does to someone who is deeply
religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, he said, the need both to give and receive
forgiveness, to get beyond past mistakes and hurts, is a human need
for believers and nonbelievers alike.
</P>
<P>
   The call of the ram's horn, or shofar, that summons Jews to the
synagogue to usher in the New Year is a call both to connection
with the history of a people who have worshipped for 4,000 years
and to the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Julie Schwartz of B'Nai Israel synagogue in Riverdale said
the timing of the holidays, near the start of the religious school
year, brings new families into the fold, not only for the holidays
but for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of family traditions, and people remember being
with grandma and grandpa, things that happened in their own
families,'' she said. ``Those traditions and rituals are very
powerful, not necessarily when someone is young, college-aged, but
as people start to create their own homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The holidays ``are a combination of community celebration and a
powerful period of self-reflection,'' she said. ``That draws at
people's souls.''
</P>

 &HT;    Karen, Klein and Rowley wrap up fashion week
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW-YORK _ It's almost too bad that Donna Karan's always the
second-to-last of the major designers to stage a show during
Fashion Week. After you've seen almost every other collection and
gotten a fix on the trends, sitting through a Karan runway previews
can give you that ``been there, done that'' feeling.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, on Friday, Karan unveiled 71 spring styles for
women and 14 for men that touched on looks shown throughout the
week. But in several cases, Karan did them better.
</P>
<P>
   Striped motifs have been ridiculously recurrent here. But hardly
anyone's come up with a way to lend stripes the sensuality that
Karan has by making suits, dresses and separates look as if they
were stretches of sand that someone idly combed their fingers
through.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffled skirts and blouse sleeves have made a sudden
re-emergence, and Karan's looked better than most because they
wafted delicately as the models walked. Even multilayered skirts
that fall below the knee looked somehow revealing because of the
way they fluttered up, down and around the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Her menswear, on the other hand, looked irrefutably masculine
and modern.
</P>
<P>
   Much emphasis has been placed on upping the luxury ante for next
spring: Karan's trim-fitting women's suits and curve-hugging
dresses just happened to glisten like caviar and sparkle like
champagne. She keenly mixed vertical, horizontal and diagonal
stripes, craftily cut jackets to nip and then fall from the waist
and wisely stayed away from the belts other designers have
overdepended on. It wasn't the most colorful collection shown this
week, but it was among the most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   To bring Fashion Week to its official close Friday, Calvin Klein
assumed an extraordinarily relaxed stance. The most-often shown
looks in his collection were skin-skimming dresses and tops that
were made of ultra-thin jersey fabric and strongly resembled
athletic jerseys. Each of these was tri-colored, with bands around
the waist and shoulder straps that contrasted with the bodice.
</P>
<P>
   Few suits were shown as Klein opted instead for prim,
knee-length skirts paired with cropped leather jackets. Whereas
most designers gave their pants a knife's edge flare from the knee
down, Klein's were cut close to the ankle. His eveningwear styles
were sparse as well: using the same formula applied to his daywear,
he produced filmy slips adorned with lacy straps in contrasting
shades to the silk bodices.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Cynthia Rowley set a new standard for herself
in terms of combining wit, sex appeal, ingenuity and sophistication
into one very wearable collection. With sparrows perched in
neon-colored cages above her runway, Rowley showed prescious
dresses and skirted outfits featuring cascading tiers of antique
white eyelet cotton. Her dainty, sherbert-shaded tops were sashed
at the waist in same-colored satin. The belts on her trim-fitting
pants were thin strips of neon leather.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley also offered up some whimsical pieces for men: white
jeans smeared with rust stains from the rivets on the pockets and
photo-printed T-shirts that would make men look like dogs from the
neck down.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of spring, some of Rowley's girly skirts were
appliqued with shamrocks. And in the spirit of flirtation, most
were slit daringly high on the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, John Bartlett staged a provocative preview
that smacked of sadomasochism: His sultry, show-closing gowns were
clingy little numbers that featured built-in, gold-tipped red
leather whips that wrapped around models' shoulders and served as
back straps. Bartlett also showed a captivation with Asian culture
with a series of modified kimono dresses and blouses and
samurai-style coats. The captivating collection also contained what
Bartlett called ``rope prints'': solid white, red and black dresses
that looked as if they'd been haphazardly coiled up in ropes dipped
in paint.

 &HT;    Screenwriting seminar gets the dialogue started
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you learn one thing from this summer's slate of lackluster
movies, Robert McKee wants you to learn this: All those
luxury-car-driving, cellphone-toting Hollywood executives ``just
don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   We had three months of blaring soundtracks (``Coyote Ugly''),
braggadocious special effects (``Hollow Man'') and more pounding
waves of water (``The Perfect Storm'') than anyone should endure in
a lifetime. But in all that hype, noise and computerized gadgetry,
where was the story?
</P>
<P>
   That's what McKee wants to know. At 59, he's a longtime
scriptwriter (``Columbo'' and TNT's ``Abraham''), a Fulbright
scholar and an instructor with a doctorate in cinema arts, and he
came to Atlanta from Los Angeles this month to conduct an intensive
three-day screenwriting seminar that The Washington Post has dubbed
``near legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Telling stories ``is why God put us on this planet,'' McKee
declares. And few are telling them well anymore. ``When was the
last time you saw a well-told story onstage?''
</P>
<P>
   McKee's students have included former Mariettan Alan Ball (an
Oscar winner this year for writing ``American Beauty''), Julia
Roberts, Meg Ryan, Drew Carey and thousands of others. Each sat for
36 hours over three days and listened to McKee talk about story
form, surface vs. deep characterization, genres, controlling ideas,
story spines, arcs, turning points, act structure and, of course,
dialogue. The three days conclude with a six-hour, scene-by-scene
(and sometimes line-by-line) analysis of ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 100 people paid from $300 to $500 to attend McKee's
first seminar in Atlanta (tentative plans call for him to return
next spring or summer). And some emerged realizing that what looks
simple to do on-screen simply isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume it's easy because they see a lot of crummy
movies,'' says Kevin Brehm, 46, a Brookhaven lawyer who has written
a screenplay and is trying to improve it. ``Writing scripts is
certainly not an easy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many are trying their hand at it. Some 40,000 to 50,000
screenplay titles a year are registered with the Writers Guild of
America. ``And those are the ones people bother to register,''
McKee notes.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of selling a script to a big Hollywood movie studio
are indeed slim. Studios normally make only about a dozen movies a
year. But the payoff is often substantial.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not the only avenue. Hollywood spends roughly $750
million a year to option and develop scripts, many of which never
get made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built a home and a swimming pool on option money,'' says
McKee, who says he received ``well over six figures'' to write a
script for Cher. The pitch: ``Jagged Edge'' meets rock 'n' roll.
The plot: Rock star kills her lover and gets away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Cher read it, McKee says, and said, ``No, I won't play a bad
person.''
</P>
<P>
   One simple read ``and they buried it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Truly great scripts often take time. Oliver Stone spent 10 years
honing his Oscar-winning screenplay for ``Midnight Express.'' And,
as McKee says, once you strip away their surfaces, they all share
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful.'' ``American Beauty.'' ``Being John
Malkovich.'' ``Reservoir Dogs.'' ``The Silence of the Lambs.''
``Thelma &AMP; Louise.'' None is based on a formula. ``They have
essential form of story and bring it to the surface uniquely,''
McKee says.
</P>
<P>
   The good writers, he maintains, have talent (``the ability to
discover a hidden connection between two things that no one's ever
seen before''), taste (``an innate ability to know good from bad'')
and craft (``mastery of the art form itself'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Good writers know that 90 percent of what they write they will
trash,'' McKee says.
</P>
<P>
   Rohan Crawford, 32, a credit analyst who lives in Roswell, has
been working on his screenplays for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to give it a try after looking at some of the movies
being made,'' he says. ``A lot of them are horrible. I thought,
hell, I could just do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As an African-American, Crawford would like to write scripts
with un-Hollywood twists: romantic comedies with black, Asian and
Native American characters, and action films with female
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only once every few months is there a movie I will rave
about,'' Crawford says. ``Like `Sense and Sensibility.'''
Hollywood, he says, is mostly interested in marketing and getting
``butts in seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest example he cites: ``The Cell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to see Jennifer Lopez, I can watch her on MTV for
free. I sat there and was bored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now that I will look at movies differently,'' says
Haifa Sabhan of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who came to Atlanta for
McKee's seminar from her family's home in Lawrence, Kan. She
attended the University of Kansas in 1992 as a film major, but
never took a class in screenwriting. ``It's hard to believe, but it
was not offered and not required,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I realize it's not just hard work, but it has to come from
within you,'' Sabhan says.
</P>
<P>
   And a good story will always sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you write with Crayolas on toilet
paper,'' McKee says. ``A great story is a great story.''

 &HT;    The popular weave gets a fun reworking, in bolder colors on just
about everything
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great Scot! Plaids are back, but with a decidedly updated look.
</P>
<P>
   From prim and proper to hip and funky, unusual colors give the
traditional preppy pattern a new edge. Think teal blue with brown,
chartreuse with olive, orange with purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the red-and-black or green-and navy tartans your
mother wore as kilts or jumpers,'' says Kaye Davis, fashion
director of AmericasMart. ``Recolored plaids assume a modern, fresh
look.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are available on everything from bucket hats to
ruffle-trim blouses to sleek boots.
</P>
<P>
   Accessory designer Kate Spade always features a plaid in her
fall collections. This time around, it's an orange/gray/cream
buffalo plaid Mary Jane shoe. ``The shoe works well with gray
flannels and tweeds,'' says Spade, who got her inspiration from a
man's plaid jacket.
</P>
<P>
   While designers such as Sonia Rykiel, Cynthia Rowley, Ralph
Lauren and Michael Kors offer plenty of plaids in their
collections, it's the British house of Burberry that's led the
plaid revival. The company is well-known for its status plaid of
tan, red and black; designer Roberto Menichetti offers its
signature weave on footwear, clothing and leather goods.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger chose to go the traditional route with his
plaids. He even traveled to his family's home in Scotland to
research his roots and came up with pleated skirts, vests and
suits.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need your own clan to dress well in plaids this fall.
But don't wear it head to toe. Mix it with other fabrics, including
suede, cashmere, leather and silk. Or, for a modern look, wear it
with other patterns. For example, pair plaid with snakeskin or
animal prints, but make certain all are in the same color tones.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the less-is-more theory. A plaid shoulder bag or hat can
update last year's black suit perfectly. Also, camel, the popular
neutral this fall, is a good foil for many plaids.
</P>

 &HT;    Denny's launching $10 million effort to reshape its image

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Denny's was hit with racial discrimination
charges in the mid-1990s, the company took a hard look at its past.
</P>
<P>
   Now the restaurant chain is visiting history once again, this
time in hopes of conjuring better memories.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Denny's will unveil a new ad campaign to reposition
the 47-year-old restaurant chain as ``America's Kitchen Table.''
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million effort _ handled by a branch of Atlanta-based
WestWayne _ marks the latest image overhaul for Denny's, which
instituted mandatory diversity training for employees and made
other changes in the wake of racial discrimination problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with a corporate crisis is one of the toughest
challenges in advertising. But rehabilitating a damaged brand is
possible, as shown by image improvements at Denny's and AirTran
Airways, which has virtually shed its association with its
tragedy-scarred predecessor, ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   The job of reshaping Denny's is in the hands of the Tampa office
of WestWayne, which won the account earlier this year. For the
television ads, WestWayne has chosen a theme of families _ both
black and white _ enjoying time together in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign definitely has a kind of nostalgic yearning,''
said Creative Director Scott Sheinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach wouldn't work if Denny's hadn't put behind it
the issues that led to a pair of class-action lawsuits by
African-Americans. In the first case, six U.S. Secret Service
agents accused Denny's of refusing to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's parent, Advantica Restaurant Group of Spartanburg,
S.C., is credited with a ``nearly miraculous turnaround'' by
Fortune magazine, which ranks the company as the nation's best
employer for minorities. The chain has increased minority ownership
of its franchises to around 35 percent. Advantica's 11-member board
also has four minority members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a continual improvement,'' said Roy Getz, vice
president of marketing at Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   WestWayne didn't feel the brand was tainted, so new ads don't
mention past troubles. ``I don't think we really thought about
it,'' Sheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   WestWayne decided to pitch Denny's as a refuge for harried
families, trying to enhance the chain's image as a cozy, if unhip,
place to eat. ``The way life is so busy now, it's hard to get that
time,'' Sheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Repositioning a brand isn't easy, however. AirTran, the
successor to ValuJet, went through the process following ValuJet's
1996 crash in the Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet was a no-frills success story before the disaster, but
executives eventually realized the brand was hopelessly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passengers weren't coming back,'' said Tad Hutcheson,
AirTran's director of marketing and an employee at the time.
</P>
<P>
   About a year after the crash, ValuJet merged with AirTran
Airways of Orlando and adopted its name, even though ValuJet was
the larger of the two. The merger was followed by a new product and
image campaign aimed at budget-minded business travelers. ``It made
sense to begin fresh,'' said Peter Krivkovich, president of
AirTran's ad agency, Cramer-Krasselt of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The merged AirTran's first tag line, ``It's something else,''
hinted at the effort to distance the carrier from ValuJet without
directly addressing the issue. Earlier this year, the company
launched a second generation of ads under the tag line, ``Your
airline has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cases of rehab advertising occurred this summer with
United Airlines, which suffered serious service woes, and Ford
Motor Co., caught up in the Firestone tire fiasco. Both rolled out
ads featuring chief executives vowing to do right by customers.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's rehab has been an ongoing effort. In early 1999, Denny's
ran three TV ads that talked about racial diversity. In one spot, a
young African-American man said, ''Noticing a person's color
doesn't make you a racist. Acting like it matters does.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the company has moved to other themes. Now it's time
to clarify the chain's image. ``Their stuff has been a little
scattered,'' Sheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   For the new television commercials, WestWayne asked its own
staffers to bring in old home movies. Those clips ended up being
the basis for ads, letting WestWayne avoid the trouble of hiring
actors during an ongoing commercial actors' strike.
</P>
<P>
   If the campaign succeeds, Denny's could take another step away
from its old image. That might provide a case study for other
companies that have had troubles lately, such as Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a place where people go for comfortable food,'' said
Getz, who contends memories of the race litigation have largely
faded. ``It's part of the past.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Friday ordered the release of 30
million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserve over the
next month, only a day after Vice President Al Gore injected the
issue into the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement helped drive crude oil prices down, and
analysts said the move could be effective in the short run in
checking or even reversing the surge in home heating oil and
gasoline prices in the run-up to election day. But they said there
were no guarantees that consumers would benefit, and that the
decision did nothing to address the underlying issue of how to
bring energy supply into line with demand over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they acted primarily because
inventories of heating oil on the east coast had fallen to
worrisomely low levels, raising the risk of shortages should the
winter be particularly cold or long.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his decision after a sharp debate within the
administration over whether releasing oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve was justified, and after talking by phone on
Tuesday with Gore, who told the president then that he intended to
call for use of the reserve to stabilize oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did that on Thursday, but recommended starting with the
release of a smaller amount, 5 million barrels, with the
possibility of releasing more. Clinton committed himself to a
substantially larger 30 million barrel release.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision played neatly into Gore's campaign strategy
of portraying himself as fighting for the people against powerful
interests like big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   It also allowed the vice president to dominate the news again on
an issue of his choosing, forcing his opponent, Gov. George W.
Bush, into an argument about who could do more to help consumers.
And it was clearly intended by Gore to minimize the chances that
voters could be put in a sour mood around election day by high
prices for gas or heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bush said the stockpile was created as a
backstop for times when the supply of oil has been seriously
disrupted, such as during a war. And he pointed out that as
recently as last winter, Gore had opposed use of the reserve just
to deal with rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the vice president has made this decision, with the
support of the president, for short term political gain,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania a few hours before the
administration announced its decision, Gore said it was time to
stand up to what he called ``big oil'' and its apologists, of whom
he implied Bush was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices are skyrocketing,'' Gore said. ``It's hurting
small business. It's hurting those on fixed incomes. It's hurting
young families. And the prospect for even higher prices ahead is
going to cause even more trouble unless we act now.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had been considering the
issue for weeks, but came to a consensus on how to proceed only
during a late-night conference call among the president's senior
advisers on Thursday, a few hours after Gore gave a speech in which
he laid out the case for drawing on the nation's oil reserves.
Clinton then signed off on the strategy Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's decision was announced by Bill Richardson, the energy
secretary, who said the government would begin releasing 1 million
barrels of oil a day from the reserve starting on Monday and
continuing for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than selling the oil outright, the government intends to
enter into deals with refiners under which the companies will agree
to replace the oil it is taking, and then some, at a later date. In
that way, Richardson said, the program would add to the nation's
oil reserves rather than deplete them.
</P>
<P>
   The United States uses about 14.5 million barrels of oil a day,
9 million of them imported, said Angela Antonelli, the director of
economic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
research group.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 million barrels a day from the reserve, plus a modest
increase in production promised several weeks ago by the OPEC oil
producing nations, means that crude oil supplies in the United
States will rise about 10 percent for the next few weeks, she said,
enough to have a noticeable short-term effect on prices of both
crude oil and refined products.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil for November delivery fell by $1.32 cents
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, closing at
$32.68. Heating oil for delivery in October fell by 4.41 cents a
gallon, to 95.48 cents.

YOGA TEACHER TO STARS TRIES BECOMING ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Danny Paradise _ yogi, minstrel, world citizen _ has
no phone number, no post office box, no residence he calls home. He
roams the planet with a bag or two, leaving luggage under beds in
his wake. The only way to reach him directly is through a carefully
guarded e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   ``People generally get to me by contacting someone who already
knows me, and when I'm in their area, I'll call that person to say
I've arrived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Paradise is just the sort of centered,
enlightened, elusive personality that celebrities flock to, making
him a yoga darling of the music and fashion industries.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he'd want you to know this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to put myself out there,'' Paradise said
recently, voice modulated, posture perfect, as he sat amid Asian
artifacts in a friend's Central Park West aerie. A ribbon of
incense wafted out an open window in a futile attempt to rub out
the aroma of cigarette smoke. (Not his.)
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Paradise arrived in, and quickly departed from,
the city that never sleeps, ostensibly to talk about the
culmination of a dream: the release this week of his first CD,
``River of the Soul,'' featuring music inspired by a lifetime of
ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to overlook the coincidence between his visit and
Sting's concert in Central Park. (He was there.) Or Paul Simon's
appearance at the Democratic fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall.
(He was there, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Especially since both rock icons, as well as Simon's wife, the
singer Edie Brickell, a host of musicians from both their bands and
two of Nepal's most famous indigenous ensembles, Prastar and Karma,
can be heard on ``River of the Soul'' alongside Paradise, who
performs vocals, acoustic guitar and the odd flute or harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   While singing with Sting, Paradise sounds, well, a bit like
Sting. When singing with Simon, he sounds, uh, a lot like Simon.
(No small wonder since Paradise cut his musical teeth on Simon and
Garfunkel in the 1960s.)
</P>
<P>
   On his own, ``it's Neil Young'' _ pause _ ``meets Windham Hill''
was how one listener, a mechanical engineer, described him.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the work will be filed in record stores under ``New
Age,'' Paradise said, adding, ``They don't know what to do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Donna Karan does. In her own contribution to her
friend's career, the designer has committed to putting the CD in
her stores, as well as its soon-to-be-released companion video of
location shots filmed by Paradise and his girlfriend, Michi Holley.
</P>
<P>
   But however star-studded his client roster may be _ a news
release for the album names Madonna, Eddie Vedder, Mickey Hart and
Bob Weir as Paradise's students _ he prefers to remain, Zelig-like,
in the frame but comfortably removed from the camera's gaze. He has
granted only one other interview in his 25-year career, for a yoga
book published in Sweden, in Swedish, a language he hoped might not
be widely read.
</P>
<P>
   He is soft-spoken, articulate and thoughtful, and his laid-back
appearance belies an encyclopedic knowledge of things spiritual and
physiological and a disarming, razor-sharp wit.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a journalist's worst nightmare, and he knows it,
delicately establishing parameters on such topics as his real name
(``Can't you just say that I would neither confirm nor deny whether
I changed it?'') and the virtues of tantric sex as spoken of in the
past by Sting (``I'm not sure that really belongs in this article.
Let's just say he was a good student'').
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the interview, he began to look uncomfortable.
``Would you mind mentioning how we met?'' he asked. ``I don't want
people to think I sought you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, this writer met Paradise through cousins living
in Bangkok, who met him through friends living in Phuket, an island
off Thailand, where he was teaching (most of his teaching, he
insists, is done in public classes). Even with what he called an
``organic connection,'' it still took Paradise nearly three years
to agree to an interview.
</P>
<P>
   This much he'll reveal: He is 48 and was reared in Toronto,
where as a teen-ager he played football and baseball, studied
martial arts and worked as a swimming instructor.
</P>
<P>
   After a year at a university, he met a man who described
traveling across India and Asia, following a route taken by
spiritual seekers. Intrigued, Paradise quit school and set out
himself, on foot. By 21, he was making an annual pilgrimage from
Canada to Hawaii to Asia and back again.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a layover in Hawaii that he noticed a sign for a yoga
demonstration given by David Williams, a grandfather of Ashtanga
yoga in the West, and his wife at the time, Nancy Gilgoff. Urged by
a girlfriend, Paradise went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this guy who was amazing, very advanced, doing things no
one had seen,'' he recalled of the physically rigorous system that
involves synchronizing the breath with a progressive series of
increasingly complicated postures. ``The moment I did it, I
recognized this as something Westerners had never experienced
before. It was much, much deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, he would stop in Hawaii and learn another of the
system's six sequences. Halfway into the series, at age 23,
Paradise began to work for Williams as an apprentice teacher
whenever he was on the islands.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he made a little money by writing music and
playing his guitar in clubs. In 1983 Dominic Miller, an English
guitarist, dropped by a London bar where Paradise was performing
and struck up a conversation. Soon, he, too, became a yoga convert.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987 Miller had joined Sting's band. Three years later,
Paradise dropped by the studio where Sting was recording his ``Soul
Cages'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny asked if I wanted to do yoga, and I thought yoga was
sitting around contemplating my navel,'' Sting said in a telephone
interview from his home outside London. ``But he had these amazing
photographs, and I was intrigued. And I thought, I'm in great
shape. Let me have a go at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he was crowing a different tune. ``I couldn't do a
thing,'' he said, laughing. After about 20 minutes of yoga, Sting
was exhausted. ``So I invited him to my home,'' he continued, ``and
he stayed with me for about three months. I haven't missed a day
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward two years, when Sting called up Simon and Brickell
to ask if they'd like to meet his yoga teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaking my head, `No, no, no,''' Brickell recalled.
``But Paul invited Danny over and we took a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it and I wanted to do it as often as I could, because
I imagined it as something you could do your whole life,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sting also turned Madonna on to Paradise, who says he gave her
her first yoga lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, Brickell and Paradise became good friends, occasionally
performing music together. By now, in yet another class, Paradise
had also encountered Richard Foos, a co-owner of Rhino Records. He
passed along a tape of his work, and Foos eventually got it to
Mesa/Bluemoon Recordings. A contract was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got this record deal and asked if we would sing with him,''
Brickell said. ``And we said sure, because we like his music and it
would be great giving back to Danny, especially when you love
someone as much as we do him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sting had this to say of the wandering yogi he considers a close
friend: ``Danny's had this dream since I met him, to make a record
of his works. In order to do that, you have to stop flitting around
the world with your guitar, and tie yourself to a stake and set
fire to it. Lo and behold, 10 years later it has happened, and
we're all rooting for him.''

ANALYSIS: THE POLITICS OF OIL WORK IN GORE'S FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By   DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Did President Clinton decide to dip into the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Friday to protect Vice President Al
Gore? Or does he truly believe it will reverse a jump in oil prices
that could hurt millions of Americans and threaten the country's
remarkable prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides insisted on Friday, not surprisingly, that the
decision was made on policy grounds alone. But none denied that it
had the pleasant side effect of casting Gore into the limelight as
the man who attempted to save American homeowners from a winter of
sky-high heating bills.
</P>
<P>
   But politics moves a lot faster than oil tankers do.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton and Gore are exploiting one of the ultimate perks
of incumbency _ the power to move both oil and markets _ in hopes
of lifting an economic burden on millions of American households
while outflanking a Republican ticket that Gore has already charged
with being a tool of big oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, no one here is going to argue that we made this decision
in a vacuum _ Gore's people were right in the room,'' one senior
administration official said on Friday. ``But just because it helps
Al doesn't mean it was the wrong policy choice. A week ago we were
going the other way. But if you looked at the markets in the past
few days, it was clear we couldn't sit and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly clear to Gore, who called Clinton on Tuesday
and told him that he was going to give a speech later in the week
calling on the president to tap the reserves. In public, Gore said
he was seeking only a small intervention in the oil markets _
starting with 5 million barrels, roughly a quarter of the amount of
oil that the United States consumes in a single day. But he was
clearly looking for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the president a lot of room to do a little or a lot,''
one of Gore's aides said on Friday. But the message was clear: He
had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton did in the end was split the difference between two
cabinet members who had been arguing over the subject for weeks.
One was Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who told the president in
a memo earlier this month that he should flood the market with 60
million barrels, or more than 10 percent of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a sharp retort from Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, who viewed Richardson's proposal as foolish, saying it
would ``set a dangerous precedent'' by using the reserves to
manipulate prices rather than act as an insurance policy against
real disruptions in supply.
</P>
<P>
   The sale might have a modest effect on prices, Summers argued,
but it wouldn't last long. The markets would quickly conclude that
the United States did not dare pull the same trick twice _ because
it would not want to exhaust its emergency reserves or give Gore's
Republican opponent, Gov. George W. &UR;  &LR; Bush &UR; , &LR;  the chance to make a
credible argument that the administration was endangering America's
energy security in an effort to get Gore elected.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that is exactly what Bush charged on Thursday, after
Gore's announcement. He repeated the charge on Friday, saying,
``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve needs to be used in the case of
war, in case of major disruption of supply. This is an
administration that has had no energy plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson went a step further, arguing that because he is
``swapping'' oil rather than selling it _ that is, releasing it in
return for commitments from oil companies to put even more back in
_ the result will be a ``further increase in the nation's
protection against potential or actual energy supply disruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right, as long as any disruptions come after the supplies
are replenished. It seems unlikely, however, that he has convinced
Saddam Hussein, who has been verbally threatening Kuwait in recent
days, to sign on to that strategy. Nations in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries could easily nullify the effects of
the administration's move by cutting their own production by the
same million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can head that off,'' one Administration official
said. If so, the announcement on Friday could have a significant
impact.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the oil markets, as in the currency markets, just a bit of
additional supply can have a much-magnified effect on price _
especially if traders believe that Washington is ready to act
again.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Summers and other economic officials around the
world were betting this morning when they intervened in the
international currency markets to support the lagging Euro, the
European currency, and it is what Gore is betting with his oil
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But the price effect can prove temporary if traders conclude
that the chance of additional releases of oil is remote.
</P>
<P>
   One Administration official noted on Friday that Summers,
Richardson and others had settled on releasing 30 million barrels
in a conference call Thursday night because ``it was big enough to
really move the markets, and yet small enough to make a convincing
case that we could do more if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Gore will be on the stump suggesting that he can do
plenty more if he needs to. ``I reject the agenda of those who say,
`Don't even offer a plan, do nothing about it,' `' he said on
Friday in Pennsylvania. ``We are not helpless. We can act. We have
tools at our disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, incumbents do.

 &HT;    Familiarity breeds success for Holtz
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ When a team goes from 0-11 and despair to 3-0
and joy, it is natural to concentrate on the changes that have
taken place on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest change in South Carolina's program took place
off the field, the players say. And it is a big reason they are
unbeaten going into today's SEC game with Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   After South Carolina finished last season with a 21-game losing
streak, coach Lou Holtz determined that one of the problems was
that his players did not know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys living all over town and, except for practice,
they never interacted with one another,'' Holtz said. In August,
Holtz implemented policies to bring his team together:
</P>
<P>
   _ He took away their car keys and told them they would have to
ride the bus together if they wanted to go anywhere. For two weeks,
the players were thrown together, at practice, for meals, during
their free time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once school started, the staff made arrangements so that about
70 of the 85 scholarship players could live together in one dorm.
NCAA rules have eliminated athletic dorms, but Holtz could make the
change because less than half of the 400 rooms in the dorm are
occupied by athletes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Holtz started a system to keep track of good deeds and reward
players. He called it Chicken Points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your car is broken down, like mine was last week, and a guy
gives you a ride, you can nominate him for Chicken Points,''
quarterback Phil Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   Players who build up 30 Chicken Points get extra privileges,
such as going to the front of the line for meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can also get negative Chicken Points for being late
and stuff like that,'' defensive tackle Cleveland Pinkney said.
``Get negative 30 points and you run the stadium at 5 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The object of Chicken Points, Holtz said, is to get players
thinking about their actions and about their teammates. And it has
worked.
</P>
<P>
   At nightly team meetings, Holtz also required players to stand
and tell their life stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a story,'' Holtz said. ``And when our guys
look at a teammate, I don't want them to see just a name and a
face. I want them to know the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Derek Watson summoned up his courage and told his
teammates about the tragedies in his life. His mother died when he
was only 11. His brother, who had become his guardian, was killed
in an automobile accident. Then his uncle, who had taken over, was
killed in a shooting incident. Several players said the team shed a
lot of tears that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pain expressed in that room, but it really
brought this group of guys closer together,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that players will not want to let the others down
once they know each other and understand that all are making the
same commitment. ``Once you bond with another person, it is tougher
to surrender in adversity,'' said Skip Holtz, the Gamecocks'
offensive coordinator. ``It has been an amazing thing to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Gamecocks start the tough part of a schedule that
includes Mississippi State, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida and
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many games we're going to win, but we know
we've done something very important this season,'' Pinkney said.
``We turned this thing around. I know I'm going to remember this
group of guys for the rest of my life.''

FRENCH FLIGHT TESTS BAN ON TRAVEL TO IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Insisting that it has never recognized an
embargo on civilian air travel to Iraq, France on Friday let a
group fly from Paris to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, soon after two Russian flights to Baghdad, appeared
to be intended to force the Security Council to reconsider its ban
on air travel, which is part of the comprehensive sanctions that
the United Nations imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The French are encouraging others to follow suit in defying a
ban that has been so complete that to reach Baghdad, even diplomats
have had to travel overland through Jordan. The Russians said
Friday that they were planning another flight on Saturday, and a
Russian airline hopes to start regular service to Baghdad soon.
Jordan also wants to begin air service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be other flights,'' Ambassador Jean-David Levitte
of France said after a Security Council meeting Friday. ``For many
years now, we have considered that there is no flight embargo
against Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   But the French are not challenging the main sanctions against
trade with Iraq, or the U.N. effort to send inspectors to Iraq to
ensure that it is not making weapons of mass destruction. Earlier
this month France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, warned the
Iraqis pointedly that they would have to comply with a new
inspection process if they wanted to see the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. reaction to the flight was swift. The State
Department said the flight had been made ``in blatant violation''
of the sanctions. Richard Boucher, the department spokesman, said,
``This supports Iraq's efforts to undermine the authority of the
United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador James B. Cunningham, who handles the Iraqi issue for
the U.S. mission at the United Nations, said: ``We regret that this
happened. We would hope it doesn't happen again, but I don't have
any confidence in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The British also objected.
</P>
<P>
   Agence France-Presse said the flight carried 75 doctors,
athletes and writers who were planning to stay several days.
Diplomats here said they understood that among the passengers were
people planning to take part in a cultural festival in the ancient
city of Babylon, now rebuilt to some degree by President Saddam
Hussein. Iraqi officials greeted the plane when it landed at Saddam
Hussein International Airport in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi government newspaper urged all Arabs and others ``to
take a courageous stand and resume air links with Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The French gesture perplexed diplomats here and deepened
divisions on the Security Council at a critical moment in its
relations with the government of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   France has considerable oil-industry interests in Iraq, but
French diplomats have always argued that those interests are not
its reason for seeking changes in or new interpretations of the
U.N. sanctions. In addition to the sanctions, Britain and the
United States enforce no-flight zones over parts of Iraq, where
Iraqi planes are not supposed to operate.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the council heard from Hans Blix, the new chief arms
inspector for Iraq, about Iraq's continuing refusal to allow
monitoring to resume. The council has no plan for how to meet this
defiance, and diplomats do not expect the United States to push the
issue during a presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting Friday, Blix told reporters that the council
seemed eager to get inspections started, although there has been no
council action. ``There seem to be many people who are guessing
that not much might happen before the American elections,'' he
said. ``I think that might be a good guess.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the
Clinton administration would not use force to make the Iraqis
accept weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Next Tuesday, the Geneva-based commission awarding compensation
to victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 meets in an
atmosphere of crisis because of attempts by France and Russia to
block a reparations payment of $15.9 billion to Kuwait Petroleum
Corp. The United States is now considering whether to force a vote
on the claim, which would normally be approved by consensus. The
commission's members are the same as the nations on the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Russia, France, China and Tunisia, which holds a
rotating Security Council seat, are pressing here to lower the
percentage of Iraqi oil earnings set aside for compensation to 20
percent from 30 percent so more money can go to importing goods for
Iraqi civilian needs. That demand will be a major focus of debate
through the coming weeks and perhaps months.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, now exporting oil at levels nearly as high as before the
1991 war in the Persian Gulf, and at very high prices, is expected
to earn as much as $20 billion this year, the director of the
oil-sales program told the council on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On flights into Baghdad, where Saddam has now reopened the
international airport with some fanfare, Russia, France and China
take the position that sanctions do not cover civilian flights _
which were barred to isolate the Iraqis after their attack on
Kuwait _ if no commercial cargo is involved.

 &HT;    Group races against time to preserve an underground wonderland
endangered by the south's growth
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rusty's Cave is as quiet as a tomb and as artful as a museum. As
long as the clumsy, the malevolent or the profane don't stumble
upon it, it's safe.
</P>
<P>
   For Rusty's, while not a secret, isn't too well known, which has
protected the formations inside. They took thousands of years to
form, and they can shatter in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness, Diane Cousineau of Lafayette and Bill Putnam of
Lawrenceville murmur about enjoying quiet moments in the cool
embrace of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Their headlamps are off. But minutes earlier the lights had
illuminated stalagmites rising from the floor and stalactites
dangling from the ceiling, a few of them coming together to form
columns. Some formations sparkle in hues of red, orange and white,
while others are so thin they're translucent.
</P>
<P>
   Others take the form of a bacon rind or soda straws. One,
nicknamed ``The Fickle Finger of Fate,'' resembles an obscene
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how some people are beautiful and stunning and others
are just as plain as plain can be,'' Cousineau says. ``Caves are
like that, too. Every one is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is a director of the Southeastern Cave Conservancy, which
Cousineau chairs. Over the past several years, the 600-member
organization has spent more than $300,000 to acquire 27 caverns on
15 preserves from West Virginia to Florida. Of that money, $105,000
was spent on Fricks Cave in Georgia, specifically to protect
endangered gray bats.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the caves bought are near the place where Tennessee,
Alabama and Georgia meet, a region with perhaps more caves per
square mile than anywhere else in the United States. ``You have
about 12,000 caves within an hour's drive of Chattanooga,'' says
Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those caves are too small or too ordinary to interest
the conservancy except as a donation. But the region also has some
of the best caves _ such as Neversink and Surprise Pit, both owned
by the conservancy, and Ellisons Cave, which is owned by the state
of Georgia and until recently held the record as the deepest east
of the Mississippi River at 1,063 feet. (A cave just discovered in
Virginia has been measured at 1,200 feet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Land acquisition is our mission,'' says Cousineau. ``We just
need to go out and buy most of the Southeast. It's a modest goal.''
</P>
<P>
   A HIDDEN WILDERNESS
</P>
<P>
   A virtual underground wilderness riddles the Southeastern United
States, from Lafayette, Ga., to Scottsboro, Ala., and north into
Tennessee. The cave network _ full of beauties, dangers and
mysteries _ exists because of the predominance of porous limestone,
which once made moonshining a top regional industry.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has about 500 caves, barely an echo of the 4,000 that
cavers have documented in Alabama. Tennessee, in the past few
years, has recorded about 8,000 caves, which have allowed it to
surpass Missouri, which has recorded 6,000, as the Cave State.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam cautions that the numbers are fluid. He thinks
Tennesseans are more aggressive at hunting for caves than
Missourians, and out West, cavers are notoriously secretive about
their finds. ``Arizona cavers have a saying that there are no caves
in Arizona to speak of,'' he says. ``New Mexico may have 10,000
that nobody has reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the numbers, it's a world open only to those with the
skills and the stomach to push their way underground. It's a
subculture that views 15 inches of crawl space as high.
</P>
<P>
   ```Tight' is when you have to exhale to crawl a few feet,''
jokes Joe Abbott of the Dogwood City Grotto, an Atlanta caving
club.
</P>
<P>
   Those who cave do so for myriad reasons: Biologists study bats;
paleontologists seek fossils; cartographers map one of the last
frontiers; adventurers rappel underground waterfalls or hope to
stumble onto a room the size of a cathedral where nobody has ever
stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people cave for the pretties, some go for the physical
challenges and some go for exploration,'' Cousineau says. ``You
never know what's around the next bend.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the sport has increased in popularity in recent years,
cavers _ ``spelunkers'' is a term they reserve for dilettantes _
make up a closed-mouth fraternity. They've seen too often what has
happened when caves are discovered by the masses: bats killed,
formations broken. Secrecy is the best defense.
</P>
<P>
   `A SACRED PLACE'
</P>
<P>
   Rusty's Cave in northwest Georgia has stayed relatively pristine
because it's on a wooded bluff that's a good hike from the nearest
road. It also requires a 20-foot rappel, which increases the
likelihood that only an experienced caver will enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To most cavers, a cave is almost a sacred place,'' says Jim
Ozier, a biologist for the state of Georgia. ``The idea is to
disturb it as little as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But not far from Rusty's is Howard's Waterfall, a cave with 3.4
miles of passageways containing fossils of creatures from when
Georgia was a sea. There also are signs of modern visitors: stubs
of broken stalactites lining the ceiling and spray-painted
pronouncements of love on the walls. Because its entrance is right
next to the highway, it has become a favorite of teenagers and
curious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't enough to be here,'' Putnam says of the interlopers.
``They break the formations and it sounds like glass breaking, and
they like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard's Waterfall was the conservancy's first cave, and for
several years its only one. Chuck Henson, an Atlanta caver, bought
it and donated it because he feared it would be closed. ``It's a
good cave for kids,'' Henson says. ``And it's pretty when you get
further back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousineau believes that much destruction results more from
ignorance than malevolence. Howard's was discovered decades ago by
a road crew cutting into the mountain, and a gasoline station owner
``mined'' its formations to sell _ unaware that they glistened only
when wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great desire to write your name on a big rock,''
Cousineau says, ``and there is a great desire to collect pretty
things.''
</P>
<P>
   A SLOW START
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, many cavers began to fear that they would be
barred from their favorite territories. Accidents and deaths
prompted some landowners to close caves out of fear of lawsuits, or
they leased land to hunting clubs, which then locked cavers out.
</P>
<P>
   A few cavers formed the conservancy in 1991 to counter the
trend, but the venture stalled for several years. Most of their
brethren, it seemed, were skeptical of the idea of cavers owning
caves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought we were idiots,'' Putnam recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea picked up support after a landowner closed
Neversink in Jackson County, Ala., a 162-foot pit that is a kind of
mecca for vertical cavers. Its stunning entrance has graced the
pages of National Geographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of cavers didn't want to lose one of the best pits in
America for rappelling, and they spent nearly three years trying to
negotiate a purchase. They ended up paying $51,000 for 33 backwoods
acres in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land up there at that time was going for $100 to $400 an
acre,'' says Buddy Lane, the conservancy's treasurer. ``He knew we
wanted that pit real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a great deal for the conservancy, though,
because the crusade fueled membership. Now about half the
membership donates through monthly draws on their credit cards,
which total about $48,000 a year. An additional $9,000 comes in
through dues, and the group also gets grants from conservation and
caving organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has become the premier cave conservancy
nationwide, says Rick Keeler, executive vice president of the
National Speleological Society. He lives in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southeastern Cave Conservancy is way ahead on this _ they
did it real strong,'' Keeler says. ``The SCCI is finding experts in
areas such as biology, hydrology and archaeology to document
reasons why a cave should be purchased or why there should be
access.''
</P>
<P>
   ASSUMING LIABILITY
</P>
<P>
   There are many hurdles in cave acquisition. Some landowners are
distrustful of an organization either buying or leasing their land,
Putnam says. Some have had bad experiences when an injured caver
had to be rescued from a cavern on their property. And some cavers
create ill will by ignoring property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cavers who operate with the innate belief that they
have a God-given right to go in any cave, anytime, anywhere,''
Putnam says. ``Those are the folks who cause the trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy, which is now negotiating for caves in
Tennessee, has persuaded some landowners to lease caves for a
nominal fee of $1 annually by selling them on the idea that it's
taking a liability off their hands. The conservancy provides up to
$7 million in liability coverage on properties it leases, and
although laws in several states, including Georgia, absolve
landowners of liability in most caving accidents, the insurance
gives added comfort in a nation of creative lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lane says the conservancy is exploring subleasing some
properties from hunting clubs or leasing bigger acreage before it's
swallowed up by hunters or developers expanding from Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunters already have a lot of property we would like to
have,'' he says. ``And the Southeast is growing so much, with more
big pieces of open land broken up, and houses going up
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTING BATS
</P>
<P>
   Though the conservancy's main goal is to ensure that cavers have
places to ply their sport, it also has adopted protection of
endangered species as a raison d'etre. It paid $105,000 for Fricks
Cave in Walker County, part-time home to 10,000 endangered gray
bats as well as the Tennessee salamander, which prompted the Nature
Conservancy to provide financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only cave we've bought to specifically protect
bats,'' says Lane, adding that the conservancy paid off the loan
for the 34 acres ahead of schedule last spring. ``We weren't sure
how well cavers would receive it, because it was our single biggest
purchase and we're saying nobody can go in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has been negotiating for a cave near Birmingham
to protect another gray bat colony. In some places _ Tennessee is a
recent example _ there were reports of people killing bats with
everything from shotguns to tennis rackets. Merely entering a cave
where gray bats are nursing can wipe out a generation by causing
frightened mothers to abandon their pups.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are among the few mammals that live in caves. It's more
common to find insects, such as camel-back crickets. Georgia is
trying to catalog cave life, says Ozier, the state biologist, who
partners with the conservancy to study the bats at Fricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that live in a cave that don't live anywhere
else,'' he says. ``We're finding species that have not been
described by science, mostly invertebrates, and which may just live
in a cave or two in Georgia. They may not be pretty to look at or
good to eat or have any obvious use, but that doesn't mean they
should be thrown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cavers fear that the subdivisions sprawling out from
Chattanooga will threaten caves. A golf course community and resort
hotel rising near Fricks Cave has spurred concern that runoff from
chemicals and fertilizer might contaminate ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Another golf course being developed in Dade County also has
raised concern. Roads will come within a few feet of the entrances
to some of the property's 60 caves. The developer has been
discussing with the conservancy how to protect the caves, Putnam
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to work with developers because they're in control _
it's their land. There could be problems with siltation and runoff
into the caves. And then there is the human impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousineau isn't too worried _ yet. She says the topography and
the development's advanced sewer system will protect Fricks, and so
far development hasn't been an impediment to caving. But she can
look to California and Colorado, where housing has crept into
canyons and mountainsides, and see the future for the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a while before we begin to look like California,
but that is the future,'' Cousineau says. ``We're trying to look
way ahead before that happens. It's coming for us. It's already
come for the family farms.''

 &HT;    Pole takes edge off tough season
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Jeremy Mayfield's up-and-down year took an upward
bounce Friday when he won the pole for Sunday's MBNA.com 400 at
Dover Downs International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's No. 12 Ford dashed around Dover's one-mile concrete
track in 159.872 mph to grab the pole over two surprisingly strong
cars: Rick Mast in the No. 14 Pontiac, followed by Johnny Benson in
the No. 10 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   About the only consistent element of Mayfield's season has been
inconsistency. Fairly decent in qualifying, terrible at the finish.
If there's a wreck, his car always seems to find a way to get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five races, Mayfield's had an average start of 12th
(including the pole at Darlington) and an average finish of 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   After a 13th-place finish at Michigan in the Pepsi 400 last
month, Mayfield's finishes have been 35th at Bristol (he wrecked),
41st at Darlington (wrecked), 39th at Richmond (engine failure) and
40th last week at New Hampshire (wrecked).
</P>
<P>
   It's his third pole of the season but only his seventh top-10
start in 27 qualifying sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we have something good happen to us, it pumps us up,
gets our confidence back up,'' Mayfield said. ``We've had a couple
of bad weeks and when you do that, these teams get in slumps. The
guys' morale goes down. We needed this to get right back up.''
</P>
<P>
   He means way back up. ``We're confident that we can win the race
on Sunday,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sounded as if his ambitions were a tad more modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do what we did at Darlington. We don't want
to dominate. That got us in trouble. We'll do whatever we have to
do to be there the last 50 miles. We're going to focus hard on
being there at the end, having the car in one piece and try to win
the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a plan Mast would endorse. He hasn't been there at the
end much of the season. His eighth-place finish at Pocono in July
is his only top 10 in 21 starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   But his team, owned by A.J. Foyt, has been playing catch-up
since changing drivers and crew chiefs seven races into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started with this team, we didn`t have good (cars),''
Mast said. ``We were screwed up aerodynamic-wise, we were screwed
up horsepower-wise, our geometry wasn't right. So anything we did
in that period of time was no good for us now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from here on out, it's just going to continue to get
better.''

 &HT;    Bulldogs need breakout game
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Can the Bulldogs recover from their bitterly
disappointing loss at South Carolina two weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   Georgia fans could get a good indication today. The No. 24
Bulldogs host New Mexico State in Sanford Stadium. Since losing to
the unranked Gamecocks 21-10 on Sept. 9, Georgia's players have
spent much of their time answering criticism about their lackluster
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to forget about it when you live around here,''
Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan said. ``Everybody tells you about it
every day. The reality is it happened, but you've got to focus on
the present task. Every week, we have a new challenge in living up
to our own capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who had aspirations of winning the program's first
SEC title since 1982, haven't done it so far. The defense has
improved under new coordinator Gary Gibbs, but the offense has
looked inept in its first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is ranked 10th in the SEC in offense, ahead of only
Alabama and Mississippi State. The passing game, led by Quincy
Carter at quarterback, is ranked 88th nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make some first downs,'' Carter said. ``We need to
have a better running game and be more efficient with our attack.
We need to make some big plays, too, but consistency is what we're
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies lost to the Gamecocks 31-0 on Sept. 2. But Georgia is
about to face the heart of its SEC schedule and can't afford to
overlook any team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're fairly relaxed,'' Donnan said. ``We're a
little bit on edge, but obviously we should be. Our team's a lot
better than we showed (against South Carolina). We can't worry
about why it happened. It happened and we've got to rectify it.''

 CHINA SHOULD COUNT ITS BLESSINGS ON TRADE VOTE  
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's easy
approval of normalized trade relations with communist China might
be attributed in part to divine intervention.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, one late convert to the trade deal,
said his own reticence about dealing with a nation that has a poor
track record on human rights and religious tolerance was eased by
assurances from the son of the Rev. Billy Graham that open trade
with China could spur gains in individual freedoms there.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Graham heads an evangelical ministry that has distributed
more than 2 million Bibles printed in China to Chinese citizens. In
an appearance before the Senate Finance Committee this spring,
Graham told lawmakers that validating China's status as a full
trading partner ``will not only benefit U.S. businesses and
U.S.-based religious organizations, but will be one further step
towards bettering the relationship between our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said he was among those swayed by the message from a
man who has visited China 40 times. ``His comments were right on
the point,'' Sessions said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Sessions and other Southern Republicans who typically
consider themselves tough on national security and human rights
questions had to swallow hard when voting to grant special
privileges to China. But they argued the economic gains outweighed
other considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free trade benefits all,'' said Florida Republican Connie
Mack, usually a watchdog on human rights issues and a fierce critic
of communist Cuba. But Mack said U.S. monitors must remain
watchful. ``The United States must vigilantly seek enforcement of
all agreements with China, including those addressing human rights
and national security,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all conservatives were sold on the trade package. Hard-liner
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., was one of 15 lawmakers to oppose it as was
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who assailed the lack of a clear U.S.
trade policy and the politics behind the China bill in typically
blunt fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote has been fixed,'' declared Hollings on the Senate
floor. ``This thing has been fixed since midsummer. You know it and
I know it.''
</P>
<P>
   COUNTING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   True to their history of keeping the federal government at arm's
length, Southern states posted some of the lowest rates in the
nation for returning Census forms.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Southern states came in at 65 percent or lower compared to
the national figure of 67 percent, a slight increase over 1990.
South Carolina, Louisiana and Alabama were among the lowest
performers with returns of 59 percent, 60 percent and 61 percent
respectively. However, the overall participation of Southern states
actually improved slightly over 1990, helping to boost the national
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that the South's traditional distrust of
Washington contributes to census apathy as does the large number of
low-income and minority residents who can be hard to reach. But the
resistance can be counterproductive since the federal aid the
region receives is tied to census figures. This year's count wasn't
helped by criticism from Southern politicians that the census
questions _ which Congress approved _ were intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   VETS WORRY
</P>
<P>
   The measure is called the veterans Health Care Personnel Act and
passed the House unanimously, but some veteran advocacy groups fear
it could be an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the proposal is the expansion of a pilot program
that would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to finance
health care for vets at community hospitals if no VA facility is
close by. A few leading vet organizations fear the idea could
ultimately lead to the dismantling of the sacrosanct VA hospital
and clinic system.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cliff Stearns, the Florida Republican who heads a veterans
health panel, said opponents should focus on the benefits of the
trial program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of forcing veterans to travel long distances to the
nearest VA hospital, this program would enable the VA to place
veterans in nearby private hospitals for treatment when there is no
VA presence in that area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GOLD MEDAL MOMENT
</P>
<P>
   As they conducted a press conference on the need for Medicare
drug coverage, Democratic Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts were impressed by the rapt attention
reporters were paying to a chart being used as a prop. Then they
noticed the press corps was actually watching Olympic swimming
events being shown on a television behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say I hope the United States Senate starts paying as
much attention to drugs as the International Olympic Committee has
done,'' said Graham, referring to the IOC's crackdown on
performance enhancing substances.

 &HT;    Lieberman touts child-care plan at Head Start
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. _ On a made-for-TV Friday morning, Joseph
Lieberman hugged a rainbow-colored gaggle of hip-high preschoolers,
touted his ticket's tax break for child-care costs and _ perhaps
most critically _ gave South Florida Democrats another reminder to
get out the vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's hourlong visit to the Head Start Center was his
fourth trip to South Florida in the past five weeks. The vice
presidential nominee was all grins and good-natured jokes as he
played to his crowd _ in this case about 25 members of the press
watching a semicircle of six children and their parents with
Lieberman in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't being hugged by 2 1/2-foot tall potential
constituents, Lieberman preached the importance of Head Start, long
a favorite of Democratic politicians. Surrounded by parents who
leave their 3- and 4-year-olds at Head Start for eight to10 hours a
day, Lieberman said he would make the program available to more
families and hopes to ultimately make preschool available to all 3-
and 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   He and Al Gore are promising to pump an additional $50 billion
into Head Start over the next 10 years as well as pass substantial
tax credits for child-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   The promise is likely to play well among working parents.
According to the Children's Defense Fund, 13 million children under
the age of six spend at least part of the day being cared for by
someone other than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Lieberman's sound bites on child care policy lay a strong
dose of home-stretch politics.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts figure the Gore-Lieberman ticket needs to win
South Florida handily to grab Florida's 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Robert Wexler, who showed up Friday along with
Congressman Alcee Hastings, predicted that with Lieberman on the
ticket, the Democrats could carry South Florida more handily than
Bill Clinton did in 1996. Clinton won the region by nearly 400,000
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are literally lining up at the polls six weeks early to
vote for Lieberman,'' Wexler gushed. ``This is exciting, this is
electric . . . We're going to win here because of Lieberman . . .
All of the moons are in our favor for a big Democratic turnout in
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those moons are a disgust among black people with Gov. Jeb
Bush's One Florida Plan, said Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings predicted that issue alone would motivate black people
to vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman mentioned none of this as he cooed, hugged and hoisted
a half-dozen pint-sized admirers onto his lap.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing three parents _ Oprah-style _ on how the Head
Start program has helped them, he repeated a saying by Jean
Dolivier, who was there with his daughter Rachelle.
</P>
<P>
   Dolivier, 38, explained that in his native Haiti a proverb says
that when you open a school, you close a jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to remember that,'' Lieberman said. ``I'm going to
take that around the country because that's what this is all
about.''

COMMENTARY: NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Richard Nixon tried to prove his '60s hip bona fides
by delivering a ``Sock it to me'' gag on ``Laugh-In'' has there
been a shotgun marriage of show biz and politics more awkward than
George W. Bush's Thursday appearance on ``Live With Regis.'' But
male candidates desperately seeking undecided female voters will do
desperate things. In this case, Bush _ whose co-stars on the show
were a man who breaks boards over his head and the singer Sarah
Brightman _ donned a dark shirt and matching tie from the ``Regis
collection'' and suffered gladly the morning's Kathie Lee wannabe,
the persistently dim Susan Hawk of ``Survivor.'' He at least knew
better than to give her a smooch, as he had Oprah two days before
in his continuing if doomed quest to make up the ground he lost
after Al's Excellent Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   You almost have to feel for Bush. A man who by his own admission
loved ``Cats'' and hasn't been to a movie theater in years, he is
not exactly a slick show-biz hand. John Mellencamp and Tom Petty
have even forbidden him to play their songs at rallies. But swamped
by Al Gore's latest manic chat-show tour (Oprah, Letterman, Leno in
10 days) and Joe Lieberman's (Imus, Conan, Jon Stewart in 24
hours), the poor guy has no choice but to play, even if he doesn't
quite get the game. How long will it be before Dick Cheney starts
quipping big time with Gilbert Gottfried on ``Hollywood Squares''?
</P>
<P>
   Pity Bush. He's so out of it that he may be the only politician
in America, regardless of party, who has not hypocritically
grandstanded about the Federal Trade Commission's ``shocking''
report that entertainment companies market violence and sex to
kids. Instead of offering a glib governmental panacea to curb
Hollywood excesses, Bush warned that Washington schemes to govern
cultural content, ``no matter how well intended or well funded, are
simply no match'' for parental supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the fallen estate of the Bush campaign, however, that
his rational stance was easily drowned out by his opponents'
shameless barrage of TV clowning (take the Manischewitz shtick,
please, Lieberman), moralistic sermonizing and over-the-top Radio
City and Beverly Hills fund-raising. Bush was also sabotaged by his
own self-immolating strategists, who sent their personal Dr. Laura
stand-in, Lynne Cheney, as the ticket's anti-Hollywood emissary to
Congress and political talk shows. With characteristic shrillness
and selective indignation, she condemned Eminem (though, curiously,
without any reference to his homophobic lyrics) and a five-year-old
Miramax movie seen only in art houses (``Kids'') while scrupulously
avoiding mention of more recent violent (``Fight Club'') and
lubricious (``There's Something About Mary'') fare marketed to kids
by the conservative fat cat Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   This whole culture war, of course, is for public consumption
only until Election Day. As Ernest Hollings, the South Carolina
Democrat, observed in last week's Senate Commerce Committee
hearing, there have been 20 hearings by the same committee on kids
and media _ and what do taxpayers have to show for it? The V-chip!
Gore proudly takes credit for that gizmo, but it's no Internet.
Ninety-seven percent of American parents don't use it, according to
a study that another Democrat, John Breaux, cited in the hearing.
The vice president's new placebo for worried moms _ his ultimatum
that Hollywood ``shape up in six months'' or face punitive
legislation _ is just as feeble. Such legislation is more likely a
full-employment program for First Amendment lawyers than an
impediment to any teen-ager's access to Dr. Dre.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Gore's frenzied and often
self-contradictory posturing about Hollywood has been without
meaning. It's a creepy, if G-rated, preview of coming attractions
depicting what his administration may be like at its opportunistic
and pandering worst.
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of culture and children, Gore is repeating his
familiar pattern. It was not until years after his sister died of
lung cancer that he stopped taking tobacco money and boasting of
his tobacco farming so that he could tardily declare Joe Camel
Public Enemy No. 1. According to The Los Angeles Times, the vice
president's embrace of the FTC report is just as sudden a
conversion: a year ago he was reassuring Hollywood executives that
he had nothing to do with President Clinton's post-Columbine
decision to commission it in the first place. Gore pulled a similar
stunt in 1987 when he and Tipper Gore, on the eve of his first
presidential run, groveled behind closed doors before Hollywood
donors to disown as a ``mistake'' Tipper Gore's 1985 anti-rock-smut
crusade, which had led to another high-dudgeon congressional
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even were Gore consistent on this issue, it would still be a
smoke screen to deflect public attention from what's really going
on in the fast-consolidating entertainment industry right now _ and
its potentially deleterious effect on children and parents alike.
The most important matter before the FTC _ and the FCC _ is hardly
the report Gore and Lynne Cheney are hawking but the approval of
pending media mergers like the AOL purchase of Time Warner. These
momentous deliberations are happening off-camera and receive far
less attention from politicians and press.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates here and in Europe believe that an unchecked
AOL Time Warner may have enough technological and economic clout to
dictate how Americans use the coming cable TV-Internet box (and
what content they get at what price). Part of that clout could well
determine what movies and music are pushed to future generations of
children and under what rules. The time is fast arriving when most
kids will rent or purchase their media in the privacy of their own
homes by cable pay-per-view or Internet downloads rather than by
going to multiplexes, Blockbuster or record stores. (Multiplexes
are already a dwindling source of movie distribution _ witness the
recent theater-chain bankruptcies.)
</P>
<P>
   But even as Gore proposes government intervention in
movie-and-music marketing, he offers nothing but dead silence about
AOL Time Warner and other entertainment industry regulatory issues
_ all of which will have a far more lasting effect on the child
culture he purports to hold so close to his heart as a potential
Parent in Chief.

 UNDATED: in Chief.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bush campaign can't call Gore on this. While the vice
president often goes Hollywood _ the Gores even had Disney supply
costly ``Beauty and the Beast'' costumes and a makeup artist for
their 1995 Halloween party _ Bush has actually worked for
Hollywood. As a board member of Silver Screen, which financed
R-rated Disney Touchstone movies, he pocketed $100,000 over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, the political contributions that are most worth
tracking are not those high-profile sums that Gore collected from
movie stars and directors last week. Steven Spielberg, Rob Reiner
and Tom Hanks aren't giving so that Gore will help them let
15-year-olds sneak into ``Saving Private Ryan'' _ they're giving
because they support his traditionally liberal stands on social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Media corporations, by contrast, are seeking favors _ big
regulatory favors that increase their hold on our culture, airwaves
and wallets. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the
two top contributors, Seagram (home of Eminem) and Time Warner,
give extravagantly to both parties. Everyone's in the tank. A new
investigation by the Center for Public Integrity (read it at
www.publicintegrity.org) reveals that some 118 members of Congress,
as well as FCC employees, have traveled as far as Taiwan on
media-corporation junkets.
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't going to challenge these corporations any more than
Gore or Lieberman are, but at least he doesn't condescend to us by
pretending he will. The ingenious trick of Gore's strategy is that
he exploits the vast reach of the entertainment industry to get out
his message of phony threats against the entertainment industry.
And he doesn't risk being grilled about this contradiction since he
has held no press conference with actual journalists, as opposed to
entertainers, since mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Bush can't even begin to compete in this racket. He is so
clueless about show biz that he hoped he might book into Letterman
during his New York visit this week, when the show was in reruns.
Ricki Lake awaits.

KRAFT RECALLS TACO SHELLS CONTAINING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CORN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kraft Foods announced a recall of taco shells Friday after
confirming that they contained a genetically engineered corn not
approved for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The recall is the first in this country of a food made from a
genetically engineered crop, and it is likely to increase the
pressure on the biotechnology industry and the government for
tougher regulations on agricultural biotechnology. Stung by its
experience, Kraft itself issued some recommendations Friday for new
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The corn in question, known as StarLink, is approved for animal
feed but not for human consumption because it has a protein that
has certain characteristics of a food allergen. The protein has not
been proved an allergen, however, and there is no evidence that
anyone has been harmed by eating the taco shells, sold under the
Taco Bell brand.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the unapproved corn in the taco shells was first
reported on Monday by Genetically Engineered Food Alert, a
coalition of environmental and consumer groups critical of
bio-engineered food. While the biotechnology industry's trade
organization challenged the reliability of the test, Kraft said
Friday that it had independently confirmed the presence of the
StarLink corn in multiple samples and production lots.
</P>
<P>
   The recall covers Taco Bell Home Originals packages containing
12 shells and 18 shells as well as the Taco Bell Home Originals
Taco Dinner, which contains 12 shells plus sauce and seasoning.
Kraft, a subsidiary of Philip Morris, said consumers should return
the product to the supermarket where it was purchased, for a full
refund.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mudd, vice president for corporate affairs at Kraft,
said the Taco Bell product line, sold under license from the Taco
Bell restaurant chain, accounted for about $100 million in annual
sales, but that the shells themselves were about half of that. The
company estimates that there are about 2.5 million boxes in stores
and homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Taco Bell chain, which uses shells from the same factory,
said Friday that it had asked its suppliers to start buying flour
from mills other than the one in Texas where the flour in the
suspect shells was made. It said that all the shells in its 7,000
restaurants would be replaced by next week.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has given new ammunition to those calling for
stricter safety testing and labeling of bio-engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as a very poignant cautionary tale that our
regulatory system is not up to the task of preventing potential
problems with genetically engineered food,'' said Joseph Mendelson
III, legal director of the Center for Food Safety, a Washington
advocacy group that is part of Genetically Engineered Food Alert.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the Food and Drug Administration and in the
biotechnology industry said that this was a case of food
contamination, not a problem with regulations, and they noted that
StarLink was the only biotech crop approved for use by animals but
not people.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the incident shows how difficult it can be to
contain genes once they get into the field and how hard it can be
to keep different varieties of crops from commingling. Europe has
been shaken this year by several incidents in which crops were
found to contain small amounts of genetically modified material
that they were not supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how the contamination occurred in this case.
But pollen from genetically modified plants can fertilize
nonmodified crops in nearby fields. Also, some genetically modified
seed can be left in barges or trucks that are later used to carry
nonmodified crops.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency are
investigating the taco shell contamination and could take actions,
including revoking the market approval of StarLink.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents like this one could help drive a wedge between the
agricultural biotech companies and the food companies, which have
generally supported biotechnology. Some food companies, like
McDonald's and Frito-Lay _ though not Kraft _ have already cut back
on some use of bio-engineered crops out of fear that consumers
would reject them, not safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft recommended Friday that in the future products not be
approved for animal use if they were not approved for human use as
well. It also called for a fully validated testing procedure to be
available to detect the presence of a genetically modified crop in
food. It also called for ``mandatory review'' by the government of
all crops before the crops enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   StarLink, developed by Aventis CropScience, is a type of BT
corn, meaning it has a gene from the bacillus thuringiensis
bacterium that allows it to produce a protein toxic to a pest, the
European corn borer. The question that confronted regulators was
whether this protein could cause allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the StarLink bacterial protein, known as Cry9C, has not
been in the human diet before, there are no people with known
allergies from whom to obtain blood. So scientists were left to use
indirect methods that usually cannot provide a clear answer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Proteins that are destroyed in the stomach are considered
unlikely to cause allergic reactions. But tests showed that the
Cry9C protein did not break down quickly in an acid bath that
simulates the stomach, raising a red flag. A governmental
scientific advisory panel concluded there was ``no evidence to
indicate that Cry9C is or is not a potential food allergen.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA on Friday called Kraft's action ``prudent,'' but
officials at the agency rejected claims by the biotech critics that
the agency had been slow to act, saying it had first to confirm the
allegations. ``This is not a case where we have illnesses or health
problems,'' said James Maryanski, the agency's biotech food
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft purchased the finished taco shells, which were made in
Mexicali, Mexico, in a factory owned by Sabritas, a subsidiary of
PepsiCo. The corn flour came from a mill in Plainview, Texas, owned
by Azteca Milling LP, a major flour producer.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis CropScience, a division of the big European drug company
Aventis SA, said the StarLink corn is grown on only 315,000 acres,
or less than one-half of 1 percent of American corn acreage. The
company said it requires farmers to make sure that the corn is used
or sold only for animal feed. Aventis said in a statement that it
``understands and supports'' Kraft's decision but did not feel that
the presence of StarLink corn in the taco shells had been
confirmed.

ANNE DYSON, 52, EDUCATOR, PEDIATRICIAN AND PHILANTHROPIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Anne E. Dyson, a pediatrician known for her
philanthropy in the field of children's welfare, died Friday at her
home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson died after a yearlong struggle with breast cancer,
according to a statement from the Dyson Foundation, a family
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   She was a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Cornell
University's medical school and was on the faculty at the
University of Illinois College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1947, Dyson received her undergraduate degree from New
York University. After attending New York Medical College, she
completed an internship at St. Christopher's Hospital in
Philadelphia and then did her residency at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said that she concluded from her exposure to patients from
Philadelphia's poor neighborhoods that doctors need some training
outside the hospital walls to learn how the community affected
patients' health.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Dyson Foundation, founded in 1957 by her
parents, Margaret and Charles Dyson, she started a program to help
hospitals extend their pediatric training to include topics like
violence, teen-age pregnancy and single-parent homes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her foundation work, Dyson was the chairwoman of
the board of the Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, which sends children
with cancer and other illnesses to summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is survived by her husband, Michael S. Kramer, the
managing editor of The Daily News; her sons, Roberto Hull and Mac
Hull; her stepson, Ben Kramer; and three brothers, John S. Dyson of
Millbrook, N.Y., an economic adviser to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
a former deputy mayor of New York, Robert R. Dyson, chairman and
chief executive of Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a privately held investment
company in Manhattan, and Peter L. Dyson, president of a private
investment firm in Kenilworth, Ill.

 &HT;    Savannah teenager happy to medal
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The only lifting Cheryl Haworth plans in the next few
days is her suitcase. It will be heavier than the one she brought
over _ by the weight of a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Another page was turned Friday in a story too strange for
fiction. The kid from Savannah elevated the loaded bar six times
without flinching and took third among 11 women Olympic
super-heavyweight lifters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't ask for a better day,'' said Haworth, 17, a mature,
300-pound gifted sketch artist who was barely familiar with the
sport during the Atlanta Games. ``I feel like I could have done
more.''
</P>
<P>
   In undramatic fashion, Haworth was positioned by her coach,
Michael Cohen, for bronze early on. To them, any hue of medal would
do, and Cohen turned conservative in his choice of weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming in that catching the other two athletes was a
formidable task,'' Cohen said. ``After the snatch, we knew (a gold
or silver) was out of reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Each entrant opened with three attempts in the snatch, a lift in
one continuous motion. Haworth topped out at 125 kilograms (275
pounds), a personal best by 5kg but well behind Meiyuan Ding of
China at 135 and Agata Wrobel of Poland at 132.5.
</P>
<P>
   In the clean-and-jerk, the lifter raises the bar to under her
chin, stops and pushes it skyward. It is Haworth's stronger suit,
and she would have three tries to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   As supporters from Savannah shouted ``Fun,'' her nickname,
Haworth hoisted 140kg. When Ding started with 157.5 and Wrobel 150,
the silver was out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen had intended to move Haworth to 145. But with Carmenza
Delgado on Haworth's heels, he elected to increase the weight in
smaller increments and avoid the risk of failed lifts.
</P>
<P>
   With Haworth settling for 142.5 on the second clean-and-jerk and
Delgado nailing 145, the gap was down to 7.5.
</P>
<P>
   But hitting 145 (319 pounds) put her beyond reach of Delgado,
justifying Cohen's strategy. For the first time all day, she broke
into a smile.

 &HT;    Upstarts doing it their way
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _The other U.S. soccer team is far away from the Olympic
glare in South Australia, not to mention well out of the public
spotlight back home.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. men's team is gradually turning some heads as it
already has made a modest slice of Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in Adelaide, the American men meet another soccer
upstart in Japan in the quarterfinals with the chance to become the
more intriguing Olympic soccer story from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For the first U.S. men's team ever to make it out of group play,
this match is more than historic. The chance to play for a medal
might still seem like a longshot, but the importance it bears in
the growth of the men's professional and international game
contains more intangibles than that.
</P>
<P>
   While the better-known women's team is in the semifinals, the
men have quickly come together to generate a modicum of mainstream
media interest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best teams I've been around as far at team
spirit is concerned,'' said goalkeeper Brad Friedel, one of the
three over-23 players on the team. ``It is not easy to get a group
of 23-year-olds together who have conducted themselves as
professionally as these guys have.''
</P>
<P>
   The esprit de corps is not overrated. The women's team
repeatedly talks up its togetherness, how players love, care for
and play for one another. The men are doing it too, although in
more playful fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Before a convincing 3-1 win over Kuwait on Tuesday, former
Parkview High star Josh Wolff was trying to conduct an interview.
But fellow forward Chris Albright, a moppy-haired practical
jokester, couldn't resist taking a dig at one of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're acting like you're one of our big finishers,'' cracked
Albright, making fun of the hit-or-miss quality of Wolff's scoring
chances in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Red-faced, Wolff tried to ignore the barb, but it underscored
how loose and relaxed this bunch has been.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they're the first generation of American men's
players to along that has had the expectation of providing some
substantial results.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 1994 World Cup, the U.S. Soccer Federation poured
greater resources into men's youth programs. Last year, the
Under-17 team finished a respectable fourth in the Youth World Cup.
Midfielder Landon Donovan, who starred in the Kuwait game, was
given the Golden Ball award as the tournament most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the 18 players compete in Major League Soccer, and
many, like Wolff, are missing important playoff games. The heart of
the MLS season prevented the Olympians from spending more time
together. They played two friendly matches before heading Down
Under and even coach Clive Charles, who coaches the men's and
women's teams at the University of Portland, admittedly watches
very little MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance to make a name for ourselves,'' said Wolff,
who has been a key figure in the Olympic run. ``We can't compare
ourselves with what the women have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Their Japanese opponents cut some similar cloth. Desperately
trying to develop their national team programs, Japan is taking its
Olympic mission seriously because of its role as a co-host for the
2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only halfway there,'' Donovan said. ``We can't get too
excited yet. We want to be able to play for a medal.''

 &HT;    Training partners so close they tie
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Gary Hall Sr. remembers giving Anthony Ervin a hug at
the U.S. trials after Ervin and Gary Hall Jr. made the Olympic team
in the 50-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You know, maybe we'll be lucky and we'll tie in
Sydney,''' Hall Sr., a three-time Olympian himself, recalled. ``I
said, ``That would be great, wouldn't it?' And I thought, `What are
the chances of that happening?'''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good, it turns out. Hall and Ervin, training partners in
Phoenix, tied for the gold medal Friday with a time of 21.98
seconds. Pieter van den Hoogenband, the Dutch swimmer who won the
100 and the 200 freestyles, was third in 22.03 for his fourth
Olympic medal. The legendary Alexander Popov of Russia, who was
seeking his third straight title, took sixth in 22.24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind sharing the gold medal podium,'' said Hall, who
won his first individual gold medal. ``I couldn't be sharing it
with a nicer guy.''
</P>
<P>
   They both train at the Phoenix Swim Club where they hit punching
bags as part of their regimen and munch on a supplement they call
``horse bars'' because they are also taken by the Kentucky Derby
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just pushed ourselves to limits that otherwise I wouldn't
have reached if we'd been training on our own,'' said Hall, who
amused the crowd when he kissed his biceps during his introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic tie was the first since 1984, when Nancy Hogshead
and Carrie Steinseifer won the 100-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the frosty podium behavior of Dara Torres and Jenny
Thompson when they tied for third Thursday in the 100 freestyle,
Hall and Ervin enjoyed sharing the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race wasn't even that much about fast times as it was
about racing,'' Ervin said, ``and the fiercest racers ended up on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin said he had tied in a race once before. ``One time at
junior nationals,'' he said. ``I tied for 24th place.''
</P>
<P>
   The medal was the first individual gold for the Hall family. The
elder Hall won two silvers and a bronze but never reached the top
step of the podium. His son was relieved to see him Friday after
learning that his dad spent a scary night in the emergency room two
days earlier. The Sydney flu had turned into toxic shock syndrome,
an incident which Hall Sr. had tried unsuccessly to keep from his
son.
</P>
<P>
   For Hall, who will turn 26 on Tuesday, the gold medal was the
culmination of an incredible comeback. He sank into a depression
when he was diagnosed with diabetes in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the lowest low of his life a year ago,'' his father
said. ``I was more concerned about him living than swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes affects Hall's training, but he's able to control
it with medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice to overcome so much adversity,'' said Hall, who
also has won a bronze in the 100 freestyle and a silver in the 400
free relay. ``The diabetes was really a factor in my life, not just
my swimming career. To win at the Olympics is something that was
never expected, I don't think by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall wants to be an inspiration for people with diabetes. ``I
hope my efforts and my accomplishments have proven to the rest of
the world,'' he said, ``that diabetes or any other disease doesn't
have to be the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, 19, is the first swimmer of African-American descent to
make the U.S. team, as well as the first to win a gold medal.
Ervin's father is part African-American, part Native American, and
his mother is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out this year, I wasn't expecting anything
remotely close to what I've accomplished,'' said Ervin, whose first
major title was NCAA champion. ``And just as things kept going, I
just kept building this momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he's reluctant to offer himself as a spokesman for
African-Americans. ``Like I said before...'' Ervin said, turning to
Hall to ask, ``What did I say before?'' He then continued, ``I've
always been proud of my heritage... I don't think of it as being
the first of this, the first of that. I just go out there and try
to do the best for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was younger, Ervin, who has a very light complexion,
would check multiple boxes when forms asked about his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to pin me down into saying one definitive
thing, when it's never been an issue for me,'' he said. ``I never
really thought about it. I feel in American society today,
something in the nature of having diverse blood would be not that
big a deal.''

BLACK HARVARD LAW STUDENTS HOLD REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As civil rights workers headed south in the mid-1960s
to register blacks to vote, Reginald Gilliam left Harlem and headed
north to Harvard University's Law School.
</P>
<P>
   With a law degree in hand, Gilliam was confident that he would
have the necessary skills to begin advocating for the rights of
disenfranchised blacks.
</P>
<P>
   For Arianne de Govia, 24 _ a third-year law student from
Trinidad _ a degree from Harvard Law School is the perfect tool to
secure her place on the corporate legal ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because of the name and the opportunities,'' she
said. ``You can get everything and anything here at Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend Harvard has invited all 1,500 of its
African-American law school alumni back to campus, the first
reunion of its kind. The purpose: to pay tribute to their
ground-breaking accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But the reunion also offers a study in contrasts, between
members of the old guard like Gilliam and de Govia's new
generation.
</P>
<P>
   During Gilliam's time on campus, it was widely assumed that a
black attorney who trained at Harvard would use his education to
help end social injustice. De Govia's generation, however, faces no
such burden; indeed, their options now include the corporate world
as well as civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two generations are linked by one common fact:
African-American students at one of the nation's elite law schools
have never had it easy.
</P>
<P>
   Though black students have attended Harvard Law for more than a
century _ the first, George Lewis Ruffin, graduated in 1869 and
went on to become Massachusetts' first black judge _ there has
always been turmoil, at least in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   For Gilliam, 55, going to Cambridge meant leaving behind a
comfortable world _ his Harlem neighborhood and Lincoln University,
a historically black college _ for one in which he could
practically count his classmates on the fingers of both hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a part of the largest class of black students (15) that
Harvard recruited from the historically black colleges,'' said
Gilliam, who is a senior lobbyist in Washington. ``And when we got
there, we faced a real culture shock. Boston and the law school was
hostile to blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gilliam said, the white professors seemed to avoid
calling on black students, and when they did their voices dripped
with the assumption that the student hadn't studied.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there were the so-called ``black days,'' Gilliam said.
Instructors would deliberately spend the entire class calling only
on black students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to see if we were prepared,'' he said. They wanted
to engage in an intentionally humiliating experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For de Govia, such behavior is almost inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of a generation that came of age well after the
civil rights battles of the 1960s, she believes that Harvard Law
School has made great strides in enrolling minorities. It's all but
assumed, she said, that Harvard will have black law students; the
issue is how many.
</P>
<P>
   She and other students think there should be more. Out of each
years' first-year class of 550, African-Americans comprise slightly
less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is still a challenge being a black person at
Harvard law school today'' because the black student community is
so small, said de Govia. ``But it's so much better now because of
those who came before us.''
</P>
<P>
   And that has transformed expectations as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 60s, spurred by sit-ins, protest marches and
speeches, Gilliam and his black classmates felt pressure from the
community _ and their consciences _ to study civil rights law and
join the fight. But by the early 1980s _ the age of Ronald Reagan,
Wall Street wealth and a burgeoning black middle class _ more
students were concentrating on all types of law, ranging from
corporate and tax to entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But others absorbed the lessons of their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Martin Phalen, 33, who started the Bell Foundation, a
program that works with elementary children, who felt compelled to
use his degree to work on social justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of work to be done, especially as it
relates to inequalities around education, economic status and
political participation,'' said Phalen, who graduated in 1993.
``There are glaring disparities that still exist in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the civil rights struggle for black law school students
in the 60s was clear, both on and off campus, successive
generations of black students say that there are still more ground
to cross.
</P>
<P>
   They point to tenure fights for black professors at Harvard as
well as the recent attack on affirmative action at high-profile law
schools in Texas and California, country as evidence that racial
discrimination against minorities still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ogletree, Class of 1978 and a tenured member of the
faculty, has seen significant progress on both sides of the
lectern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have seven tenured and tenured track professors at the
law school,'' said Ogletree. ``We've gone from a low to a high of
seven. I don't know if any major law school can come close to

   But most say Harvard Law School has come a long way, as
evidenced by its distinguished black alumni: Kenneth I. Chenault,
the new CEO of American Express; District of Columbia Mayor Anthony
Williams; and U.S Court of Appeals Judge Judith W. Rogers, who are
graduates of the law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Harvard has made a committment to recruiting
black students,'' said Pamela Everhart, 42, a 1990 graduate of the
school who now works as a corporate executive at Fidelity Bank.
``There were enough black students at the law school that I didn't
feel alone.''

BUSH CALLS GORE POLITICAL `FLIP-FLOPPER' ON USING U.S. OIL
RESERVES

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ A day after Vice President Al Gore called for
tapping federal oil reserves, Gov. George W. Bush sought to turn
the proposal into a test of character: He accused his opponent of
turning ``political somersaults,'' and proclaimed that voters
``don't want flip-floppers as president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sharply stepped up his rhetoric against Gore as he
campaigned across Florida, a state that Republicans once thought
would be safely theirs, in part because Bush's brother Jeb is
governor. It was Bush's second campaign trip here in just two weeks
and his sixth since the Republican primaries ended.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also pledged before a warmly supportive audience of the
elderly in Sun City that he would promote medical advances ``with
new resources and new resolve'' by doubling funding for the
National Institutes of Health and by more than doubling the budget
of the National Cancer Institute over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative new spending over 10 years would amount to $67
billion. Congressional Republicans have already embarked year by
year on the same goal, and President Clinton has been signing the
annual increases into law.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Bush's campaign plane touched down in Sarasota
on Florida's west coast, he was on the offensive, trying to stoke
perceptions that Gore is inconstant and too political. He pointed
to the fact the Democrat's call for the White House to release oil
from government stockpiles to stabilize prices _ which President
Clinton agreed to do later in the day _ was a reversal of Gore's
own stand from last winter when prices were significantly lower
than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be interesting to America to hear the facts,'' Bush
shouted out at an airport rally in Sarasota under a scorching sun.
``Last winter my opponent opposed the plan to use the strategic
petroleum reserve. He was right then. But now we're getting close
to the time when we find out, who's steady, who's got a vision, who
doesn't listen to polls and focus groups, how he has flip-flopped
on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``The reason why Florida is going to vote for this
team is because they don't want flip-floppers as the president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   And at another point, Bush said, ``Florida wants to turn back
from the past of double talking, of changing positions, of just
kind of talking one way and doing another.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a week in which Bush put a new focus on
the issues in a ``cradle to grave'' tour designed to show that he
has proposals that would help middle-class voters at every stage of
their lives. And each day he has drawn contrasts between his plan
and those of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign never gave up questions about Gore's character
and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Pouncing on every recent misteps by Gore, Karen Hughes, Bush's
communications director, told reporters that in just one week Gore
had muted his criticism of Hollywood, run into a controversy over
whether he had embellished a story about the costs his
mother-in-law pays for prescription drugs, ``remembered a childhood
lullaby'' that had not been written until he was older, and called
for tapping the oil reserves ``after saying eight months ago it was
a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush tried to use the spike in oil prices to bolster one of
his broader themes: his charge that President Clinton and Gore
``have not led.'' Consumers, he said, wonder ``where the
administration has been for the last seven years; where was the
plan?''
</P>
<P>
   A series of recent polls show Bush and Gore running neck and
neck in Florida, which narrowly voted for Bush's father in 1992,
but which voted for Clinton in 1996. Both parties have poured
millions of advertising dollars into the state.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush talked extensively about his Social Security and
Medicare proposals at his next stop in Sun City, he also tried to
woo older voters with his proposals on medical research. He was
introduced by Sen. Connie Mack, who told the crowd about his own
family's experiences with cancer _ how his brother had died at 35
of melanoma, how his wife had survived breast cancer, and how he
himself had survived melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Bush compared his goal for medical research to John F. Kennedy's
challenge to the nation to put a man on the moon: ``I will fund and
lead a medical moonshot to reach far beyond what seems possible
today and discover new cures for age-old afflictions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also reminded his listeners that Richard Nixon, as
president, had declared a war on cancer, and Bush pledged to renew
that cause. He pointed to increased cancer survival rates and the
progress that had been made in curing diseases like leukemia ``that
tragically touched my own family,'' referring to the death of his
sister, Robin, who died of leukemia as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was repeatedly given standing ovations during a town hall
meeting with older voters in the Kingspoint Theater in the Sun City
Center. And when he again referred to Gore's propsoal that the
United States tap the oil reserve, people started yelling out
``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my position,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush made his signature pledge to restore ``honor and
integrity'' to the White House, he was cheered with applause and
another standing ovation. His first questioner appeared to catch
the crowd's mood when she asked, ``Are you going to be able to have
a big enough shovel to clean up Washington?''

 &HT;    With Perec out, Freeman lights up track
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ She made just one appearance that lasted less than a
minute, but Cathy Freeman was the star of the evening session of
Olympic track and field Friday. Nonetheless, she had to share the
spotlight with the United States' Marion Jones and Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman in the 400 meters and sprinters Jones and Green advanced
in their respective events with efforts that thrilled the sold-out
Olympic Stadium crowd of more than 100,000. Also, an expected star
of the evening, Canada's Donovan Bailey, flamed out. The defending
Olympic 100-meter champion, who finished third in his heat in the
morning session, came in last and failed to qualify when he gave up
after about 25 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, first up on the stage, gave no indication she was
overwhelmed by her first Olympic performance at home. She was last
seen lighting the cauldron to start the Games. Under that flame
Friday, she zoomed into the finals of the 400 meters with a
first-place finish in the third heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian of aboriginal roots justified the rousing ovation
she received in the prerace introduction with a time of 51.63
seconds to beat American Monique Hennagan by one-tenth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   As Freeman rounded the track in long, graceful strides,
flashbulbs clicked. The lights and consistent roaring gave the
effect of a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeman was not about to let the atmosphere _ or Marie-Jose
Perec's absence _ affect her performance. ``I wasn't sure how I was
going to handle the crowd,'' she said. ``Nor was I going to
underestimate anyone. Everything felt good. I'm looking forward to
the second round.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's anticipated chief competitor in the 400 _ Perec, the
defending Olympic champion _ was nowhere to be found. She bolted
Sydney early Thursday morning amid reports she had been verbally
threatened by a man who forced his way into her room. That incident
has been widely viewed as a Perec fantasy. A feeling permeates that
the temperamental star from France was not in condition to
successfully defend her medals (she's the 200-meter champion, too)
and concocted the story as a way of drawing sympathy as she
withdrew from the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Perec, who holds the Olympic record in the 400 at 48.25, was
scheduled to run in the fifth qualifying heat. Katharine Merry of
Great Britain ended up winning that race in 51.61.
</P>
<P>
   In her second 100-meter qualifying heat of the day, Jones was
strong on a cool, breezy night. Wearing a blue body suit, Jones
blew out the field in 10.83, fastest time in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to have the first day complete,'' she said.
``My focus this evening was to set up for tomorrow. That's why I
put a bit more into the race than I did earlier (in the day).''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she'll put up a faster number in the next round.
``I'll run much faster than 10.83,'' she said. ``I'm capable of
10.70.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a wink of an eye, she was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Latasha Colander-Richardson advanced in the
400 by winning her heat. Colander-Richardson, who got married in
February and has had injury troubles, she was elated to advance
without pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good,'' she said. ``And no injury. My goal was to make
it back, and I have so that's exciting. Now we've got to keep on
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlene Ottey just keeps on going. The Jamaican sprinter
participating in her fifth Olympics advanced to the semifinals in
the 100 meters by winning her heat in 11.08.

 &HT;    Sprinters coast through initial round
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Making it look easy, Michael Johnson put in the
equivalent of a practice run during the first round of the 400
meters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he stepped on an Olympic track, Johnson made
history by crushing the 200-meter world record in what is now
Turner Field. He's since stamped his name on the 400 record. But in
the first day of track competition, Johnson worked on the
acceleration phase of his race and then eased up by design after
the halfway mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get up to race pace, come through the first
200 strong and work the curve a little,'' said Johnson, winning his
heat in 45.25 seconds. ``Mission accomplished. Everything is
feeling really good. It felt pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an equally good first day for the American team, which
advanced all three athletes entered in the sprints, including the
men's 400, men's and women's 100 and women's 800 meters. The 100
favorites, Marion Jones and Maurice Greene, exerted just enough to
win their qualifying races as they eye the finals Saturday. Jones
kicked off her bid for five gold medals with an 11.20 clocking,
almost jogging by the finish.
</P>
<P>
   American teammates Alvin Harrison and Antonio Pettigrew could be
part of a medals sweep with Johnson in the 400, and neither has
quit on aspirations of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectation is to go home with two gold medals,'' said
Pettigrew, who grew up in Macon and graduated from Southwest Macon.
``I'm here to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Johnson's favorite status, Pettigrew said, ``You
can't make any assumptions here. You just have to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettigrew won his heat in 45.62, but it was a long wait getting
to the line. His name popped up in the last of nine heats, then he
had to cope with two runners false starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just ticked me off, because it's not that hard to start
the 400,'' Pettigrew said. ``A case of the nerves, I guess. This is
the Olympic Games, but you have to try and treat it like any other
meet. It was tough to wait until the last heat and then all the
false starts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 800 qualifier, the Clark crew _ Hazel Clark, Jearl
Miles-Clark and Joetta Clark Diggs _ advanced from separate heats
to the second round. Hazel, a former University of Florida star,
had the most trouble, being boxed in coming off the final turn and
needing to run hard to free herself.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Marion and Maurice Show should be in full effect
Saturday. The finals of the men's and women's 100 meters in track
and field will be shown, and all eyes will be on Americans Marion
Jones and Maurice Greene, the respective favorites in each event.
There's also the swimming finals of the men's and women's 400-meter
medley relay, while Dara Torres and Amy van Dyken try to increase
the U.S. medal count in the 50-meter freestyle. American Erik Vendt
also hopes to challenge for a spot on the medal platform in the
men's 1500-meter freestyle. Meanwhile, during the afternoon session
on NBC, the NBA stars plan to re-establish their dominance against
New Zealand after the close call against Lithuania. The
quarterfinals and semifinals in women's beach volleyball and the
women's synchronized springboard final in diving are also on the
afternoon schedule. MSNBC (TV 33) will have the United States vs.
Cuba in baseball; and the U.S. softball team in a must-win
situation against Italy to retain any hope of repeating as the gold
medalists. There's also the U.S. men against Japan in soccer; while
CNBC will have USA-Croatia in water polo to go along with its usual
dose of boxing.

COMMENTARY: CORRECTING A MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hardly anyone noticed, but the House of Representatives
did something rare and admirable the other day. It voted to correct
a legislative mistake that has had cruel consequences for thousands
of legally admitted aliens: the retroactive deportation feature of
the 1996 Immigration Act.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law defined as ``aggravated felonies'' requiring
deportation a large number of offenses, including minor
misdemeanors. And it applied the new definition retroactively, so
that people who had been convicted before 1996 were subject to
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   I have described, in columns, some harsh human results of the
1996 law. Mary Anne Gehris, who was brought to this country from
Germany as an infant 33 years ago, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
in 1988 for pulling another woman's hair in a quarrel. She avoided
deportation only when her home state pardoned her. Others were not
so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The bill just passed by the House provides that aliens who were
convicted of an ``aggravated felony'' before passage of the 1996
act can avoid deportation. Moreover, the bill allows those who have
already been deported under the retroactive clause to apply for
readmission. The bill now goes to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Aliens have little or no political influence. How, then, did
this bill get through the House _ without a dissenting voice, as it
happens?
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories about the wrenching of people from their families
for deportation troubled Americans. People asked me why retroactive
deportations did not violate the clause of the Constitution barring
ex post facto laws. (The answer is that the bar applies only to
criminal laws, and deportation has always been treated by the
courts as non-criminal.)
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress urged broad changes in the 1996 act, such
as reducing the number of ``aggravated felonies'' and restoring
judicial review. Republicans resisted those changes. But Lamar
Smith, a principal author of the 1996 act and chairman of the House
immigration subcommittee, was ready to support a limited reform. He
worked with liberal Democrats, notably Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, to produce the bill that passed.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor such ideological opposites as Frank and Henry Hyde,
Republican of Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
spoke for the bill. When a crime was committed long ago, Hyde said,
and aliens ``have clearly rehabilitated themselves,'' deportation
``seems an extreme remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank made the point that the House vote contradicted the idea
``that only big money dominates politics.'' The bill ``will mean a
great deal to many people,'' he said, ``and to my knowledge there
are not a lot of campaign contributors among them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hyde and Frank said that without the new bill the
Immigration and Naturalization Service should have used its
discretion not to pursue deportations where, in Hyde's words, ``the
facts called out for forbearance.'' But there is too little wise
forbearance in the INS, as a new horror story this week showed.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Young is the German wife of an American, Rick Young, who
brought her to Portland, Ore. As described in an article by Richard
Read in The Oregonian, she was nursing her year-old daughter on
July 18 when INS officers arrested her. She was handcuffed and
chained, twice strip-searched, then deported and barred from
returning to the United States for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because she did not have the proper visa. An INS official
in Portland said the law gave him no choice. So much for discretion
_ or common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at INS headquarters in Washington were distressed at
the story. A spokesman said to me, ``It won't happen again.'' And,
he said, ``We're ready to help Claudia Young come back.''
</P>
<P>
   What that story tells us is that amending unjust immigration law
is necessary _ but it is also necessary to remove a harsh rigidity
that persists in INS ranks.
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish that human change is to lay down
guidelines explaining to INS agents that they have discretion to
use what Henry Hyde called ``forbearance,'' and then to train them
in its use. The INS has promised for many months to issue just such
guidelines. Officials now say that the guidelines and training
should come soon. It cannot be soon enough.

 &HT;    Enough scandals! U.S. cleared in ticket selling
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The U.S. Olympic Committee has been cleared of selling
tickets to the scalpers flourishing on Sydney's streets.
</P>
<P>
   USOC spokesman Mike Moran said an investigation by Sydney
Olympic organizers of scalped passes had found ``not one bearing
the name USOC.''
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators had found tickets from Cartan Tours, the
officially licensed U.S. outlet for Olympic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee had said it was
investigating reports in the Australian news media that tickets
from Olympic committees from several rich countries, including the
United States, were winding up in the hands of scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   IOC rules forbid any agency other than the local organizing
committee from selling tickets in the host country of the Games,
and organizing committees also have licensing agreements with the
organizers to prevent them from selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   NO WORRY, THEY'RE HARMLESS
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Stadium has some unexpected _ and annoying _ visitors:
giant moths.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of bogong moths, migrating from dry areas of
Queensland to the cool Snowy Mountains, have detoured to Sydney and
been drawn to the lights at the 110,000-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moths will flock to such a light and at this time of year
you're just asking for it,'' entomologist Sharon Cory told The
Australian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The moths, with a wingspan about the size of a sparrow, have
swarmed around the towering floodlights but also have swooped down
to the track, getting into the faces of some athletes as they
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the moths are harmless.
</P>
<P>
   AND THE SURVEY SAYS . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of U.S. adults consider themselves fans of the
Olympics, more than any sport, according to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris Interactive poll, released Friday, showed the NFL was
second, with 82 percent of adults considering themselves fans.
College football was next with 68, followed by baseball with 62.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the Internet survey of more than 12,700
Americans 18 and older:
</P>
<P>
   _ 64 percent of those surveyed would rather watch Olympic events
live, as they occur, than on tape.
</P>
<P>
   _ 55 percent of women are interested in seeing athlete profiles
during television coverage; 45 percent of men are.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diving and gymnastics tie as the most popular summer Olympic
sports among women; basketball was top choice among men.
</P>
<P>
   _ 18 percent of those surveyed only watch events where U.S.
athletes are expected to do well.
</P>
<P>
   _ 34 percent get most of what they need from the Olympics from
highlights or regular news.
</P>
<P>
   _ 81 percent of those surveyed have positive feelings about the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   _ 73 percent feel Olympic athletes provide role models for kids.
</P>
<P>
   SAMARANCH RETURNS TO GAMES
</P>
<P>
   On his first day back in Sydney after attending his wife's
funeral in Barcelona, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was out
and about _ even taking in an exhibit of ancient Greek artifacts at
the Powerhouse Museum downtown. Museum officials appeared to be
holding their breath while the famously petulant Samaranch weaved
his way among the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, whose head wobbles slightly because of Parkinson's
disease, is 80 years old and rarely smiles. So when a reporter
approached him to ask him what he thought of the show, he paused
for a moment and then said tersely: ``Fantastic. First class. At
the same level of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Crown Prince of Nepal visited at the Sydney
Aquarium at Darling Harbour on Thursday.

<P>
   TAKING A BREAK FROM `SEX'
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker, star of HBO's ``Sex and the City,'' is
attending the Games. She and her sister have been particularly
interested in the sailing events.
</P>
<P>
   CHEER UP, MATE
</P>
<P>
   Aussie Ian Thorpe tried to cheer up teammate Daniel Kowalski,
who swam the morning preliminary of the 800-meter freestyle relay,
but not the final. Thorpe staged a mock presentation ceremony for
Kowalski near the warm-down pool at the Sydney International
Aquatic Center. ``He put the medal around my neck and told me to
hold on to it, but I couldn't,'' Kowalski said. ``I gave it back.''
However, Kowalski will receive his own gold medal for his
contribution. Thorpe, meanwhile, has cashed in to the tune of
$72,500. He became the first recipient of the Australian Olympic
Committee's medal reward scheme, which offers $15,000 to each gold
medalist, $7,500 for silver and $5,000 for bronze. The optimistic
AOC has set aside $1.8 million. Australia Post will chip in $20,000
for gold.
</P>
<P>
   SO MUCH FOR SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   More than $100,000 in Olympic souvenirs have been stolen from
the SuperStore. Security officers and hidden cameras are being
used, but Olympic spectators have still been able to sneak out
merchandise. One way to keep people from pilfering small items is
to make them put their backpacks, purses, etc. into a duffle bag,
which is then sealed with a tie string. However, people are walking
out with the duffle bags.

 &HT;    IAAF official: U.S. track hiding drug test details
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Allegations that U.S. officials failed to disclose
details of at least a dozen positive drug tests are ``absurd,'' the
head of USA Track &AMP; Field says.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ljungqvist, chief anti-doping official of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, accused the U.S. association of
withholding details of 12 to 15 positive samples in the past two
years. ``They conduct their tests like all the other federations
and are supposed to report back to us when they make positive
findings,'' Ljungqvist said. ``They have not done so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljungqvist said it was possible that American athletes who have
failed drug tests were competing in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know,'' he said. ``We have no idea.'' Craig
Masback, executive director of USATF, said Ljungvist was misguided.
``It's absolutely absurd,'' he said. ``We have reported, reported
regularly and reported comprehensively every detail of our drug
testing program.

   BAD DAY FOR U.S.

<P>
   Evander Holyfield looked like he wanted to step inside the ring.
Though he couldn't throw punches, he was eager to offer advice.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lacy listened and reached the quarterfinals with a 21-7
decision over Poland's Pawel Kakietek at 165 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my favorite boxer,'' Lacy said. ``He really rose me up
when I saw him step into the dressing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Advice was no help for Brian Viloria in a 6-4 loss to Brahim
Asloum of France at 106 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I got enough credit for the body shots,'' said
Viloria, who thought about a dozen body punches went uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   On the worst day so far for the U.S. team, two boxers were
eliminated _ one in the ring and the other on the scale. In
addition to Viloria's loss, David Jackson couldn't make the
132-pound weight and was eliminated.

   The Kiwis aren't very good. In fact, they're winless so far in
the preliminary round, losing to France, Italy and China. The
Americans, who had some unexpected problems against Lithuania, are
one of three remaining undefeated teams. Canada and Yugoslavia, who
are in Group B, are the other remaining undefeated teams.
</P>
<P>
   If Canada can beat Russia and Yugoslavia can defeat Spain on
Saturday, it will set up the meeting of two 4-0 teams Monday. The
winner can then avoid the United States until the gold-medal
game.WOMEN'S WATER POLO

<P>
   The United States and Australia will play Saturday in the first
women's Olympic water polo final. A crowd of 17,500 is expected,
the largest ever to watch a women's water polo game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big opportunity,'' U.S. Water Polo Federation
executive director Bruce Wigo said. Australia has never won a water
polo medal, while America's only gold in the sport came when the
pool deck was stacked at the 1904 St. Louis Games _ no other
country competed.

<P>
   Tara Nott, who was elevated from silver to gold in women's 106

the athletes' village. Just one problem: She wasn't about to miss
teammate Cheryl Haworth's bronze-medal performance. So, a makeshift

tested positive for drugs and had to give back her medal.

   TOYOTA EXPECTS STRONGER RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Japan's leading automaker, the Toyota Motor Corp., said Friday
that it was likely to report higher earnings for the first half of
its fiscal year than it had anticipated as sales were stronger than
expected in North America and Europe. Toyota raised its profit
forecast by 43 percent, to 100 billion yen, or nearly $1 billion,
for the six months ending in September. It will probably sell
10,000 more cars domestically and 60,000 more for export to North
America and Europe than it originally expected.

GORE DEFENDS USE OF OIL RESERVES AT NEWS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALPORT, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore held his first news
conference in 67 days on Friday, defending his call for the release
of oil from the government's stockpiles and and vowing that he
would ``confront friend and foe alike'' over the marketing of
violent entertainment to children, despite the millions in
donations he receives from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Gore tried to brush off criticism from Gov.
George W. Bush, who pointed to the fact that as recently as
February, the Vice President has resisted using the oil stockpile
to reduce prices. On Friday, Bush called Gore a ``flip-flopper,''
saying his proposal to tap into the reserves was a political ploy.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said: ``The situation is very different today. It's not
fair to the middle-class families of this country to stand by and
do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices dominated the 31-minute news conference, held here
near Pittsburgh. Gore spoke to reporters after holding a discussion
with two dozen people at a union hall belonging to the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about their
difficulties in paying higher prices for home-heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Gore said he was not nervous about the upcoming
debates, but was incredulous when a reporter asked whether he was
confident he had the election locked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an overconfident bone in my body,'' he said.
``This is very much out there to be won or lost. This is a jump
ball right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Bush was ``a very good debater and has won all
of the debates he's been in that I know of.'' He mentioned Bush's
debate against Gov. Ann Richards of Texas in 1994. ``He was
supposed to be slaughtered in that,'' Gore mused. ``She's certainly
a better debater than I am. She's got a very quick wit and silver
tongue and is just smart as a whip, and he beat her in that debate,
so put that in your formula.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that he had privately cozied up to Hollywood
executives while chastising them in public over marketing
practices. ``That's just not true,'' he said. ``I don't care if
somebody supports me or opposes me, I'm going to take them on on
this issue.'' He added: ``I'm going to confront friend and foe
alike to get this change.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had not talked to Tom Downey, his friend and
adviser, since Downey mysteriously received a packet of materials
about Bush's debate preparation. Downey immediately turned the
information over to the FBI. ``I have not talked to him since then
out of excessive caution,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took fierce exception to Bush's desire to drill for oil in
the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. ``I am not in favor
of putting fragile parts of our environment at risk in order to get
tiny new amounts when the price is going up sky high and the
production is being artificially cut back elsewhere,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Bush's charge that oil and gas prices were
climbing because the Clinton administration had no coherent energy
policy, Gore said the blame lay with Republicans in Congress.
``They have blocked and stalled and prevented the investments in
renewable energy and the development of our own natural resources
here that we have advocated year after year,'' he said. ``I want to
put this on the front burner in the midst of this campaign, in part
to seek a mandate to get the next Congress to act.''
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that the release of oil could be more of a
psychological move than one that would be felt immediately by
consumers. He said he did not know when consumers would feel relief
and would not specify a price he thought was fair. ``I think we'll
learn a lot from this, if we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore had not held a news conference since July 17. The 67-day
stretch surpassed his previous record earlier this year of 62 days
without a news conference. During this period, in which his
campaign has tightly controlled his appearances and tried to
produce a single message of the day, he has climbed in the polls.
But he said on Friday, after wandering over to a clutch of
reporters and camera crews, that the lack of news conferences was
not a sign that he would not hold regular news conferences as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former reporter himself, suggested that he had been
available to reporters all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a press conference?'' he asked with somewhat feigned
innocence. ``Now, when I have what you call an `avail' and people
ask whatever questions they want for as long as they want, is that
not a press conference?''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters said he had not done that, but he asserted otherwise.
``Yeah, on the plane, I've done it on a regular basis,'' he said.
Such moments, which are infrequent and sometimes off the record,
are held with only a handful of reporters. ``Oh, so that's the
difference for you?'' he asked. ``But they're representing
everybody else, right?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore associates said he made himself available on Friday to end
the increasing number of stories that he was inaccessible. Still,
asked if he would hold a news conference once a week, he avoided
answering. ``We'll talk about that at the next one,'' he said.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 29 years of deceit, coverup and injustice, the State of
New York agreed this year to pay $8 million in damages to inmates
who were beaten and abused in reprisals during the recapture of the
Attica Correctional Facility in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the families of the inmates' hostages who were
slain that day by indiscriminate state police gunfire? What about
surviving hostages? All the hostages were doing their duty when
they were killed, injured or endangered by their employer, New York
State.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, so far, New York has done nothing remotely adequate to
compensate these forgotten victims for what one investigatory
commission called ``the bloodiest encounter between Americans since
the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the state has deceived widows and survivors. And
no state administration, Republican or Democratic, has admitted
responsibility for the uprising at the overcrowded prison, for its
poorly planned and brutal repression or for the 43 resulting
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A brief recap:
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1971, inmates at Attica _ steeped in the general
political unrest of the time _ rebelled in reaction to a long
history of overcrowding and hard conditions. They took 42 hostages
(four were released almost immediately), corrections officers and
civilian employees, and held out for nearly five days. One
corrections officer was killed in the initial takeover. The inmates
then threatened to kill their hostages if attacked.
</P>
<P>
   They did not kill anybody, though, even when the state police
assaulted their stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   On the orders of Gov. Nelson D. Rockefeller, troopers retook the
prison on the morning of Sept. 13, firing into a crowd of about
1,500 inmates. The death toll was 32 inmates and 11 state
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Though prison officials first announced that inmates had killed
10 hostages after castrating some of them, autopsies later
disproved this lie: All the dead hostages, none of them castrated,
were found to have been killed by gunfire _ mostly from the state
police, some from corrections officers.
</P>
<P>
   Years of coverup ensued, with the state's primary effort
directed at indicting inmates only. No state police and no
corrections officers known to have taken reprisals against the
inmates were charged. In 1976, Gov. Hugh Carey issued a blanket
pardon for everyone involved and sealed the state's records
concerning Attica for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Attica was retaken, state officials urged the
families of slain and surviving hostages to accept certain limited
death benefits _ for example, $347.62 a month for a widow with four
children. Surviving hostages were asked to take paid leave. But
they didn't know that this pay included workers' compensation
funds, which, once accepted, barred them from suing the state.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, when it comes to compensation, can be
significant: One of the widows, Herbert Jones, rejected the
benefit, sued the state and was awarded $1 million for her
husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   In January 2000, 29 years after the assault, New York finally
agreed to a $12 million settlement _ $8 million for 1,280 inmates
who claimed to have been beaten in reprisals, $4 million for their
lawyers. The state still admitted no wrongdoing or responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   This settlement with the inmates aggrieved surviving hostages
and families of state employees who died. None had received a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   To redress their grievances, they formed Forgotten Victims of
Attica and are now hoping to persuade the New York legislature and
Governor Pataki of the justice of their cause and of their demands:
acceptance of responsibility by the state, psychological counseling
for widows and survivors, an annual commemorative ceremony at the
prison, access to the sealed records of the uprising and some
financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have approved a total payment of $550,000 _ a mere
$50,000 for each of the 11 dead state employees. The victims' group
has rejected this, urging the state to follow the precedent set in
Jones' suit _ $1 million for the families of each hostage killed
and for each of the surviving hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The public, said Michael Smith, a surviving hostage recently
interviewed by the Batavia, N.Y., Daily News, ``has the
misconception that we were taken care of. That never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it did not; quite the opposite. After 29 years, it's time
to remember these forgotten victims and to make the public aware of
the whole truth about the Attica uprising, its aftermath and the
state's callous response.
</P>
<P>
   (Tom Wicker, a former New York Times columnist, was asked by
inmates of the 1971 Attica uprising to observe and help mediate the
standoff.)

LIEBERMANS RELEASE TAX RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, released their
federal income tax returns for the last 10 years on Friday,
revealing that they depended almost entirely on his Senate salary,
supplemented in some years by his wife's modest earnings as a
consultant and, since 1996, by fees for administering two family
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party nominee for vice president and his wife
reported an adjusted gross income of $336,201 last year and paid
23.5 percent of that, or $78,700, in federal income and self
employment taxes. The couple gave $13,804 to charity, all of it in
cash. The returns showed a consistent pattern of donating about 3
percent of income each year.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's income was $107,000 in 1990, the first year for
which their full returns were released.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, has so
far released only the first two pages of his tax returns. Unlike
the Liebermans, the Republican vice presidential nominee and his
wife have not made available any of the separate schedules and
supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   The limited information disclosed earlier this month by Cheney
and his wife, Lynne, showed that their income soared from $258,394
in 1992, the last year when Cheney was defense secretary, to
$4,423,289 in 1999 when he was chief executive of Halliburton
Corp., the world's largest oil services company, and a director of
other firms such as Lockheed Martin, a major defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night Dirk Van De Beek, Cheney's spokesman, said he
was trying to ascertain when the Cheneys full tax returns may be
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his wife reported salary income in 1999 of
$206,700, $1,738 in taxable interest, $3,083 in dividends, $37,965
in business income from the senator's latest book, $29,216 in
capital gains, $10,735 in pension and annuity income and a $15
profit from renting out a condominium they own in their home town
of New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also reported $45,000 of income as an author,
apparently the senator's share of the advance for ``In Praise of
Public Life,'' a slim volume he wrote with Michael D'Orso that was
published in February by Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996 the Liebermans have also collected fees for
administering two family trusts for the benefit of various cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the senator also reported a $20,000 fee for
administering the Manger Family Trust. He is entitled to a $50,000
annual fee, but Senate ethics rules limit his income from the
trust, said his spokeswoman, Jodi Sakol.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman was paid $40,000 by the Faye Manger Trust, which
she administers, but whose investments are decided by an investment
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The returns showed that the Libermans did not follow the advice
of many tax professionals on minimizing their taxes. For example,
the couple made their charitable gifts with cash rather than giving
securities they own that have appreciated in value. And last year
they paid a $314 penalty because their combined income tax
withholding and estimated payments on their business and investment
income fell short of the minimum required under Internal Revenue
Service rules.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world's largest auction houses, Sotheby's and
Christie's, tentatively agreed Friday to pay $512 million to settle
claims that they cheated buyers and sellers in a price-fixing
scheme that dates back to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The civil settlement, reported by lawyers but not officially
announced, comes as prosecutors for the Justice Department are
stepping up efforts to conclude a three-year criminal investigation
focusing on evidence that the two auction giants stifled
competition by colluding on a host of business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that the auction houses themselves are each
responsible for $256 million of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is the equivalent to about three or four years of
annual pretax profits for each firm. If the case had gone to trial
and the auction houses lost, they could have been liable for triple
damages, a judgment that could have reached $1.3 billion, one
lawyer connected with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the negotiations said Friday that the
agreement was reached late Thursday night at the offices of Weil
Gotshal &AMP; Manges, the law firm representing Sotheby's and included
Christie's counsel, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom as well as
the lead counsel representing the buyers and sellers in the
class-action suit, Boies, Schiller &AMP; Flexner of Armonk, N.Y. and
Hanover, N.H. The civil case grew out of the federal antitrust
investigation that focuses on documents that court papers say
record years of secret meetings by top officials of the two houses
aimed at colluding on fees paid to buyers and sellers as well as a
host of other business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been investigating actions dating back as early
as 1991 to see whether the two houses cooperated to set identical
commission charges for buyers in 1992 and for sellers in 1995. This
would have made it more difficult for sellers to play off the
houses against each other in the hope of extracting better deals.
It would have also made it impossible for buyers to choose between
them on the basis of commission costs.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also established that the companies exchanged
confidential lists of superrich collectors who were not to be
charged commissions at all. The auction house officials are also
said to have shaken hands on a host of other policies such as
charging identical interest rates to sellers and not poaching each
other's staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's settlement was based on everything from auction house
employee diaries and expense accounts to travel records and notes
that put Sotheby's and Christie's officials together at times and
places where the strong inference pointed to conspiracy, people
close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Weiner of Skadden Arps declined to comment, referring
calls to a public relations spokesman for Christie's who did not
return a call. A spokesman for Sotheby's, Matthew Weigman, also
declined to comment as did David Boies and other members of the
Boies firm. A message left for a Sotheby's lawyer, Greg Danilow at
Weil Gotshal, was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will not be formally announced until Judge Lewis
A. Kaplan rules on whether to preliminarily approve the settlement
and give notice to the buyers and sellers, a decision that is
expected soon. Under the agreement, the boards of both auction
houses are required to vote on the settlement by Sept. 30.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's settlement, half of the $256 million in payments
would be due within 30 days of the judge's preliminary approval and
the remainder after final court approval. Each auction house has
the option of substituting up to $50 million of its payment in
certificates to sellers, which would be transferable and could be
used toward reducing commission costs on future consignments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $256 million that Sotheby's and Christie's
are each required to pay, they also have to split the costs of
notifying the 120,000 buyers and sellers as well as such
administrative expenses as processing and distributing the claims,
which could cost an additional $1 million, people familiar with the
case said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26 Kaplan selected David A. Boies and Richard B. Drubel
of Boies, Schiller &AMP; Flexner to lead the civil case after an
unusual bidding process designed, the judge said, to maximize the
recovery for clients while keeping legal fees down. The judge had
law firms submit sealed bids offering the highest settlement figure
they would be willing accept in negotiations and turn over entirely
to their clients, without taking a fee. The firms also proposed a
second figure for a settlement figure beyond this, from which they
would receive a quarter and their clients the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in an opinion that made no reference to the settlement,
Kaplan discussed the bidding process and noted one potential
problem: If the case could not be settled for more than the winning
bidder's maximum figure, the firm would have no incentive to pursue
the case and would ``make a hasty exit.'' But the judge said that
in such an eventuality he retained the authority to reject an
inadequate settlement. There was no suggestion that the judge was
referring specifically to Friday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation began more than three years ago but it
was thought to have been dormant until January when the Justice
Department's antitrust office in New York received more than 100
pages of documents _ memorandums and notes of secret meetings that
took place between Christopher M. Davidge, a former Christie's
chief executive, and Diana B. Brooks, his counterpart at Sotheby's.
(Davidge resigned from his job on Christmas eve.) The documents
also contain reports on these meetings written by Davidge and sent
to his boss, Anthony Tennant, chairman of Christie's from 1993 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Along with providing the documents, Christie's agreed to
cooperate with the federal investigation and in exchange for its
help, the company was granted a form of leniency called conditional
amnesty, with the provision that its cooperation be complete and
truthful. Christie's general counsel, Jo Backer Laird, disclosed
the cooperation on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also includes some of Sotheby's longtime
executives including A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman who is
still its majority shareholder, and Brooks, its former chief
executive. Both abruptly resigned from their posts in February and
are under investigation by federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, documents gathered for this case show that the
collusion began with Taubman and Tennant who, as early as 1992,
instructed Davidge and Brooks to carry out the scheme. Since the
case began, Taubman through his lawyers, has denied any
wrongdoing.Tennant, when reached by telephone at his London home,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   To wind up their long-running investigation, prosecutors under
John J. Greene, head of the Justice Department antitrust office in
New York, have been intensively negotiating with counsel for
Brooks, seeking a deal that would secure her testimony against her
former boss, Taubman, in exchange for leniency, according to people
familiar with the talks.

 &HT;    Surprising Finn upstages Nelson
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Adam Nelson never thought it would come to this. There
he stood on the defensive in the bowels of the Olympic Stadium,
engulfed in a pack of journalists, asked if he was disappointed
with a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson shrugged his beefy shoulders and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A silver medal in the Olympics, come on,'' said Nelson,
runner-up in the shot put. ``This is unbelievable. I'll tell you
this, though, it'll keep me coming back in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lovett School grad basked in fame Friday, a silver medal
draped from his neck. The idea would only have been a dream before
the season. But after posting the world-leading throw at the
Olympic trials, Nelson arrived here favored for the gold won by
little-known Arsi Harju, a 26-year-old from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Harju hails from the town of Perho, where locals have a
reputation for being some of the country's more stoic, stubborn
people. He gets around on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and carries
through the biker-look with a full red beard and his thick hair
wrapped in a pink doo-rag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not very typical of a Finn,'' said a Finnish journalist,
apologetically. ``He's very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Harju won Finland's first medal of the Sydney Games, even if his
countrymen perceived him a longshot. His claim to fame had been a
bronze-medal showing at the 1998 European indoor championship. But
with an Olympic medal at stake, he surpassed his personal best by
almost two feet and won with a throw of 69 feet, 10 1/4 inches _ a
distance Nelson routinely exceeded by late season.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the field rated him the favorite, and few had ever
competed against Harju. He ended up beating Nelson for the gold by
3 1/4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have seen him around, but I really had no idea who he
was,'' said Nelson, who couldn't remember previously competing
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson arrived at the stadium with his own cheering section. His
parents and family made the trip Down Under. So had his girlfriend,
along a friends from his Lovett days and others from Dartmouth
College, where Nelson starred as a defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   With a slight evening chill, Nelson never hit his groove and
Harju was the lone finalist who managed a personal-best. Even his
performance went down as the first gold medalist to win with a less
than a 70-foot throw since the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   Bronze medalist John Godina, for one, saw it as a positive sign
an indication of performance-enhance drugs no longer running
rampant among the strongmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug testing works, I guess,'' Godina said. ``Nobody out there
(among 12 finalists) has a positive drug test. The last two
Olympics, five of the six medalists had positive drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seriously question putting up the world record, because the
guy that set it is banned for life and there's such a gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Barnes, the Atlanta champ and record-holder, was banned
from competing in 1998 after a second positive tests for anabolic
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson suggested the lateness of the Sydney Games may also have
played a factor in performances, claiming throwing marks generally
began to slip in the last month. But he, too, acknowledged the
emergence of a different breed of throwers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three things I'm most proud of: `I'm here, I'm clean
(drug-free) and I've got a silver medal,''' Nelson said. ``This is
my first major championship (medal), in front of 100,000 people . .
. cameras in my face. It hasn't sunk in yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Nelson is the American future in the event. He and
Godina, silver medalist in Atlanta, gave the U.S. two shot-put
medals here and role models for being successful without the aid of
performance-enhancing drugs. Godina is the only one of the previous
six medalists from Barcelona and Atlanta who hasn't had a positive
tests.
</P>
<P>
   It's time, both said, for the new generation to cleanse the
stereotype of shot-put throwers as large, wild guys pumped up on
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the stereotype is very fair,'' Nelson said.
``Just by the nature of being large you draw more attention to
yourself. If you go to a bar and you're the biggest guy in the bar,
it's almost inevitable that somebody at some point in the night,
especailly in the south, is going to come up and challenge you.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, some people do bring attention to themselves. But
you find just as many in other events that are a little loud and
crazy. It's a stereotype that people attach to meatheads and
football players or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   An Ivy Leaguer working the Silicon Valley computer-trade by day
hardly fits the meathead decription. No, an Olympic medalist fits
Nelson just fine.

 &HT;    Hall and Ervin share the gold
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Everyone had a scenario for how the big shootout in the
men's 50 meter freestyle was going to play out. No one got it
right.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ervin, first swimmer of African-American ancestry to
make the U.S. swim team.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr., rebel who now has diabetes for a cause. And there
they were on the podium _ together _ arms raised in gold medal
triumph as Dutch superstar Pieter van Hoogenband looked on while
settling for a bronze. Russian legend Alexander Popov, the two-time
defending Olympic champion at the distance, was out of the picture
after finishing sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely do you see a tie for the gold medal in the Olympics.
This makes us the best in the world,'' said Ervin, whose father,
Jack, is 75 percent African American, and whose mother, Sherry, is
white.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin could remember only one other time in his entire swimming
career where he'd been involved in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time at junior nationals I tied for 24th place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a million reasons I shouldn't have gotten this,'' Hall
said, citing the No. 1 factor as being the disease he was diagnosed
with a little more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Hall and Ervin shared the medal stand Friday night, they
weren't the only Americans to visit there as the squad continued a
medal run that has made it the strongest American team in years.
</P>
<P>
   When Brooke Bennett and Kaitlin Sandeno picked up a gold and a
bronze after the 800 meter freestyle, they gave the United States
its 26th and 27th medals here, surpassing the 26 that were won in
the 1996 Atlanta Games and tying the haul from Barcelona. Then Hall
and Ervin added their pair, pushing the total to just two short of
the 33 amassed in Los Angeles in 1984 when the United States hosted
a boycotted Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   No one was happier with a medal than Sandeno, the buoyant
17-year-old who swam in four grueling races before medaling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's my age, thinking Olympics equals medals. I thought
I was going to do better,'' Sandeno said.''I'm really excited right
now. I just wanted a medal. I represented my country the best I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Bennett, who picked up a second gold medal here. She may
not be Janet Evans, but she's relentlessly closing in on some of
those once seemingly unreachable world marks. Friday she broke
Evans' 12-year-old Olympic record by about half a second with a
8:19.67 swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to have one distance queen (Evans),''
Sandeno said. ``We can have her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One swimmer who almost added to the medal count was Ian Crocker,
who'll soon be attending the University of Texas. He swam something
he'd been shooting for since the U.S. trials, a new American record
in the 100 meter butterfly. His time of 52.44 seconds was good for
fourth place behind Sweden's Lars Froelander's winning time of
52.00.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I gave it everything I had mentally, physically and
emotionally, so I'm not upset,'' Crocker said. Some Aussie fans
were. They were hoping for a quinella of Michael Klim and Geoff
Huegill, but they finished second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Klim has taken offense at some of the statements made by Hall,
as have some of the other Aussies. Hall, however, probably just
talks too much for his own good. Almost all of what he has said
here has been thoughtful and complimentary, but he has a knack of
saying one thing that can get twisted around.
</P>
<P>
   The Web page where he threw out the off-hand remark about
smashing the Aussies like guitars was also full of nice things
about the country and its swimmers. It's also a candid and informed
diary by someone dealing with diabetes. Hall, long regarded as U.S.
swimming's biggest flake/slacker, is trying to take his new status
as a role model seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetes, or any other disease, doesn't have to be the end,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hall talks too much for some, Ervin says too little for
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my heritage,'' he maintained. He just doesn't
liked being saddled with or pigeonholed as the first this or the
first that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel in American society today that something like having
diverse blood would not be that big a deal,'' Ervin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Ervin both train in Phoenix with coach Mike Bottom.
Unlike two other U.S. swimmers who shared a medal here (Jenny
Thompson and Dara Torres in the 100 meter freestyle), they actually
train together with the same coach and knew how to act on the same
podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to share a gold medal with anybody there couldn't be
a nicer guy,'' Hall said. ``It's like another day in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of their swimming buddies, Bartosz Kizierowski of
Poland, finished fifth and also beat Popov. Whatever they're doing
in Phoenix obviously works. Just not as well as Inge de Bruijn's
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   There was no photo finish in her semifinal race in the women's
50-meter freestyle. In a race often decided by fingernails, she was
a body length ahead of the competition and set a world record of
24.13 seconds. If someone, anyone, wound up sharing the victory
stand with her, that would be the one finish more unexpected than
the men's 50 here.

 &HT;    Varicose vein surgery less radical than past procedures
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a sunny Wednesday morning at the Vein
Centre of the Palm Beaches, and Dr. Z. Catherine Navarro is
exterminating spiders.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of 'em, the blue, squiggly kind that spin themselves a
home on thighs, calves and ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``insecticide'' is a saline solution injected with a tiny
syringe into the veins, some of which fade as salt meets
circulatory system. The process is called sclerotherapy, and these
days it's the most common weapon wielded against veins.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of said spiders, a 36-year-old mother of two, reclines
while the doctor needles her once, twice, 20 times. Why is she
putting her legs through this, at a cost of roughly $300 per
15-minute treatment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was finding that I was covering them up when I was wearing
shorts, which you do every day down here,'' she says. She had never
been bothered by spider veins until her pregnancies spawned them,
as happens for many women.
</P>
<P>
   Others inherit their veins. Dr. Navarro's next patient, also in
her mid-30s, has complained of leg cramps, not to mention
embarrassment, because of the veins that streak her legs. Her
mother had spider veins, ``but I'm the only child who got them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, spider veins and their big brothers, varicose
veins, are a little like kudzu. You can trim them back all you
want, but if your lower extremities are varicose-friendly, doctors
say the clinging blue vessels require regular maintenance to keep
them from hugging your legs. In fact, 20 percent of varicose vein
operations are re-treatments, according to a 1999 article in the
Journal of Vascular Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it like dental care, says Conrad Goulet, medical
director of Guylaine Lanctot Cliniques, with 3 offices in south
Florida. ``If you want to keep your teeth, you have to take care of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to take care of your veins, here's a primer to give
you, er, a leg up on causes, prevention and treatment:
</P>
<P>
   _ What are varicose veins and spider veins, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   As you may remember from high-school biology, thick-walled
arteries carry blood away from the heart and deliver it to your
organs and extremities.
</P>
<P>
   Once the blood has made the circuit and is ready to return to
the heart, it becomes the veins' job to get it there. But in the
legs, blood has to fight against gravity to make the long climb
back. To keep it flowing heartward, veins are equipped with valves
that prevent what is essentially backwash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young, the valves snap back and close,'' says
Janee Steinberg, a dermatologist and medical director of the
Advanced Cosmetic Laser Center in Fort Lauderdale. ``But with
gravity and with age, with hormones and with genetics _ these are
factors that we don't have much control over _ the valves weaken.
They open OK, but they don't shut all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   As the blood is pushed along, some trickles back and widens the
vessel, putting pressure on its walls and enlarging it over time.
</P>
<P>
   The vein becomes overfilled with pools of blood that cause
dilation and distortion.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's the difference between a spider vein and a varicose
vein?
</P>
<P>
   Spider veins, sometimes referred to as broken capillaries and
much more common than varicose veins, are the size of threads or
smaller. Vessels larger than a pencil and located somewhat deeper
than spider veins are called varicose veins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are these vein problems largely an issue of vanity?
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, no. The veins can burn or itch, make legs feel
heavy and achy by the end of the day, and cause cramping in the
middle of the night. If left untreated, they can lead to the
formation of blood clots, phlebitis and skin ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs always felt unrested, and I was just tired of dealing
with that on a daily basis,'' says Larry, a 51-year-old. ``There
was a constant reminder that part of my body was uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if varicose veins don't cause physical pain, emotionally
they can take their toll. Some sufferers wear long pants only, and
they avoid trips to the pool and beach.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, a 41-year-old Wellington resident, had spider veins on
the back of one leg and varicose veins on the other, a genetic gift
from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Chris's veins gave her charley horses and ``just cosmetically, I
didn't like them.'' She knew the veins were noticeable and was
self-conscious when wearing shorts. ``I'm getting older, and I want
to look the best I can for as long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ What causes varicose veins?
</P>
<P>
   Goulet estimates that 90 percent of cases are hereditary. So
peek at your parents' limbs. If they're veiny, you could be too.
</P>
<P>
   The other 10 percent are a result of aging, obesity, injury or
jobs that require standing for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   The weight gain and hormonal fluctuations of pregnancy can also
spur spider or varicose veins. (The conventional wisdom used to
dictate that a woman wait until after she had had all her children
to seek treatment. Now doctors advise addressing problem vessels
before pregnancy and then hitting them again after.)
</P>
<P>
   Spider veins on the face can be the result of sun exposure,
alcohol consumption or rosacea.
</P>
<P>
   _ How many people are affected?
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, 80
million American adults suffer from varicose and/or spider veins.
Among women 40 to 50 years old, 41 percent have varicose veins,
with that number climbing to 72 percent between the ages of 60 and
70. Almost a quarter of men aged 30 to 40 have bad veins,
increasing to 43 percent among men in their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bulk of Navarro's sclerotherapy patients are women,
she says most surgical candidates are men who have postponed a trip
to the doctor until their veins literally bulge out of their skin.
``Women are smarter. They come in sooner,'' Navarro says. ``They're
more into prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   _ How can varicose and spider veins be prevented?
</P>
<P>
   Because the reasons for valve failure aren't entirely
understood, it's tough to say what preemptive steps to take. ``If
you have a family history of varicose or spider veins and it's
something you have inherited, there is obviously nothing you can do
to change your genes,'' www.veinsonline.com helpfully points out.
</P>
<P>
   More hopeful medical advice for lessening symptoms includes:
</P>
<P>
   Stay in shape and eat a low-fat, high-fiber diet. A workout that
pumps your feet and calves: good (contracting those muscles helps
nearby veins do their job). High-impact exercise: bad (puts too
much strain on veins).
</P>
<P>
   Try to not to spend long, uninterrupted periods of time either
sitting or standing.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid hot baths, particularly at the end of the day. The warm
water may feel great on your muscles, but it's dilating your veins.
</P>
<P>
   Forgo very high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Support stockings squeeze the veins so they hold less blood. But
the hose won't keep new veins from forming or make existing veins
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Elevate your feet whenever possible. ``If we could hang upside
down at night, we wouldn't have this problem,'' Steinberg says.
``Gravity really takes its toll on the system.''
</P>
<P>
   _ What can be done about them?
</P>
<P>
   Many treatments are available, but sclerotherapy is the
mainstay, particularly for spider veins. A saline solution is
injected directly into the vein. It dries up the vessel which, over
the course of a few weeks, gets washed away by the body. Cotton
balls are taped to the sites of the injections, and compression
hose are tugged on and worn for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy allows the doctor to see the
problematic vessel on a monitor, which means he or she can
penetrate the deeper veins that are feeding the vessels closer to
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Larger varicose veins may require surgery, but not necessarily
the radical stripping of yore, where a long segment of vein was
pulled out from groin to ankle. Newer surgical techniques include
ligation, in which the offending vein is tied off, and ambulatory
phlebectomy, an outpatient procedure in which veins are removed
through very tiny incisions. The latter requires only local
anesthesia, usually doesn't require stitches, and typically leaves
small scars only.
</P>
<P>
   A treatment called the Closure procedure was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration in March 1999. A small catheter is
inserted into the damaged vein, where it delivers radiofrequency
energy to the vein wall. As the vein heats up, it collapses and
seals shut.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the American Academy of Dermatology who helped
develop the technique has predicted that it will ``become the gold
standard in treating varicose veins in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   _ What about lasers?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, lasers aren't a viable option for varicose veins.
They work best only on the tiniest of spider veins, like those
found on the face.
</P>
<P>
   _ If spider and varicose veins are being injected and stripped
and tied off and sealed shut, how does a leg still get enough
blood?
</P>
<P>
   Your legs have 90 percent more veins than they actually need,
Navarro says. (Credit evolution. If you had only a couple of veins
carrying all your blood, and one was accidentally severed, you'd
quickly bleed to death.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Larry, the West Palm Beach assistant principal, has had
the saphenous veins in each of his legs _ those large veins
typically harvested for heart bypass surgery _ injected from groin
to ankle, and he's still more ambulatory than before sclerotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Damaged veins are not functioning veins, Steinberg says.
``They're like tiny branches of a tree that has multiple branching
patterns. The other veins really carry the bulk. These are like
little tributaries that aren't really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Are follow-up visits necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Almost always. Like old age, varicose veins aren't something you
cure, Navarro says.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, the Wellington woman who had sclerotherapy, returns to
her doctor every six weeks for check-ups. ``They come back and I
know that's going to happen, but they don't come back as bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walked around with your legs up in the air all day,
they wouldn't. But I don't know who's going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Who treats veins?
</P>
<P>
   The study of veins isn't exactly a specialty in medical school,
but awareness of the field is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phlebology'' refers to the treatment of veins, and the
American College of Phlebology (formerly the North American Society
of Phlebology) was founded in 1985. Its members include
dermatologists, plastic surgeons, gynecologists and physicians who
spend a bulk of their practice treating veins.
</P>
<P>
   _ So how do you know who to visit?
</P>
<P>
   Rely on common sense, vein specialists say. Select a physician
who devotes a healthy percentage of his or her time to vein work,
not someone who learned about sclerotherapy in a weekend course and
occasionally picks up a syringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks easy when you see the injection,'' Goulet says. ``But
like anything else, practice makes you better.''
</P>
<P>
   _ How much does it cost?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on how bad your veins are. By shopping around, those
with a smattering of spider veins could find a series of treatments
for $200 to $300. The average patient at Guylaine Lanctot needs six
visits at $175 per visit, Goulet says.
</P>
<P>
   If your veins require surgery, however, expect operation-level
prices _ $3,000 to $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to calculate the costs of follow-up
appointments. Most doctors recommend checking on your veins at
least annually after your initial round of treatments. Larry
estimates that he's spent $5,000 on sclerotherapy over the past
couple of years, and his insurance company has started balking
about picking up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Treating veins is a lifelong investment, doctors agree. ``This
is not cheap,'' Navarro says. ``And if it's cheap, then it's a
problem.''

 &HT;    Believers pray for healing at shrine
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELSA, Texas _ On an autumn day in 1993, Dario Mendoza was in his
sister's front yard, repairing a rusted spot on his car, when he
noticed something odd about the galvanized steel he'd used as a
patch.
</P>
<P>
   In the metal, Mendoza saw what looked like the silhouette of the
Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint. His sister, Aurora
Quintero, and her husband, Santiago, saw it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Word quickly spread around this small Rio Grande Valley city,
and within days, hundreds of people had followed the pothole-pocked
dirt road to the Quinteros' home to see ``La Virgen'' on Mendoza's
1981 Camaro.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Mendoza and the Quinteros have heard the
doubting voices. People have dismissed the image as a hoax, or
simply a stain molded into a miracle by hopeful minds. But for this
family of migrant workers, the dark, oblong shape on the back of a
maroon Camaro is a gift to the faithful, and it has changed their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven years, they have used donations from visitors
to build a wood-and-cinderblock shrine around the maroon car, which
they placed on metal posts and surrounded with a large crucifix,
framed newspaper clippings and a makeshift altar. A local priest
comes to deliver the occasional Sunday Mass to overflow crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of their neighbors, the Quinteros leave the Valley for
months every year to work the fields _ they drive to Georgia to
pick onions, then to Michigan to hoe beets before returning home
each fall. Devout Catholics, they don't question why the Virgin
chose them; they simply thank her for bringing them closer as a
family and for deepening their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needed a place to stay, I guess,'' said 17-year-old San
Juanita Quintero, Santiago and Aurora Quintero's daughter. ``She
came to be here with us. To bring the people here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mexican lore, the Virgin Mary appeared before a
recently converted Indian, Juan Diego, on Dec. 12, 1531, 10 years
after Hernan Cortes and his soldiers captured the Aztec capital
Tenochtitlan. The Virgin of Guadalupe, as she became known, spurred
millions of indigenous people to convert to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful have reported seeing the Virgin's image on
tortillas, bathroom floors and buildings, and each sighting draws
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, people converged on an elm tree in Lockhart
where many said they saw Jesus, Mary and crosses.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a woman said she saw the Virgin of Guadalupe's
silhouette on a tree in Bonita Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in Clearwater, Fla., an image resembling the
Virgin on the side of a building drew an estimated 500,000 people
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, from across the street and around the country,
believers keep coming to the Quinteros' shrine to light candles, to
confirm their faith, to pray for healing or guidance or better
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too long ago, a lady came and was on her knees all the way
from the fence to inside (the church),'' said Caroline Mendoza,
Aurora Quintero's sister, who acts as the church's caretaker while
the Quinteros are gone during the picking season.
</P>
<P>
   On a large board mounted on the wall next to the front bumper,
visitors have attached locks of hair, hundreds of photographs and
scribbled prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virgin Mary, please help me heal my two ears and help me
through my operation,'' reads a note tacked to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virgin, please help me with my problems throughout the days,''
another visitor wrote in the guest book. ``I believe, and I have
faith in you. Please return my boyfriend or have him call me.
Please take care of my children. Please help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to it is the book of ``milagros,'' where people document
the miracles they attribute to the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Elvira Escobar, a volunteer at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in
Elsa, said the church began holding Masses and catechism classes at
the Quinteros' shrine about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The church doesn't take a position on whether or not the image
is a miracle, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is there to get the people together, not to tell
them to believe or not to believe (in the image),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   San Juanita said she has seen many doubters leave their doubts
in the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come out, they feel something they didn't feel
before,'' she said. ``They can't explain how they feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The family also turns to the image with their prayers. San
Juanita, a high school junior, said she prays for help in school,
hoping to build a life that doesn't involve picking crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I want something other than the fields,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Caroline's husband, Jesus, suffered a stroke a year ago
that left him blind and immobilized, Caroline said she thought he
would never walk again. He still cannot see, but he has regained
some use of his arms and legs, and shuffles into the shrine with
his walker every day to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have all your faith in her, it will work,'' Caroline
Mendoza said.

 &HT;    Don't count out Bush
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Don't count Bush out.
</P>
<P>
   Political memories are notoriously short, a Republican friend
reminded me during a conversation about Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
current situation.
</P>
<P>
   After the primaries, experienced politicos never expected the
race to be anything other than close. But then Bush caught a good
bounce after the Republican convention in Philadelphia and suddenly
was portrayed as inevitable in the national press. These days, we
read stories about how badly the campaign is stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is certainly a rough patch, but I wouldn't call the
undertaker just yet. From the beginning, the governor was running
against prosperity _ always a popular incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   And though he has been a popular governor in Texas, Texans don't
really play well in the rest of the country, despite our natural
charm. And, to be perfectly candid, the state's socially
parsimonious Legislature opened the doors to loads of questions
about the delivery of human services. Our juries and judges are
notorious for severe punishments and our posture on environmental
issues is like our air: hazy.
</P>
<P>
   But you can say the same thing about California, which curiously
has an image of being hip and progressive. Texans, on the other
hand, are viewed as backward, crude Luddites. Here in Texas,
however, we didn't vote to deny hapless immigrants social services
and education like Californians did. The Golden State hires better
publicists.
</P>
<P>
   So, the presumption was always that the governor was going to
take some hard knocks and that it was going to be a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? That's exactly the way the campaign has
unfolded. It shouldn't be a surprise, but there's an awful lot of
that being expressed out there. Maybe it was the post convention
bounce that shortened that memory. Could have been any number of
things, but we're back to where it started _ staring at a close
contest that is to be decided in October, now just over a week and
the Olympics away.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend suggested that people are starting to focus on
issues and the governor hasn't done a good job of identifying and
pushing his. Bush went on the offensive last week on the state of
the national parks system. While it is true that the national parks
are in sad shape, the same can be said for the parks in Texas,
making that choice of an issue a curious one.
</P>
<P>
   When yet more questions arose recently about Gore fund-raising
techniques, Bush tried to capitalize on it, but the national media
was more enthralled with the governor's seeming capitulation on the
debate issue.
</P>
<P>
   This guy can't seem to buy a break.
</P>
<P>
   Next month's debates undoubtedly will play a major role in
shaping the outcome. And all Bush has to do is show up and break
even _ or close to it _ to be declared the real winner.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he paid a price for balking at participating in the
debates organized by the national commission, but he's committed
now. And no one expects anything except an Al Gore win.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bush's job will be similar to the groom's mother at a
wedding: Wear beige and speak only when spoken to. Everything
should be all right then. The expectations for Bush are so low that
Gore might even come off poorly if he presses too aggressively. And
if Bush manages to land a good punch or two, it will make him look
like the greatest debater since Henry Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Man, I'd love to play a poker hand with those odds.

 &HT;    KOA keeps pace with needs of `kampers'
 &HT;    By Kevin Robbins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELTON _ Hours ago, when all was dark and still, the only noise
was the hum of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nancy stepped out the door with Chester the terrier, and
the gravel crunched under her feet. She ambled to the intersection
and turned right, away from the place reserved for the family from
Canada, down by the covered patio where the cowboys and cowgirls
from out in East Texas will drink some Coors and grill some chicken
and talk about some horses tonight. She passed the tree that holds
the iguana that came from the carnival that was here. She passed
the tiny pool. Those inflatable porpoises weren't there. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Good morning, Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Morning, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows Nancy Adams. She's been here since the early days
of June.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy's husband died in the spring, and she had nowhere to go,
so now she lives in a 35-foot-long travel trailer with an
expandable living room and 100 channels of satellite TV. It's a
Holiday Rambler Imperial with oak interior trim. Chester sleeps
with her on the queen bed. Nancy loves it at the
Belton/Temple/Killeen KOA, the only Kampground of America between
San Antonio and Waco, the great American way station for travelers
on their adventures from here to there.
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't she? There's a laundry room with 50-cent dryers.
Mail service. Shade trees. A KOA convenience store and a horseshoe
pit and complimentary coffee. Chester _ any dog _ is welcome. Nancy
pays $240 a month in rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've homesteaded,'' she says with a playful snicker.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her about the people she's met. She'll go on and on and on.
Most of them, she's liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing to say, but if you do get pissed at your
neighbors, you pick up and move on,'' Nancy says.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs loudly. She's not kidding. ``You can't do that if you
buy a house.''
</P>
<P>
   So here she is.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scalding Saturday in September, and she's sitting at a
picnic table, waiting for it all.
</P>
<P>
   Any minute now. They'll be coming up the road any minute now.
</P>
<P>
   Look.
</P>
<P>
   There they are.
</P>
<P>
   Vets, cowboys, widows
</P>
<P>
   The two pickups wear Oregon plates. One is pulling a long travel
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Crathers. the KOA maintenance man, has to trim branches
from a tree so the trailer can fit into space D12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' says campground owner Alice Oltmer. ``These big rigs
are somethin' else.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice never gets over just how big they are. When her parents
bought this campground in 1976, the big rigs were smaller, and none
of them had expandable living rooms or 100-channel satellite
service. None of them had data ports for laptop computers, either,
but these days data ports are important, so Alice installed one in
the KOA office so the guests could tap into the Internet while
their laundry is drying in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of spoil our people,'' Alice says.
</P>
<P>
   Alice and her business partner bought the campground from her
parents in 1997. Her partner lives in Indiana, so when someone
wants to stay in one of the 100 spaces at the KOA, Alice usually is
the one who takes care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the spaces are reserved. It's the day of the
first football game for the University of Texas, and there's a
cutting-horse show in town, and about a third of the spaces are
occupied by people such as Nancy Adams, people who live here all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   There's a veterinarian. A writer of police stories. Contractors.
Nurses. Widows.
</P>
<P>
   The two trucks with Oregon plates carry a family of four from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairs . Harlon and Renell and the kids. They have not been
home in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Their 38-foot travel trailer is home and school for
the8-year-old Justin Fair and his brother Colter, 4. Their mother
home-schools them while their father digs trenches for fiber-optic
cable.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairs started out in Washington, then went to Oregon, then
to Nevada, then to San Angelo. ``And now, here,'' Renell Fair says,
and she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to do. Her husband unhooks the trailer. The boys
play tag and scrape around in the rocks for fossils. Renell fetches
water thefor the dog, El Paso. She figures they'll be here for two
months or so. Right here in space D12 at the KOA of cCentral Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a long way from home,'' Renell says. ``I keep reminding
myself: There are worse situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Amenities abound
</P>
<P>
   Hear that?
</P>
<P>
   That rattle? Like a marble in a spraypaint can.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound of a diesel engine, and it means more guests
are on the way. Enormous trucks hauling enormous travel trailers
across enormous Texas. Finding exit 292 on Interstate 35 between
Waco and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The red and yellow and black sign.
</P>
<P>
   The KOA.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kampground of America was a cinderblock restroom near
the Yellowstone River in Billings, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   That was 38 years ago. The idea caught fire like Sterno: bBy the
mid-1980s, there were more than 800 KOAs.
</P>
<P>
   There are 495 now. The value of land goes up; the KOAs get sold.
But the best survive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida Keys, a KOA has its own golf course. The KOA in
Port Huron, Mich., has its own train.
</P>
<P>
   The KOA in WndoverWendover, Nev., features slot machines and
video poker. The one in San Francisco has a petting zoo. In
Jamestown, N.D., campers _ kampers? _ find themselves near the home
of Louis L'Amour and ``the world's largest buffalo,'' according to
the KOA directory. In Hayward, Wis., there's the lumberjack
competition. In Steamboat Springs, Colo., there are weekend
bonfires and balloon rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised what you find,'' says KOA communications
director Michael Smith , who answers the telephone this way: ``It's
a great day at KOA.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, as a matter of fact, a great day at our KOA in Belton.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is setting, pulling the temperature down with it. People
are riding bikes, walking dogs, floating in the pool on the
inflatable porpoises that are there for the guests. Smoke rises
from someone's grill.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboys and cowgirls are cooking up some chicken for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   They're here for the cutting-horse competition, like a rodeo for
quarter horses trained to separate a steer from a herd. They came
from East Texas, from places called Cleveland and Conroe and Winnie
and Weatherford.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting horses are in their stalls. The competition begins
on Monday, two days away. The Longhorns won this afternoon. So did
the Aggies. ``God Bless Texas'' is on the radio. Everyone's here,
their trailers are hooked up, and their chicken is sizzling on the
barbecue pit.
</P>
<P>
   So tonight they celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of cause. Terry Jones, a cowboy from Conroe,
will be honored at the end of the cutting-horse competition for
winning the season championship. He's been gone from home almost
every weekend this year, hauling horses from show to show.
</P>
<P>
   Terry says he used to spend $800 a month on hotels. Now he
sleeps in the front of his Featherlite horse trailer, which
resembles an apartment but smells of hay. ``I don't know how I made
it without it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Terry and his fiance, Jennifer Mushinski , booked this spot as
soon as they knew they were coming. The arena is over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got water. We've got electricity. We're right here,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's this: Terry, 34, has a special kinship with
KOA. He was conceived at one, he swears, in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   It's dark now, and the cowboys and cowgirls have been through
some Coors, so everyone gets a chuckle out of Terry's claim. The
laughter sweeps through the campground, and Alice Oltmer, the
owner, comes outside from the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quiet hours,'' she says quietly. It's after 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' says Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well guys _ have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see you in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``GoodnightGood night.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, much later, the campground is still again. The East Texas
cowboys and cowgirls are in bed. So is the new family from Canada.
So is Alice. So is Nancy Adams, and so is Chester, and so areis the
rest of the guests of the KOA.
</P>
<P>
   The only noise now is the hum of the traffic, the drone of tires
on the road.

SOME DONORS TO HILLARY CLINTON STAYED AT WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Fla., Calif., Mass., Ill.)   By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have
had 404 overnight guests at the White House and Camp David since
Hillary Clinton began campaigning for the New York Senate seat in
July 1999, including scores of donors to her campaign and several
of the Democratic Party's most prominent fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign said that about 100 of the overnight guests
were contributors to her campaign. But the White House and the
Clinton campaign vigorously denied any link between campaign
donations and sleepovers at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary. ``These are friends, public officials and supporters to
whom they wanted to extend the opportunity to stay with them in
their home. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and
unsupportable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, campaigning in Westchester County, N.Y., on
Friday afternoon, said: ``We have lots of friends and supporters
who spend time with us, spend the night with us. I don't have
anything else to add, other than we have given you the information,
and I don't think it is particularly newsworthy. The vast majority
of the people on the list have not contributed to my campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 overnight guests who contributed to Clinton's
campaign, 77 gave a total of $108,000 in direct or hard-money
donations to her Senate campaign, according to a preliminary
analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six sleepover guests gave $516,000 to related fund-raising
committees, chiefly the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
and New York Senate 2000, accounts that are designed to accept
unlimited soft-money contributions, the center found. Some of the
guests gave to both accounts. Clinton has raised more than $33
million in hard and soft money for her campaign, according to
federal campaign-finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, the center's director, said the figures might
contain minor errors because a number of the overnight guests have
common surnames.
</P>
<P>
   The center found that 146 of the guests had made political
contributions in this election cycle, giving a total of $5.5
million, 98 percent of it to Democratic committees and candidates.
The Democratic National Committee was the single largest recipient,
with $2.5 million. Vice President Al Gore's campaign got $142,750,
the center found.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who spent the night at the White House were three of
the biggest contributors to Clinton's soft-money campaign account,
New York Senate 2000: Vinod Gupta, an Internet entrepreneur from
Omaha, Neb.; S. Daniel Abraham, the founder of SlimFast Foods in
West Palm Beach, Fla.; and Lisa Perry, a longtime Democratic
fund-raiser and donor from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta, Abraham and Perry together gave Clinton more than
$228,000, according to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, which oversees Clinton's soft-money account. The three
are also large contributors to other Democratic candidates and
committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons also were host to Paul W. Adler, the Rockland
County Democratic Party chairman who was indicted last week on
federal fraud and bribery charges. Adler was an early supporter and
fund-raiser for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other New York political figures favored with overnight
invitations include Michael Bragman, the former state Assembly
majority leader; C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough
president; the Rev. Floyd Flake, the former congressman; and state
Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, the Nassau County Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   The list of overnight guests also contains several of Gore's top
fund-raisers, as well as a number of the Democratic Party's most
generous sponsors in recent years. Among those are Terry McAuliffe
of Washington; Alan Patricof of New York; Norman Pattiz of Los
Angeles, Haim Saban of Beverly Hills, Calif., Howard J. Kessler of
Boston, Chris Korge of Miami, William Brandt of Chicago, and Smith
and Elizabeth Bagley of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the overnight guests have given or pledged sizable
sums for the Clinton Presidential Library, a project for which
President Clinton and McAuliffe have been raising tens of millions
of dollars, a Democratic supporter said. Those donors include
Steven Spielberg, Arnold Simon, Gerald Schuster, Saban, Abraham,
Korge and the Bagleys, the supporter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were host to prominent figures including Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and King Juan Carlos of Spain, former
President Jimmy Carter and former Sen. George McGovern. They also
entertained numerous Hollywood figures, including Chevy Chase, Ted
Danson, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Quincy Jones, Michael Medavoy,
Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that overnight privileges at the White House and
Camp David were never given as a reward for contributions or an
incentive to donate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   And Lockhart asserted that the Clintons would continue to put up
guests in the Lincoln Bedroom, other White House residential
quarters and Camp David during the remainder of President Clinton's
term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, a group that
advocates stronger campaign-finance laws, and the Democratic former
attorney general of Massachusetts, accused the Clintons of using
the White House as a tool to advance their personal and political
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is particularly shocking is that it appears no lessons
were learned from scandals of 1996, and that the current occupants
of the White House are using it as a personal trophy and not the
people's house,'' Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazes me is that there is no sense of limits or shame,''
he added. ``Now to use it in furtherance of one of the occupants'
personal political goals in the state of New York is a new low.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House released the list Friday afternoon, two weeks
after The New York Times requested it. It covers guests who stayed
overnight from July 1, 1999, when Hillary Clinton began her
``listening tour'' in New York as a prelude to her campaign for the
Senate, through Aug. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog groups the guests in six categories: Arkansas
friends (51 people), longtime friends (102), friends and supporters
(86), officials and dignitaries (77), arts and letters and sports
(45), and family members and Chelsea Clinton's friends (43). The
White House did not provide names for the last group, citing
privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The list does not provide hometowns of guests or dates of
sleepovers (several of the guests stayed more than once, Lockhart
said). Lockhart said the dates were omitted because it would have
taken several additional days of research and because he did not
want reporters drawing unfounded inferences about a connection
between overnight stays and campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the White House detail whether guests were housed at the
White House or at Camp David. The list does not include members of
the Israeli and Palestinian delegations and U.S. officials who
participated in the Camp David talks on the Middle East this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Rick Lazio, Hillary Clinton's opponent, said the
amount of information released was insufficient, adding that the
link between sleepovers and donations would be clear if the White
House released the dates of the overnight stays. His aides
suggested that the Clintons were not present at the White House or
Camp David when some of guests stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand that Mrs. Clinton release the dates of the
sleepovers by all of her White House and Camp David guests,'' said
Bill Dal Col, manager of the Lazio campaign. ``New Yorkers deserve
to know if she was there `getting to know' these big donors or if
they were merely renting out these taxpayer-owned monuments like a
cheap motel.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said there might have been some occasions when neither
Clinton was present when a guest stayed overnight. But he
attributed those instances to last-minute scheduling changes and
the Camp David peace talks, which ran longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly sensitive because President Clinton
was widely criticized in 1997 when it was learned that he had used
White House coffees, overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and
rides aboard Air Force One to encourage supporters to donate to the
Democrats, and to reward those who had already done so. The White
House released a list of 938 guests who had spent the night at the
White House, prompting a flurry of congressional criticism and
negative press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,'' the president said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guests on the current list, Jill Iscol of Pound
Ridge, N.Y., said she resented the implication that the Clintons
were auctioning off White House stays to big donors.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Kenneth Iscol, a telecommunications
executive, have known the president and his wife for six years.
They met through their children; Zack Iscol, now 22, met Chelsea
Clinton when they were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Iscol said her family stayed overnight at the White House last
December but their largess to the Clintons and the Democratic Party
predated their sleepover. The Iscols have given more than $29,000
to Clinton's campaign and helped raise tens of thousands of dollars
more for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clintons are dear wonderful friends and have been for six
years,'' Jill Iscol said. ``I'm spending my life on this campaign
because I believe in it. There is no quid pro quo in this
operation.''

 &HT;    Toastmasters offers training ground for public speaking
 &HT;    By Sharon Sullivan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ It's early Tuesday morning and members
of Grand Junction Toastmasters are sitting around a table in a back
room at Common Grounds coffeehouse, 1230 N. 12th St.
</P>
<P>
   Some are drinking coffee, hoping to wake up fully before having
to speak. Palangat Velayudhan, who goes by Vela, loosens everyone
up with a bit of humor. His job today as Jokemaster comes
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Then they move on to Table Topics _ a thinking-on-your-feet
public speaking exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The word of the day is copious, which means abundant, plentiful,
in great quantities. Three to four people get called upon to speak
for 1 to 2 minutes, using the word of the day.
</P>
<P>
   New member Paul Harshman uses his turn to talk about the
``copious'' information he gathered while attending the Denver
Green Party Convention, during which Ralph Nader was nominated for
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He's pretty fired up about his experience in Denver and getting
to hobnob with Nader supporters Jim Hightower, author and activist,
and Granny D, the 90-year-old great-grandmother who walked 3,200
miles across the United States advocating campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Harshman may have been in the minority for his political views,
but he was voted best Table Topics that day, anyway. He told an
engaging story in 2 minutes on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   Toastmasters clubs are open to anyone wanting to improve formal
public speaking, individual communications, impromptu situations
and leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   Members participate in a self-paced, focused speaking program.
Founder of Toastmasters, Dr. Ralph Smedley, formed the first club
on Oct. 22, 1924, with a group of men in Santa Ana, Calif., with
the purpose ``to afford practice and training in the art of public
speaking and in presiding over meetings, and to promote sociability
and good fellowship among its members.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, other clubs in other cities and countries were
formed, and in 1973, Toastmasters International club membership was
opened to women. Today there are more than 8,000 clubs with more
than 180,000 members from all over the world in the nonprofit
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly draws people who want to be successful and are
interested in wanting to make their life and career grow,'' said
Barry Moore, area governor of Toastmasters for the Western Slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has a desire and a dream is going to have to
present themselves to the public. Table Topics in Toastmasters is
the way to prepare themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Grand Junction Toastmasters club you'll meet the ardent
Republican and the avid Green and everyone in-between, people of
all professions, philosophies and lifestyles. The most senior
member is 87 years old. The youngest is 26 and is as casual as the
other is formal.
</P>
<P>
   There are generally two 5- to 7-minute speeches at each weekly
meeting on topics as diverse as the members themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I love about our club, there's a real variety of
ages, experiences, political affiliations and knowledge,'' said
Kasey Conway, who has been a Toastmaster for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we have a conservative ex-uranium mining engineer
and I'm a liberal Democrat environmentalist. I think our
Toastmasters club is exciting because you can talk about the
different perspectives on an issue and actually give a speech about
it. It stimulates intellectual thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our club we have some polarized ideas and that's one of the
great things about our club. You learn to listen and evaluate ideas
even though they may be 180 degrees from where you're coming
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all speeches are political. In fact, most are not. People
speak about what they know about and are interested in. Kim Bridge,
34, likes to speak about family issues, drawing on her experiences
as a mother. ``I was home with my kids all the time. I'd become a
recluse. Getting into Toastmasters gave me the confidence to get
back out in the workforce,'' Bridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure. You just go and speak and get critiqued
but it's done in such a positive way. It makes you want to do
better and expand on your speeches, at least it did for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Roles at the meetings rotate each week. There are people giving
prepared speeches, someone assigned to give the joke of the day,
speech evaluators and Toastmaster of the week, who leads the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership skills you gain from running the meeting _ that
also helps out in the workforce,'' Bridge said. ``It helps to have
that experience behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers will pay for their employees to join. There is a
one-time fee of $36 and dues are $40 for six months.
</P>
<P>
   When a Toastmaster has the job of evaluator, he or she stands up
and gives a 2-minute oral evaluation of one of the speeches given
that day. ``One of the goals that has emerged from my experience is
the development of my evaluation skills, listening to what people
are saying,'' Conway said. ``You learn to be diplomatic, to say
what you mean, mean what you say, but say it in a way that doesn't
destroy but encourages them. I think that's a tremendous benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Vela came to the United States from India 25 years ago. ``I'm a
single full-custodial parent,'' Vela said. ``I wanted to convince
the courts to give fathers equal treatment in terms of giving them
either full or joint custody during divorce. That's one of the main
reasons I joined Toastmasters, and so I could talk to fathers'
groups about the important role they play in the lives of their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toastmasters also helped me a lot in my graduate courses. I
was able to talk off the cuff anytime I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   At 87 years old, Bob Sayre is the most senior and longest
standing member of Grand Junction Toastmasters, which was charted
in 1954. ``It's a challenge even when you've been in for 40-some
years,'' he said. ``When you get to be 87 years old, there's a
tendency to just stay at home or travel if they have the money. To
me it's a challenge to still get up there and make a talk that has
a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayre said he is still not running out of ideas to talk about.
``It helps to have a globe-trotting life,'' he said. ``Subjects
keep coming up that need to be covered.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife Bonney attends. She often wins at Table Topics.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd Carlson, a retired geologist, has been in Toastmasters
since 1986 and doesn't lack for ideas either. ``There's always
something new to come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyd and I are geologists and engineers,'' Sayre said. ``We've
sat through literally hundreds of awful speeches at professional
conventions on technical subjects _ speeches that were worthless.
They know their geology but they get up there and mumble about.
It's terrible. And you sit there and think `Gosh that guy needs
Toastmasters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speeches can be serious, humorous, personal or professional. New
members receive a manual that guides them on various aspects of
speaking such as vocal variety, using visual aids or adding impact
to a speech.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest member of Grand Junction Toastmasters, 26-year-old
Justin Monroe, said he uses what he has learned at Toastmasters
every day. ``I used to get really nervous if I had to talk about a
specific topic,'' Monroe said. ``Already in just the last three
months I can tell I'm much more calm. The cold sweats don't come
over me, the hands aren't as shaky as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member, Dorothy McNeese, has worked in environmental
restoration and is finishing up a degree in that field. She saw an
opportunity to improve her abilities with Toastmasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a need to speak more confidently, to do the things I
want to do,'' McNeese said. ``There are a lot of diverse people in
our club, different philosophies, yet when we come together at
Toastmasters there is this central goal to learn to speak better. I
like the way I see people who are total opposites yet have respect
for each other.''

 &HT;    Can't I just do a book report?
 &HT;    By Sharon Sullivan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ My friend Diana laughs when she thinks
about me being in Toastmasters.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to view me as a down-to-earth, laid-back sort of
person. Diana had an impression that Toastmasters were conservative
old businessmen all dressed in suits _a common misconception it
seems. Actually all kinds of people join Toastmasters. Sometimes
the only thing they have in common is a desire to speak better.
</P>
<P>
   I was browsing through the newspaper one day when a small ad
caught my eye. ``Speechcraft,'' an eight-week speech class, was
being sponsored by Toastmasters. It was one of those moments when I
knew in an instant that this was something I wanted and needed to
do. No hesitation, no thinking about it, I just signed up.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I enjoy getting up in front of a group and
speaking. Quite the contrary. I was always one of those kids who
would opt for a written book report over an oral one any day. Yet,
at 43, I'm a teacher. I teach small groups of pregnant couples
preparation for childbirth. I love the subject and am comfortable
in front of my small groups. But I figured the speech class could
help me polish my presentation skills.
</P>
<P>
   Our class of eight students learned the first night we'd each be
doing a 5- to 7-minute speech for the next seven classes. It was a
challenge, and slightly terrifying, but turned out to be exciting
and even fun. We all admitted to each other how we'd come home
after class totally energized. I liked it so much, in fact, I went
on to join Grand Junction Toastmasters even though they meet at
6:45 a.m. I used to hate to talk on the phone before 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But I go most every Tuesday morning to Common Grounds
Coffeehouse, where we meet, and it's definitely been worth it. I'm
back home by 8 a.m. and feel like I've already accomplished a lot
that day.
</P>
<P>
   I still get nervous when it's my turn to do a speech.
Practically everyone does. But I can do it now. I stand up in front
of my fellow Toastmasters and speak about things that are dear to
my own heart. I've had fun talking about things and issues I think
people should know about _ like Grand Junction's new community
radio station, the joy of contra dancing and the benefits of
carrying your baby on your body with a sling. I've been an advocate
for recycling and for the closing of the School of the Americas.
It's practicing and it's real at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned a lot about myself, where I'm strong and where I
need to improve. Meeting a group of people I wouldn't normally
cross paths with has been an added benefit. I love the people and
all the speeches I get to listen to.
</P>
<P>
   Toastmasters is a real exercise for the mind. I only wish I'd
joined 20 years ago.

U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL IS RECALLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Martin S. Indyk, the American ambassador to Israel
and an architect of American policy in the Middle East, has been
temporarily relieved of his post and has had his security clearance
lifted, pending an investigation into whether he mishandled
classified materials, State Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of espionage, the officials said, nor
was any American intelligence compromised. But they said the
concerns about Indyk's behavior stretch back at least five years,
to his first tour as ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department suspended the security clearance of Martin
Indyk, U.S. ambassador to Israel, pending the outcome of an
investigation of suspected violations of Department of State
security standards,'' said Richard Boucher, the State Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials involved in the inquiry declined to discuss
the specific charges against Indyk, except to say that questions
were raised about the proper treatment of classified documents, and
involved matters of their handling and storage and discussion about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk is ``cooperating fully'' with investigators from the FBI
and the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, officials
said. He has returned to the United States, and his deputy chief of
mission, Paul Simons, has taken charge of the American Embassy, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday night, Indyk expressed regret that his
security clearances had been suspended, leaving him unable to
perform his duties, and emphasized his ``firm conviction'' that no
classified information had been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over seven years, in the proud service of my country, I
have dedicated myself to the promotion of U.S. interests in the
Middle East,'' Indyk said. ``Jeopardizing the national security
interests of the U.S. is absolutely abhorrent to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indyk's departure threatens to further complicate the peace
process as American, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators struggle
to reach a deal before Clinton leaves office. Indyk, a longtime
expert on the region who is close to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, is
seen as a virtual partner to Dennis Ross, the administration's
special Middle East coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran national security official, John M. Deutch, is
under investigation by the Justice Department for admitted computer
security violations when he was director of the CIA. Investigators
are also trying to determine whether Deutch committed computer
security breaches years earlier as a senior official at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The new inquiry highlights a more stringent regime at the State
Department on matters of internal security. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced a department-wide shake-up last spring
_ including a series of briefings on the handling of classified
materials _ after a laptop computer vanished from a secure office
and an eavesdropping device, traced to a Russian diplomat, was
found in a conference room.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who declared herself ``humiliated'' by those lapses,
has been under pressure from Congress to turn around her
department's lax image. She has ordered State Department security
officers to draft a $300 million plan to improve security at the
Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   One American official voiced sympathy for Indyk's position,
calling him the victim of overzealous investigators motivated by
Albright's security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One lawmaker who has been critical of the State Department
breaches, Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., the chairman of the
International Relations Committee, said that if the allegations
were correct, ``they are a matter of highest concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident threatens an unusual career. Indyk, who was born in
London and raised in Australia, did not become an American citizen
until 1993, little more than a week before Clinton appointed him to
a job as the top Mideast expert on the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, his resume included a 10-month stint as deputy
director of Australia's intelligence operation for the Middle East.
He also held positions as a professor and the head of a
conservative pro-Israel group, the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Clinton named Indyk to his first tour as ambassador to
Israel, making him America's first Jewish ambassador to that
country. The appointment stirred skepticism among some American
Jews, who questioned why a foreign-born Jew should be so honored,
and among some Arab leaders, who voiced doubts about his
objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   As ambassador, Indyk became a pivotal figure in peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk became associated with more liberal Israeli leaders, and
was an early supporter of Shimon Peres of the Labor Party in his
bid to become prime minister. When Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud won
instead, Clinton recalled Indyk to Washington, but continued to tap
his expertise by making him assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In January, with the return to power of a Labor government and
Barak as prime minister, Clinton dispatched Indyk to Tel Aviv for a
second tour.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his candor and disdain of bureaucracy, Indyk angered
American Jewish groups this month, after he gave a speech calling
for Israel to share control of Jerusalem.

RENO ORDERS INTERNAL INQUIRY INTO HANDLING OF SECRETS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno told President Clinton
Friday that she has ordered an internal review of prosecutors'
handling of the case of Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos nuclear
scientist who was released from jail this month after the federal
government's case against him largely collapsed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who met with the president at the White House for about 45
minutes at his request, said she had ordered a review of the case
by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility
after the judge handling the matter, James A. Parker of U.S.
District Court in Albuquerque, strongly condemned the prosecution's
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also said that she would seek to declassify some documents
filed in connection with the case to explain the government's
handling of Lee, officials said. Critics, particularly
Asian-American groups, have said that Lee was the victim of racial
profiling by overzealous prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In calling Reno to the White House last week, Clinton said he
was ``quite troubled'' by the government's actions. Prosecutors
charged Lee with 59 counts of putting at risk the nation's nuclear
secrets. He was charged with downloading classified material to an
unsecure computer with the intent of aiding a foreign government.
Lee was kept in jail for nine months before his trial after
prosecutors argued that he was a threat to national security. But
the government dropped 58 of the charges as part of a deal in which
Lee pleaded guilty to a single felony count of mishandling
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had reservations about the claims that were being
made denying him bail,'' the president told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Lee's pretrial detention will be the focus of the
Justice Department's review, aides to Reno said, but the review
could grow beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the president's harsh words last week, it was clear
Friday that the White House was trying to play down any
disagreement between the president and the attorney general he
appointed in 1993 _ perhaps to present a united front in advance of
what is expected to be a contentious congressional hearing on the
issue next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who called the hearing, said Friday
that an internal Justice Department review of the case was
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the attorney general's standard reply, and then nothing
happens,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides explained that when the president said that
the government's handling of Lee ``can't be justified,'' his scorn
was more directed at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, an agency
with which he has clashed, than with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said the president
expressed his strong support for Reno at the meeting and agreed
with her that ``the priority'' was to debrief Lee to determine what
he did with the nuclear secrets that he improperly downloaded from
federal government computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general gave the president a sense of where they
are as far as looking at this,'' Lockhart said. ``I think they both
agree the most important thing going on is the debriefing process
and trying to find out just what happened to the computer tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who spoke by telephone with the president on Wednesday for
about 10 minutes, said before Friday's meeting that she and the
president were on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to discuss it, and he was thoughtful and
supportive,'' Reno said at her weekly media briefing Friday
morning. ``I think anybody who looks at this case and doesn't know
the circumstances of it is going to say, `Why?' And I think that's
what the president kind of naturally asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Clinton administration is expected to come under
heavy fire from congressional Republicans who believe the case was
bungled by the government. The Senate Judiciary Committee will
question Louis Freeh, the FBI director; James Robinson, head of the
Justice Department's criminal division; and Norman Bay, the U.S.
attorney in New Mexico, who handled the prosecution of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Professional Responsibility is led by H. Marshall
Jarrett, a career prosecutor. The office handles accusations of
criminal or ethical misconduct by Justice Department prosecutors.
Its oversight includes the FBI, whose agents, critics say, treated
Lee aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was joined at Friday's meeting by her chief of staff, Ann
M. Harkins. Beth Nolan, the White House counsel, and John Podesta,
the president's chief of staff, also attended the session.

 &HT;    Vote with your remote for the new fall shows
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the presidential campaign shifts into final gear, the new TV
season gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably noticed that summer rerun season has been
especially long this year _ an unhappy situation necessitated by
the late-arriving Summer Olympics. We've slogged through
``Survivor,'' muddled through ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
a few reality also-rans. Now it's time to get down to business, the
prime-time entertainment business, with real series written by real
writers and starring real actors.
</P>
<P>
   Much was written months ago about the absence of ``buzz'' around
the new TV season, but I think that may have had more to do with
the fact that previews arrived four months before the shows. Why
bother to buzz about something that's so far away? It's like trying
to get voters to pay attention to the November election before
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, a lot of new shows should be studiously ignored. Think
of them as fifth-party candidates. Some shows are worth a glance, a
few are promising and a handful are actually contenders. To help
you cast an educated vote in this fall's TV campaign, here's our
handy guide. Mark you ballots and set your VCRs. You want to be an
educated viewer/voter, don't you? And, as always, watch and debate
amongst yourselves.

   ' Ed'
</P>
<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   Relative unknown Tom Cavanagh stars as Ed, a big-city lawyer who
gets fired and comes home to find his wife in bed with another man.
What to do? He moves back to his hometown of Stuckeyville, Ohio,
buys a bowling alley and hawks 10-pin fun and legal advice. In his
spare time, he romances his high-school sweetheart, Carol (Julie
Bowen). This isn't as icky-sweet as it sounds. It's more charming
and quirky, a la ``Northern Exposure.'' Not a lot of guffaws but
plenty of gentle smiles.

<P>
   `Hype'
</P>
<P>
   (WB, Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   A large cast of complete unknowns does over-the-top, frantically
paced sketch comedy. The presentation tape, which was not supposed
to be for review but is the only thing available, shows a
potentially sharp cast performing gross-out material that spoofs
pop culture.There's an emphasis on tasteless, off-color humor
geared to the younger-than-''Saturday Night Live'' set. And there's
an annoying overall hysteria in the air.

   `Nikki'

<P>
   (WB, Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   This tacky new sitcom stars Nikki Cox's chest. Really. There's
no attempt to direct attention to dialogue or the situation or even
her pretty face. It's about her chest. She plays a Las Vegas dancer
married to a would-be wrestler. They're supposed to be funny
together. The wildly lame show comes from ``The Drew Carey Show''
creator Bruce Helford, who used to have talent.

<P>
   `Yes, Dear'
</P>
<P>
   (CBS, Oct. 2)
</P>
<P>
   Here's a worn out premise: Two couples with different
child-rearing philosophies collide with allegedly hilarious
results. Kim hyperventilates when her baby refuses to stand up and
walk on time; her sister, Christine, however, barely notices when
her kids refuse to eat or when she runs over the neighbor's cat.
Har har. There's one funny scene in the pilot, a computerized
gimmick with Kim's baby.

   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   `Tucker'
</P>
<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 2)
</P>
<P>
   A grosser version of ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' this sitcom is
about a 14-year-old boy, winningly played by Eli Marienthal
(``American Pie''). When his parents get divorced, he and his
mother move into the crowded home of his crass aunt (Katey Sagal)
and her idiot son, Leon. Tucker's life is one big embarrassment,
from Leon's disgusting human hair collection to the aunt's
misbegotten conviction that he's trying to see her naked. The only
light in Tucker's life is the pretty girl next door. This show has
some funny moments, but it lacks the intelligence and innocence
that elevate ``Malcolm.''

   `Deadline'

<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 2)
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Platt is a refreshing addition to TV, and the
star-studded supporting cast of Dick Wolf's latest drama includes
Bebe Neuwirth, Tom Conti and Lili Taylor. But ... the pilot doesn't
do a good job of blending the newspaper and crime-fighting
elements. Platt plays Wallace Benton, a New York columnist (based
on Jimmy Breslin), who uses his enormous ego and a group of
journalism students to right wrongs and solve crimes. The pilot has
a truthful ring or two (such as Benton screaming at his computer),
but it also has Benton asking cops to leave so he can interrogate a
murder suspect. Wolf wouldn't go that far astray on the superior
``Law &AMP; Order.''

   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   `Boston Public'
</P>
<P>
   (Fox, Oct. 23)
</P>
<P>
   Most TV critics hated this new high school drama _ which focuses
on the teachers rather than the students _ from David E. Kelley.
They said it was too sexual, too gross and too strange. Obviously
my colleagues haven't set foot in a high school in a long time. Chi
McBride holds things together as the intimidating but soft-hearted
principal, whose job is to deal with unruly students, burned-out
teachers and whining parents. Among the controversies dealt with in
the pilot: A teacher ends an affair with a student; a teacher
becomes the focus of an R-rated, student-produced computer cartoon;
and a teacher in charge of troubled students fires a gun in class
to get their attention. Irresponsible and illegal? Sure, but the
teacher will face repercussions. This isn't Kelley's best work, but
it's got lots of potential.

   `Girlfriends'
</P>
<P>
   (UPN, Sept. 11)
</P>
<P>
   This concept has certainly been beaten to death _ four women
living in the city, navigating professional and personal tides.
Promoted as an African American version of ``Sex and the City,''
it's not as R-rated or sex-obsessed. Kelsey Grammer is one of the
executive producers, a good sign, and the fresh new faces are
backed up with talent. Now, if only the scripts would rise to the
level of the

<P>
   `The Geena Davis Show'
</P>
<P>
   (ABC, Oct. 10)
</P>
<P>
   Well, yuck. There's something creepy about a sexy woman prancing
undressed around the home of the man she's engaged to while her
future stepson, an impressionable 14-year-old, drools over her.
This alleged family sitcom, with strong elements of (you guessed
it) ``Sex and the City,'' stars Oscar-winner Davis as a New York
careerwoman who falls in love with a suburban widower (Peter
Horton). If there is a dram of chemistry between Davis and Horton,
it isn't evident in the pilot. Nor is there an ounce of humor _
unless you're sick enough to laugh at the adolescent's ogling.

   `Dark Angel'
</P>
<P>
   (Fox, Oct. 3)
</P>
<P>
   James Cameron's first TV series is about as buoyant as the
Titanic. Critical opinion on this dark sci-fi drama split along
gender lines: Men liked it, while most women did not. The
leather-clad heroine, played by Jessica Alba (``Never Been
Kissed''), probably has something to do with it. The lumbering
two-hour pilot bounces between flashbacks to a group of genetically
enhanced kids with bar codes on their necks and the now grown-up
superwoman Max, a weary warrior in a post-apocalyptic future. The
language is crude, the dialogue cheap: ``I would have come sooner,
but I didn't,'' Max mutters. It's a future without civility or,
apparently, shampoo. Max joins forces with a resistance journalist
to buck the bad guys, but their crusade makes no sense.

   `The Michael Richards Show'
</P>
<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 24)
</P>
<P>
   At press time, there was still no pilot for the former
``Seinfeld'' star's latest outing. Scenes that were screened for
critics months ago, as well as promotional spots running on NBC
now, indicate that Richards is again playing Kramer. Now Jerry's
wacky neighbor is named Vic Nardozza and working as a bumbling
Hollywood detective. If enough of the spotlight is spread to the
impressive supporting cast (including Tim Meadows, William Devane
and Bill Cobbs), this one could be swell _ especially for
unrepentant lovers of physical comedy.

   Delta Burke as the first lady, and David Alan Grier as a Secret
Service agent demoted from protecting the president to guarding the
first lady. Concept: first rate. Stars: excellent. Execution: What
in the world went wrong? The pacing of the pilot is clumsy, with
odd spaces of dead air and characters, except for Agent Daggett,
that are not remotely entertaining. The first lady is mean-spirited
and superficial, her daughters are obnoxious and the president is
stupid. For this premise to work, somebody besides Dag has to be
sharp. The network is said to be tinkering with future episodes, so
there's a slender ray of hope.

</P>
<P>
   Emmy winner Andre Braugher teams up with his ``Homicide''
producer-writer Paul Attanasio for this brooding medical drama.
Braugher plays an experimental oncologist. The premise is that
life-threatening illnesses give life meaning. The show itself isn't
on the same level as ``Homicide,'' but Braugher's intensity and
passion can make the phone book interesting, and Attanasio promises
to weigh in on meaty medical issues. The downside of this drama is
the demographically driven residents and interns whom Gideon
teaches _ pretty and handsome young things who add little to the
mix. But maybe they'll get better.

<P>
   Grade: A-

<P>
   `Bette'
</P>
<P>
   (CBS, Oct. 11)
</P>
<P>
   OK, we're sick of the ads showing Bette Midler hoisting her
breasts and taping up her eyelids. But there's more to ``Bette,''
trust me. The Divine Miss M spoofs her own outrageous persona,
honing in on insecurities about age, weight, sex appeal and talent.
``I keep doing guest spots,'' she moans. ``Pretty soon I'll have my
own series and then I might as well kill myself.'' There's a
running gag in the pilot about Bette's bitterness toward Sally
Field, who beat her for an Oscar. Bigger-than-life Bette may rub
some viewers wrong, but in comedy, bigger is better and Bette is
huge.

   `Welcome to New York'
</P>
<P>
   (CBS, Oct. 11)
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman's production company concocted this sitcom, and
the premise is vaguely autobiographical. Jim Gaffigan plays a
weatherman from Indiana who lands a job on a morning show in New
York where abrasive producer Christine Baranski rules the roost.
The stuffed-shirt anchorman, played by Rocky Carroll, instantly
feels threatened, much to Jim's surprise. Well-written with smart,
snappy dialogue, this one could click if the culture clash between
plain-spoken Midwesterner and sharp-barking New Yorkers stays on
track.

   Yes, I'm ashamed that I kind of liked this new soap from Aaron
Spelling. Maybe it's just nostalgia for the days of ``Dallas'' and
``Dynasty,'' but I wasn't the only critic who hooted at Spelling's
spoof of his own favorite genre. Victoria Principal plays the sweet
matron in a divorced family headed by Perry King. The exes have two
hunky sons and two luscious daughters. The sons are vying for
control of the family business, and the daughters are in love with
the same man. One of the sons, woodenly played by flex-happy Casper
Van Dien, has a history with his father's new fiancee, played by
super-babe Yasmine Bleeth. A very campy guilty pleasure.

   Sex, power and money _ not necessarily in that order _ are the
focus of this fast-paced drama from Darren Star, creator of
``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex and the City.'' A group of fast-trading
hot shots decide to leave a prestigious Wall Street brokerage firm
and strike out on their own. Will they make it? Of course, the
question is what they'll do with the lucrative proceeds after
hours. Besides making money, these folks like to make whoopee,
occasionally under kinky conditions. The eclectic mix includes an
ambitious good guy, played by Tom Everett Scott; Adam Goldberg as
the kinky guy with an ironic detachment from work; Rick Hoffman as
a major sexist pig; and Jennifer Connelly as a hard-charging
executive. Fresh faces, fine potential.

   This soft-focus, multigenerational family drama gets some heft
from classy Edward Hermann as (what else?) a stodgy, upper-crust
snob. But the heart of the show, which is sometimes a bit too
tender and precious, comes from the relationship between a
32-year-old single mother, played by Lauren Graham, and her
16-year-old daughter, winningly played by Alexis Bledel. To save
her daughter from the perils of an inner-city high school, the mom
decides to send her to an elite prep school. To pay for it,
however, she has to move home and sponge off her wealthy parents,
played by Hermann and Kelly Bishop. The concept is a bit strained,
but the relationships are worthwhile.

pilot is an earnest attempt _ with scaled-down special effects from
the movie. The train crash, for example, is replaced by a car
crash, and Kimball leaps off a building instead of a dam as he
flees Lt. Gerard (Mykelti Williamson). By TV standards, a ton of

instance, solves a murder in which a prostitute killed a man by
putting poison on her nipples. Swell. Petersen experiments with how
another crime might have happened by pumping a fake head with real
blood, swatting it with a golf club and eyeballing how the blood
splattered. I'm sure this is realistic, but it was too darn gross
for me. Less queasy types, however, may find it fascinating.

life-long dream of going to college. Her Italian immigrant parents
have mixed opinions about the decision. Her mother, played by Ellen
Burstyn, is convinced that Lydia is destined to a life of manless
misery; her father, played by Paul Sorvino, tells her to follow her
dream. Rounding out this exceptional cast is Debi Mazar as Lydia's

   The local politics of Washington, D.C. _ populated by an African

make for great dramatic fodder. Unfortunately, that's not what this
cop show is about. Craig T. Nelson plays the city's crusading new
police chief who arrives to save the city ruled by an ineffective
black mayor (remember Marion Barry?) and a corrupt black police
deputy. White savior in a black city is an uncomfortable concept,
although the premise is based on the life of Jack Maple,a former
New York deputy police commissioner who headed police departments
in New Orleans and Philadelphia. Nelson is good as the quirky
commissioner, and the supporting cast, which includes Lynn Thigpen
and John Amos, is good, too. It's just hard to get past the white
savior element.

 &HT;    A new look at ``Grosse Pointe''
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And today's Hollywood lesson: Don't mess with Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary producer may be about 125 years old, but he still
wields clout in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Darren Star. The creator of such hits as ``Beverly
Hills, 90210,'' ``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex and the City'' was at
it again with a new show, ``Grosse Pointe,'' a dead-on,
behind-the-scenes look at the making of a teen soap. Think a
younger version of ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' While the series
attacks the entire teen soap genre, it became quite obvious
``Grosse Pointe'' was aiming many of its wickedly funny barbs at
the campy ``90210.'' In fact, Star even hired actors who looked
like they could stand in for Shannen Doherty, Luke Perry and Tori
Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Tori Spelling. Seems her well-heeled pops wasn't too happy
that some of those barbs hit too close to home. On the series, a
red-haired Lindsay Sloane ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' plays a
Tori Spelling lookalike whose producer-daddy got her the gig on the
fictional ``Grosse Pointe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nepotism in Hollywood _ imagine that!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, poppa Spelling's feelings were hurt. So were Tori's.
Spelling called the WB and complained _ loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have some nerve making fun of my no-talent daughter who's
still looking for work,'' Spelling barked to WB suits. Well, I'm
guessing his words sounded something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling also called Star and told him he was not amused. Star
admits Spelling's vehement reaction surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would look at it with a greater sense of humor,''
Star says sheepishly. ``When you're a public figure, you'd think
you'd develop a slightly thicker skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to risk alienating the mighty Spelling, Star made a
few subtle changes. Sloane's hair is now brown and the nepotism
angle has been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really worth fighting to the point of perhaps not
seeing the show on the air,'' Star reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, OK, but everyone still knows Sloane's character is an
exaggerated _ or perhaps not so exaggerated _ version of Tori.
</P>
<P>
   Sloane, currently co-starring with Kirsten Dunst as a cutthroat
cheerleader in the film ``Bring it On,'' admits she was a bit
confused by all the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I created this character, and then suddenly I'm
reading all of these articles and people are saying that I'm
mimicking somebody or copying somebody,'' Sloane says. ``So, it
kind of makes you think twice about how much credit you may get in
this business.''
</P>
<P>
   So, has Star heard from Doherty or Perry?
</P>
<P>
   Star actually approached Doherty about a cameo, but she was too
busy filming ``Charmed'', the WB's hit drama about three witches.
No word from Perry, who actually has more reason to be upset. Kohl
Sudduth, the actor who plays the hunky Perry clone, is balding and
looks more like, oh, Tim Conway, when the cameras stop rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Star certainly hopes he won't receive any more calls from ticked
off actors or producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is nobody form the cast of ``90210'' should be
rushing to identify themselves,'' he says. ``They should just
laugh, say that's funny and that's it's not me.''

Reagan's quip about age. ``I was almost certain the campaign was
over,'' he said in an interview for the special, ``and it was.''
Clinton loved debating at a town meeting in 1992, but George Bush
could not help looking at his watch twice. ``I was glad when the
damn thing was over,'' Bush says. The special, ``Debating Our

playwrights, including Edward Albee and Arthur Miller. This season
it has invited each of its past nine resident writers to submit a
new play. The New York Times recently brought together some of
these playwrights to ask how their experiences at Signature had
affected their artistic process. The panel _ John Guare, Horten
Foote, Maria Irene Fornes, Miller and Albee _ was moderated by The

   THEATER-LIFEGAME-IMPROV (New York) _ Actors and producers of
``Lifegame'' say it is ``terrifying.'' Here's why. Every night, the

the guest about important events of his life. Then, the
seven-person troupe makes theater about that guest's life. On the
spot. For two hours. In front of an audience. Sometimes the troupe
might act out a guest's first kiss with puppets; other times the
guests might play themselves in a scene. Sometimes, the guest plays
God talking to an actor playing the guest. In short, no show is

Christopher Wheeldon listened to the composer's words inserted in

in the snow.'' With that, Wheeldon's imagination took off as
everything else has for the 27-year-old choreographer. In 1993, he
took a guest class at the New York City Ballet and two days later
was offered a position in the company. Since last spring when he
announced he was retiring from performing, he has created new works
for City Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal Ballet of
London and a workshop of a Marvin Hamlisch-John Guare musical,

   MUSIC-HENDERSON (New York) _ Luther Henderson, 81, knows that
the lot of the orchestrator-arranger is to labor behind the scenes
constructing instrumental settings that animate the music of
others. On Thursday at Carnegie Hall, Henderson's billing for once
will be bold-faced, as Simon Rattle directs an evening of Duke
Ellington's music re-orchestrated by Henderson for symphonic
performance. For this occasion Henderson chats with Barry Singer
about the orchestrations and offers some historical insight into
Ellington, who he met when he was 13 years old. By Barry Singer.

   MUSIC-PROMS (London) _ The Henry Wood Promenade Concerts were
founded by Wood, a conductor, organist and pianist, in 1895. The
Proms, as it is known, take their character from the Promenaders,
or Prommers: the devoted listeners who buy standing room on the
arena floor in front of the stage and high aloft in the gallery.
Lines of Prommers form outside on the day of a concert. Some wait
to buy tickets for less than $5. For the most part, the Prommers
spend the time before concerts collecting money for charities and
engaging in polite conversation, but once performances begin, the
intense silence is impressive. On the Last Night of Proms, as the
capstone is called, lunacy prevails and Prommers sing along, wave
flags and become part of the show. By James R. Oestreich

best, including the Metropolitan Operas series that can be
purchased with a $150 donation. Among them, he finds an
electrifying recording of Puccini's ``Turandot'' from 1961, with
Birgit Nilsson in the title role conducted by Leopold Stokowski. By

   EXHIBIT-REMBRANDT (Boston) _ Once again a small show at the
Isabelle Stewart Gardner Museum addresses large themes. The show
entitled ``Rembrandt Creates Rembrandt: Art and Ambition in Leiden,
1629-1631,'' examines how the artist managed his career during
those critical years. We see him at 23 with tousled hair, a bulbous
nose, a small mouth and round eyes. Two years later, having
achieved fame and some fortune, to a large extent from
experimenting with images of his own face, he moved from Leiden to
Amsterdam, the commercial and artistic center of the Netherlands.
There are 9 etchings and 11 paintings in the show. Each conveys the

   TRAVEL-WILLIAMSBURG (Undated) _ Colonial Williamsburg has lost
that freshly painted look that critics said made it look like a
genteel ancestor of Disneyland. Today its picture of 1770s life has
taken on greater accuracy. Horse droppings are left on the street
and in the Governor's Palace some of the antiques, brocades and
Oriental rugs have been replaced with less ornate furnishings. The
revisions also address the fact that half of Williamsburg's
Revolutionary-era population were slaves. Through a boxwood hedge,
the writer observed actors portraying slaves debating the rights
and wrongs of rebellion. As for Indians, the man playing the
schoolmaster complains that Indians lack punctuality and ambition.

(1790), about the arrival of limes from the Antilles. She found
Mrs. Shapiro (1909) worried about her daughter Mollie's refusal to
speak Yiddish and a look-a-like for Rosie the Riveter discussed the
fall of the Philippines to Japan and her observation that it might

highlighting its most distinctive saunas with a ``sauna of the
month'' tour. Edmund L. Andrews was determined to find out why a
country of 5 million people has 2 million saunas. Andrews' tour
included the power sauna at the Palace Hotel where executives cool
down with a view of Helsinki and the King's Road smoke sauna, a
wood shack built in 1839. At the Finnish Sauna Society on
Lauttasaari Island he felt the tingle of birch branches; in Oulu,
he followed his naked host into an icy river. Visiting the full
dozen on the tour is probably too much, but Andrews reports that
the purpose is to feel good and for that any of the saunas will do.

fares are starting to climb and Great Britain is still more

   OIL-ENERGY-CRISIS (Undated) _ Business is struggling with the
energy crisis much more than consumers, who appear to view higher
prices for gasoline and heating fuel as more of a nuisance than a
threat, concludes this definitive 3200-word piece on the nation's
third energy crisis since 1973. Five reporters assigned to this
story found the hardest hit (truckers) and the biggest
beneficiaries (oil companies and airlines) and even a silver lining
(a stimulus for oil exploration). They found some energy-dependent
companies like Federal Express adding a rate surcharge and many
companies worried about profits. In general terms, the nation's
booming prosperity is losing a little steam. Then they brought the
economy home to one trucker, David Densberger, paying $300 a week
for more diesel fuel. That $300 would have gone to buy a new rig.

   PROFILE-ICAHN _ In the heyday of leveraged buyouts Carl C. Icahn
was lumped into the same category as Saul Steinberg, Ronald
Perelman and T. Boone Pickens. They have, to varying degrees, faded
while his worth has increased five-fold since 1966. This profile
and interview reveals details about his investment philosophy that
date back to his study of philosophy at Princeton. It also reviews
some of his headline-making deals, including the most recent, the
purchase of GM stock and its abrupt sale this week after GM annoyed
him by revealing his position. As for future plans, he might buy it

one of his best-known brainchildren, the first frequent-flier
program. The program transformed airline marketing and has become a
sort of shadow currency. With the boom in travel, the number of
unredeemed miles outstanding has shot up into the trillions, by
some estimates. Crandall, 64, is now an investor and adviser with
MilePoint.com, a new venture meant to help mop up some of those
miles. Five questions are posed to Crandall by Jane L. Levere.

25,000 copies for his own publishing company, Waggle Dancer Books.
Kaplan hired a friend from Harvard to draw the book's cartoons, but
he and his parents did everything else. He formatted the book on
his computer. His parents helped with the editing and contracted
with a printer for 5,000 copies, paying the bill with money from
the family's college savings that went unused because Benjamin got
$90,000 in scholarships. By Mary B.W. Tabor.

   BOOK-HARLEY (Undated) _ ``More Than a Motorcycle'' is not a book
about the how Harley-Davison scratched its way to prosperity after
laying off 4 of 10 employees. It's about changing a company's
thinking to a more collaborative style. Instead of command and
control from the top down, Harley chief executive Rich Teerlink,
and co-author Lee Ozley, a consultant, had a vision of the people
closest to a problem resolving it by consensus. It is is full of
observations of how employees were organized into ``natural work
cycles'' instead of departments and how Harley changed its mission
statement from producing motorcycles to fulfilling ``dreams through
the experiences of motorcycling.'' Students of business
organization could take this instructive account as a textbook;
unfortunately, it reads like one, says the reviewer, Fred Andrews.

The answer: conservation concession. The Conservation International
Foundation, based in Washington, is in the final stages of buying
logging rights to 200,000 acres of rain forest in Guyana. Peru,
Bolivia, Brazil, Madagascar and Cambodia may be next. The charity
is backed by business luminaries like Craig McCaw, who gave $5

portfolio of Alliance Capital he also uses a a V-Factor strategy.

eventually even baby boomers will become risk adverse like every

according to the National Association of Realtors. The median age
of buyers was 43. All this buying has soaked up the supply and
raised the prices of second homes in many areas. More than new
wealth is driving boomers into second homes. Previous generations
tended to buy second homes as they neared retirement or when the
children were grown. Boomers, too, are looking to retirement, but
they are planning for it earlier, buying second homes in their 40s
in anticipation of retiring, say, at 55. They are also buying them
to give their children a sanctuary from a stressful world. By James

Companies with operations in Europe have been hurt by the weak euro

automakers to keep a lid on prices. General Motors and
DaimlerChrysler, in particular, have launched extensive, worldwide
cost-cutting drives in recent weeks. ``It's a horrific confluence

   ABOUT-CARS-MITSUBISHI-MONTERO (Estes Park, Colo.) _ Like just
about every vehicle in the $32,000-to-$36,000 segment, the ride in
the Mitsubishi Montero has been re-engineered to feel more like a
car's than a camel's. The appointments are more luxurious and the
third row of seats, which is standard, does a neat disappearing
act. Outside, the Montero's famously boxy look has been given a
little flair. but the large grille and squared-off side windows
don't mesh well with rounded fenders. Another reason for the strong
sales is its new Sportronic automatic, a transmission that allows
drivers to shift manually, but without a clutch. This was a
brake-saving delight, reports Leonard M. Apcar, who did something
not many drivers do _ he took an off-road vehicle off-road.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-MITSUBISHI _ In late-night sessions at Mitsubishi's
Atlanta headquarters, Automotive News reports that regional sales
managers entered false sales data, seeking to inflate the region's
total to meet corporate objectives and outsell other regions. The
managers entered names like Bud Weiser and Supa Mann as the buyers
of cars on dealers' lots. Dealers never knew about the fake sales
until a legitimate buyer wanted the car _ and the dealer would find
it listed on the computerized inventory as sold. The region would
then ``back out'' the false sale and enter the real buyer.
Mitsubishi concedes that false sales were entered, though it
insists that the numbers were in the hundreds, not the thousands as
Automotive News reported. By Marcia Ruff.

   GLOBAL-PROTEST-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Say
``anti-globalization'' and a stormy image tends to come to mind:
ransackers of McDonald's restaurants in France, smashers of Seattle
store-front windows. The police on every corner here and the
shuttered shops reflect the power of such specters. But they

Petroleum Reserve for only the second time in history, it would

up to the moon. We own personal computers. The Internet has made
its way into more than half of America's homes; the geeks did

   VIOLENCE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ More than 80 percent of
American adults tell pollsters that they think that violence in the
culture contributes to violent acts by young people. Even though
the evidence of a relationship between culture and actual violence
is highly uncertain, it is good politics to wax indignant about
entertainment corrupting the nation's youth. Of course, the First
Amendment makes it almost impossible to draft a law that would
place meaningful restrictions on entertainment. Besides, the
entertainment industry is a big source of campaign money for both
major parties, especially for Democrats. By David E. Rosenbaum.

   GUNS-DECISION-TEXT (Undated) _ A federal judge in Texas gave gun
groups a startling victory last year and set off an appeals battle
that legal experts say could be the most important dispute over the
constitutional right to firearms in recent memory. The judge, Sam
R. Cummings, held that history proves that the right ``to keep and
bear arms'' in the Second Amendment gave individual citizens a
right to weapons. His decision, with its emotional resonance for
gun supporters, was in conflict with the vast weight of modern
rulings, which have held that the amendment merely gave the states
a right to keep armed militia units.

   KISSING-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In politics, the Y2K bug has

   UNWED-MOTHERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Four years ago, as the whole
debate over ``family values,'' single mothers and welfare
dependency reached its peak, Congress plopped a $400 million bonus
program into the welfare reform act. The so-called ``illegitimacy
bonus'' promised $100 million a year, for four years, to be split
among the five states that produced the largest decrease in
out-of-wedlock births, with no increase in abortion rates. Last

   GORE-MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Much has been made in the

<P>
   For David Densberger, who last week hauled canned tuna from New
Orleans to Chicago in his 18-wheeler and then took a load of fresh
vegetables on the much shorter hop across Wisconsin to St. Paul,
the building energy crisis has a precise cost: the extra $300 that
he now spends each week on diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   That was the $300 that Densberger, who is 53, had been putting
aside to buy a new rig, which he does every three years. His
current tractor, in fact, will turn three in February, but as the
price of a barrel of crude oil has climbed to its highest level in
a decade, Densberger can no longer save for a down payment. Unable
to raise the rates he charges to haul freight as fast as his fuel
prices have climbed, he sees no choice but to keep the old rig
rolling and his fingers crossed that oil prices will fall soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can I do?'' he asked. ``I can't stop driving and let
my truck go back to the finance company and ruin my credit and not
have a way to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the impact on the American economy of the prolonged
rise in petroleum prices and the more recent spike in natural gas _
both now at levels that provoked previous energy shocks _ and
Densberger pops up among the hardest hit. On a scale of 1 to 10, he
is close to 10, along with tens of thousands of other
owner-operators in trucking who have not been able to offset the
steep rise in diesel fuel prices. Corporate America in general,
registering 4 or 5 on this scale, is struggling with the energy
crisis much more than consumers, who appear to view higher prices
for gasoline and heating fuel as more of a nuisance than a threat
to their living standards. That puts them at 1 or 2 on the scale,
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that people think they are immune to higher energy
costs, but they don't believe the higher costs will persist,'' said
Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's consumer
sentiment survey. ``That is the key to their indifferent behavior.
They expect the spike in prices to be a temporary phenomenon, so
they don't give it much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses do. Worried about profits, many companies have found
or are trying to find ways to offset the impact: They use less
energy, obtain discounts on their energy purchases, charge a bit
more when they can, or operate more efficiently. Some companies, of
course, are profiting from this latest energy crisis, which began
stealthily about 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy is not profiting, even though economists are not
forecasting doom, either. Each of the three other crises since 1973
ended in a recession, but this one appears unlikely to do so. It
is, however, gradually taking some steam out of the nation's
booming prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the energy crisis, the economy would have expanded at
close to a 6 percent rate this year,'' said Mark Zandi, chief
economist at Economy.com, an economics research firm. ``Now the
consensus forecast is 5.2 percent growth.''
</P>
<P>
   If oil and natural gas prices remain stubbornly high through
next year, economic growth will be reduced by an additional half
percentage point, by some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   As the higher energy prices ripple through the economy, the big,
early beneficiaries are obvious: the integrated oil companies like
ExxonMobil, Chevron, Texaco and Conoco. They not only pump crude
oil _ now selling for $32.68 a barrel, more than double the price
during the spring of last year _ but they also refine it and sell
it as gasoline, aviation fuel and heating oil. Net income at some
of these giants has almost doubled this year, their best
performances since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies are not the only winners. The airlines, already
flooded with passengers in a booming economy, have raised fares 14
percent this year, more than covering the extra fuel costs. Delta
enhanced profitability by investing, months ago and more than the
other airlines, in futures contracts _ in effect, buying fuel in
advance at well below the current market price.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are even using the spike in heating fuel prices
as a selling opportunity. The Carrier division of United
Technologies, for instance, is pushing a remote thermostat control
that it makes for utility companies. Three utilities are beginning
to use the control to adjust the thermostats of homeowners, with
their permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family hardly notices if its utility supplier, using an
Internet connection, lowers the thermostat setting by a single
degree in winter,'' said Matt Chadderdon, a Carrier spokesman,
``but across hundreds of homes there is a saving.''
</P>
<P>
   For most companies and industries, though, high energy prices
are a risk. FedEx, a huge consumer of aviation fuel as well as
gasoline, has added a 4 percent surcharge to its rates. That has
just about offset the increase in fuel costs _ without costing the
company business so far, the company said. In the auto industry,
sales of sport utility vehicles stopped rising over the summer,
while sales grew for smaller vehicles that are more fuel-efficient
but less profitable. Higher gasoline prices played a role in this
shift, analysts said, but so did a weaker stock market, whose
earlier gains had helped people pay for SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical industry is particularly pressed to adjust. Natural
gas and petroleum are basic raw materials in making chemicals,
which in turn are the raw materials for all sorts of everyday
products and parts, especially those made of plastic and fiber.
Companies are using many strategies to nullify their rising energy
costs and even gain a leg up. Nova Chemicals, for one, had
fortuitously bought futures contracts that guaranteed natural gas
for well under $3 per thousand cubic feet, or roughly three days of
consumption in a single-family house. When the price shot up in the
spring and summer to $4.50, the company sold the contracts at a
profit of $100 million and bought gas on the spot market, gambling
that prices would fall sharply before the money was used up in late
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal view is that natural gas prices will come down in
the next quarter,'' Jeffrey M. Lipton, Nova's chief executive, said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   He is more optimistic than almost every forecaster. The price of
natural gas is still a very strong $5.29 at the wellhead, while
crude oil fell below $35 a barrel on Friday as President Clinton
announced the staggered release of 30 million barrels of oil from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Gasoline, averaging $1.53 a gallon,
is up 50 percent in two years. Natural gas prices began to rise
sharply only last spring, but have doubled since then. Most homes
use natural gas for heating, and household heating bills will rise
by $200 or more this winter, according to an Energy Department
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   When will prices drop significantly? Production cutbacks in 1998
and early 1999 by the oil-producing nations brought on the crisis,
and only now is production revving up by enough to replenish
inventories to the point that prices can begin to move back toward
noncrisis levels. ``Rather than $25-a-barrel oil by Christmas,''
said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of
Economic Advisers, ``we will get down to that level a year from
now, or maybe 18 months from now.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Tire industry shielded from scrutiny
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ No federal agency tracks the number of deaths
related to tire problems, a fact that may change since officials
linked 101 deaths to faulty Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the recent calls for stronger regulation, the
industry was cloaking its mistakes in judges' orders designed to
protect ``trade secrets,'' attorneys going after tire companies
around the country say. And with few reporting rules, not even the
National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has many key
records.
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach County lawsuit, set for trial in October,
highlights the industry's ability to shield itself from scrutiny.
Attorneys suing Uniroyal Goodrich say the company's parent,
Michelin, has consistently destroyed documents and lied about their
existence, according to court records. And in at least one
occasion, a judge has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want anybody to see the records of the tires that
are failing. Nobody,'' said Jeff Liggio, a lawyer representing one
of the two women who died in a 13-person van crash eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Liggio, partner Jene Williams, and a para-legal have been
sifting through 79 banker's boxes and 103 rolls of microfilm full
of complaints about Uniroyal tires.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints, lodged between 1983 and 1989, may be unwarranted
or minor. A consumer may have run over a bed of glass and blamed
the company when she popped a tire. Perhaps someone else used the
tires so much they became bald, but still tried to weasel a free
pair of new tires from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the nature or validity of the complaints, consumers and
the government have never seen them. The records are confidential.
And if not for a bit of luck and a court order, Liggio and Williams
wouldn't have them in their office now.
</P>
<P>
   Liggio has been asking Uniroyal for the tire complaints since
1993, two years after a van leaving from a Fort Pierce church
meeting flipped on Interstate 95 near PGA Boulevard and left Mary
Eddings and Lisa Wright dead. The tread on the van's left rear tire
had separated, the victims' families contend. The 1988 tire,
labelled National Chaparral, was manufactured by Uniroyal Goodrich
in an Alabama plant, which has since been bought by Michelin.
</P>
<P>
   Eddings' and Wright's families sued Uniroyal, claiming the tire
was defective and caused the crash. Uniroyal argues a number of
other factors are responsible, including a plug used to make a
faulty tire repair. No one in the van was wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after filing suit, victims' attorneys requested the records
on tire complaints, called adjustment forms. The judge in the case
determined the request was legitimate because the families were
claiming Uniroyal had used a poor adhesive between the tire's
rubber and its steel belts. Complaints from other customers could
help the plaintiffs determine whether this was a manufacturing
problem or if consumers were improperly warned of potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Uniroyal attorneys said the company didn't keep those records,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't true. Another attorney had the exact records
Liggio and Williams were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   James Seifter, who was suing Uniroyal in Fulton County, Ga., had
spent weeks digging through company files in Akron, Ohio, and
eventually left the plant with boxes full of consumer complaints.
Seifter won a $42 million verdict in the Georgia case, which was
later overturned by the state supreme court. He has since settled,
with an agreement that he and his client would not disclose the
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Before the confidentiality agreement, word of Seifter's boxes
made its way through the small community of lawyers who sue tire
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Seifter couldn't hand the boxes to Liggio and Williams,
photocopy the records or even summarize them.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in product liability cases _ including Seifters _ give
companies broad protection from public s of many of their
records. State and federal laws protect the companies from having
to divulge trade secrets and that is often interpreted to include
the release of most company documents. When lawyers suing the
companies get such documents, it is usually under ``protective
orders,'' which strictly limit who can see the documents and
require that they be returned when the cases end.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin vigorously defends its right to protect company
secrets, claiming many of the documents requested could aid
competitors. Company spokesman Michael Fanning said complaint
statistics can be taken out of context and he also points out that
lawyers often file groundless complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, plaintiffs lawyers will go on fishing
expeditions,'' Fanning said.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA, which regulates tire safety, can request company
documents. But that organization relies mostly on complaints made
directly to its hotline, a spokeswoman said, meaning regulators see
documents only when they order an investigation or when a company
reports defects on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Bills moving through Congress this week, as a result of the
Firestone inquiry, would give the agency a larger budget along with
more power to collect data related to tire defects.
</P>
<P>
   Seifter asked an Atlanta judge to modify the protective order in
his case, which allowed Liggio and Williams to discuss the
documents. Georgia state Judge John Mather ruled Liggio and
Williams could have the documents as long as their Florida judge
agreed, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   In his Dec. 16 order, Mather wrote of ``grave concerns that the
defendant may be engaged in a pattern of misrepresentation with the
aid of this court's protective order.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Catherine Brunson said
the attorneys could use the boxes for their case.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Florida attorneys could get the boxes, Uniroyal
attorneys went back to Georgia and persuaded Mather to send the
boxes to Price Waterhouse, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   That rankled Brunson: ``Uniroyal has engaged in a pattern of
willfully violating this Court's Order and obstructing the
Plaintiff's ability to carry out this Court's Order of March 10,
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   She ordered the documents be turned over immediately and
reserved the right to penalize Uniroyal as the suit progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Liggio and Williams say other documents have been hidden,
including a manual used at the plant where the tire was made. A
judge will rule on that issue later.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning, the Michelin spokesman, said his company has provided
600,000 pages of documents to Liggio and Williams in the past six
months. And, he said, officials spent $200,000 to locate a single
roll of microfilm that had fallen out of its container, become
wedged between file folders and made its way to Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did locate it,'' Fanning said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin, Uniroyal's parent, has aggressively defended itself
before. Three years ago, after Michelin lost a $30 million verdict
to a Belle Glade truck driver, the company sent nine private
detectives to look at jurors' pasts and accused three of them of
lies or omissions during jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney in that case, Donald Fountain, wanted the same
boxes that are now in Liggio's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to trial on our case, their final word was these
documents are destroyed, they do not exist any longer. And that's
what the jury heard,'' Fountain said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth District Court of Appeals threw out the $30 million
verdict and ordered a new trial because the trial judge didn't let
Michelin strike one of the jurors whose daughter had a tire
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Before the second trial, Fountain learned of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then all the sudden, we settled,'' Fountain said. ``Funny how
that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of Fountain's March settlement are confidential, and a
Michelin spokesman said the settlement did not amount to an
admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a federal magistrate in Georgia fined Michelin $25,000
for abusing evidence requested in a tire failure lawsuit in which
three people died, according to papers filed in the Eddings case.
``Michelin offered nothing but verbiage and a stone wall in
response to plaintiffs' efforts to obtain information essential to
the prosecution of their case,'' the judge wrote in a stinging
seven-page order.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain was in Seattle this week, meeting with about a dozen
lawyers from around the country who sue tire companies to discuss
strategies and possible class actions against Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Firestone recall began, Fountain said he has received
about 150 calls to his office. About 65 callers had blown out
tires, but most of the people were not injured enough to justify an
expensive lawsuit, he said. Fountain has about a dozen tire-related
lawsuits against multiple companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has the exact same problem. It's just that poor
Firestone had the moons lined up against them,'' Fountain said
without a trace of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers say they're happy the industry will have to change
as a result of media and congressional pressure. They say NHTSA has
been lax in requesting documents.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope judges will protect fewer tire company documents
from scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the courts recognized how widespread the abuse
was,'' said Ocala lawyer Bruce Kaster.
</P>
<P>
   Kaster advertised in legal journals 13 years ago to find other
lawyers suing Uniroyal to show the company was misrepresenting the
number of pending tread-separation lawsuits it was defending,
according to a Wall Street Journal article.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's attorney general's office, in the midst of a Firestone
investigation launched in August, has also been unable to view key
documents. Its attorneys have been asking plaintiffs lawyers around
the state for records, only to learn court orders have sealed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in the dark and doesn't need to be in the dark,''
said Les Garringer, assistant deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Garringer said the office will be asking judges to open sealed
documents _ and limit viewing to the attorney general's
investigation if the information really merits protection as trade
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, lawyers may rely on Florida's ``Sunshine in
Litigation'' law, which forbids judges from sealing information
about public hazards. But business groups question the plaintiffs
lawyers' motives: ``They're basically lazy and they don't want to
do any work, so they want to just get all the file cabinets in
corporate headquarters,'' said Jon Shebel, president and CEO of
Associated Industries of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Shebel, whose group lobbies on behalf of business interests,
cites the example of the Coca-Cola formula as an essential trade
secret that plaintiffs' lawyers would undermine if they had the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the man who lost his wife in the 1992 van crash is
frustrated by Uniroyal's tactics. Sylvester Wright, who was driving
the van he borrowed from his pastor the night it crashed, doesn't
claim to know the law, but would like to see his case go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in what you believe, put the cards on the table
and let justice take its course,'' he said.

UNDATED: from now.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the energy crisis is at high water today, but while companies
struggle to adjust, the American consumer looks more like a
spectator than a player.
</P>
<P>
   When consumers have become involved, they have done so mainly at
the gas station, by buying regular rather than premium gasoline,
for example, or by driving a few extra blocks in search of cheaper
gas, particularly in California where it often tops $2, or by
vacationing closer to home, or by leaving the SUV in the garage and
driving the family's more fuel-efficient second car. That is what
Travis Wells, 32, a security guard in Chicago, did for a while over
the summer, when gasoline prices in the upper Midwest jumped
briefly above $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, I had to cut down on riding around altogether,''
said Wells. The reaction in Europe was much more demonstrative.
Protesters in Britain blocked fuel deliveries there, disrupting
commerce. Gasoline in Europe starts at more than $3 a gallon even
in the least expensive countries because of high fuel taxes. The
protesters sought tax relief to offset their extra outlays for fuel
itself, but got it only in France.
</P>
<P>
   If the American consumer seems blase, that is partly because the
impact of high energy prices on the robust American economy has
been relatively minor so far. But it is there, economists say.
Americans are spending an additional $115 billion, nearly 1 percent
of the gross domestic product, on energy this year, according to an
estimate by Larry Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   That is $115 billion diverted from other spending, although some
of that money is being recycled into the economy. Rising tax
revenue from the sale of oil pumped in Oklahoma, for example, has
helped to pay for a $3,000 across-the-board raise for the state's
teachers. More than half of the diverted $115 billion is going
abroad to pay for imported oil, shrinking spending at home and
gradually acting as a drag on the economy. The slowdown is becoming
evident in falling retail sales, weaker job growth, a decline in
industrial production, a drop in home construction permits and a
mild decline in freight traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are good structural reasons that this energy
crunch, as opposed to those in 1973, 1979 and 1990, seems unlikely
to bring on a recession _ even if energy prices stay high into next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the old impact is no longer there; energy plays a
smaller role in the economy. Americans have already made the shift
to more fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving appliances and
easier-to-heat buildings. Service companies and computer technology
play a bigger role in the economy, shrinking the role of oil and
natural gas. Consumers have learned a lot. In the Northeast, for
example, some homeowners and landlords, stung by sharply higher
heating oil prices last winter, have borrowed a tactic that is
common in business: They have negotiated caps on what they will pay
for heating oil this winter, using futures contracts bought by
their oil suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all these changes, the nation's spending on oil
has declined to just above 3 percent of the gross domestic product
this year, from 8.7 percent in the late 1970s, Goldstein estimated.
Moreover, many fuel prices, high as they are, are really not much
different than they were in the 1980's and early 1990s, adjusted
for inflation. Even among families with incomes of less than
$40,000 a year, energy spending, measured as a percentage of a
family's total spending, declined by two percentage points or more
from 1985 to 1998, the latest year for which data is available,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are the households, often living from paycheck to
paycheck, that are hit hardest by the rise in the overall inflation
rate after companies pass through some of their increases in energy
costs. That rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has
risen nearly a full percentage point over the last 12 months, to
3.4 percent, with nearly all of the increase attributed to higher
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   As inflation rises, workers find that their incomes buy less.
Policy makers at the Federal Reserve worry that these workers will
soon agitate successfully for higher wages. As wages rise, so will
prices, as companies seek to cover their higher labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   That was the pattern in the last three oil shocks, and the Fed's
response _ sooner or later raising interest rates to discourage the
wage pressure and the price increases _ helped each time to push
the economy into recession. This time, however, there has been
relatively little wage pressure from a more subdued work force with
less bargaining power. In the absence of wage acceleration, the Fed
seems willing to leave interest rates alone for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the wage pressure, it is pretty much a no-brainer for
the Fed to wait out the higher oil prices,'' said Ben Herzon, an
economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting and consulting
service in St. Louis. ``If you don't get the wage-price spiral,
then the inflation disappears when oil prices decline.'' (MORE)

UNDATED: prices decline.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the Fed waits, the nation's companies don't. The potential
damage to earnings is too painful.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially the case in trucking, and particularly for
the David Densbergers, whose single-truck operations are everywhere
in the industry. Only in the last three months, he said, has he
been able to add a 2 or 3 percent surcharge to his rates, a
surcharge that ``only one in five customers actually pays.'' Even
if all did so, he said, the extra income would not offset the rise
in diesel fuel. He paid $1.57 a gallon in Arkansas last week and
$1.71 in Wisconsin _ up from 90 cents to $1.10 before prices began
rising 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Densberger, who lives in Berwick, Pa., grosses enough to
continue to maintain a family income of $35,000 a year. To stay at
that level, he, like most other truckers, puts in the maximum 70
hours a week of driving time allowed by federal law. When he rests,
he turns off the engine and the air-conditioner, no matter the
outside temperature. He cuts other corners. His truck has a
refrigeration system that runs on diesel fuel, so he tries to carry
dry cargo on long hauls, like the canned tuna he took from New
Orleans to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But there is that new rig he wants, and he also has to be
concerned about emergencies. ``The $300 extra that I am spending on
diesel fuel,'' he said, ``is the profit that would go to buy new
tires, when I need them, or a new engine if the one I have blows
up. Engines cost $15,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger trucking companies, like C.R. England in Salt Lake City,
which operates 2,600 tractor-trailers, are also feeling squeezed by
higher fuel costs, but much less so than owner-operators like
Densberger. The surcharges they impose on their rates are higher
and stick better, and such companies buy huge amounts of fuel at a
discounted price, averaging $1.50 a gallon, said Dan England, the
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But workloads have risen for the nondriver staff, which has been
trimmed to 700 from 820 two years ago. During periods of peak
demand, like the current harvest season, the company is more
selective about whose business it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers that have not granted us our full surcharge, we
don't haul for them,'' England said, adding, ``Our profit margins
have eroded, but they would be eroded a lot more if we had not
taken the steps we have taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical has become similarly agile. The company buys
naptha, ethane and other petroleum and natural gas-based ``feed
stocks'' to make ethylene, which in turn is a chief building block
of plastics from which so many consumer products and parts are
made. With ethylene in abundant supply, raising its price is hard.
So a big goal for Dow is to pay as little as possible for the ever
more costly feed stocks. To do this, the company has installed new
processing equipment that allows it to switch feed stocks on a
dime, going to naptha, for example, if it is less costly than
ethane or something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly running computer models that show us,
literally on a daily basis, which raw materials are best to use,''
said William S. Stavropoulos, Dow's chief executive. He added:
``Our feed stock costs were up 60 percent in the second quarter,
and that dinged our bottom line by 50 cents a share. Without all of
these systems in place, we would have been dinged by half again as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   For Enron, based in Houston, an energy crisis offers
opportunity, particularly when prices are volatile, as they have
been so far in this squeeze. Enron owns a natural gas pipeline and
makes money in that business, but it also does well helping other
companies manage risks. One client, the United Illuminating Co. in
Hartford, sold off its electricity generating plants under
deregulation. Still, it is required for the next five years to
charge customers only 5.5 cents a kilowatt hour, about what a
100-watt bulb consumes in 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided that they did not want to take the risk of being
forced to buy electricity for more than 5.5 cents,'' said Mark
Palmer, a spokesman for Enron. ``So we agreed to deliver the
electricity for less than that amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Enron does this by juggling a whole bunch of similar clients. On
any given day, the electricity delivered to Hartford might cost too
much, say 10 cents a kilowatt hour. But there is an offsetting
profit elsewhere, say in the delivery of natural gas to a
generating plant in Michigan. On balance, there has been enough
profit from risk management in this energy crisis to contribute
significantly to Enron's growing revenue and profits, Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity has been a sideshow of this energy shock. Most
electricity rates have remained fairly steady. But the combination
of deregulation and not enough generating power has resulted in
spot shortages and price spikes, particularly in the West. In this
situation, the Ormet Primary Aluminum Corp. found that it could
make more money by selling some of the electricity that it had
bought to make aluminum, rather than make the aluminum itself.
</P>
<P>
   Using futures contracts, Ormet had bought the electricity at a
discount and has sold some at a profit while shutting down some
aluminum production at a smelter in Hannibal, Ohio. Aluminum
production in the United States has dropped sharply in recent
months, and prices have risen. Ormet's experience helps to explain
why this is happening, said John Mothersole, an analyst at Standard
&AMP; Poor's DRI, a data gathering and consulting service.
</P>
<P>
   The one great gift of an energy crisis should be the stimulus it
provides for exploration and new drilling, to increase the
production of oil and natural gas and thus take advantage of the
higher prices. The growing supply then moderates prices. But
exploration and drilling have picked up only recently in the United
States, reflecting concern that new production will come on line
just as prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy with respect to capital spending is `constancy
of purpose,''' said David O'Reilly, the chairman of Chevron, adding
that ``oil and gas prices go up and down, but it's
counterproductive to overreact to prices that are either atypically
low or high.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Charles Goodson, chairman of PetroQuest Energy, in
Lafayette, La., is not throwing his hat in the air. His is one of
the many small companies that account for most of the actual oil
drilling and new production in the United States. Goodson said
PetroQuest was just getting back on its feet after the blow it
suffered in 1998, when crude oil prices fell to as low as $10 a
barrel, and his employees _ 25 then, 40 today _ all took pay cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been consistently drilling wells through the ups and
downs of this,'' Goodson said. ``You've got to weigh the prices we
are getting now with the prices we were getting a year and two
years ago. So when you average those things out, they don't look
nearly so rosy.''

   Clinton Orders Oil Released From Emergency Reserve
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the release of 30 million barrels of
oil from the nation's emergency reserve over the next month, only a
day after Vice President Al Gore injected the issue into the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The move could stall or even reverse the surge in home heating
oil and gasoline prices. But analysts said that there were no
guarantees that consumers would benefit and that the decision did
nothing to address the underlying issue of how to bring energy
supply into line with demand over the long run. Administration
officials said they acted primarily because inventories of heating
oil on the East Coast had fallen to worrisomely low levels, raising
the risk of shortages should the winter be particularly cold or
long.

U.S. AGENCY SAYS ALLSTATE ILLEGALLY COERCED AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined this week
that when the Allstate Insurance Co. forced more than 6,000 agents
to sign away their rights to sue the company in order to keep their
jobs, it violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Allstate said that it would convert its employee
sales force _ most of whom are over the age of 45 _ into
independent contractors. The move stripped the agents of their
employee benefits, but the company promised them higher commissions
to help cover the cost of doing business on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The agents could have rejected the offer and opted instead to
leave Allstate with an enhanced severance package. But either way,
they were required to sign a waiver in which they pledged not to
sue the company.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated by the waiver, which they viewed as the linchpin in
the company's strategy to shed its older workers, roughly 70 agents
filed complaints this spring with the EEOC, saying they were
victims of age discrimination. After a six-month investigation, the
commission ruled in favor of the agents, concluding that Allstate
had coerced and intimidated them into surrendering their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate officials characterized the waiver as ``a common and
prudent business practice'' and said the company had no immediate
plans to change it. But while EEOC officials acknowledge that
waivers are a common way of warding off litigation in the
workplace, they say waivers rarely require employees to give up
their rights to sue a company merely to hold onto their jobs, a
violation of federal law. The commission investigators also said
they viewed the Allstate case as particularly troubling because so
many agents were affected, considerably more than in many of the
cases it takes on.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's finding is a potential stumbling block for
Allstate's efforts to re-create itself. In the past year or so, the
company has begun a major overhaul, hoping to sell its policies
from call centers around the country and over the Internet, where
traditional agents are considered almost obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also eager to sell more insurance through what
are referred to as independent agents, who work for themselves and
sell the policies of 10 or more insurance companies at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, independent agents have become an increasingly
important part of the industry, responsible for roughly 40 percent
of all insurance sold. But Allstate has had little success getting
them to sell its policies, in no small part because of the
company's own sales force. Part of Allstate's profits go into
paying modest stipends to help its employees cover the many
expenses that come with selling insurance. Not surprisingly, the
independent agents, who are also scrambling for customers, have
little interest in supporting their competition.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate wanted to convert employees into independent
contractors because employees have become considerably more
expensive. For years, the agents have spent their own money to stay
competitive, often without being reimbursed. But in a July
settlement with agents in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota,
Allstate agreed to pay more than $2 million to reimburse a handful
of its employees for the money they had spent for office rent,
secretaries and advertising. Agents around the country are looking
into bringing a national lawsuit, which could cost the company much
more.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver, which has already been signed by thousands of
agents, could protect Allstate from such claims. And until a court
determines that it is unlawful, the company is under no obligation
to retract or alter the waiver. Allstate has indicated that it will
cooperate in discussions with the EEOC, a necessary precursor to
litigation, but is confident that the document, drawn up by its
in-house legal team of more than 700 lawyers, will stand up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials, however, say they have a 90 percent
success rate once they decide to take on an issue, and they suggest
that they would take this case to a judge if necessary.

INTERVENTION CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With EURO-INTERVENE) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the central banks of the world's leading industrial nations
intervene in the currency market, there are winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   The currency traders who are betting that the euro will continue
to decline lost on Friday. But if they have been making this bet
for a while, they are still way ahead _ the euro is still down 13.7
percent in value against the dollar so far this year. And if they
think the euro will rally, they can just change their bet and make
more money.
</P>
<P>
   A recovery in the euro would help U.S. exporters. The weak euro
has made their products more expensive in Europe, hurting sales.
And for companies that have big markets in Europe, their sales and
earnings in euros have been reduced when they are exchanged for
stronger dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a number of big multinationals _ including Gillette,
DuPont, Colgate-Palmolive and McDonald's _ have recently warned
that the weak euro will reduce their third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies competing against European imports in the United
States would also like a stronger euro and a weaker dollar. A weak
euro makes European products, like cars, cheaper, hurting domestic
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But American travelers to Europe will have reason to be unhappy
with a rally in the euro, if it happens. Travelers to some parts of
Europe, like France, have not seen such bargains when it comes to
exchange rates since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it is American tourists or multinationals that
benefit from Friday's action depends on whether the intervention
works as planned.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, successful intervention would mean that the euro
would begin to climb in value. But achieving that success may take
more coordinated interventions and a clear sign that Europe is
growing at a faster economic clip while the United States is
slowing significantly. That would make Europe more attractive to
global investors, meaning that they would buy more euros to invest
there. But that trend has not taken hold yet.

 &HT;    Political risk high for both Gore, Bush
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH and R.G. RATCLIFFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANPORT, Pa. _ Here in western Pennsylvania, the advent of fall
marks the annual rite of stockpiling home heating oil for the
cooler days and nights ahead.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that when Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore visited this depressed steel town Friday, he
tackled a pocketbook issue that was on the minds of a number of
local residents. The price of home heating oil in this region of
the state has risen to more than $1.30 a gallon, up from $1 last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with a friendly crowd at a union hall, Gore reiterated
his support for a number of measures to deal with high oil prices,
including loaning refineries millions of barrels of oil from the
federal Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, the Clinton administration announced it was moving
ahead with a variation of Gore's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of the home heating season with short
stocks and rising prices. It is not fair to middle-class families
to stand by and do nothing,'' Gore told reporters after the union
hall event.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of gasoline prices clearly poses the latest
political danger for both presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All they have to do is look abroad and see the pounding British
Prime Minister Tony Blair has taken recently as his countrymen
mounted massive protests against rising prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are aware of the fact that they are vulnerable and
are mostly concerned about inoculation. They are afraid of being
burnt by it,'' said Bruce Buchanan, professor of political science
at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not entirely clear whether Gore or his Republican
opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, would be harmed most by public
anger over gasoline prices. The conventional wisdom is that voters
will hold the incumbent administration, of which Gore is a part,
responsible for economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately if people decide there is a problem and someone
needs to take the fall it will be the administration, not the
governor,'' said Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a lingering recession helped Bill Clinton ride to
victory over President Bush, who appeared slow to recognize how
pocketbook issues were affecting voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, both the younger Bush and his running mate,
Dick Cheney, have had extensive ties to the oil industry, which the
public might blame if oil prices continue to go up.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was involved in oil ventures earlier in his career. Cheney
left his job as head of Haliburton, the giant, Texas-based
oil-field services company, after he was tapped as Bush's running
mate
</P>
<P>
   Bush's friend and campaign chairman, Don Evans, is still in the
industry. Evans is chairman and CEO of Tom Brown Inc., a
Midland-based energy company that is moving to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
Tom Brown's revenues grew by $42.9 million, or 112 percent, in the
six months ending June 30. Almost $26 million of that increased
revenue resulted from rising oil and gas prices, the company
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp never misses a chance to point out the
Republicans' ties to the energy industry, frequently calling them
``the Big Oil ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   optional trim
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at the union hall Gore alluded to his GOP
opponents when he promised that he would ``stand up to the
apologists for big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   During the discussion, one local resident, as if on cue, further
spelled out Gore's message about his opponent's attitude on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course Governor Bush being a big oilman is not going to do
anything about it,'' said Ramona Wachter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' responded Gore.
</P>
<P>
   end optional trim
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fired back that his experience in the oil industry
would help him deal with energy crises and negotiations with oil
producing nations. He has blamed Clinton and Gore for not pursuing
a coherent energy policy over the years that could have prevented
the latest price jump.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also opposes the administration plan to tap the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, arguing it should be used for national
emergencies and not to stabilize prices. And he accused Gore of
flip-flopping on the question.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president opposed dipping into the reserves last
winter, but he endorsed the move Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right then (last winter), but now we're getting close
to the election, now we're getting close to the time when we find
out who is steady, whose got a vision, who doesn't listen to polls
and focus groups,'' Bush said as he campaigned Friday in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended the reversal, saying that the situation has
changed as prices have gone up and oil producing countries have not
lived up to their pledges to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected Bush's contention that the oil reserve was not meant
to be used to stabilize prices. ``The purposes that justify release
are many and varied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advocated diplomacy to get the Middle Eastern members of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase
production. He said they should be reminded of the United States'
role in driving Iraq out of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied Bush's claim that the Clinton White House has no
energy policy. He blamed the Republican Congress for blocking
administration initiatives to encourage energy conservation and
domestic exploration.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, echoed that
sentiment in a White House news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we can do in the short term that are being
considered,'' he said. ``But there is a comprehensive plan for
dealing with long-term energy issues that the Republican-controlled
Congress has blocked over the last several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The competing positions on oil present voters with a clear
distinction between the two presidential tickets _ if the issue
becomes an electoral flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Voters aren't yet registering much outrage over rising energy
prices, said Andy Kohut, who directs polling for the Pew Center for
the People and the Press. He noted that consumer confidence remains
high.
</P>
<P>
   In surveys taken during the last gasoline spike in the spring,
Pew said, respondents had mixed assessments of whether Bush or Gore
would do a better job handling an oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While last spring's price surge appeared to have negligible
political impact, the current one may be more damaging because it
comes at a time when consumers are stockpiling home heating fuel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Friday ordered the release of 30
million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserve over the
next month, only a day after Vice President Al Gore injected the
issue into the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement helped drive crude oil prices down, and
analysts said the move could be effective in the short run in
checking or even reversing the surge in home heating oil and
gasoline prices in the run-up to election day. But they said there
were no guarantees that consumers would benefit, and that the
decision did nothing to address the underlying issue of how to
bring energy supply into line with demand over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they acted primarily because
inventories of heating oil on the east coast had fallen to
worrisomely low levels, raising the risk of shortages should the
winter be particularly cold or long.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his decision after a sharp debate within the
administration over whether releasing oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve was justified, and after talking by phone on
Tuesday with Gore, who told the president then that he intended to
call for use of the reserve to stabilize oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did that on Thursday, but recommended starting with the
release of a smaller amount, 5 million barrels, with the
possibility of releasing more. Clinton committed himself to a
substantially larger 30 million barrel release.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision played neatly into Gore's campaign strategy
of portraying himself as fighting for the people against powerful
interests like big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   It also allowed the vice president to dominate the news again on
an issue of his choosing, forcing his opponent, Gov. George W.
Bush, into an argument about who could do more to help consumers.
And it was clearly intended by Gore to minimize the chances that
voters could be put in a sour mood around election day by high
prices for gas or heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bush said the stockpile was created as a
backstop for times when the supply of oil has been seriously
disrupted, such as during a war. And he pointed out that as
recently as last winter, Gore had opposed use of the reserve just
to deal with rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the vice president has made this decision, with the
support of the president, for short term political gain,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania a few hours before the
administration announced its decision, Gore said it was time to
stand up to what he called ``big oil'' and its apologists, of whom
he implied Bush was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices are skyrocketing,'' Gore said. ``It's hurting
small business. It's hurting those on fixed incomes. It's hurting
young families. And the prospect for even higher prices ahead is
going to cause even more trouble unless we act now.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had been considering the
issue for weeks, but came to a consensus on how to proceed only
during a late-night conference call among the president's senior
advisers on Thursday, a few hours after Gore gave a speech in which
he laid out the case for drawing on the nation's oil reserves.
Clinton then signed off on the strategy Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision was announced by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson,
who said the government would begin taking bids starting on Monday,
with the expectation of releasing 30 million barrels over 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said they expected the oil to begin
reaching buyers in Gulf Coast terminals by Nov. 1, and said the oil
would go from there to refineries around the country over the
following several weeks. The crude oil could be refined and on the
market as heating oil by early December.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than selling the oil outright, the government intends to
enter into deals with refiners under which the companies will agree
to replace the oil it is taking, and then some, at a later date. In
that way, Richardson said, the program would add to the nation's
oil reserves rather than deplete them.
</P>

   The United States uses about 19 million barrels of oil a day, 10
million of them imported, according to the energy department. The 1
million barrels a day from the reserve, plus a modest increase in
production promised several weeks ago by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries means that crude oil supplies in the
United States should rise enough to lower prices of both crude oil
and refined products in the short term, said Angela Antonelli,
director for economic policy at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil for November delivery fell by $1.32 cents
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, closing at
$32.68. Heating oil for delivery in October fell by 4.41 cents a
gallon, to 95.48 cents. On Thursday, after Gore called for release
of the reserves, prices dropped $1.24 a barrel for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials acknowledged that there had been a split
within the administration over how to proceed, with Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers arguing against a big release of oil,
and Richardson leading the charge in favor.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the differences narrowed in recent days as it
became clear that stocks of home heating oil were extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, inventories of heating oil stood this week at 48.1
million barrels, down from 72.4 million barrels a year ago,
according to the energy department. On the East Coast, inventories
were at 24.4 million barrels, down from 48.5 million a year ago,
and in New England they stood at 4.6 million barrels, down from 14
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the 30 million barrels of crude oil could put an
additional 3 million to 5 million barrels of heating oil on the
market. Because crude oil is refined into a number of products,
supplies of gasoline and diesel are also likely to increase, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portland, Maine, will be in the 50s next week, so will
Minneapolis, and it snowed in the Rockies yesterday,'' Richardson
said at a news conference. ``We need to make sure the American
families keep warm this winter and get their heating oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that after 30 days the administration would
evaluate whether the program was working and whether to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that they had briefed OPEC members
on the possibility of tapping the reserve, and that they were
hopeful the organization would view the decision as a response to
domestic concerns about the supply of heating fuel rather than as a
challenge to OPEC's efforts to keep prices at a profitable level.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of heating oil inventories was driven in part by
expectations among refiners that crude oil prices would decline in
coming months, leading them to wait rather than build their
inventories with expensive oil now, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   If crude oil prices fall and stay down, refiners could prove
more willing to increase their inventories, which could help lower
heating oil prices. But refineries are already running close to
capacity, limiting how much more heating oil they can produce. And
crude oil prices are notoriously sensitive to other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, Iraq has also talked belligerently,
accusing Kuwait of stealing its oil and intimating that it would
reduce or cut its oil exports to pressure Kuwait's allies,
particularly the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq exports about 2.3 million barrels a day, or about 4 percent
of the world's daily consumption, and any reductions on its part
would destabilize a world market where supplies of oil are tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put a finger on the outright price and where it's
going to stop,'' said one New York oil trader. ``What will Iraq do
or not do, will Saudi production hold; we'll have to see what new
information is introduced into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the move, especially in the Northeast, said it
would be a substantial help in ensuring that consumers get through
the winter without facing crippling heating bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that this is great news for the Northeast
and the American economy,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic reserve was established in 1975, after the Arab
oil embargo. It contains about 570 million barrels of oil, which is
stored in salt domes along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was first used during in 1991, when President George Bush
ordered that as much as 30 million barrels be released during the
war against Iraq. In the end, only about 17 million barrels were
actually sold.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then sold smaller amounts in 1996 as part of an effort
to raise money to balance the budget. Small amounts have also been
sold to pay some of the reserve's costs.

TIME TO GO OUT AND GET A WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's hard to believe, but in the six weeks since
USC opened training camp, the Trojans have played exactly two
games. This team has practiced so much, it should be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But as the ninth-ranked Trojans host San Jose State today at the
Coliseum at 3:30 p.m., they are still searching for their identity,
thanks to their quirky schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five or six games, we'll know what kind of team we
are,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``Right now, we're still not
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are fresh. Yes, we are injury-free. But where is the
momentum? Can we gain the momentum?''
</P>
<P>
   Things don't figure to get a whole lot clearer after USC (2-0)
plays the Spartans (1-2), who like to spread out the field with
four wide receivers and then let diminutive 5-foot-6 tailback
Deonce Whitaker squirt through the line when defenses are set up
for a pass.
</P>
<P>
   This is considered a final tuneup before USC opens Pacific-10
Conference play next week against Oregon State, but the Trojans
aren't sure how to treat this game. That's the dilemma of being
ninth in the nation and wondering how good you really are?
</P>
<P>
   If USC wins big today, it's expected. If the Trojans struggle,
they might face plenty of internal and external questions right
before their Pac-10 opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 10 games left and six at home. Let's see how good we
really are,'' Hackett said. ``Every game counts. Every game is
important. We're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, USC probably needs to pile up a lot of points and
beat the Spartans big or they will lose face nationally. San Jose
State beat Stanford two weeks ago and played Nebraska tough before
wearing down, but it hardly impresses poll voters in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett, weary of the gutty little Spartans, wants to hear
no talk about how much better the Trojans are than San Jose State,
even if they are 23-point favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements are for you guys to go out and make,'' he told
reporters this week. ``We need to go out and get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   His sermon on not taking the Spartans lightly has filtered down
to the players, who are just thankful to be playing a game after
two weeks of living off the victory over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obviously a team we have to worry about,'' quarterback
Carson Palmer said. ``They beat Stanford. And Stanford beat
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   If USC wants to handle San Jose State, it needs to stop
Whitaker. Because he is small, the Trojans will try to tackle him
high, to avoid being left grabbing dust if they go for his speedy
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll win the low battle, so we'll have to come high,'' free
safety Ife Ohalete said. ``The old-school style of tackling.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Colorado's Marcus Houston gained 150 yards on the Trojans,
this is a nice test, to see if the vaunted run defense is as good
as originally hyped. Whitaker is the third-leading rusher in the
nation (182.7 yards per game), so something will have to give
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Colorado ran on us, we missed a lot of tackles,''
Ohalete said. ``This does give us a chance to prove ourselves
again.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush returns to Florida to counter Gore's gains
 &HT;    Republican has his eye on state's electoral votes
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By R.G. RATCLIFFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Returning to a state he hoped to have locked up
by now, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush touted
medical research initiatives and took straight aim at claims that
his campaign is faltering in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read something quite amusing the other day, this wishful
thinking on behalf of our opponents. They said they think they can
carry Florida,'' Bush told a crowd of about 500 at the Sarasota
airport. ``They don't understand what's about to hit them in
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is a cornerstone of the Electoral College structure
Bush hopes will lift him to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He once held a solid lead in the Sunshine State, where his
brother, Jeb, is governor. But his Democratic rival, Vice President
Al Gore, has barnstormed the state pushing his promise to make
prescription drugs affordable for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush suddenly has found himself in a dead heat for Florida's
25 electoral votes, according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has since come out with his own proposal for making
prescription drugs affordable through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush renewed his promise Friday to double funding for the
National Institutes of Health and increase the budget of the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have each been to Florida three times since the
national party conventions, and Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., also campaigned there Friday. Gore planned to
return on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor may yet carry Florida, but the fact he is
having to fight for it is damaging to his national strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the broader picture of a race with problems for
Bush,'' said Southern Methodist University political scientist Cal
Jillson. ``The momentum in the key swing states of Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin is in Gore's direction. You include
Florida being in play and it's serious for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   University of South Florida political scientist Susan MacManus
said there should not be too much surprise that Florida came into
play once Gore decided to contest it. She said the state has become
increasingly competitive during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, former President Bush, carried the state in 1992,
though he lost the presidency. President Clinton carried it in his
1996 re-election. Jeb Bush lost a governor's race in 1994 before
winning in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way back when, Jeb said this is a tough state,'' MacManus
said. ``When you put pen to paper, it still looks like Bush might
eke it out.''
</P>
<P>
   MacManus said Gore has caught up with Bush in Florida with a
series of television commercials that are better than Bush's and
more issue-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Florida visit Friday also underscored what has been a key
element of his campaign during the past month _ he has been working
his Republican base vote as much as reaching out to women and swing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign at the last minute Friday put together a Tampa
rally to coincide with a $2 million fund-raiser he was having in
the city.

ELDER BUSH BREAKS A STRATEGIC SILENCE AND DEFENDS HIS SON 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Former President George Bush may have a mannerly
reputation, but shortly after the Republican National Convention
opened in Philadelphia, he was burning to mix it up with President
Clinton for saying not-so-nice things about his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tempted to get off the reservation,'' Bush told NBC News
in late July. If Clinton is still denouncing his son after a month,
he said of the man who vanquished him, ``I'm going to tell the
nation what I think about him as a human being and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly two months after he uttered those words, Bush kept
a decidedly low profile and seemed to stay squarely on the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday. Unable to resist the temptation, Bush verged as
close as he has ever been to endorsing the House vote to impeach
Clinton. At a fund-raising luncheon in Miami for Rep. Bill
McCollum, who is running for the Senate, Bush made what McCollum's
aides said was an unmistakable reference to the lawmaker's vote to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the issue business any more,'' Bush said. ``But I'm
in the character business. And I know a man of character when I see
one. I saw him take a lot of heat a few months ago in the House,
held his head up high, and did what he felt was right. And whether
you agree or not _ and I 100 percent agree _ I think people
respect'' his decision.
</P>
<P>
   During the impeachment proceedings, Bush studiously avoided any
comment on his position. While Bush made no direct mention of
Clinton or Vice President Al Gore on Friday, the former president
peppered his speech with references to honor, integrity and
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely convinced that if our son is elected president
of the United States,'' Bush declared, ``we will restore the
respect, honor and decency that the White House deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Bush slipped out of the hotel ballroom briskly
and quietly, determined not to say anything that would thrust
himself back in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Bush family said the former president has
taken pains since the Republican convention to keep a low profile _
and do nothing to distract from his son's campaign. They said he
seems to regret his comments about Clinton. (Clinton, while not shy
about castigating his predecessor's administration, has refrained
from inflammatory language that could provoke Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all his caution, the former president cannot always
resist expressing his strong feelings about what he believes has
been a breach of trust in the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Bush campaign might be best advised against making
Clinton's personal lapses a big issue. Polls have shown that
slicing into the president's values _ while helpful in rallying
partisans _ does not carry weight among swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas as well, some Bush advisers say the Texas
governor might be most prudent if he steers clear of his father's
advice. Though the precise extent of his father's role is unclear,
campaign advisers say Gov. Bush turned to his father for counsel on
two crucial decisions that have drawn decidedly mixed reviews: the
selection of Dick Cheney as the running mate and the initial
reluctance by the campaign to negotiate with sponsors other than
the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Bush family said the former president never
liked debates and never trusted the commission. In an interview
with PBS to be broadcast on Sunday on a documentary about debates,
the former president acknowledged his distaste for debates, which
he derided as ``show business.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why he checked his watch during his last encounter in
1992 with Clinton and Ross Perot, Bush said, ``Was I glad when the
damn thing was over? Yeah. And maybe that's why I was looking at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush flashed a glimpse of his family's competitive
spirit by letting it be known that he relishes the notion of his
son toppling politicians who think they have the upper hand. He
recalled that in the 1994 campaign, then Gov. Ann Richards of Texas
derisively mocked Bush as ``Shrub.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Shrub _ Little Shrub is taking me on,'' the former
president quoted Richards as saying. His son won, he said,
``because his word is good _ he'll say something and he means it
and it comes from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., scoffed at the idea that the Bushes
were motivated, at all, by a desire to get back at the Democrats
for ousting President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Bush is not that kind of man, and neither is his
son,'' he said. ``That father wouldn't allow that. He's has
opportunities for the past eight years to say things about Bill
Clinton and Al Gore and he's refrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked, then, about the elder Bush's nearly verging off the
reservation at the convention, Mack replied: ``That was a little
different situation. And it was very short lived.''

 &HT;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANPORT, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore sought Friday to downplay
his reputed debating skills and argued instead that he is
``even-steven'' with his Republican presidential opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush, going into the three scheduled presidential
face-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding reporters' questions during his first news conference
in two months, Gore tried to lower expectations that he will
outperform his Republican opponent in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is really a very good debater and won all the debates he
has been in,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bush's first gubernatorial debate in Texas, he
said, ``Going up against Ann Richards, he was supposed to be
slaughtered in that. She's certainly a better debater than I am.
She's just a very quick wit and a sharp tongue and hard to whip,
and he beat her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush also defied expectations during the presidential
primary debates, where he faced a strong challenge from U.S. Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the chips were down in the Republican nomination all the
people thought that John McCain, he's the best debater there is _
he gets out there and can sell igloos to Eskimos. Then they went
into the debates several times and Bush beat him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to mention Garry Mauro,'' he said, referring to Bush's
1996 gubernatorial opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that going into the debates ``there ought to be a
fresh slate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has downplayed his debating skills and spoken of
Gore's formidable talents in advance of the first debate, which is
scheduled for Oct. 3 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   During his half-hour news conference, Gore spoke about a wide
range of issues, including high oil prices, his relationship with
Hollywood and charges that he has a tendency to embellish the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about criticism that he told the Teamsters last week that
he was lulled to sleep as a baby by a union song that wasn't even
written until he was an adult, Gore responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``I told a joke that I have told to a number of union audiences.
They laughed just like audiences always laugh. If someone didn't
get the joke maybe I better tell better jokes. Nobody sings a
lullaby to a little baby about a union label.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also referred briefly to accusations that he didn't use
accurate figures when he said his mother-in-law paid three times
more for her arthritis drugs than the family paid for the same
medicine for their dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about my mother-in-law anymore. Maybe my
dog,'' he said. &QL;

THE WAY IN SAN JOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Baldwin arrived at San Jose State four years
ago fresh from turning the Cal State Northridge football program
from 2-8 to 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin has found it more difficult to duplicate that success.
Now, his job depends on winning. But how do you win when you travel
all across the country playing the likes of Nebraska, LSU,
Virginia, Colorado, Oregon and USC?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the money's good, about $1 million in so-called ``body-bag
games.'' Yet there's a reason these games have that name: The
lesser teams often lose key players to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin finds himself in perhaps a no-win situation. He is in
the final year of his contract with a record of 13-23 heading into
today's game with USC at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Before Baldwin, the Spartans were without a winning season since
1992. San Jose State administrators are running out of patience.
They hired Baldwin to rebuild. Time's up. They want to see results.
Publicly, Baldwin won't comment, except to say, ``It's a fun
situation. It's fun. Let's put it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, sources say, he's gone, either because he will have a
losing season and San Jose doesn't renew his contract, or he wins
and he goes elsewhere. For now, though, he looks forward, trying to
keep the focus on on-the-field matters, eager to post a winning
record and compete in the Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to quit or fight, and Dave's a fighter,'' said Ron
Ponciano, who worked with Baldwin at CSUN. ``San Jose's not an easy
place. You recruit against other great schools, and when you look
at housing costs, maybe it's better elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin admits the turnaround at a Division I school takes
longer than at at Division I-AA school such as Northridge. Division
I schools can't take ``bounce-backs,'' players who return from a
Division I school to a lower-level program.
</P>
<P>
   He blames the struggles partly on the injuries that come from
being somebody's whipping boy. Last year, the Spartans were 3-2 to
start the year, and that included a close loss at LSU, a big loss
at Colorado and a big win at Stanford, but the injuries mounted _
11 starters went down in two weeks _ and the team fell apart,
losing its last five games.
</P>
<P>
   That put Baldwin under pressure to perform this season. But
beginning at No. 1 Nebraska guarantees a big payout, not a win.
</P>
<P>
   A third straight victory over Stanford and a home win over
Southern Utah have followed. This also is the first time under
Baldwin the Spartans have as many as five home games. Baldwin said
the Oct. 14 game against Texas-El Paso will be the first time the
seniors have faced the Miners at home.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Spartans avoid a repeat of last season's collapse?
Obviously, Baldwin hopes to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to establish a family,'' he said. ``The people
trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But does the administration trust him?

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Woodstock was once the Valhalla for
aspiring hippies everywhere _ a name that invoked the ideals of a
generation of make-love-not-war activists, but for today's
dreadlocked wannabes, there cannot be much doubt that place is
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our Seattle,'' says Desko Vladic, a 23-year-old German
blacksmith who traveled to Prague by bus carrying comb, toothbrush,
fork and knife in his baggy painter pants. ``Seattle was the most
amazing thing I have ever seen _ people uniting to shut down a
global institution.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was a little skewed. The Geneva-based World Trade
Organization picked Seattle for a global trade summit meeting late
last year, only to see it collapse with unruly protests outside the
conference hall and discord among trade ministers inside.
</P>
<P>
   So, Seattle looms as a beacon _ and challenge _ as perhaps
20,000 European and American protesters converge on the
cobble-stoned streets of Prague, the Czech Republic's capital, for
a series of demonstrations scheduled to start this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the target of those protesting globalization has shifted.
Instead of the World Trade Organization, they are now stalking the
meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the
lending agencies made up of national governments from around the
world to spur regional economic development blunt economic
depressions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the goal of the protesters is the same: Grab a share of
the media spotlight to fight the international agencies the
protesters perceive as the advance guard of corporate
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that Europeans have had a chance to
bring all these issues together in one unified movement, like the
Americans did,'' said Rachel Hudson, a 23-year-old from Liverpool,
as she wrapped twine around bamboo poles to make a garage-sized
globe for the march by protesters planned for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people to open their eyes and understand how all
the overconsumption in the West exploits the poor,'' she said.
``And if we can stop these delegates from doing more harm, that'd
be brilliant, wouldn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Prague has mostly welcomed the protesters. Vaclav Havel, the
former dissident who is now the Czech Republic's president, has
invited pressure groups to join him and leaders of the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund for a pubic debate at the Prague
Castle on Saturday. The city also opened Strahov Stadium, a gray
and decrepit monument of Prague's Communist past, as a campground
for visiting demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   But Prague has just begun to taste the fruits of globalization _
a few sparkling McDonald's and Tesco department stores are the most
visible symbols around the Baroque architecture of Old Square _ and
most Prague politicians and policemen do not share the desire to
see a repeat of the demonstration in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Police have summoned reinforcements from around the Czech
Republic. They are promising to turn out 11,000 officers in their
blue and gray uniforms, armed with pistols, attack dogs and water
cannons. Large areas of the city are being closed to traffic;
shopkeepers have closed early for a long weekend, boarding up their
shop windows.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that it might be difficult to shut down the
Congress Center, where World Bank and International Monetary Fund
officials have already begun their week-long session, the umbrella
group organizing the protests, called the Initiative Against
Economic Globalization, has tried to turn the event into a
celebration of the movement's many intellectual pillars.
</P>
<P>
   Said Amin, an Egyptian neo-Marxist, is scheduled to lecture an
audience on how the lending agencies act as colonialists once did.
Leonida Zurida Vargas, a Bolivian peasant activist, came to Prague
to call attention to the forced eradication of coca plantations she
says has displaced thousands of indigenous farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers, many of them Americans who were involved in
the Seattle demonstrations, said the diversity of participants in
the demonstrations here is a strength. But the volume of groups and
complaints belies any common theme.
</P>
<P>
   The boldest headlines from the Prague clash could come courtesy
of a promised confrontation between neo-Nazi skinheads and
anarchists. The two groups, the left and right extremes of the
European youth underground, say they have gathered in Prague to
fight the lending agencies, but they seem more excited about
fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
   They plan rival marches in Letna Square on Saturday, neither of
which has been authorized by the police. Both sides say they will
reluctantly bash heads to get their message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't personally like violence, but there is just one way to
stop the skinheads,'' said Jan Kensky, 22, a Prague anarchist and
warehouse worker. ``When we chase the Nazis out of Prague, maybe
the World Bank can leave, too.''

 &HT;    How can you get experience when you can't get your foot in the
door?
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Duane Chattam thought he made all the right moves.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on leaving behind his job as a paint prepper to move into
a career in information technology, the 29-year-old enrolled in
Coosa Valley Technical College. He took night classes, studying to
become a software specialist. When he finished his classes, he
began looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1 1/2 years ago. Chattam still hasn't found a position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting to land a job,'' Chattam admits. ``I mean, I'm
not going to say without any problem, but I figured something would
have come along before now.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Chattam says he hears it over and over again: ``We need someone
with experience,'' potential employers are telling him. ``How are
you supposed to get the experience if no one wants to hire you for
lack of experience?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Chattam's problem is an age-old Catch-22 that often confronts
recent graduates and career changers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, everybody faces this,'' says Thomas A. Freese,
a career adviser and author of ``Secrets of Question-based
Selling.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important steps in landing that first job is to
manage your expectations, says Doug Griest, one of the founders of
Management Psychology Group in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have their sights set on a particular job and
they're getting the roadblocks because they don't have experience
in that particular job,'' Griest says. ``I think one thing you have
to do is lower your expectations a little bit and take a job that
may not be your ideal, but one that maybe you can gain that
experience under your belt and maybe a year or two later move to
the job you want.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't count yourself out unnecessarily, either, Freese says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who interview don't have the exact experience for
the job they're interviewing for. Most people who get hired don't
have the exact experience for the job they're hired for,'' Freese
contends. ``Inexperienced people are hired all the time. The
challenge is, how does a candidate cause an interviewer to believe
that they are capable of accomplishing the objectives of the job,
given they don't have the exact experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As you approach the job market, your objective should be to
figure out what skills and aptitudes are necessary for success in
the position you desire and then compare them to your own skill set
and experience, counsels Gayle Oliver, author of ``Execume: It's
More Than A Resume, It's a Reflection Of You.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver suggests a series of questions to ask yourself as you
prepare for the job you want: ``What does it take to be
successful?'' ``What are the skills that support that?'' ``What are
the behaviors that I've been doing in the past and what skills are
associated with that?'' she offers.
</P>
<P>
   You may find that you've got more marketable experience that
applies to the position you want than you first realized, Oliver
says. ``There are all sorts of skill sets that you demonstrated
throughout your life. It doesn't have to be on a job. It could be
volunteer work, college activities, hobbies,'' says Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding your capabilities is a crucial element in selling
yourself to future employers and beginning to fill the experience
void.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem at this level is people don't know their skill set
and what the (employer's) need is,'' Oliver says. ``Stop and think
about all the things you do, even if it's not job-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've found ``hidden'' experience in your background, be
sure to highlight it in your resume, Oliver says. The best way to
do this is by using a ``functional resume'' style, one that
downplays your job history but emphasizes the functions you
performed. With this type of resume, play up your skill set and
previously demonstrated abilities not only in a job setting, but in
other activities, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull out what's buried under the job description,'' Oliver
says. For instance, ``instead of saying you were president of the
fraternity, you `presided at meetings, rallied support for the
organization and demonstrated good communication skills,' '' Oliver
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Use the interview with potential employers to further sell
yourself and your willingness to get the work done, Freese says.
``If you communicate `I have no idea what to do in this job,' then
unless it's making hamburgers at the McDonald's, your chance of
getting it is very slim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you communicate the opposite, `I know what it takes to be
successful in this job, though I have limited experience,' your
chances go up. You can make up for the lack of experience with a
demonstration of willingness, capability and effort,'' Freese says.
</P>
<P>
   Freese recommends writing a plan. ``You say, `By the way, I
happen to have put together a plan to make sure I'm successful and
will help your company,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Your plan should detail what you will do in the first 90 to 120
days in your new post to ensure your success with the company. Let
the employer know that you will alter and edit the plan as you go
along and as they recommend, Freese says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to create a two- to three-page plan,'' he says, that
includes taking inside training classes and going to the library to
research articles relative to the field. In addition, ``I would
make it a point to talk to 12 to 15 people who are experts in the
field, talk to experts, talk to customers,'' Freese says.
</P>
<P>
   The employer won't focus on evaluating your plan at that time,
Freese contends, but more importantly, will be impressed with your
effort and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``People are going to be blown away. They're not
judging if you have a good plan. They're judging you on if you're a
person who is organized, has a commitment to succeeding, thinks in
advance, and is willing to plan in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot convince the employer to hire you right away, the
internship is another way around the lack of experience, Oliver
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't get the job. They're saying ``no'' to you. One of
my fallback plans would be an internship,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I have to work for peanuts or I have to work for free,
I would pitch to that person, 'Would you be able to utilize my
skills on an interim basis, as an intern? Because I feel confident
that you will see how I can be a contributor, at which point we can
re-evaluate the possibility of employment,' '' Oliver says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to gain experience and exposure, get involved with
associations and organizations related to your new career choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a technology area and you've been trained as a
Web developer, go help people get Web sites done,'' Oliver
suggests. ``If human resources is your area, go volunteer on a
committee that will use your skills.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    U.S. to tap into Strategic Petroleum Reserve
 &HT;    Oil release first since Gulf War
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By DAVID IVANOVICH and PATTY REINERT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson unveiled
plans Friday to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, the first time the stockpile has been tapped for supposed
emergency use since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But critics quickly assailed the decision as politically
motivated, coming as it does just a month and a half before voters
will be going to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan calls for the United States to swap
out 30 million barrels of crude from the 571 million-barrel
reserve, 1 million barrels a day for 30 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just a day after Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic presidential nominee, called on the president to tap
into the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's reasons for taking this action are very
clear,'' Richardson said Friday. ``Portland, Maine, will be in the
50s next week. So will Minneapolis. And it snowed in the Rockies
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that American families keep warm this
winter,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the administration's action, oil traders pushed
down oil prices Friday by nearly 4 percent. The price for light,
sweet crude for November delivery dropped $1.32 a barrel to close
at $32.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Earlier
this week, crude for October delivery was trading at nearly $38 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the decision to tap into the reserve was not
aimed at reducing high fuel prices but merely to ensure adequate
supplies through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to stocks of ``distillate'' products _ both home
heating oil and diesel fuel _ which are down 19 percent from last
year's levels nationwide and 65 percent below 1999 inventories in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   After the 30 million barrels of oil are released, administration
officials intend to re-evaluate the program and decide whether to
dip further into the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to take further action, if necessary,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be only the fifth time the government has released oil
from the reserve in its 25-year history and never for supply
reasons in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   The government sold off 1 million barrels as a test run in 1983;
3 million barrels in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; another
17 million barrels in 1991 as the U.S.-led forces launched the
counteroffensive Desert Storm; and 28 million barrels in 1996 and
1997 for budgetary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A million barrels of oil a day represents about 5 percent of
total U.S. crude consumption. Administration officials expect the
additional oil will help boost home heating oil stocks by 3 million
to 5 million barrels, closer but still short of normal inventory
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, the Energy Department will begin accepting
solicitations from oil companies wanting to make deals with the
federal government, agreeing to take crude from the reserve in
exchange for promises to reinject the stockpile with even more oil
at some later date.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hailed the decision to release the oil, although the plan
was somewhat different from his proposal to release 5 million
barrels of crude in six or seven installments over a month's time.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
accused President Clinton and Gore of using the nation's emergency
reserve ``for short-term political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten months ago, this president and vice president thought it
was a bad idea to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve,'' Bush said. ``Now that we are 46 days away from the
election, they changed their minds. I agree with them that it was a
bad idea in the past, and I still think it is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strategic Petroleum needs to be used in case of war, in
case of major disruption of supply,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush was not alone in his assessment of the political
overtones of the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it an October surprise two weeks early,'' said Larry J.
Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just Bill Clinton protecting Al Gore and himself. He
needs Al Gore to win, to keep the sheen on his legacy and to keep
U.S. attorneys and the Justice Department in Democratic hands,
which will help him,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could backfire, but it won't be until after Nov. 7, and
that's all Bill Clinton cares about,'' Sabato said. ``I figure the
only reason he's taken a few days to think about it is to drag it
out and make it a three-day story instead of a one-day story. They
are drowning out Bush's message, whatever that is, and grabbing the
attention for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice University, said the
announcement does leave Democrats open to criticism for using the
stockpile for something that might not be perceived by the public
as a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually a national emergency means war, not that there's a
month and a half to go before a presidential election,'' Black
said. ``This is political convenience rather than a national
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday administration
officials understand ``that we're in the middle of an election
season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we find that almost everything, every decision we make
around here, is overanalyzed and the process is covered with
overwrought passion,'' Lockhart said, ``so we tend to try to stick
to the basics of the pros and cons on policy decisions and let the
politics take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Oil Patch, reaction to the announcement was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a panic situation on your hands,'' said Adam
Sieminski, a Baltimore-based oil analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex.
(CQ) Brown. ``People want to know how bad it's going to get. People
are yelling `Fire!' in the theater, and Clinton is saying, `Let's
file out in an orderly fashion.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is good public policy not to have panic,''
Sieminski added. ``This is not an empty gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Miller, senior principal at Purvin &AMP; Gertz, in
Houston, says there is no fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reserve is for emergencies, not manipulation of the
market,'' Miller said. ``There is no emergency here. There is no
shortage of crude oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Fleming, a spokesman for the Texas Independent Producers
&AMP; Royalty Owners Association, agreed that while supplies are tight
the industry is not experiencing an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this will have only a small, short-term effect, at
best,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle reporters Greg Hassell in Houston and R.G. Ratcliffe
with the Bush campaign in Sun City, Fla., contributed to this
story.

`KRAPP'S LAST TAPE': PRATFALLS OF OLD AGE CONFRONT A LOST YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Krapp's Last Tape,'' Atom Egoyan's loving and
scrupulous adaptation of Samuel Beckett's 1958 play, opens with a
bit of melancholy slapstick that offers an elegant reminder of the
playwright's affinities with the great clowns of silent cinema,
Buster Keaton in particular. Krapp, a mournful old man who lives
surrounded by the detritus of his once-heroic intellectual
ambitions _ books, papers and boxes of reel-to-reel tape _ reaches
into a drawer of his metal desk and extracts a banana. He removes
the peel in four sections, which he lets fall to the floor, and
then, with languorous relish, eats the banana, whereupon he
circumnavigates the desk and promptly slips, disappearing from the
frame with a poignant and hilarious crash.
</P>
<P>
   Krapp is played with Keatonesque weariness by John Hurt, whose
grizzled face and ravaged voice make him an ideal vessel for
Beckett's meditation on the displacement of experience by memory.
Krapp spends his days listening to tapes he made earlier in his
life, and recording new ones. The technology he uses may be
obsolescent, but the play is remarkably prescient in its
understanding of how, in the modern world, identity is refracted by
ever-proliferating forms of mechanical reproduction. For most of
the play, Krapp's voice _ the still-young, smooth voice of his
39-year-old self _ is detached from his body, the bent, sad frame
that leans over the tape recorder as if in a desperate attempt to
touch the vanished past. What the older Krapp hears is his younger
self recounting, without quite knowing it, the eclipse of his
hopes. He impatiently fast-forwards through the parts of the tape
that record a great philosophical insight and obsessively returns
to the memory of a moment of intimacy in a rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   The play is a study in grief and frustration _ constipation,
really, both spiritual and physical, thanks to those bananas _ and,
like most of Beckett's works, extremely funny in its rigorous
fatalism. Krapp's grand insight yielded a book that sold 17 copies,
11 of them purchased by ``libraries beyond the sea.'' ``Getting
known,'' Krapp howls. Hurt's baggy eyes seem to contain a
lifetime's worth of unshed tears, and when, at the end, one is
allowed to escape down his cheek, Egoyan's film strikes its only
false note. Beckett's mix of stoic wit and existential anguish is a
cocktail best served dry.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bodily fluids, ``Krapp's Last Tape'' is being shown
tomorrow and Monday at the New York Film Festival along with Neil
Jordan's adaptation of ``Not I.'' Both films are part of a
continuing project, based in Dublin, in which leading filmmakers
are invited to bring suitable works to the screen with the
stipulation that they respect the integrity of the text and obey,
as far as possible, Beckett's famously fastidious instructions
about staging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not I'' stars Julianne Moore _ or rather, Julianne Moore's
mouth, which has been filmed in extreme close-up spewing out (with
amazing precision) another monologue of splintered identity. The
attentive viewer _ or even an inattentive one _ will marvel at the
rosy health of Moore's gums, and note the little bubble of saliva
that appears for a moment on the side of her tongue. Jordan's
camera considers her mouth from the front and the side, in medium
and extreme close-up, cutting from one shot to another with
choreographic rigor.
</P>
<P>
   The magic, or course, is in the words, which pack a lifetime of
loss, confusion and curious liberation into 13 exhilarating
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   KRAPP'S LAST TAPE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world's largest auction houses, Sotheby's and
Christie's, tentatively agreed Friday to pay $512 million to settle
claims that they cheated buyers and sellers in a price-fixing
scheme that dates back to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The civil settlement, reported by lawyers but not officially
announced, comes as prosecutors for the Justice Department are
stepping up efforts to conclude a three-year criminal investigation
focusing on evidence that the two auction giants stifled
competition by colluding on a host of business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that the auction houses themselves are each
responsible for $256 million of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is the equivalent to about three or four years of
annual pretax profits for each firm. If the case had gone to trial
and the auction houses lost, they could have been liable for triple
damages, a judgment that could have reached $1.3 billion, one
lawyer connected with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the negotiations said Friday that the
agreement was reached late Thursday night at the offices of Weil
Gotshal &AMP; Manges, the law firm representing Sotheby's and included
Christie's counsel, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom as well as
the lead counsel representing the buyers and sellers in the
class-action suit, Boies, Schiller &AMP; Flexner of Armonk, N.Y. and
Hanover, N.H. The civil case grew out of the federal antitrust
investigation that focuses on documents that court papers say
record years of secret meetings by top officials of the two houses
aimed at colluding on fees paid to buyers and sellers as well as a
host of other business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been investigating actions dating back as early
as 1991 to see whether the two houses cooperated to set identical
commission charges for buyers in 1992 and for sellers in 1995. This
would have made it more difficult for sellers to play off the
houses against each other in the hope of extracting better deals.
It would have also made it impossible for buyers to choose between
them on the basis of commission costs.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also established that the companies exchanged
confidential lists of superrich collectors who were not to be
charged commissions at all. The auction house officials are also
said to have shaken hands on a host of other policies such as
charging identical interest rates to sellers and not poaching each
other's staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's settlement was based on everything from auction house
employee diaries and expense accounts to travel records and notes
that put Sotheby's and Christie's officials together at times and
places where the strong inference pointed to conspiracy, people
close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Weiner of Skadden Arps declined to comment, referring
calls to a public relations spokesman for Christie's who did not
return a call. A spokesman for Sotheby's, Matthew Weigman, also
declined to comment as did David Boies and Richard B. Drubel of the
Boies firm. A message left for a Sotheby's lawyer, Greg Danilow at
Weil Gotshal, was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will not be formally announced until Judge Lewis
A. Kaplan rules on whether to preliminarily approve the settlement
and give notice to the buyers and sellers, a decision that is
expected soon. Under the agreement, the boards of both auction
houses are required to vote on the settlement by Sept. 30.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's settlement, half of the $256 million in payments
would be due within 30 days of the judge's preliminary approval and
the remainder after final court approval. Each auction house has
the option of substituting up to $50 million of its payment in
certificates to sellers, which would be transferable and could be
used toward reducing commission costs on future consignments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $256 million that Sotheby's and Christie's
are each required to pay, they also have to split the costs of
notifying the 120,000 buyers and sellers as well as such
administrative expenses as processing and distributing the claims,
which could cost an additional $1 million, people familiar with the
case said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26 Kaplan selected Boies and Drubel of Boies, Schiller &AMP;
Flexner to lead the civil case after an unusual bidding process
designed, the judge said, to maximize the recovery for clients
while keeping legal fees down. The judge had law firms submit
sealed bids offering the highest settlement figure they would be
willing accept in negotiations and turn over entirely to their
clients, without taking a fee. The firms also proposed a second
figure for a settlement figure beyond this, from which they would
receive a quarter and their clients the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in an opinion that made no reference to the settlement,
Kaplan discussed the bidding process and noted one potential
problem: If the case could not be settled for more than the winning
bidder's maximum figure, the firm would have no incentive to pursue
the case and would ``make a hasty exit.'' But the judge said that
in such an eventuality he retained the authority to reject an
inadequate settlement. There was no suggestion that the judge was
referring specifically to Friday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation began more than three years ago but it
was thought to have been dormant until January when the Justice
Department's antitrust office in New York received more than 100
pages of documents _ memorandums and notes of secret meetings that
took place between Christopher M. Davidge, a former Christie's
chief executive, and Diana B. Brooks, his counterpart at Sotheby's.
(Davidge resigned from his job on Christmas eve.) The documents
also contain reports on these meetings written by Davidge and sent
to his boss, Anthony Tennant, chairman of Christie's from 1993 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Along with providing the documents, Christie's agreed to
cooperate with the federal investigation and in exchange for its
help, the company was granted a form of leniency called conditional
amnesty, with the provision that its cooperation be complete and
truthful. Christie's general counsel, Jo Backer Laird, disclosed
the cooperation on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also includes some of Sotheby's longtime
executives including A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman who is
still its majority shareholder, and Brooks, its former chief
executive. Both abruptly resigned from their posts in February and
are under investigation by federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, documents gathered for this case show that the
collusion began with Taubman and Tennant who, as early as 1992,
instructed Davidge and Brooks to carry out the scheme. Since the
case began, Taubman through his lawyers, has denied any
wrongdoing.Tennant, when reached by telephone at his London home,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   To wind up their long-running investigation, prosecutors under
John J. Greene, head of the Justice Department antitrust office in
New York, have been intensively negotiating with counsel for
Brooks, seeking a deal that would secure her testimony against her
former boss, Taubman, in exchange for leniency, according to people
familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came after negotiations in which each auction
house tried to be the first to strike an agreement in the hope that
the other would be forced to accept a worse deal or to fight it out
in the courts with the buyers and sellers.

WORLD BANK MEETS IMF IN PRAGUE; FACTIONS PLAN TO PROTEST THEM AND
EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ ``This is our Seattle,'' says Desko
Vladic, a 23-year-old German blacksmith who traveled to the Czech
Republic's capital, Prague, by bus, carrying comb, toothbrush, fork
and knife in his baggy painter pants. ``Seattle was the most
amazing thing I have ever seen _ people uniting to shut down a
global institution.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was a little skewed: It was the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization that picked Seattle for a global trade summit
meeting late last year, only to see it collapse with unruly
protests outside the conference hall and discord among trade
ministers inside.
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, the target of globalization protesters is a meeting
of officials from the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, the lending agencies made up of national governments from
around the world formed to spur regional economic development blunt
economic depressions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Seattle looms as a beacon _ and challenge _ as perhaps
20,000 European and American protesters converge for a series of
demonstrations scheduled to start this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people to open their eyes and understand how all
the overconsumption in the West exploits the poor,'' said Rachel
Hudson, a 23-year-old from Liverpool. ``And if we can stop these
delegates from doing more harm, that'd be brilliant, wouldn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Police have summoned reinforcements from around the Czech
Republic. They are promising to turn out 11,000 officers. Large
areas of the city are being closed to traffic; shopkeepers have
closed early, boarding up their shop windows.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella group organizing the protests, called the
Initiative Against Economic Globalization, has tried to turn the
event into a celebration of the movement's many intellectual
pillars. But the volume of groups and the disparity of their
respective complaints belies any common theme.
</P>
<P>
   The boldest headlines from the Prague clash may come from a
confrontation between neo-Nazi skinheads and anarchists. Members of
the two groups said they gathered in Prague to fight the lending
agencies, but they seem more excited about fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
   They plan rival marches in Letna Square on Saturday, neither of
which has been authorized by police. Both sides say they will
reluctantly bash heads to get their message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't personally like violence, but there is just one way to
stop the skinheads,'' said Jan Kensky, 22, a Prague anarchist and
warehouse worker. ``When we chase the Nazis out of Prague, maybe
the World Bank can leave, too.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Congress considers going home, resuming after Nov. 7
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KAREN MASTERSON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only five working days remain before the end of the
fiscal year, and Congress still must complete 11 of 13 spending
bills to avoid a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party is eager to revisit the political nightmare that
emerged in 1995 when several government agencies closed down
because of a lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
   With very few accomplishments in the three weeks since Congress
returned from summer recess and a failed attempt Wednesday to pass
the only spending bill considered by the Senate since July, few
options remain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most controversial, and one that is considered viable
by Republicans, is to release members of Congress to go home for
their campaigns and bring them back after the Nov. 7 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The post-election return _ called a ``lame duck'' session
because some members may be voted out _ would allow Congress to
finish legislation now paralyzed by election-year politics. In the
meantime, each party blames the other for the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is trying to stall every bill,'' said Emily
Miller, spokeswoman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar
Land. ``They don't want anything to happen. If we're going to play
politics, fine. The leadership can stay (and work out differences
with the White House) and let our guys go home and campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats oppose the idea and Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., said his party would try to prevent it from
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was all orchestrated,'' Daschle said Friday. ``I
don't think this was an accident.'' He said the Republican
leadership intentionally scheduled only 115 days this year _ the
fewest over a comparable period since 1956 _ to limit the time
available for serious legislative work.
</P>
<P>
   Only two spending bills, both for the Department of Defense,
have been signed into law. At that pace, Daschle quipped it would
take another year and a half to finish the remaining 11 spending
bills.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake this election, not the least of which is
control over the House, the end-game politicking has hit a high
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats now accuse the GOP of letting the clock run out so
that Republicans in tough races can avoid voting against popular
bills, such as gun control, hate crimes legislation, an increase in
the minimum wage and a patients bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been trying to label this Congress a do-nothing
Congress,'' said Larry Neal, spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-College Station. ``But their entire focus seems to be to slow the
process and accomplish as little as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, shuddered at the possibility
of coming back into session after the election, but said Democrats
were stringing Congress along at a time when members need to get
home to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no real reason for needing a lame-duck session,'' he
said. ``We're only 2 percent apart on the entire budget. It tells
me that election-year politics is taking its toll, making this more
difficult than it should be. There's a lot at stake and a lot of
games being played.''
</P>
<P>
   A short-term solution, which Democrats and Republicans have
already begun work on, is legislation that would temporarily fund
the federal government for at least a few weeks beyond the Oct. 1
start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   That would prevent a government shutdown and buy lawmakers more
time to work out their disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   If talks continue to break down, however, Congress may opt to
continue government funding until after the elections, requiring
lawmakers to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the spending bickering is over $20 billion to $30
billion that President Clinton wants for specific programs,
including school construction, land preservation and help to repair
the damage caused by Western forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are holding tight control on spending increases.
And last week, after conceding defeat on their big tax-cut package,
Republicans insisted that 90 percent of the $268 billion projected
budget surplus for next year go to help pay down the $3.3 trillion
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., was the
first to mention the possibility of calling a ``lame-duck''
session. The drama started during the surprise defeat of a spending
bill that combined funding for the legislative branch and several
federal agencies, including the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans brought the bill up under a procedure that prevented
amendments, causing Democrats and Republicans to revolt.
</P>
<P>
   The failed bill, which should have headed for routine passage,
began speculation by Democrats that Lott had lost control of the
Senate. Republicans said the Democrats had reneged on an agreement
to vote in favor of the bill. The bill included a congressional pay
raise.
</P>
<P>
   After that, other spending bills that were being considered for
floor action were pulled and members of Congress went home for the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no game plan on their part,'' said Rep.
Ken Bentsen, D-Houston. ``Now they come up with this goofy plan to
go home and campaign and come back after the election.''

GORE DEFENDS USE OF OIL RESERVES AT NEWS CONFERENCE

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANPORT, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore held his first news
conference in 67 days on Friday, defending his call for the release
of oil from the government's stockpiles and and vowing that he
would ``confront friend and foe alike'' over the marketing of
violent entertainment to children, despite the millions in
donations he receives from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Gore tried to brush off criticism from Gov.
George W. Bush, who pointed to the fact that as recently as
February, the Vice President has resisted using the oil stockpile
to reduce prices. On Friday, Bush called Gore a ``flip-flopper,''
saying his proposal to tap into the reserves was a political ploy.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said: ``The situation is very different today. It's not
fair to the middle-class families of this country to stand by and
do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices dominated the 31-minute news conference, held here
near Pittsburgh. Gore spoke to reporters after holding a discussion
with two dozen people at a union hall belonging to the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about their
difficulties in paying higher prices for home-heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Gore said he was not nervous about the upcoming
debates, but was incredulous when a reporter asked whether he was
confident he had the election locked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an overconfident bone in my body,'' he said.
``This is very much out there to be won or lost. This is a jump
ball right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Bush was ``a very good debater and has won all
of the debates he's been in that I know of.'' He mentioned Bush's
debate against Gov. Ann Richards of Texas in 1994. ``He was
supposed to be slaughtered in that,'' Gore mused. ``She's certainly
a better debater than I am. She's got a very quick wit and silver
tongue and is just smart as a whip, and he beat her in that debate,
so put that in your formula.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that he had privately cozied up to Hollywood
executives while chastising them in public over marketing
practices. ``That's just not true,'' he said. ``I don't care if
somebody supports me or opposes me, I'm going to take them on on
this issue.'' He added: ``I'm going to confront friend and foe
alike to get this change.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had not talked to Tom Downey, his friend and
adviser, since Downey mysteriously received a packet of materials
about Bush's debate preparation. Downey immediately turned the
information over to the FBI. ``I have not talked to him since then
out of excessive caution,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took fierce exception to Bush's desire to drill for oil in
the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. ``I am not in favor
of putting fragile parts of our environment at risk in order to get
tiny new amounts when the price is going up sky high and the
production is being artificially cut back elsewhere,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Bush's charge that oil and gas prices were
climbing because the Clinton administration had no coherent energy
policy, Gore said the blame lay with Republicans in Congress.
``They have blocked and stalled and prevented the investments in
renewable energy and the development of our own natural resources
here that we have advocated year after year,'' he said. ``I want to
put this on the front burner in the midst of this campaign, in part
to seek a mandate to get the next Congress to act.''
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that the release of oil could be more of a
psychological move than one that would be felt immediately by
consumers. He said he did not know when consumers would feel relief
and would not specify a price he thought was fair. ``I think we'll
learn a lot from this, if we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore had not held a news conference since July 17. The 67-day
stretch surpassed his previous record earlier this year of 62 days
without a news conference. During this period, in which his
campaign has tightly controlled his appearances and tried to
produce a single message of the day, he has climbed in the polls.
But he said on Friday, after wandering over to a clutch of
reporters and camera crews, that the lack of news conferences was
not a sign that he would not hold regular news conferences as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former reporter himself, suggested that he had been
available to reporters all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a press conference?'' he asked with somewhat feigned
innocence. ``Now, when I have what you call an `avail' and people
ask whatever questions they want for as long as they want, is that
not a press conference?''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters said he had not done that, but he asserted otherwise.
``Yeah, on the plane, I've done it on a regular basis,'' he said.
Such moments, which are infrequent and sometimes off the record,
are held with only a handful of reporters. ``Oh, so that's the
difference for you?'' he asked. ``But they're representing
everybody else, right?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore associates said he made himself available on Friday to end
the increasing number of stories that he was inaccessible. Still,
asked if he would hold a news conference once a week, he avoided
answering. ``We'll talk about that at the next one,'' he said.

AN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE CHENEY IN OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa _ As the Republicans renewed their attacks
on Vice President Al Gore over his plan to tap the nation's oil
reserves, Gore's aides fought petroleum with petroleum on Friday.
They released news accounts from last year that they said showed
Dick Cheney, who was then the chief executive of an energy-services
company, praising the global oil cartel for driving up worldwide
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, stung by Republican accusations that Gore's
plan is unwise and politically motivated, released accounts of an
energy conference in 1999 attended by Cheney, then the chief
executive of the Halliburton Co. In the accounts, Cheney appears to
praise the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for
agreeing to take more than 2 million barrels of oil off the market
to drive up prices, which had been kept low by a worldwide glut.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton and other energy companies had been hurt by the low
prices, and Cheney was quoted in news accounts at the time as
saying, ``I'm struck by the extent to which OPEC seems to have got
its act together.'' Another account characterized him as
``optimistic'' at the prospect _ which his campaign now denies.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Cheney defended him Friday, saying that at the time
of the conference, the price of oil had dipped to $10 a barrel. The
aide said that was an unsustainably low price that drove people out
of the oil business and had brought on the current spike in prices.
</P>
<P>
   The punches and counter-punches came after a week in which
Cheney stepped up his criticisms of Gore, and underscored the
degree to which the Gore campaign hoped to turn public anxieties
over rising oil prices against Cheney and his running mate, Gov.
George W. Bush, who both have ties to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign also attacked a central component of the Bush
campaign's proposal to bring oil prices down: their call to
increase domestic production by allowing drilling in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, a move that Gore and many
environmentalists oppose. Gore's aides noted that Cheney's old
company, Halliburton, has pushed plans to open the refuge to oil
drilling in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Cheney, said, ``Unlike
Al Gore, Secretary Cheney has always made his decisions based on
what's in the national interest and is good for the country, rather
than for any personal or political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   And aides noted that Cheney has agreed to divest himself of his
holdings in Halliburton if elected vice president, so he would not
benefit from the proposal to open the wildlife refuge to drilling.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney was asked on Thursday if he thought it was
politically risky to advocate drilling in the arctic reserve, known
as Anwar, he stood his ground. ``I think we ought to develop the
Anwar reserves in Alaska,'' he said. ``In my opinion it would be
silly not to.''

ERIC STIEBEL, 89, GALLERY DEALER FOCUSING ON OLD MASTER WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eric Stiebel, chairman of Rosenberg &AMP; Stiebel, an
internationally known art gallery that specialized in European old
master paintings and decorative arts, died on Thursday, his family
said. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Germany, Stiebel moved to New York from
Frankfurt-am-Main in 1939, after he was forced to drop his
university studies as the Hitler regime's campaign against Jews
gathered force. He represented the third generation of his family
to work in the gallery, which was founded between 1860 and 1870.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade after World War II, Stiebel acted as an agent for
some of Europe's great art-collecting families, including the
Rothschilds, who were looking to sell artworks in the United
States. Some of these works were sold directly to American museums,
and others were sold first to private collectors who eventually
donated them to public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous painting handled by the gallery was the Merode
Altarpiece, a 15th-century work by the Flemish artist Robert Campin
that is now in the Cloisters. All told, more than 300 works now in
the Metropolitan Museum of Art passed through the Rosenberg &AMP;
Stiebel gallery. More than 100 works were sold directly to the
Cleveland Museum of Art. A painting of St. Catherine by Rubens, now
in the Toledo Museum, was also handled by the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery this year moved out of its old location at 32 East
57th Street to a private house and changed its name to Stiebel
Ltd., becoming a private dealership headed by Stiebel's son,
Gerald, and his wife, Penelope, a former curator at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Stiebel is survived by his wife of 63 years, Irene; his son; and
three grandchildren.

DAVID FLUSSER, 83, SCHOLAR WHO AFFIRMED THE JUDAISM OF JESUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Flusser, among the first Israeli scholars to scrutinize
ancient religious texts for clues to the Jewish roots of
Christianity, died in Jerusalem on Sept. 15, his 83rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   After poring over new archaeological discoveries like the Dead
Sea Scrolls, Flusser popularized the idea that Jesus was born and
died a faithful Jew and never intended to found a new religion.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of Flusser's research were published in 1965 in an
influential book, ``Jesus,'' which was translated into 11
languages. A second edition incorporating new research was
published by Magnes Press in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Flusser, a professor of comparative religion at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, was awarded the Israel Prize, the
country's most prestigious award, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``He established the modern study of Christianity in the state
of Israel in a scholarly context,'' said Dr. Lawrence H. Schiffman,
chairman of the Skirball department of Hebrew and Judaic studies at
New York University. ``People have now realized that this is a
topic that needs to be paid greater attention in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna and raised in Prague, Flusser immigrated to
Israel in 1939. He received his doctorate from Hebrew University.
An Orthodox Jew, he applied his skills in Talmud study to examining
ancient Roman, Greek and Arabic texts.
</P>
<P>
   Flusser strove to separate the historical, verifiable life of
Jesus from the version put forth in the Gospels and the writings of
his later followers. In a piece of research that made headlines, he
and Shlomo Pines, a professor of philosophy at Hebrew University,
offered evidence to support the idea that a description of Jesus as
messiah by the Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus was probably
forged more than two centuries later by Christian church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Satran, a professor of comparative religion at Hebrew
University, said in a telephone interview, ``Dr. Flusser was rather
remarkable in his strong insistence that not only was Jesus a Jew
from birth to death, but that Jesus did nothing that could be
interpreted as a revolt or questioning of the basic principles of
the Judaism at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Flusser was conducting his research at a time when many Jews
were blaming Christianity for Nazism, and he stepped into the
discussion, with an article in The Jerusalem Post during the trial
of Adolf Eichmann, the Gestapo officer. In court, Eichmann had
refused to take an oath on the New Testament, and said he would
swear only in the name of God.
</P>
<P>
   Flusser wrote: ``I do not know who is the God in whose name
Eichmann swore, but I am certain that it is neither the God of
Israel nor the God of the Christian church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should now become clear to the strongest Jewish opponents
of Christianity,'' he continued, ``that Christianity per se imposes
limitations and that the greatest crime against our people was not
committed in the name of the Christian faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Flusser is survived by his wife, Channa; two sons, Yochanan and
Uri; and seven grandchildren.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Clinton pressuring Reno over handling of Lee case
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MICHAEL HEDGES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an unusual huddle with President Clinton, who
last week criticized the Justice Department's handling of the Wen
Ho Lee probe, Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday triggered a
review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Professional Responsibility will review decisions
that led to Lee, a former scientist at the Los Alamos laboratory,
being held in solitary confinement for more than nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, had faced life in prison after being charged with
multiple counts of espionage for putting sensitive government
information on portable computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   But 58 counts were dropped last week in a plea agreement. Lee
went free after pleading guilty to one charge of mishandling
weapons secrets and being sentenced to the 278 days he'd already
served.
</P>
<P>
   Holding Lee in confinement for months only to let him plead to a
single minor charge angered the case's presiding judge, U.S.
District Judge James Parker, who said the Justice Department
handling of the case ``embarrassed our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made stinging remarks about the case, saying he was
``quite troubled'' by Lee's treatment and adding that the time Lee
spent in solitary confinement ``just can't be justified.''
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for a summons to the White House by Clinton
that one presidential expert said, ``smelled like calling (Reno) on
the carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's meeting, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
sought to dampen talk of a Clinton-Reno feud, saying Clinton,
``expressed strong support for the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Reno has convinced the president that Justice
Department methods in the Lee case were justified, Lockhart said,
``I think she gave an overall sense of the case. But I think that
rather than trying to make a judgment at this point, we should wait
(for results of the investigation.)''
</P>
<P>
   The review by the OPR, which handles all claims of abusive or
improper actions by federal prosecutors, will focus on criticisms
by Parker of the Lee prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The probe will encompass actions by federal prosecutors in New
Mexico, FBI agents assigned to the case, and Justice officials in
Washington who oversaw the case, including Reno, a Justice official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strong rebuke of Justice Department handling of the
case was viewed in Washington as a rare public break between a
president and a Cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Reno said Clinton's criticism didn't bother her.
``I wasn't let down. I understand how somebody can ask a question
why,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the sequence of a president publicly criticizing a
policy by a Cabinet member, then calling the Cabinet member into a
conspicuous White House meeting, was highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of another situation that has unfolded like
this; it is very unusual,'' said Paul Rothstein, a professor at
Georgetown Law Center and an expert on the presidency and the law.
``Certainly it smelled like calling (Reno) on the carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   Most disputes between presidents and Cabinet members occur in
private, before the decisions are made, Rothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably would not have done this earlier in his
administration when it was necessary to keep a working relationship
going with the attorney general,'' Rothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's family and supporters, and many other Americans, have
questioned the Justice Department's handling of the case, and
whether Lee, who was born in Taiwan, was a victim of selective
prosecution because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein said Clinton's quick comments in the case last week,
``could have been to establish for legacy reasons that he is
supportive of multiracial inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the face-to-face meeting, Clinton and Reno spoke by
phone. The attorney general gave a positive spin to that
conversation at a briefing Friday, saying the president was
``thoughtful and supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she hoped to ``clarify'' for Clinton why the Justice
Department officials handling the Lee case made the decisions they
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who looks at this case and doesn't know the
circumstances is going to ask why? And I think that is what the
president, naturally, asked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters expressed surprise that Clinton didn't know the
circumstances of the high-profile case, Reno said Clinton ``has
taken great care not to infringe in law enforcement decisions, so
as to avoid a political charge that it's politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Friday meeting, neither Reno or Clinton directly
commented on what had been said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, ``They both agreed that the most important thing
we can do is to try to get to the bottom of this, and the process
continues ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Several questions surrounding the Lee case remain, including
what happened to some of the tapes he admitted making that have not
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Also, due to the classified nature of the lab's work, it has
been difficult for the public to judge whether it was critical the
material Lee copied be kept secret.

BRUINS WANT DUCK FEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ No matter how many correct answers it delivers,
the UCLA football team keeps getting hit with a new pop quiz each
week.
</P>
<P>
   Do they belong on the same field as Alabama? (Rolled over Tide).
</P>
<P>
   Can they avoid a letdown against Fresno State? (A raisin d'etre,
barely).
</P>
<P>
   Will Michigan make the Alabama game a fluke? (Maize and Blew
it).
</P>
<P>
   And now that the once unranked Bruins have climbed to No. 6 in
the writers' poll, they are faced with a new question for today's
nationally televised Pacific-10 Conference opener at Oregon: Can
they win on the road?
</P>
<P>
   All of UCLA's accomplishments this season have come in the
friendly confines of the Rose Bowl, so the test now is to see how
the Bruins respond when there isn't a home crowd to rally them.
</P>
<P>
   This test will be just as challenging as the other three. For if
you're going to win on the road, there's no place tougher to do it
than Oregon's cozy Autzen Stadium, which will be filled _ just as
it is every Saturday _ beyond the 41,698 capacity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place where Oregon has won 16 consecutive games, the
fourth-longest streak in the nation and the longest in the Pac-10
since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very tough, hostile, loud, very
difficult environment,'' said UCLA head coach Bob Toledo, who spent
six seasons in the mid-80s as the Ducks' offensive coordinator. ``I
saw that (atmosphere) getting built and I'll tell you what, it's
pretty wild up there right now. They've got great fans, they got a
great little stadium and they've got a heck of a football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers put so much stock in Oregon's streak that they
established the Ducks as one-point favorites. The bettors put so
much faith in it, they've pushed the latest line to three points.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the smallest crowd UCLA plays in front of this
season _ only Washington State and Oregon State have smaller
stadiums in the Pac-10 _ but it will rival Husky Stadium as the
loudest.
</P>
<P>
   There's no track around the field, leaving the first row of
seats just 30 feet from the sideline. Players on the Bruins' bench
will have little trouble figuring out for whom the nearby fans are
rooting.
</P>
<P>
   As for the noise, Oregon State coach Dennis Erickson said he was
caught unprepared last season when he failed to put in an audible
system with hand signals. USC's offensive line committed five false
starts in last season's triple-overtime loss here.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of the turf. Autzen Stadium is one of
four fields in the Pac-10 with artificial turf, which plays much
faster than grass. To avoid rug burn, many Bruins will wear
neoprene sleeves over their elbows. They may have additional aches
and pains on Sunday, too, but they aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go play in a parking lot,'' receiver Brian Poli-Dixon
said. ``It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the atmosphere, the Ducks also have become one of
the Pac-10's best programs. In fact, in the 1990s, they owned a
better record (70-48) than USC and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the crowd, the noise, the environment that is
Autzen Stadium, the surface that we play on _ there's some magic
going on there,'' Oregon head coach Mike Bellotti, in his sixth
year, said of the streak. ``We've pulled out some games. We've
played well. There's a certain belief/trust system that is
prevalent there. Other than that, I've got no reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins might have an answer for the streak _ they haven't
played there in a while.
</P>
<P>
   They were the last team to win at Autzen Stadium, a convincing
39-31 victory in 1997, and are 10-1 here overall. Moreover, they've
beaten the Ducks four consecutive times, though they've won at the
Rose Bowl on the final play of the game the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also be the highest-ranked team to play at Oregon during
the streak.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Bruins come in with a five-game road
losing streak dating back to 1998. Ten of their 22 starters have
never started a road victory _ including quarterback Ryan McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always worry about that,'' Toledo said. ``He's been in
some big stadiums because I've taken him with us, but he hasn't
been behind the center. You always wonder what a guy's going to do
when the lights go on and the crowd starts yelling at him and
calling him bad names.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins will be called plenty of them. Now that they've
beaten Michigan and Alabama, they've gone from hunter to hunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulls-eye is going to get bigger now,'' Toledo said.
``People are always going to want to get us. It's like the old
gunslinger _ the guy with the black hat, the black suit and
pearl-handled guns. Everybody wants to knock you out.''

   A gay rights organization will broadcast a radio advertising
campaign in seven states whose Republican senators or congressmen
oppose a bill to make attacks on gays a federal hate crime, one of
President Clinton's top remaining priorities. Beginning Tuesday,
the Human Rights Campaign will run radio advertisements for four
days in four states where Republican senators are fighting tough
re-election battles: Washington, Michigan, Minnesota and
Pennsylvania. The $60,000 campaign will also run in Mississippi and
Illinois, the respective home states of the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, and the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert.
Advertisements will also run in California, aimed at Rep. James
Rogan, one of the Republican impeachment managers.

 &HT;    Harbor anchors plenty of sights for visitors
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ When the stingray buzzed overhead like a stunt pilot, I
should have known something was up. It was morning, and the nasal
passages of my mind needed a decongestant. By dark, I had entered _
do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do _ The Twilight Zone.
</P>
<P>
   I was floating 1,000 feet about this whirling galaxy of an
Olympic town in a gold scepter of a tower that looks like something
from a ``Lost in Space'' episode _ or East Berlin, circa 1960. They
say the AMP Tower is the tallest building in the Southern
Hemisphere. But calling this sliver of steel a ``building'' is like
calling Ian Thorpe a meatball. This is Sydney's answer to the
Eiffel Tower and Seattle's Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   From up here, you have to look through a telescope to see the
Olympic caldron _ miles away at Homebush Bay. Even then, it looks
like a match, and the largest stadium on earth doesn't even
register. The opera house is a couple of scallop shells on a beach,
the coastline a jigsaw puzzle. And at dusk, the sky turns into pink
and purple cotton candy.
</P>
<P>
   Take a day to see Sydney, and see how far you get.
</P>
<P>
   This place is so thick with atmosphere _ harbors and boats and
quays and things _ that you can barely navigate it. And from the
AMP Tower you see why.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is no one-harbor town. It's a fjord, miles and miles of
meandering shore, broken up by vast lakes, rivers and inlets of
water. And right now, thanks to the fleet-footed American dollar,
it's an affordable fjord.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters pile up like popcorn. Tourists ship home cargo
containers full of high-fashion Mambo surf wear, $32 Swatch
watches, opals the size of potatoes. And they can make sure that
come Christmas, every tot has an Olympic toy. I found myself buying
a kangaroo hand puppet, a kangaroo backpack that says ``I (heart)
Australia'' and, my favorite, a little stingray stuffed animal. I
passed on the kangaroo-scrotum coin purse, but I may reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   This uncharacteristic buying frenzy set in at the Sydney
Aquarium. The nice lady at the front desk told me that crowds are
up 20 percent over normal, and it's an unexpected boon. ``We talked
to attractions in Atlanta, and they said they didn't do as well as
expected,'' said marketing manager Christine Humphries. So the
aquarium cafe has been ching-ching-chinging with orders of fish and
chips, and the gift shop has been flooded with folks like me,
looking for little floaty pens with fish inside them.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta doesn't have this magnificent harbor, which looks
like the world's most wonderful seaside theme park. But this is no
Rouse Development. It's real. The downside is that half-empty
restaurants will tell you they are fully booked. So you take your
money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, about the Sydney Aquarium: It's killer.
</P>
<P>
   You can soak up the sun and watch the seals loll on the rocks.
Walk through glassed-in underwater chambers while sharks and rays
soar overheard like Concordes. Put your hand inside tanks and pick
up starfish. Stare down Blue Mountain tree frogs that look like
green leather souvenirs from a childhood vacation in Florida. Watch
box-shaped fish with little horns swim about it. ``Look, he's
playing with his tentacles!'' said one Australian mom to her
charges, pointing to a squid, which was flexing its arms like an
Adonis.
</P>
<P>
   These creatures were oblivious to the fact that the Olympics
were in town. Outside somewhere, gold medals were being won.
Volleyballs were whizzing over Bondi Beach.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite section was the Great Barrier Reef rooms, and the
aquarium full of moon jellyfish, hundreds of them, swimming around
like puffy, transparent purple mushroom caps or contracting ovula.
Oh, I also liked the banana peel eel, a long-finned eel that had
the bad luck to come out bright-yellow instead of brown. ``It's a
mutant,'' said one observer.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Golden Century Seafood Restaurant, a Hong Kong style
joint with a wall of 24 aquariums, customers were pointing to their
supper _ abalone, barramundi, lobsters the size of small children.
A restaurant employee wearing rubber boots scooped fish into
plastic bags, then sent them back to the kitchen to be cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, I caught a show at the Sydney Opera House, and
when I walked outside afterward, the ocean appeared like a net of
glistening jewels. The light made the sidewalk pavers around the
opera house look wet _ like the restaurant floor. When I turned
back to look at the opera house, its sails were covered in purple,
gold and turquoise paisleys.
</P>
<P>
   The surf culture is all pervasive. Over at Darling Harbor, IBM
has set up a giant Surf Shack, really a room full of computers
where fans can send e-mail to their favorite Olympians. At the
Powerhouse Museum nearby, an exhibit of Greek antiquities reads
like e-mail from several thousand centuries ago. Inside one glassed
case was a metal discus belonging to Publius Asklepiades, winner of
the pentathlon in A.D. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about the twilight zone. Wonder what they'll find in the
Sydney time capsule?

SEC FILES FRAUD COMPLAINT AGAINST FINANCIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ark., Miss., Mo., Okla., Tenn., Ohio, Mich.)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday that it had
filed a fraud complaint against Martin R. Frankel, the financier
who is already facing federal criminal charges in a huge insurance
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also filed a complaint against John A. Hackney,
accusing him of receiving over $8 million for helping Frankel loot
the assets of 10 insurance companies. And the U.S. attorney's
office in Connecticut said Hackney had pleaded guilty to
involvement in a racketeering conspiracy and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC did not specify how much money it wanted Frankel to
return or what financial penalties it was seeking in Friday's
complaint, but previous estimates of the amount Frankel siphoned
from insurance companies and investors start at a minimum of $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance commissioners in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri,
Oklahoma and Tennessee have filed a federal lawsuit asking for more
than $600 million in damages from Frankel for the money he is
accused of stealing from companies in their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, a 45-year-old Ohio native who fled the United States in
May 1999 and was captured four months later in Germany after an
international manhunt, is currently in a German prison fighting
efforts to extradite him. He is serving a three-year German prison
term after pleading guilty in June to failing to pay German customs
taxes on diamonds that he smuggled into the country, and to
carrying false passports.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel is accused in the United States of diverting insurance
premiums of companies that he controlled to a Swiss bank account
and spending some of that money on luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's filings were the finale in a week of stepped-up public
activity in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Todd Bennett, 44, of Mahopac, N.Y., pleaded guilty
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in New Haven, Conn., to pocketing
at least $35,000 from the sale of a Cadillac and a Mercedes
belonging to Frankel, as well as racketeering, conspiracy, wire
fraud and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   More important, federal officials say, Robert J. Guyer, 62, of
Dundee, Mich., admitted in court Monday that he had told the SEC in
1994 that he was president of Liberty National Securities, when in
fact Frankel operated the brokerage firm. SEC officials said that
Guyer's willingness to serve as a front helped Frankel carry out
his financial maneuvering in violation of a 1992 injunction barring
him from any involvement in such activities.
</P>
<P>
   Hackney is seen as another crucial player. He was chief
executive of Franklin American Corp., a public company in Tennessee
that Frankel used secretly to acquire control of insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have wondered how Frankel could pull this
off,'' said Wayne Carlin, who oversees enforcement for the SEC's
regional office in New York City. ``A big part of the answer is the
people who were willing to be fronts for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Guyer said, ``There's a million things I'd like to say, but my
attorney has told me not to make any comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackney, Frankel and their lawyers could not be reached for
comment. Carlin said that the investigation was continuing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carl C. Icahn has been called a lot of names in his
life. Quitter usually isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, the billionaire financier, struggled for four years to
force RJR Nabisco Holdings to split its food and tobacco units
before reaching his goal in June. He worked to turn around Trans
World Airlines for six years before giving up control of the
carrier in a 1992 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very determined,'' said Alfred Kingsley, who worked with
Icahn for 28 years before leaving in 1993 to start his own
investing firm. ``He likes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   So when General Motors disclosed last month that Icahn had
notified the company that he might buy as much as 15 percent of its
shares, it looked like the start of a potentially epic battle
between Icahn and the automaker. After all, Icahn has made a career
of forcing change on reluctant executives to unlock the potential
of undervalued companies _ and GM is viewed by some analysts as the
last great American corporate dinosaur. Though GM posted giant
sales and earned $6 billion last year, the company's unexceptional
cars have been losing market share in North America for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Icahn stunned Wall Street when he abruptly backed
away from GM. He sold his stake after buying less than $15 million
in GM shares. He accused the company of cynically disclosing his
interest in order to give its stock a short-term jolt and to make
it more difficult for him to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   GM declined to comment on Icahn's actions. The company said that
it was required to disclose his plans to its shareholders because
it was buying back its own stock and it felt that news of Icahn's
interest might materially affect the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Only Icahn knows if he has given up on his GM investment or
whether he will return to the company next week or next year _ and
he won't say. Even when GM revealed his interest, he refused to say
whether he planned to take a passive stake or to push GM to
restructure _ largely by unlocking the value of its $15 billion
holding in Hughes Electronics, the fast-growing satellite
television provider.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn's admirers say GM should not assume that he has gone away
forever. Icahn has long since outgrown his reputation, attached to
his name in print more than 200 times this year alone, as a
``corporate raider'' interested only in short-term profits, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   To many shareholder activists, Icahn is no longer, as Fortune
magazine called him last month, simply one of a group of
``buccaneers who prowled Wall Street in the 1980s, taking and
gutting companies for sport and profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he has become one of them, acting to catalyze corporate
change. As Robert A.G. Monks, who pioneered the corporate
governance movement that tries to make companies more accountable
to their shareholders, says, ``He has represented a very positive
force.'' ( Monks' own efforts were chronicled in a 1999 book, ``A
Traitor to His Class: Robert A.G. Monks and the Battle to Change
Corporate America.'')
</P>
<P>
   Icahn reminds executives that they are ultimately responsible to
their shareholders, a k a their owners, Monks said. Along the way,
he added, Icahn has threatened the perks and high pay of the
executives, who find it easier to call him a raider than to figure
out how to make their companies more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been involved in trying to do much the same thing as
Carl without the same skill, without the same chutzpah, without the
same money, I have respect for him,'' Monks said. ``There's no
question if you do what Carl and I do, you are in effect being
excluded by the great and the good in our society. There isn't
anybody who wants to be the director of a major company who would
associate with Carl, because that would make him not clubbable.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Wien, director of investment strategy at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, said Icahn had become a shareholder champion almost by
accident. ``Selfishness has led him to the position of being a
populist folk hero,'' said Wien, who has more than three decades of
experience on Wall Street. ``It sometimes happens that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other folk heroes, Icahn prefers to keep his story simple.
He conspicuously maintains his New York accent, a relic of his
roots in Queens as the son of a cantor and a schoolteacher, though
he is an expert in chess and has a philosophy degree from Princeton
University. ``I'm just a value player,'' he said in the first of a
series of interviews this month. ``It's really as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. In the heyday of leveraged buyouts in the late
1980's, Icahn was one of several takeover artists who captured the
public imagination. But in recent years, most of the big names who
were lumped together with Icahn a decade ago _ like Saul P.
Steinberg, Ronald O. Perelman and T. Boone Pickens _ have to
varying degrees fallen on hard times. Perelman's fortune has
shrunk, as his flagship investment in Revlon has withered under the
company's debt load. Steinberg, struggling to stay afloat, has even
been sued by his mother over a $4.7 million loan that she says he
has failed to repay. And Pickens has faded into obscurity since
being forced out of Mesa, his natural gas company, four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, meanwhile, has increased his fortune fivefold since 1996,
to some $5 billion, with a series of well-timed investments. He has
grown his portfolio of operating companies, expanding his rail-car
manufacturing business and buying casinos in Atlantic City and Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, who turns 65 in February, has also sorted out his
personal life. In July 1999, he divorced his first wife, Liba,
after a six-year separation, and married Gail Golden, his longtime
assistant. Friends say he appears happier now than he did in the
early 1990s, as his marriage dissolved and his investment in TWA
ended in the carrier's bankruptcy. ``The TWA years were difficult
years, both from a business perspective and a personal
perspective,'' said Mark Buckstein, who served as TWA's general
counsel from 1986 to 1992 and has known Icahn for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Icahn, who for years has spent some of this fortune
collecting Impressionist and western art, has also increased his
charitable efforts, though his donations remain small compared with
his multibillion-dollar fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But investing remains his primary interest. ``I enjoy making
money, the scorecard,'' he said recently in his lushly appointed
offices, which offer a spectacular view of Manhattan from the 47th
floor of the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue. ``I like
doing that, because I'm a very competitive guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That desire to win, coupled with a fierce intelligence, has been
crucial to Icahn's success, according to both friends and
adversaries. So has an unusual combination of risk-taking and
caution. While other financiers have wagered their fortunes on the
success of a single deal, Icahn has always been careful to
diversify his bets and has never relied too heavily on borrowed
money. At the same time, he is willing to buck conventional wisdom,
as he did in 1999 when he shorted Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who play in that game are not as well
capitalized as he is and not as liquid as he is,'' said Wilbur L.
Ross, whose New York investment firm specializes in taking
positions in troubled companies and who has been both an ally and
an adversary of Icahn over the last two decades. ``He came from a
trading background, but he is willing to take a pretty long view,
to be a complete contrarian, to hang in there, and ultimately more
often than not to come out successfully.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities were on display in June, when Icahn more or less
singlehandedly closed the book on the misbegotten $25 billion
leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, a deal that epitomized the worst
of 1980s junk-bond excess. For four years, Icahn had pressed RJR
Nabisco to split its food division from the tobacco business, which
faces potentially huge liabilities from state and smokers'
lawsuits. After several false starts, the company sold its food
unit to Philip Morris for $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Icahn unlocked billions of dollars in value for
shareholders _ and earned nearly $1 billion for himself buying and
selling stock in RJR Nabisco and its successor companies. The road
was difficult. Nabisco shares fell almost to $8 in March after a
series of court rulings against the tobacco industry. Icahn said he
bought shares as the stock dropped, believing that the states,
which will receive hundreds of billions of dollars from cigarette
companies over the next 20 years, will not let the industry be
forced into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with cash and confidence from his Nabisco victory, Icahn
appeared ready for an even bolder move in August, when he told
General Motors that he might buy up to 15 percent of its shares, a
stake worth $5.4 billion. GMs $177 billion in sales last year made
it the world's largest company.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its size _ and its $6 billion in 1999 profits _ GM
was a classic Icahn target, a company that looked to be sorely in
need of a little tough love. Other slumbering corporate giants,
like IBM and Disney, reinvented themselves over the last two
decades under the pressure of competition and shareholder activism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet eight years after the GM board forced out Robert C. Stempel
as chief executive, the company remains troubled. GM now has less
than 30 percent of the North American auto market, down from 45
percent in 1980, despite promises to stem the erosion in its market
share. Its unions are willing and able to strike on short notice.
GM's profit margin last year was just over 3 percent, barely half
the company's goal of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, GM has improved its profitability, thanks largely to
its strength in sport utility vehicles, a cash cow. But high
gasoline prices and a growing perception that SUVs can be dangerous
may hurt that franchise as well.
</P>
<P>
   While some independent analysts, like Ron Harbour, a consultant
in Troy, Mich., who researches the productivity of GM and other
automakers, think GM has turned a corner, Wall Street's contempt
remains unmistakable. Despite a $10 billion cash hoard, a pension
plan overfunded by $9 billion and a $15 billion Hughes stake, GM
has a market capitalization of just $36 billion and trades at less
than seven times its projected earnings for 2000. The average
company in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio
of about 25.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders and analysts are anxious for GM to realize the
value of its Hughes shares, either by spinning them off to GM
investors or selling Hughes to an Internet or media company.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, GM points out that it has already reduced its
share of Hughes' stock from 70 percent to 32 percent this year and
says it is actively working to find the best exit strategy for the
rest of its stake. The company also notes that it has distributed
$34 billion to its shareholders over the last three years in
dividends, stock repurchases and spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say we're doing a lot of the right things here as a
company, particularly with respect to creating and distributing
value to shareholders,'' a GM spokeswoman, Toni Simonetti, said
last week. ``Yes, we do have challenges out there in the automotive
business.''
</P>
<P>
   For Icahn, who finds deep intellectual satisfaction in hard-core
value investing, GMs valuable assets and weak stock make the
company an almost perfect quarry.
</P>
<P>
   As a philosophy major at Princeton, Icahn wrote a prize-winning
senior thesis on empiricism, the philosophy that theories are
meaningless unless they are supported by real-world evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on that damn thing 12, 14 hours a day,'' Icahn said.
``I used to sit in this little carrel at Princeton and I worked
through Christmas.'' He became so focused on his thesis, he said,
that he grew a beard so he would not have to take the time to
shave. Icahn said he made this conclusion in his thesis:
``Knowledge is based only on what you observe. You talk to me about
something, you must relate it to something that's observable.''
</P>
<P>
   Icahn has stayed with that philosophy, searching for truth in
cash-laden balance sheets and hidden assets. He is almost
contemptuous of growth investors, especially those who put their
faith in second- and third-tier technology companies that have big
potential but not much else. Betting against conventional wisdom,
he sold many Internet companies short as they rose in 1998 and
1999, believing that their prices would eventually decline. As the
stocks peaked earlier this year, Icahn had a paper loss of more
than $60 million on his shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never bothered me. I wanted them to go higher,'' Icahn said
of the Internet stocks. He continued to short their shares as they
rose.
</P>
<P>
   After looking at potential future earnings for Internet
companies, he said, he was certain that the stocks would never be
able to earn enough money to justify their valuations. He held to
that belief even as Internet stocks hit their highs early this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with many Internet stocks off 80 percent or more from their
highs, Icahn said his short sales had turned highly profitable.
``On certain investments, I have an intellectual certainty where I
believe very strongly in what I'm doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That certainty extends to Icahn's personal life, said William S.
Beslow, who represented Icahn's first wife, Liba, in her 1999
divorce. ``My impression during the course of the case and during
the course of the negotiations is that he is enormously talented as
a tactician, and extremely brilliant, and extremely rigid in
articulating positions and adhering to them,'' Beslow said. ``The
same characteristics that he utilized in the business area were
utilized in the matrimonial.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Liba Icahn had signed a prenuptial agreement before
marrying Carl, Icahn had a nearly airtight defense against her
demands for support, Beslow said. And, Beslow added, he viewed
Icahn as basically impervious to threats of bad press. Any attempt
to scare Icahn would only have angered him and made him less likely
to settle the case, Beslow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't approach a Carl Icahn or a Donald Trump by
suggesting that you can defeat him in battle,'' Beslow said.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said that assumption was correct. ``If he had threatened,
I would have gone all the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at a lunch on the day the trial was set to begin,
Beslow appealed to Icahn's relationships with his children. ``He
came to understand that modifying his position was an enlightened
gesture not only for his wife, but for his children,'' Beslow said.
After Icahn made that decision, he and Beslow were able to reach a
settlement for Liba within 10 minutes, Beslow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution was quintessentially Carl Icahn,'' Beslow said.
``He decided what to do, and he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Icahn could ever impose his will on General Motors is
far less clear. The company's market valuation dwarfs his war
chest, and GM can bring powerful political pressure through its
unions, suppliers and dealers if it feels threatened. Nor is Icahn
likely to be able to drive GM into the hands of another automaker.
The only company powerful enough to buy out GM is Toyota, and
Toyota is rarely interested in takeovers, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But if history is any indication, last week's skirmish may be
just the first round in a long fight.

 &HT;    Bulldogs unleash tight ends
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia football coach Jim Donnan's offense has
been called a lot of things lately: inconsistent, impatient and too
predictable, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the tunnel screens, misdirections and reverses
the Bulldogs try to employ, one thing has remained constant in
Donnan's offense _ the tight ends are a key ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   In senior Jevaris Johnson and sophomore Randy McMichael, No. 24
Georgia has one of the best pairs of tight ends in the nation. The
Bulldogs will try to get them more involved when they host New
Mexico State in Sanford Stadium today.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Randy's versatility and Jevaris' size, I don't think
there's a better set of tight ends in the country,'' Georgia
quarterback Quincy Carter said. ``And if you add in Jason Rader and
Robert Brannon, two more up-and-coming prospects, I don't think
there's a better set anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But through two games this season, the tight ends have been as
untapped as Saudi Arabian oil. McMichael and Johnson, who combined
for 65 catches in 1999, have just five this season. The pair
combined to catch 13 passes in the first two games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rader, a sophomore from St. Albans, W. Va., has perhaps the best
hands of the group, but he doesn't have a reception. Neither does
Brannon, a redshirt freshman from Charlotte who served a one-game
suspension at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tight ends are a big part of our offense,'' Donnan said.
``The first game, we got them the ball a little bit. But in the
second game, Randy caught two passes and Jevaris didn't catch any.
. . . Obviously, we'd like to get them more involved, but we're not
going to force it. We forced two passes to them (against South
Carolina), and they ended up being interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The development of Johnson and McMichael has been surprising.
Neither player was highly recruited out of high school, and both
resembled basketball prospects when they arrived at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, from Anniston, Ala., weighed only 195 pounds as a
freshman four years ago. A seldom-used receiver in high school, the
only other Division I-A program to offer him a scholarship was
Georgia Tech. Now a 6-foot-6, 252-pound starter, Johnson had 31
catches last season after having only two catches his first two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevaris never really got frustrated with himself, as far as
where he was on the depth chart,'' tight ends coach Greg Adkins
said. ``I think he knew that he had to improve. He knew he had to
gain weight, get stronger and become a better receiver. He knew it
would take some time to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael, 6 feet 3 and 232 pounds, did not play football during
his first two years at Peach County High School in Fort Valley. He
concentrated on basketball, but football coach Rodney Walker
persuaded him to try out during the spring of his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to play in the NBA,'' McMichael said.
``Coach Walker told me, 'Randy, I don't think you're going to get
taller than 6-4.' I told him I'd play football if he let me play
nose guard.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael spent a few days on the defensive line, before
switching to offense. He missed nearly all of his junior season
with a sprained knee ligament and was largely dismissed as a
college prospect. But Walker convinced Georgia's coaching staff to
give McMichael another look during his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a late-bloomer,'' McMichael said.
</P>
<P>
   After McMichael signed with the Bulldogs in February 1997, and
was expected to play as a freshman at Georgia, but he broke his
thumb in the preseason and was redshirted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got here, there was no doubt about his athletic
ability,'' Adkins said. ``His athleticism was tremendous. He was a
little bit undersized, and he's still undersized in terms of being
a tight end. But he's added some strength, and his speed has gotten
better since he's been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Donnan era at Georgia, two tight ends never have
been a crowd. In 1997 and'98, Larry Brown and Jermaine Wiggins were
part-time starters at tight end. Brown is in his second season with
the Tennessee Titans of the NFL; Wiggins is an H-back with the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael's versatility and speed allow the Bulldogs to move him
around. He will line up in the backfield, split wide or move to the
line of scrimmage. Johnson has surprising speed and is a bigger
target and more accomplished blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two good tight ends,'' Johnson said. ``If we had
gone anywhere else in the country, we'd be full-time starters. But
with Randy and (me) being on the same team, it's a threat that a
lot of teams can't attack or defend. It's hard to defend a tight
end with a linebacker or defensive back, and when you've got two of
them out there, it's even more difficult.''

STOCKS RATTLED BY BAD NEWS FROM INTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A steep tumble in shares of Intel dragged the stock
market lower on Friday, after the company's warning late on
Thursday that its sales in the third quarter would grow much less
than had been expected. Trading in Intel set a daily record of more
than 300 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   But investors proved to be resilient, seeming to see more buying
opportunities than problems in the Intel news, and the market shed
nearly all its losses by the closing bell. Indeed, the Dow Jones
industrial average rebounded to climb more than 80 points.
Coordinated intervention in the currency markets by the United
States and its allies to support the weak euro also bolstered
investors' confidence, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index opened sharply
lower, falling 214 points, or 5.6 percent, in anticipation of a big
sell-off &UR; .  &LR;  In early trading, the Dow fell 143 points, or 1.3
percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 27
points, or 1.9 percent, both pulled lower by their technology
components.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reduced the damage in part by buying in other areas
Technology stocks hard hit by Intel's announcement then rallied, as
investors apparently took the opportunity to pick them up at lower
prices. Dell Computer, which was down as much as $5.19, finished
the day at $35.94, down $2.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlet-Packard also helped the rebound, announcing that it would
buy back $1 billion of its stock. Its shares were down $3.25 early
in the day but turned quickly and finished the day up $5, at
$104.25.
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel contributed a bit to the rebound, as its stock
bounced from a $46.50 low for the day to finish at $47.94. But it
was still down $13.55, or 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we hit a little bit of an air pocket here but that's
all,'' said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief U.S. strategist at Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J.P.
Morgan Securities, said ``there is no way we are out of the woods
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Intel is not going to be alone in being a
high-profile tech company that disappoints on the downside'' on
sales and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the Nasdaq was down 25.11 points, or 0.7
percent, at 3,803.76 and is now down 6.5 percent for the year. The
Dow was up 81.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,847.37 and is down
5.7 percent for the year. The S&AMP;P 500 fell 0.33 point, or 0.02
percent, to 1,448.72 and is off 1.4 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Intel was reflected in its contribution to the
declines of the indexes. In the Dow, Intel contributed about 80
negative points, while it added about 10 negative points to the S&AMP;P
500. In the Nasdaq 100, an index of the biggest stocks in the
Nasdaq composite, Intel accounted for about 54 negative points. The
Nasdaq 100 finished the day down 16.97 points, at 3,701.18.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's volume on the day, 308 million shares, shattered the
Nasdaq record set in July by JDS Uniphase, which traded 200.4
million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Intel reported after the close of the market on Thursday that
third-quarter revenue would rise just 3 to 5 percent over the $8.3
billion in the second quarter. Analysts had been predicting growth
of 12 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the slowdown in revenue, Intel said, was weaker
demand in Europe for its microprocessing chips. Some of that slump
in sales, Applegate said, was because of the sharp decline this
year in the euro, which is down over 12 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intel did not mention what the impact of the sales shortfall
would be on its earnings in the third quarter. But the announcement
had a quick impact on analysts' estimates. According to First
Call/Thomson Financial, analysts reduced Intel's earnings forecast
3 cents a share, to 38 cents a share, for the third quarter and 43
cents a share for the fourth quarter. The forecast for 2001 was
trimmed to $1.74 from $1.86.
</P>
<P>
   In the Treasury market on Friday, interest rates rose slightly.
Thomas Connor, head government trader at J.P. Morgan Securities,
said that the small sell-off came as the stock market rallied from
its opening lows. He said that bonds had rallied, sending interest
rates lower, late on Thursday after the Intel announcement.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, bond traders expected Intel to spark a sharp
sell-off in stocks on Friday, sending investors into bonds. But
that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note climbed to 5.85
percent, from 5.83 percent on Thursday, while the price, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell 5/32, to 99 8/32.

NO CONTROVERSY AT CORNERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC cornerbacks Darrell Rideaux and Chris Cash
have been splitting time at cornerback in the Trojans' first two
games, and the position has been the most hotly contested since
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But Rideaux said there is no controversy between the players.
And in an apparent effort to stress harmony and be a good foot
soldier, he denied this week that he has even been asked by
reporters about the battle at cornerback, even though he has been
questioned at least six different times on the subject since the
start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to today, I hadn't been asked,'' Rideaux said. ``We
don't look at it like we're competing for a starting job. While
we're on the sideline, we're rooting for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The players will continue to share the position today, even
though the other starting cornerback, Kris Richard, will not start
because of a sprained knee. Sophomore Kevin Arbet will start in
place of Richard.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ford might play: Defensive end Lonnie Ford is not supposed to
play today in order to rest his sore ankle and back, but he said he
would be available in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go wrong, I'll get out there if I have to,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough guy: San Jose State's Deonce Whitaker, the No. 3 rusher
in the nation, is known for his size (5-foot-6) but is considered a
strong player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not small, he's short,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``But so is Barry Sanders and so is Chad Morton. If you want to
talk about toughness, you're talking about a guy who had neck
surgery. He had fusion in the neck to come back and play football.
This is an extraordinary young man . . . . he's just short.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra motivation: USC tailback Sultan McCullough said he has
an extra reason to play well against San Jose State. His cousin,
Elonte Vaughn, who also attended Muir High in Pasadena, is a backup
wide receiver for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing against my little cousin, so I want to do my
best,'' McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Crowd count: USC officials expect a crowd of about
50,000-55,000 for today's game.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who bring an unwrapped $10 toy (for patients at local
hospitals) to the Coliseum's peristyle will be given a free general
admission ticket to the game.

YOUTH SENTENCED IN GOVERNMENT HACKING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., Calif.)  (Eds: Internet name in 6th graf is CQ.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A 16-year-old from Miami who repeatedly penetrated
computer systems of the Defense Department and the space agency has
been sentenced to six months in juvenile detention. The Justice
Department said he was the first juvenile hacker to be sentenced to
serve time.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, Jonathan James, pleaded guilty in Federal Court in
Miami on Thursday to two counts of juvenile delinquency. Had his
crimes been committed by an adult, they would have constituted
felonies and drawn a sentence of 10 years or more, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Richard Boscovich.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and the U.S. attorney, Guy A. Lewis,
issued statements signaling a tougher stance toward young computer
intruders whose deeds might once have been deemed pranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking into someone else's property, whether it is a robbery
or a computer intrusion, is a serious crime,'' Reno said. ``We take
computer intrusion seriously and are working with our law
enforcement partners to aggressively fight this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the case marked a turning point for dealing with
juvenile computer crime, at least in South Florida. ``Given the
appropriate case, we will aggressively prosecute to the full extent
of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a juvenile defendant, Jonathan James might have remained
anonymous, best known for his Internet name, cOmrade. But the
youth's father, Robert, a computer-systems analyst, disclosed his
son's name after the guilty plea. The father said that he wanted
people to have an accurate picture of his son and his misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in computers for 20 years, and I can't do what he
was doing,'' James said in an interview with The Miami Herald. ``He
didn't do anything destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities disagreed. They said the teen-ager invaded 13
computers of NASA at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., on June 29 and 30, 1999. Among other things, he
downloaded software and stole data, leading to a three-week
shutdown of some computers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Dunbar, a space agency spokesman, said Friday that the
affected computers ``were not related to command and control in any
way,'' so there was no chance of, say, rockets being launched or
satellites being thrown out of orbit. But the Justice Department
said NASA incurred more than $40,000 in labor and replacement
costs.
</P>
<P>
   From late August to late October 1999, the defendant invaded
computers used by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, a Defense
Department agency that monitors threats to the United States from
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as well as conventional
arms. He intercepted more than 3,300 messages and at least 19 user
names and passwords, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested last January. The authorities declined to say
how they caught the teen-ager, although his father said the
government and the youth's Internet service provider traced
computer calls to the family home using technology similar to
telephone caller ID service.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan James was sentenced a day after Jonathan G. Lebed, 15,
of Cedar Grove, N.J., settled a federal civil-fraud action by
agreeing to repay more than $270,000 that investigators said he
acquired by manipulating the stock market on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S attorney's office in Los Angeles on Thursday charged
Jason Diekman, 20, of Mission Viejo, Calif., with hacking into
computers at several universities as well as NASA. He is accused,
among other things, of stealing hundreds of credit-card numbers to
buy thousands of dollars worth of clothes, stereo equipment and
computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan James' lawyer, Ted Klein of Miami, said he was
disappointed that the youth's father had identified him. Klein
called his client ``a good, smart boy who made a big mistake,'' and
said that the ease with which he invaded government computers
showed there was a security problem. Klein said he hoped the
authorities would house the youth in an institution ``where he can
use his talents and develop into a productive citizen.''

A ROD TO MAKE ANY ANGLER COMPLEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 24)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBURY, England _ When you already have a Piaget watch and a
Montblanc pen and are casting around for a new handmade emblem of
arrival in the good life, think of Edward Barder in his
brick-and-shingle workshop here.
</P>
<P>
   Barder makes the fishing rods that anglers with impeccable taste
_ and deep pockets _ simply must have.
</P>
<P>
   He makes them to order from aged Chinese bamboo, in a
traditional style that long predates the mass production of
carbon-fiber or fiberglass rods that anyone can use nowadays. He
sells them at prices of $1,680 for a two-piece rod ($2,240 for a
three-piece; line and reel, of course, are extra) to customers
whose eyes glint at the rods' alchemy of silk and varnish, cork and
cane.
</P>
<P>
   At three to four times what even the top-of-the-line carbon
fiber rods fetch in the United States, the price may seem
excessive. But in the rarefied world of split-cane rods, built from
six triangular strips of bamboo to form a rod with a hexagonal
cross section, Barder's are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for instance, some fishing tackle stores advertise
similar rods made by the R.L. Winston Rod Co., an American
manufacturer, for $2,100 to $2,550. Another United States company,
Thomas &AMP; Thomas Rodmakers, sells split-cane freshwater rods for
$1,100 to $1,850. Split-cane rods made by Mario Wojnicki for the
Scott Fly Rod Co. run to $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat more modest prices for cane rods are found in Britain,
from $430 at C. Farlow &AMP; Co. to $1,400 at Hardy Brothers. Another
independent maker, Ian Martin of Durham in northeastern England,
sells his rods for around $850. And there is a strong trade in
secondhand cane rods: Stephen J. Fawcett, a Lancaster tackle
dealer, advertises old Hardy Brothers rods for up to $700, and
antique rods can fetch prices as handsome as their silk whippings
and varnished sheen.
</P>
<P>
   From his modest premises near the confluence of two trout
streams, the Lambourn and the Kennet, Barder, 35, is tapping a
market built partly on nostalgia for handmade products and partly
on the cachet of a rod that anglers associate with the languorous
chalk streams of southern England. He knows that it is a niche
market: last year, Barder said, he produced just 67 rods, and his
waiting list now stretches to six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no serious attempt at getting some terrific output
going,'' he said. ``If we try to make more rods, we run the risk of
saturating the market, and one would sacrifice quality for
quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning out one rod every three and a half working days, on
average, will not earn a fortune for him or his sole employee,
Colin Whitehouse. Total rod sales were about $116,000 last year,
and the customers expect their rods to come with pampering touches
like silk bags and handmade leather tubes to enclose them. ``This
is something you do for love, not money,'' Barder said.
</P>
<P>
   Though this country often sees itself as the cradle of angling
(Izaak Walton's ``Compleat Angler'' was first published in Britain
in 1653), the most significant innovation in the history of fine
cane rods is usually ascribed to Americans like Solon Phillippe,
who is said to have made the first hexagonal rods in the mid-1800s,
in Pennsylvania. In a brief treatise on the subject in his catalog,
Barder writes that ``the American responsible for taking the
split-cane rod to its ultimate conclusion, that is, a
precision-built, all-hexagonal rod with waterproof ferrules, a fine
action and a modest weight, was Hiram Lewis Leonard.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, GEM Skues, one of Britain's most famous fishermen and a
legend in the arcane world of catching trout with artificial flies,
called his Leonard-made rod the best in the world, spurring British
makers like Hardy Brothers to produce rods ``comparable to today's
best,'' according to Barder's treatise.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances in hollow fiberglass over the years _ and
in carbon fiber rods in the 1970s and '80s _ seduced many British
anglers away from what came to be regarded as the clunkier, less
powerful and less accurate cane ods.
</P>
<P>
   Many have stayed away. Despite the cachet of the deluxe handmade
versions, a spokesman for Farlow's fishing store in London's Pall
Mall said there was ``no great upsurge'' in sales of cane rods
generally. Hardy's, a sister store nearby, expects to sell just 10
or 12 cane rods a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, by contrast, there is a much bigger
following for split-cane rods _ both those from manufacturers and
from scores of craftsmen and small businesses. ``The U.S. market is
the toughest to crack because they are so partisan about their own
rod makers,'' Barder said.
</P>
<P>
   In a modest way, Barder sought to breach the wall last year by
making a special millennium rod to be presented by the Flyfishers
Club of London to the Anglers' Club of New York. John Larkin,
president of the New York club, pronounced the Barder rod
``splendid'' after catching fish with it on England's River Itchen.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the cane rods appeal to well-heeled anglers?
</P>
<P>
   Some say the style of fishing associated with the rod, with its
languid casts of curling fly-line, draws them back to a product
made of natural materials and away from the whippier,
less-forgiving modern carbon-fiber versions. It is a style
associated, too, with the elite fishing grounds of southern
England, where the rights to cast in the streams springing from
chalk aquifers are usually controlled by syndicates that charge
steeply for the privilege. A day's fishing on the River Test in
Hampshire can cost $350 or more. So why not do it in style?
</P>
<P>
   Others say that for certain types of angling, the split-cane rod
is simply more efficient. In the United States, split-cane rods are
regarded as part of a purist approach to fly-fishing _ a sport that
attracts its share of purists.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with many other objects of desire, from fine Swiss
watches and fountain pens to vintage cars, the appeal of a Barder
rod may lie in the knowledge that a skilled person made it
carefully and to order.
</P>
<P>
   At Barder's shop, it takes 40 to 60 hours of work, sometimes
stretching over 12 to 16 weeks, to make a typical rod _ a
two-piece, 8{-foot-long split-cane trout version weighing just four
ounces. Barder starts with Chinese bamboo tubes, some of them 35
years old. Then comes the delicate job of cutting thin strips,
straightening them and planing them into tapered triangles with
tolerances of less than one-thousandth of an inch. Six are selected
to be glued together into what he calls ``the perfect hexagon.''
The resulting blank rod must then be fitted with rings bound with
silk, a cork handle and a reel mounting made of polished olive
wood.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product may be as good for catching the eye as for
catching fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move up the career ladder, they have a bit of money and
they want to spoil themselves with something handmade from natural
materials, with a nice bag and a leather case,'' said Barder, who
began his rod-making career by repairing a broken rod as a
teen-ager. ``It's a bit of an ego boost.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Fashion's bored game
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Among the many riddles of the fashion world
is this: Why do buyers, sponsors, pseudo-celebrities and friends of
the hairstylist's second assistant push, shove, kick, do everything
but claw, hiss and spray the furniture, to land a seat at a show,
but then, once assembled, look like they're watching nail polish
dry?
</P>
<P>
   Every time it's the same: those bored faces, those blank eyes.
And after so much trouble!
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Diane Von Furstenberg held a lovely, relaxed party at
her West Village showroom. She personally led guests through a
clever exhibit of her new collection (set up almost like an art
museum with live models), and afterward many folks gathered outside
to visit in the cool September evening.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Von Furstenberg returned to a runway setup
and the attendant headaches of squeezing too many people into too
small a space.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd first had to mush its way into a holding area where
seat assignments were being handed out alphabetically. Problem was,
no one knew about the ABC part until they had propelled their way
to the front of the line. No signs, no directions.
</P>
<P>
   I was finally given Seat RBB2, but I quickly discovered that the
only way to find your seat was to be standing right in front of it.
Again, no signs, no directions. A mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember,'' I overheard one woman say, ``the people who
organize these things could have gone into brain surgery. Be
thankful they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After the photographers repeatedly yelled at the poor lemmings
who never found their seats to get the heck out of the way, the
show began. Here they came: Von Furstenburg's classic wrap dresses,
this season in denim knit as well as her signature jersey, and
featherweight chiffon numbers in mint green, baby blue and patterns
that played on her theme ``Hotel Life'' (i.e. a print composed of
room numbers).
</P>
<P>
   The audience stared mutely, the only show of emotion coming when
vavavoomy model Sophie Dahl emerged with a look that said,
``Photograph this!''
</P>
<P>
   Mandi Norwood, Mademoiselle's new editor, applauded the choice
of the up-and-coming Dahl, who could more easily borrow clothes
from Camryn Manheim than Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's beautiful, and she's normal, for God's sake,'' Norwood
said. ``It's refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it was refreshing only once. Dahl made a single runway
appearance, leaving the repeat trips to the skinny girls.
</P>
<P>
   Von Furstenberg, as always, looked radiant and effortlessly
sophisticated, but before she could complete her curtain call, a
few enterprising souls sprinted outside, thereby avoiding the exit
crush.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the room was left to reenact the scramble for the
final Titanic lifeboat. A little fellow in a red leather jacket
body-slammed me into a row of chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm . . . Wonder if I could sue for one of Von Furstenberg's
delicious beaded cardigans?
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Week, like fashion magazines or a bad day at the mall,
often prompts thoughts of ``Sure I'd wear that . . . if I were
(choose one, two or all three) 15 years younger, 15 pounds lighter
or 15 times richer.''
</P>
<P>
   So when you spot something you instantly like, something that
you could actually imagine affording and wearing, it's quite the
nice little moment.
</P>
<P>
   I adored R. Scott French's ``aunt and uncle T-shirt'' and ``dad
and stepmom campshirt,'' which have printed on them very mid-'80s,
very posed, studio portraits of assorted French relatives. The
shirts are funny, but they're also functional.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed French after the show to find out where they're sold.
His answer: They're not. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Response to the shirts has been so positive, French said, that
he had to tell dressers to make sure the tees didn't mysteriously
walk off on their own.

SPORTS COLUMN: IN SPORTS, DYSFUNCTION HAS ITS USES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not long after his autobiography had been published that
Keyshawn Johnson, the author, had one of his first run-ins with
Wayne Chrebet, the target. The incident happened outside a
dormitory, where New York Jets players were staying at training
camp. Chrebet, according to a number of Jets players, was so angry
at Johnson's calling him the ``team mascot'' in his book that he
wanted to physically confront his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet approached Johnson, edging close to the lanky receiver,
saying that if Johnson had something to say, he should say it to
his face. Johnson told Chrebet that he had better take a few steps
back. It seemed that a fight was inevitable until a teammate
arrived to calm things down. The Rumble in the Gang Green Jungle
was avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet, who is 6 inches shorter and nearly 25 pounds lighter,
and who declined repeated requests for interviews this week, showed
guts in confronting Johnson that day nearly four years ago, but he
also must have had rocks in his head. Johnson could fold Chrebet up
and stash him in a carry-on.
</P>
<P>
   The dislike between these two flowed like venom through a
snakebite. Still, for four seasons on the field, they co-existed
well, Johnson providing offensive explosion while Chrebet played
best supporting actor, a mighty mite who dominated the underneath
passing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnson expresses his dislike of Chrebet from afar, lobbing
grenades from sunny Tampa, Fla., where the 3-0 Jets travel this
week to play the 3-0 Buccaneers. Maybe Johnson and Chrebet will go
on a fishing trip together before the game to patch things up.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the two never shared a cup of coffee but still
enjoyed individual and team success is not unusual in sports. Two
teammates can hate each other and still win. A coach and player may
not be able to sit in the same room without staring poison darts in
each other's direction, but the team rolls once the games begin. A
general manager thinks the coaching staff isn't playing his players
out of spite, but the franchise prospers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in sports it is sometimes fine to be dysfunctional.
Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson argued daily, except when Martin
was fighting George Steinbrenner. Late in his career, San Francisco
quarterback Joe Montana despised his backup, Steve Young. They both
won titles. Montana is in the Hall of Fame, and Young is on his
way.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls often wanted to wring the neck of that great
sports thespian Dennis Rodman during their more recent championship
runs. Center Patrick Ewing, who is old school, never jelled with
his teammate Latrell Sprewell, who is hip-hop; the Knicks still
made the postseason dance. The Houston Comets of the Women's
National Basketball Association just won their fourth championship,
even though their two best players, Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia
Cooper, barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   Dislike, spite, lack of trust _ teams won't admit it but those
wonderful emotions can sometimes propel them as much as unity and
harmony. Johnson is a classic self-motivator, so he would probably
argue this point, but a small part of him was in competition with
Chrebet, always wanting to outdo him, and that made Johnson even
better than he already was. And Chrebet wanted to top Johnson,
which gave Chrebet his edge on the field.
</P>
<P>
   They competed, and the Jets prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been portrayed as a bad guy because he has spoken
out _ and out _ against Chrebet. Johnson owns a restaurant and is
one of the hardest-working players in football, and his name has
never shown up on a police blotter. What's not to like about that
resume?
</P>
<P>
   The news media complain that Johnson talks a lot. Sure, his
mouth sometimes needs a stop sign, but if he didn't do interviews,
he would be ripped for being surly. Talk too much, and athletes are
told to pipe down; talk too little, and they're uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to many, Chrebet is the good guy, the anti-Keyshawn.
And there are many things to like about Chrebet. Yet Chrebet has
not always been an angel when it comes to his nemesis. During
Johnson's rookie season, before a team meeting, Johnson sat in a
chair that Chrebet, who had been with the Jets for one year,
commonly used. Chrebet told Johnson to move. Johnson took the high
road and did. It was all part of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that after the Buccaneers play the Jets, he would
not shake the hand of Coach Al Groh, whom Johnson blames for
trading him to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Chrebet probably won't exchange pleasantries either.
</P>
<P>
   Or, thankfully, punches.

PRESERVING THE FOREST BY LEASING THE TREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to persuade developing nations to protect their
wilderness areas, environmentalists often meet strong resistance.
Why would any country forgo badly needed revenue and the chance to
foster economic activity by creating a national park rather than
allowing the commercial development of its land?
</P>
<P>
   One environmental group thinks it has come up with a way to
spare governments from such a choice. The Conservation
International Foundation, based in Washington, is in the final
stages of buying the long-term logging rights to 200,000 acres of
pristine South American rain forest. The group expects to spend
several million dollars over the next 25 years to protect the land,
in southern Guyana, with what it calls a ``conservation
concession.''
</P>
<P>
   Guyana is just the start. Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Cambodia may
be next.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions _ development rights to land _ are often sold by
governments to timber or mining companies and are readily available
for huge stretches of tropical rain forest. Desperate for
development, many governments are willing to lease the logging
rights to public lands at an extraordinarily cheap price _ often
just a few dollars an acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of the great ecosystems of the world have a low price
on their head,'' said Craig McCaw, the telecommunications
entrepreneur and a member of the Conservation International board.
He has given $5 million toward the creation of the group's new fund
to help conserve wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International has always favored using business
strategies to protect the environment and has been aggressive in
promoting economic alternatives, like ecotourism, to traditional
development. In the late 1980s, the group pioneered the concept of
swapping debt owed by a government for commitments to conserve
land. Its board also includes business luminaries like Gordon E.
Moore, a co-founder of Intel; Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman;
and Barry Diller, the chairman of USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do the economics, you don't win, you don't
succeed in the long term,'' said Peter Seligmann, the chairman and
chief executive of Conservation International.
</P>
<P>
   The group worked with Hardner &AMP; Gullison Associates, a
consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif., to come up with the idea of
competing directly with private businesses to win long-term
concessions for public lands. By paying an amount that compensates
the government for any lost jobs or economic activity, Conservation
International hopes to ensure that local people still benefit _
usually through job-creation or education programs. ``Unless the
local people are committed to it, it just isn't going to work,''
Seligmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have had limited success with other
approaches to protecting wilderness areas. While countries have
created some national parks, the process of convincing governments
to set aside the land _ and to ensure that it remains undisturbed _
can be slow. The World Bank has spent years trying to help Guyana
create a system of national parks, but has only started making some
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the Nature Conservancy have had success buying land
in the United States but have had difficulty acquiring large
wilderness areas elsewhere. In some countries, large sales to
outsiders are viewed as threats to sovereignty, although the Nature
Conservancy says it tries to prevent such problems by working with
local environmental groups on purchases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International and the Nature Conservancy have also
bought out private owners of timber rights in Bolivia, where they
were able to add the land to the national park system.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of buying concessions directly from governments has
``great potential,'' said Elizabeth Losos, the director for the
Center for Tropical Forest Science at the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington. ``There are far more lands slated for timber than
for protected areas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She cautioned, however, that no single approach was the answer
to saving rain forests. ``Everyone is looking for the silver
bullet,'' she said, adding that environmentalists were often quick
to back away from ideas if they did not prove to be clear
successes.
</P>
<P>
   In Guyana, which has encouraged timber cutting as a way to
stimulate its struggling economy, the idea of encouraging
conservation without sacrificing badly needed cash and jobs is
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no economic benefit, there may be a populist
sentiment that we should use it for other purposes,'' said Bharrat
Jagdeo, the president of Guyana, the only English-speaking country
in South America.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his country is committed to conservation and has
established an environmental protection agency. But, he added, it
needs the support and advice of international conservation groups.
Guyana is also working with the Carter Center, created by former
President Jimmy Carter, to create a foundation to explore
alternatives to resource exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Guyana recently approved a three-year exploratory lease for
Conservation International; the term could be extended to 25 years
once the parties have agreed to various terms, including price. The
group had already identified an additional 800,000 acres that it
would be interested in protecting if the government views the first
concession as a success.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International is pursuing similar arrangements in
countries like Peru, where the government will auction concessions
for some of its land in the Biabo forest.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation concessions, unlike national parks, might also
allow the limited use of public lands for activities like hunting
or fishing, by local people who might depend on the area for their
livelihood. ``With a simple concept, this is very accommodating to
those uses and users and dodges some of the debilitating conflicts
that have stymied a lot of traditional conservation efforts,'' said
Dan Martin, the director of ecosystems conservation and policy for
the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which has helped
to finance the group.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus also has wide appeal to potential donors, many of
whom are increasingly interested in seeing tangible results of
their gifts, according to Lewis Coleman, the chairman of Banc of
America Securities and a board member of Conservation
International.
</P>
<P>
   As promising as the concept may be, it is clearly untested.
Shifting political winds in a developing country could undo any
long-term agreement that Conservation International managed to
reach. Any preserved land must be monitored to prevent unauthorized
use.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International is quick to acknowledge that these
concessions are only a part of the effort to save the world's
wilderness areas, but it says they are important.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest problems with parks,'' said Richard Rice,
an economist for the group who helped to develop the concept, ``is
that governments don't want to make more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   By trying a market-based idea, the group hopes to compete more
effectively with commercial interests vying for the same land.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International is ``wonderfully entrepreneurial,''
said Thomas E. Lovejoy, the chief biodiversity adviser for the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason,'' he added, ``that the conservation
business can't be as creative with financing mechanisms as the
normal business world.''  &QL;

&HT;    PHOENIX TRAINING HALL, EVERVIN TIE FOR 50-METER GOLD
</HEADLINE>
  
BC-Hall-AZR(a)  &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By Norm Frauenheim 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a tie and a double. It was a first in many ways. It was
two times more than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr. and Anthony Ervin unlocked a combination of
strength, personality, humor, tenacity and skill through a
partnership seldom witnessed in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and gold.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Swim Club teammates each won one in an amazing tie
Friday night in the men's 50-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The United States got two for one on a night when Hall also
earned vindication and the United States got its first Olympic
swimming gold-medalist of African-American descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to share the gold medal platform, I can't think of
anyone else I would want to do it with,'' Hall said after he won
his first individual gold while also beating his longtime rival,
Alexander Popov of Russia, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Both finished 21.98, .26 of a second ahead of Popov, a 1992 and
1996 gold medalist who finished sixth. The bronze went to Holland's
Pieter van den Hoogenband, who swam in 22.03
</P>
<P>
   The chances that both would finish at the precisely the same
fraction in time is unlikely, but not as improbable as the other
coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   Before the two ever got to the starting blocks, there were
difficult moments that had could been tragic and at least
disruptive. The fact that they weren't is almost as amazing as the
tie itself.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesaday morning, Hall's father, Valley eye surgeon Dr.
Gary Hall, was rushed to a Sydney hospital. He was asleep aboard a
cruise ships that is the headquarters for Sports Illustrated. His
heart began to beat wildly. His blood presure plummetted. He was
taken off the ship on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the emergency room, it was discovered he was suffering from
endo-toxin shock, caused by a virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can kill you, or you recover immediately,'' said the senior
Hall, a three-time Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was going on while Hall's son was preparing to swim
in the finals of the 100 meters freestyle Wednesday night. He was
never told of his father's brush with tragedy until after he won
the bronze medal in the 100. After several hours in the hospital,
his father had recovered enough to watch his son's race.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, dad was able to cheer wildly for a son and his
teammate, Ervin, who admires Gary Hall Jr. and all of his offbeat
ways. Within USA Swimming, Ervin is called ``Junior, Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hall, he pumps his fists into the air when he is
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it as a tribute to Gary,'' said Ervin, whose father is
part African American and part Native American.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hall, he also has sprinter's speed that was fined-tuned and
brought to the Olympic stage by their mutual coach, Mike Bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Only Bottom had any inkling that they might tie for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God for this,'' said Bottom, who also is the sprint
coach at California-Berkeley, where Ervin was a sophomore last
year. ``I got on my knees before this race. What's amazing is that
a friend of mine, Mike Walker, came up to me and said: `Wouldn't it
be a great thing if they tied.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Before the field stepped to the blocks, Hall was the showman he
always has been. He kissed one bicep and then another. Then, he
flexed. Then, he threw some mock punches. It was a combination.
</P>
<P>
   It scored a knockout. Two of them.

Conversion is an individual experience, but those who have

time. For William E. Swing, the bishop of California of the

mission of trying to create a global organization in which
religious groups might work together for peace. Swing at Grace

On other days, he attended mass meetings at churches and handed out

translated into more than 25 languages, died on Friday in

Conversion is an individual experience, but those who have

worked a great change in their lives, either on the spot or over
time. For William E. Swing, the bishop of California of the
Episcopal Church, it started with a telephone call in 1993 from a
U.N. official, an incident that led him into the highly ambitious
mission of trying to create a global organization in which
religious groups might work together for peace. Swing at Grace

for the cause of civil rights. Lieberman recalled working in an
office in Jackson, drafting press releases and calling reporters.
On other days, he attended mass meetings at churches and handed out
brochures in black neighborhoods, encouraging people to vote in the
mock election for Aaron Henry and Edwin King, the designated
candidates for governor and lieutenant governor. Eventually, some
85,000 black Mississippians would vote in ballot boxes placed in
churches, restaurants and barber shops. (The New York Times)

YOUTH SENTENCED IN GOVERNMENT HACKING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., Calif.)   (SUBS to upper-case `Caller' in 11th graf.)  
(Eds: Internet name in 6th graf is CQ.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A 16-year-old from Miami who repeatedly penetrated
computer systems of the Defense Department and the space agency has
been sentenced to six months in juvenile detention. The Justice
Department said he was the first juvenile hacker to be sentenced to
serve time.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, Jonathan James, pleaded guilty in Federal Court in
Miami on Thursday to two counts of juvenile delinquency. Had his
crimes been committed by an adult, they would have constituted
felonies and drawn a sentence of 10 years or more, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Richard Boscovich.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and the U.S. attorney, Guy A. Lewis,
issued statements signaling a tougher stance toward young computer
intruders whose deeds might once have been deemed pranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking into someone else's property, whether it is a robbery
or a computer intrusion, is a serious crime,'' Reno said. ``We take
computer intrusion seriously and are working with our law
enforcement partners to aggressively fight this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the case marked a turning point for dealing with
juvenile computer crime, at least in South Florida. ``Given the
appropriate case, we will aggressively prosecute to the full extent
of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a juvenile defendant, Jonathan James might have remained
anonymous, best known for his Internet name, cOmrade. But the
youth's father, Robert, a computer-systems analyst, disclosed his
son's name after the guilty plea. The father said that he wanted
people to have an accurate picture of his son and his misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in computers for 20 years, and I can't do what he
was doing,'' James said in an interview with The Miami Herald. ``He
didn't do anything destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities disagreed. They said the teen-ager invaded 13
computers of NASA at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., on June 29 and 30, 1999. Among other things, he
downloaded software and stole data, leading to a three-week
shutdown of some computers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Dunbar, a space agency spokesman, said Friday that the
affected computers ``were not related to command and control in any
way,'' so there was no chance of, say, rockets being launched or
satellites being thrown out of orbit. But the Justice Department
said NASA incurred more than $40,000 in labor and replacement
costs.
</P>
<P>
   From late August to late October 1999, the defendant invaded
computers used by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, a Defense
Department agency that monitors threats to the United States from
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as well as conventional
arms. He intercepted more than 3,300 messages and at least 19 user
names and passwords, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested last January. The authorities declined to say
how they caught the teen-ager, although his father said the
government and the youth's Internet service provider traced
computer calls to the family home using technology similar to
telephone Caller ID service.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan James was sentenced a day after Jonathan G. Lebed, 15,
of Cedar Grove, N.J., settled a federal civil-fraud action by
agreeing to repay more than $270,000 that investigators said he
acquired by manipulating the stock market on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S attorney's office in Los Angeles on Thursday charged
Jason Diekman, 20, of Mission Viejo, Calif., with hacking into
computers at several universities as well as NASA. He is accused,
among other things, of stealing hundreds of credit-card numbers to
buy thousands of dollars worth of clothes, stereo equipment and
computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan James' lawyer, Ted Klein of Miami, said he was
disappointed that the youth's father had identified him. Klein
called his client ``a good, smart boy who made a big mistake,'' and
said that the ease with which he invaded government computers
showed there was a security problem. Klein said he hoped the
authorities would house the youth in an institution ``where he can
use his talents and develop into a productive citizen.''

SECT LEADER WANTED BY CHINA CAN STAY IN U.S., BUT IN CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal immigration court in Hawaii has ruled that the leader
of a banned Chinese meditation group may remain in the United
States, defying Beijing's demands that he be returned to face rape
charges, a rights group said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is sure to irritate Chinese leaders and complicate
law enforcement cooperation between the United States and China. It
could also crimp relations newly smoothed by the Senate's passage
of a trade bill this week granting China permanent normal trading
rights.
</P>
<P>
   However, the immigration court stopped short of granting
political asylum to the meditation group's leader, Zhang Hongbao,
who remains in Immigration and Naturalization Service custody at a
prison on Guam, according to an attorney familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's attorney, Charles Kinnunen, was not available for
comment, but he was quoted on Friday in a Guam newspaper as saying
that Zhang would file an appeal. The newspaper said the immigration
service would also appeal the case, apparently to have the
withholding order removed so that Zhang can be sent back to China.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, 46, founded the meditation and healing group known as
Zhong Gong in 1987, but dropped out of sight in the early 1990s.
Like the better-known Falun Gong movement, Zhang's group promises
to give followers supernatural powers. In Zhong Gong's case these
include the ability to fly, see the future and fast for weeks at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   But China banned the sect last year as part of a crackdown on
unauthorized spiritual movements that the Communist Party perceived
as a threat to social order. The Chinese government has been
hunting Zhang since then.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Pacific Daily News on Guam, Zhang
said that after he left China, supporters helped him hide in
Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines. He used a fake
passport in January to enter Guam, where he was detained and
requested political asylum. The island, a U.S. territory covered by
American immigration laws, attracts many Chinese seeking asylum,
often for fraudulent or flimsy reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang appeared to have a very strong case. With Zhong Gong
outlawed and many of the group's senior adherents arrested, there
was little doubt that he would face harassment, if not
imprisonment, even without the rape charges. It is also unlikely
that Zhang would be given a fair trial on those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with law enforcement cooperation growing, China asked
the United States for help in returning him to face trial in China.
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States have no extradition treaty, but a
recent bilateral accord affords the framework for the return of
people wanted on criminal charges by either side. The United States
has been trying to get two men now in Chinese custody who are
wanted for the 1991 execution-style killing of five people in
Chinatown in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's attorney, Kinnunen, told the newspaper that the
immigration court had instead granted Zhang a request for
``withholding of removal'' and relief under the United Nations'
conventions on torture. The status will allow him to stay in the
United States indefinitely but without the possibility of securing
permanent resident status.

AT PENN STATE, CALM REIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ For 35 mostly successful seasons, the
mountains of central Pennsylvania seemed to surround and protect
Joe Paterno's football program like so many big blockers forming a
pass pocket. But this year, Paterno's team may be standing on a
precipice.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in a Big Ten season opener, the Nittany Lions visit
Ohio State, bringing with them a 1-3 record, the worst start by a
Paterno team since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes, the first of Penn State's eight conference
opponents, have a 3-0 record and have defeated the Lions in three
of their last five meetings, including the last three at Ohio
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno's history of success and his reservoir of good will
blend well with a reputation as an intellectual with a pleasant
manner. Because of this, the discussion about him in this quaintly
named town is neither as passionate nor as polarized as it was in
Indiana regarding Bobby Knight, Paterno's friend, who was recently
dismissed as the Hoosiers' basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was not winning as much as he used to, and neither is
Paterno, whose team has lost six of its last seven regular-season
games. Nevertheless, the mood on the Penn State campus seems calm,
with the students almost as sanguine as the coach they call JoePa.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Long and Matt Drew, two business majors who had just
finished an exam in management information systems, reflected this
attitude while walking along College Avenue this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got JoePa and he's a legend, so you've got faith in
JoePa,'' said Long, a junior from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, a sophomore from Voorhees, N.J., said: ``The freshmen
might say something like `JoePa needs to go' because they don't
know anything. If you've been here a couple years, you know enough
to let him do his thing. Penn State football probably gets a lot
more critiques from outside sources than they do internally.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, in front of the South Residence Halls, two
juniors, JoAnna Hughes of York, Pa., and Laura Costantini, of
Norristown, Pa., were working at a voter registration table. They
had a slightly different take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of disappointed in how the campus is reacting,''
Costantini said. ``I think it is disrespectful to Joe Paterno at
the games when students start booing. People leave early. The
stands empty out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes offered a technical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need consistency in the quarterback position,'' she said,
referring to Rashard Casey. ``I don't think any of the opposing
defenses can possibly respect our offensive squad, because we're so
mediocre. Some people are questioning the fact that other teams are
able to predict the plays. However, I really don't know if that's a
valid criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the critics of the offense is a Penn State player,
running back Larry Johnson. After a 24-6 loss to Toledo three weeks
ago, Johnson said: ``Everything we do is too predictable. Everybody
knows what we are doing. The system has been around too long. We've
got coaches who have been here for 30, 20 years. It seems like
things never change.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the remarks especially stinging was that Johnson's
father, Larry Johnson Sr., is an assistant on Paterno's staff.
</P>
<P>
   After a 12-0 defeat at Pittsburgh last Saturday, Johnson the
player spoke with the news media for the first time in two weeks.
His father, who coaches the defensive line, stood next to him,
monitoring the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my lesson,'' the son said. ``I spoke out of turn. I
should have said it to the team, not out in the open to the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and the rest of the players met Monday, without the
coaches. Casey, the starting quarterback, said afterward:
``Somebody's got to say something to wake this team up. I'm the one
running around like a chicken with my head cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Drummond, a split end, said there had been times when ``I
looked into players' eyes, and it didn't seem like they were having
any fun. They were too uptight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cerimele, the fullback, said after a season-opening 29-5
loss to Southern California that ``we all started to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been so negative,'' Cerimele said. ``Our
problem is mental. We are killing ourselves. We're getting pushed
around, because we don't know what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Kennedy, a defensive tackle, said: ``Our pride is hurting.
Once things go wrong, as a team, maybe you have some guys going in
the tank and maybe not. I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   At many schools, such comments would suggest a problem with the
coaching staff. Paterno needs five victories to tie Bear Bryant's
career mark of 323, the most ever in Division I-A. He may need a
6-2 conference record to get a postseason bowl bid. With Paterno
approaching his 74th birthday, in his 51st season in the business,
it is reasonable to wonder whether he has overstayed. Tim Curley,
the athletic director, answered that question emphatically in the
negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I sit, it doesn't enter into it,'' Curley said.
``The good news is we haven't experienced this much in the past.
From my end of it, the campus is not panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Curley sits at the edge of campus in an office at the Bryce
Jordan Center, Penn State's new basketball arena. Across the
street, even during the football season, construction cranes and
hard-hatted workers are renovating Beaver Stadium, a $93 million
project that will expand seating capacity from 96,000 to 105,500.
Commercials on Paterno's radio show this week urged fans to sign up
for club seats in the new sections that could be willed to children
and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The team plays six home games each year, with each game
generating about $3 million from tickets, parking and concessions.
The economic waves lap up on many shores. Ron Agostinelli, the
general manager of McLanahan's Student Store, stood in the Penn
State Room in the back, surrounded by blue and white team shirts,
golf balls, football jerseys and other souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a drop in sales when the team is losing,''
he said. When things are going well, he sells two or three nylon
canopies per game for tailgate parties at $280 each.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, in the Corner Room restaurant, Liz Pierce, a
manager, said the entire town reflected the team's downbeat
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole aura changes; it's a much more subdued atmosphere,''
she said. ``People get fairly morose. Some of them have come in
here for 30 years. They'll order fewer appetizers. They'll order
fewer drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said she knew the mood of the fans regarding the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Joe Paterno, they don't demand,'' she said. ``Nobody
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this respect helps keep the coach's mood chipper.
Paterno declined to be interviewed for this article, but he spoke
on a conference call Tuesday and appeared on his own radio show on
Thursday night over a local station.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pittsburgh game, Paterno second-guessed himself over
his use of Casey. Paterno said he should not have pulled Casey for
a series of downs against Pittsburgh, although he still seemed
uncertain about Casey's ability to lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Paterno said, ``Our problem is not necessarily
Casey.'' He said that his young team would improve, while warning,
``We may not be good enough to beat anybody on our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   He joked that the Lions had lost every coin toss so far, and he
told reporters on the conference call, ``You guys all think I am
about ready to shoot myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno insisted that he still thought coaching was fun and said
he was ``excited'' about the rest of the season. He added, though,
that ``I work harder at coaching today than I have ever worked in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took calls on the radio Thursday, some fans prefaced
their comments by saying it was an honor to talk to him. But they
also offered pointed criticisms of Casey's movement in the pass
pocket and of Paterno's use of personnel on the offensive line and
of his choice of running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting defensive, Paterno told one caller: ``Well,
John, you've probably got something there. I kind of agree with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   And the coach said to another caller: ``Your question is
insightful. We did make that move, and it's debatable whether we
made the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a caller suggested that people in Pittsburgh perceived
that the Panthers were on the way up and the Nittany Lions were on
the way down, Paterno said, ``You can tell those guys in
Pittsburgh, we're not about to pass out into the sunset on the back
of a mule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' poor start has not upset him, the veteran coach told
another caller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for me to get too uptight,'' he said. ``I've
coached a lot of football games. Maybe I'm philosophical.''

WITH SWARMS OF VISITORS EASING, GETTY MUSEUM IN LOS ANGELES WANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the billion-dollar J. Paul Getty Center
opened its sprawling hilltop complex in December 1997, the throngs
visiting the art museum were overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for a parking reservation, often viewed the same as a
ticket to the museum, reached up to six months that first year. A
table at the restaurant? Visitors might as well have been asking
for courtside seats to a Lakers game.
</P>
<P>
   A success story, definitely, but the 1.8 million visitors that
first year outstripped resources and surprised museum officials who
had expected attendance to be about 1.3 million. Advance planning
by visitors was a must, which helped feed a perception that the
Getty was inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Getty ends its third year in its lofty new location
in Brentwood, west of Beverly Hills, that is changing. With
attendance estimates in 2000 down one-half million from that first
year, officials are actively cultivating their local audience. They
have loosened the requirements for parking reservations and
bolstered community programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moment for us. A time to reassess,'' said Deborah
Gribbon, who on Oct. 1 will become director of the museum. John
Walsh, whose tenure as director included time at a previous
location, is stepping down after 17 years. ``It's a time of
evaluation,'' Gribbon said, ``of taking stock and then moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been educating residents of nearby communities _
particularly families _ about what the Getty has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were victims of our own success or not, I think
it's not a bad thing for something to be so popular,'' Gribbon
said. ``I think we now have the ability to bring in more
visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Getty has for many years had family and community
programs, it has increased the number of family programs over the
past year and doubled the number of self-guided school visits.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty is beefing up outreach through community breakfasts
and special programs in area libraries and community centers. Two
groups that the museum is particularly interested in capturing are
families with children and young adults in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think not only do we want to build a museum-going audience,
but I think that's a way to really be of service to the
community,'' Gribbon said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that since the museum exempted college students from
having to make parking reservations, the average age of visitors
has dropped, from the early 50s to the mid-40s. Parking
reservations have recently been dropped completely on weekends and
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Successful programs have already been started around Venice and
North Hollywood, and museum officials say they are interested in
learning from the community how to serve it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not just planning in isolation, they are planning in
the community,'' said Vendella Barnett, deputy director of the
Neighborhood Youth Association, a preschool and after-school
program serving low-income youths in Venice and nearby Mar Vista.
``They're saying, `You're on the front line every day, tell me what
might be some of the ways to get around barriers.'''
</P>
<P>
   They present programs in the community as well as arranging for
visits to the museum by families.
</P>
<P>
   Elvira Linarte, whose 9-year-old son attends the Neighborhood
Youth Association after-school program, said she had been familiar
with the Getty but never saw it as a place she would visit.
</P>
<P>
   Linarte said her reaction to news that a Getty representative
would be presenting a slide show at a parents' meeting was, ``How
long will this take?''
</P>
<P>
   But she found herself enthralled. The talk was followed by a
free trip to the Getty for families at the center, and featured
music, arts and crafts for the children and audio tours in Spanish
and English. Now she goes every time she gets the chance. On one
occasion, she took 14 relatives in two vans on a weekend only to
find they needed a parking reservation.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly solved the problem by dropping the bulk of their
group and parking their vans at a shuttle location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed till they closed,'' she said.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: KEY GAMES FOR SATURDAY, SEPT. 23 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Michigan (2-1) at No. 19 Illinois (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Michigan gets the edge if it finds its scoring punch. It rushed
for 263 yards against UCLA last Saturday and still lost, partly
because John Navarre, its new quarterback, couldn't find his
receivers. Kurt Kittner, the Illinois quarterback, is slowed by a
sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 Notre Dame (2-1) at No. 23 Michigan State (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   While Michigan State struggled to beat Missouri, Notre Dame
upset Purdue on a field goal as time expired. Gary Godsey, in his
debut as the Irish quarterback, showed enough poise. But consider
this: Michigan State has won eight straight at home. Notre Dame has
lost six straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 U.C.L.A. 3-0 at Oregon (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that UCLA upset Alabama and Michigan when both were
ranked No. 3 nationally. Oregon is favored, partly because it has
won 16 in a row at home. Oregon can pass, and UCLA's best defensive
lineman, Kenyon Coleman, is injured.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Miami (1-1) at West Virginia (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Miami must be wary. Its offense has already fumbled eight times,
and its defense has yielded 760 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (2-1) at Pittsburgh (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech ended Rutgers' two-game resurrection, and Pitt
should pose more problems. Rutgers expects quarterback Mike McMahon
(strained throwing shoulder) to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis (2-1) at Army (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   Memphis ranks seventh in the nation in defense, 106th in
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Yale (1-0) at Cornell (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Cornell seems unlikely to stop Rashad Bartholomew's running.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh (2-0) at Princeton (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh could win big despite a generous defense.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia (1-0) at Bucknell (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   The difference is Jabu Powell of Bucknell, who rushed for 282
yards against Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (2-1) at No. 3 Florida (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Two big passing teams. But hardly anyone can outpass Florida.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Clemson (3-0) at Virginia (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Clemson's ground game (346 yards against Wake Forest) is too
good.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Illinois (1-1) at No. 20 Auburn (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Auburn can win with Rudi Johnson's running or Ben Leard's
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse (1-1) at East Carolina (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina's long passing game will test Syracuse's shuffled
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Penn State (1-3) at No. 14 Ohio State (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Despite Penn State's worst start in 17 years, Coach Joe Paterno
said, ``I am excited that I think I have a pretty good football
team that is eventually going to be a darn good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern (2-1) at No. 7 Wisconsin (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has won 11 in a row, but this year's victories have
been scary.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (2-1) at No. 21 Purdue (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Purdue should win if it stops making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   Houston (1-2) at No. 15 Texas (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with an offensive line averaging 315 pounds a man, is
unsteady running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rice (1-2) at No. 17 Oklahoma (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Coach Joe Hollis of Arkansas State, Oklahoma's latest victim,
said, ``I think they'll be tested when they play against a better
football team.'' Not Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State (0-3) at No. 18 Texas Christian (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian, with a big running game, has won seven
straight.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State (2-1) at No. 9 Southern California (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State, which has beaten Stanford, seems over its head
here.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   Iowa (0-3) at No. 1 Nebraska (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's only problem is stopping kickoff and punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville (2-0) at No. 2 Florida State (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke of Florida State has become a first-rate passer.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas (0-3) at No. 4 Kansas State (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, the nation's eighth-ranked offense, should be able
to run at will.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana-Monroe (1-2) at No. 13 Tennessee (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee won't have to worry about Florida's passing this time.

AOL, TIME WARNER TRY TO APPEASE EUROPEAN REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Time Warner and America Online have proposed remedies to
allay concerns of European antitrust regulators about their
proposed $165 billion merger. But the remedies have failed to sway
opponents of the deal in the music and Internet industries and in
consumer organizations, making it unlikely the regulators will
accept them without substantive change.
</P>
<P>
   Facing objections from the regulators, AOL and Time Warner
offered to dissolve gradually an alliance between America Online
and Bertelsmann, the German media giant; not to discriminate
against European Internet service providers not affiliated with
AOL, and to refrain for three years from bundling services in
Europe and the United States as a way of coercing customers like
advertisers and content providers into exclusive deals.
</P>
<P>
   The remedies, which were presented to the regulators on
Thursday, were intended to disarm concerns among Europeans that
another proposed merger including Time Warner, with the EMI Group,
the British music distributor, would create a company that would
control much of the entertainment business as well as the world's
biggest online information provider.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals by America Online came only days after Time Warner
and EMI offered what they called substantial concessions, including
the sale of some of their record labels, to dissuade antitrust
regulators of the European Commission, the administrative arm of
the 15-nation European Union, from blocking their planned $20
billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   But both deals, which would unite two of the world's biggest
music distributors with the leading Internet service provider,
still face skepticism among the Europeans. They must decide on the
EMI merger by Oct. 18 and the AOL deal by Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   European officials are most concerned about the industry
dominance the companies could gain by linking three of the world's
five biggest music distributors _ EMI, Warner and Bertelsmann.
Under the commission's rules, the regulators must now submit
recommendations to advisers from the national antitrust agencies of
the 15 European Union members states, who will meet in Brussels,
Belgium, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amelia Torres, a European spokeswoman on antitrust issues, would
not comment on the proposed remedies, but the regulators attached
detailed objections to each set of proposed changes. The objections
focused on the potential of Time Warner and its proposed new
partners to dominate the European market for online entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the deadline for the so-called interested parties,
other Internet or media companies and industry and consumer
organizations, to give the regulators their views of the
concessions. Media companies, including Seagram's Universal Music
Group and Walt Disney, objected to both transactions at this
month's hearings, and executives at several companies said Friday
that the proposals by America Online and EMI had done nothing to
alter their views.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at several companies asked not to be named because of
complex business links that exist with Time Warner and its
prospective partners. One executive said that the proposed
departure of Bertelsmann from the joint venture with America Online
would simply leave AOL in complete control of the venture, and the
assurance by AOL not to leverage its dominance of the U.S. Internet
market to press customers in Europe could be easily circumvented
through pricing arrangements or bundling, in which America Online
would offer customers special deals if they accepted AOL's services
on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are also opposed by organizations of record producers
and music composers, which fear the power of the planned
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations made it clear that they remained opposed. In
Brussels, the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs, a
lobbying group that unites 29 consumer organizations in 20 European
countries, was expected to uphold the objections it raised in this
month's hearings. It argued that the dominance created by the
proposed merger would put Time Warner and its partners in a
position to dictate prices to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Monti, the European antitrust commissioner, has taken a
tough line on large mergers. He has thwarted several major
alliances this year, including the planned combination of WorldCom
and Sprint. Monti has the power effectively to block big corporate
deals even if the parent companies are not based in Europe because
many of those companies rely heavily on the European market.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials at the Federal Trade Commission have
threatened to try to block the AOL-Time Warner deal unless the
companies agree to stringent conditions that would guarantee that
Time Warner's cable companies remain open to competing Internet
service companies.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has been studying the effects of the merger on regional
phone companies, which have been used heavily by AOL for high-speed
Internet service. The FTC and the Federal Communications Commission
have also been considering forcing America Online to make its
popular instant messaging application compatible with smaller
applications used by rivals like Microsoft and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Though European officials would not comment on the proposals
Monti will make to the antitrust advisers on Wednesday, the range
of his options is wide. He could block the mergers outright or
allow one or the other or both. Or he could ask Time Warner and its
proposed partners to submit revised remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Adler, a spokesman for Time Warner in New York, said,
``We are continuing our constructive discussions with the European
Commission, and we are on track to close our merger in the fall.''
He refused to comment on whether Time Warner would be willing to
make further concessions. America Online issued a similar statement
from its headquarters in Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Conroy, a spokeswoman for EMI in London, said it had
provided a comprehensive response to the regulators' objections,
and that it would be inappropriate to comment on whether EMI was
prepared to make further concessions.

FIVE GAMES, FIVE MEDALS FOR A DETERMINED BRITON 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENRITH, Australia _ Don't shoot the old man. On the other hand,
don't necessarily believe a word he says.
</P>
<P>
   After winning his fourth Olympic rowing gold medal in Atlanta in
1996, Steven Redgrave was heard to say _ by a multitude of
witnesses _ ``If anybody sees me near a boat again they should
shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Redgrave was back where he was in 1984 and 1988 and
1992 and 1996, accepting a gold medal _ his fifth, this time in the
coxless fours for Britain, along with his longtime teammate and the
stroke, Matthew Pinsent, as well as Tim Foster and James Cracknell.
</P>
<P>
   The Britons won in 5 minutes 56.24 seconds, which was 38
hundredths of a second ahead of Italy and a full 1.37 seconds ahead
of Australia in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave, now 38, becomes only the second athlete in Olympic
history to win gold medals in five consecutive Games. The Hungarian
fencer Aladar Gerevich won six golds between 1932 and 1960 (no
games were held in 1940 or 1944), while a Danish sailor, Paul
Elvstrom, won four from 1948 to 1960 and the American discus
thrower Al Oerter won four from 1956 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The standard line is, ``But none of them competed in an
endurance sport.'' One sporting official who agrees that it is
different in an endurance sport is Anita DeFrantz, the U.S.
delegate to the International Olympic Committee, and a bronze-medal
rower in 1976, who was watching alongside Lake Penrith Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mile and a half, 2,000 meters, your heart rate up, your body
hurting,'' DeFrantz recited, from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave, who has overcome the onset of adult diabetes, an
appendectomy and the worsening of chronic colitis since his fourth
gold medal, was the focus of the large crowd Saturday. And after
the Britons crossed the bubbling water that marks the finish line,
Pinsent scrambled backward to hug Redgrave and then fell into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve told us, `Remember these six minutes the rest of your
life,''' reported Foster, a relatively new teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave was hugged by members of the Italian crew, and within
earshot of a dock full of reporters he told one of them, ``You're a
pretty good rower yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave then told television interviewers that his crew felt
they could overcome a disheartening loss in Switzerland in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of passion,'' he said.
``We had a really good feeling all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was off to the medal ceremonies, where his gold was
presented by Princess Anne of Britain, a delegate of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Britannia. Britannia rules the waves. And not only that,
but the placid waters of Lake Penrith. Saturday's festivities were
surely more jubilant than the ones in 1996, which took place a few
hours after the bomb went off in Centennial Park, killing one
person and throwing a huge pall over the Games. Still, many people
heard Redgrave's promise to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave came back. Rowing is all he knows. There is no medical
office or law office or family board room awaiting him. He is the
son of a plasterer who has yet to identify what he wants to do when
he stops pulling his way through the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't row for pleasure; I row to win gold medals,'' Redgrave
told John Seabrook of The New Yorker before the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave's wife, Ann, a doctor with the British team, didn't
believe him in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lived with the job so long now he doesn't know any
other way,'' she said then. ``My training as a doctor tells me
people just can't switch off like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking it over with his family, Redgrave decided to
concentrate on coxless fours. He kept winning despite an
appendectomy in 1997 and then learning, in 1998, that he had
diabetes, and must now take six insulin shots per day.
Nevertheless, he was part of the quartet that won the world

   He has outlasted a number of partners. He won gold in the
four-oared boat with Martin Cross, Richard Budgett and Andy Holmes
at the 1984 Games at Lake Casitas outside Los Angeles. He won the
pairs with Holmes in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. And after working
for a year with Simon Berrisford, who was injured, Redgrave teamed
with Pinsent, who had rowed for Eton and Oxford, and they won gold
medals in 1992 outside Barcelona, Spain, and in 1996 at Lake Lanier
outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He has carried the Union Jack at two Summer Games, but has not
been treated as athletic nobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will definitely stop,'' he said recently. ``I can't see
myself rowing at any level after these Olympics. But I said that
before, so nobody's going to believe me.''

WITH GODSEY AT QUARTERBACK, NOTRE DAME MYSTERY IS SOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ The first act of ``The Gary Godsey Story''
was promising: The credits rolled 13 days ago at O'Neill Hall on
the Notre Dame campus. Godsey, the 6-foot-7-inch tight end turned
quarterback, is sleeping. In walks quarterback Arnaz Battle, who
nearly led the Fighting Irish to an upset of Nebraska, the
top-ranked team in the country, the day before. Battle has six
teammates with him, as well as a broken left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Battle wakes up Godsey and says that he will probably miss the
rest of the season, that the fate of the team rests on Godsey's
rusty right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to six days later, at Notre Dame Stadium, with 80,000 people
on their feet. The Irish trail Purdue, 21-20, with 3 minutes 39
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not leave the field second,'' Godsey tells his teammates
in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish have made 3 of 12 third-down conversions all afternoon
but Godsey, a sophomore, leads them to three more on the final
drive _ including a 15-yard completion to Javin Hunter on
third-and-10. Godsey gets them close enough for Nick Setta to kick
a 38-yard, game-winning field goal as time expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a heck of a story,'' Coach Bob Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   It already has more plot points than ``Rudy,'' but the Godsey
story may get richer. The Irish (2-1), ranked 16th, have not won a
road game in more than a year. On Saturday they play here against
No. 23 Michigan State (2-0) _ which has won each of the past three
games between the schools by at least 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's my first away game, but I'm not worried,'' said
Godsey, who scored a touchdown and completed 14 of 25 passes for
158 yards against Purdue. ``I've pictured myself in front of 80,000
people since last spring. I've continually told myself that I would
get my chance, and now it's up to me to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Godsey is already suggesting rewrites. He dislikes
being called a converted tight end because, as a high school senior
in Tampa, Fla., he threw for 1,800 yards and 22 touchdowns with
only four interceptions. Even better, the position is part of the
family pedigree. His brother, George, is the starting quarterback
at Georgia Tech. But Godsey was intent on attending Notre Dame and
agreed to a scholarship as a tight end after Davie promised the
recruit C.J. Leak that the Irish would not try to bring in another
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach was honest and upfront about it,'' Godsey said. ``He
didn't rule out quarterback, but said I was coming as a tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had it in mind I was going to be a quarterback at Notre
Dame and was willing to see what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leak changed his mind and chose Wake Forest, and injuries
thinned the Irish at quarterback last season, Godsey was installed
as the third-string backup. He had a decent spring practice, but
understood that the starting job belonged to Battle, who was better
suited to run the option.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Godsey dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the backup role very serious,'' he said. ``I lost 22
pounds over the summer so I'd be more mobile, and I talked with my
brother every day _ I still do _ about what to look for and things
to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates noticed. At 11 a.m. on Sept. 10, Battle and a
group that included tight end Jabari Holloway, receiver David
Givens and defensive back Brock Williams, went to his dorm room.
Their message was clear. ``They told me that they were confident in
me, that I had worked as hard as anyone and it was up to me to keep
the team's aspirations alive,'' Godsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey knows the ending he wants; it is nearly identical to
another that unfolded for a third-stringer at Notre Dame. In 1977,
in the third game of the year against Purdue, Joe Montana was put
into the game with one minute left in the third quarter. The Irish
trailed, 24-10. Montana completed 9 of 14 passes for 154 yards and
led the Irish to 21 points as Notre Dame won, 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Montana, Notre Dame won its last 10 games to finish 11-1
and win the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey certainly will take a wrap and print on that ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very easily could be 3-0,'' he said. ``I can see a 10-1
season just as easily. It's the team's goal, so it's my goal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be called Rainbow's End, but there's no pot of gold
awaiting folks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there's nothing but a heap of controversy surrounding
the 9,000-plus retirees who call a 130-acre RV park home in
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether 9,000 people can really ``live'' in a park
that has a few houses and space for about 300 recreational vehicles
and motor homes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say ``Yes,'' in that the park is the only ``home''
most members of the Escapees RV Club have.
</P>
<P>
   Were this not an election year and were Polk County not ground
zero for one of the most crucial state Senate elections in Texas,
few would care where the RVers said they lived.
</P>
<P>
   But Polk County is in state Senate District 3, where Republican
Todd Staples and Democrat David Fisher are in a tight race _ one
that could determine which political party controls the Senate next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have turned a quiet disagreement in the small East
Texas town
 &UR;  &LR; into a statewide controversy.
</P>
<P>
   It also is upsetting RV park residents who fear they may lose
the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe anyone can take away a national right,'' Betty
Mobry, 74, said. ``I don't know where they think we are going to
vote. You shouldn't be excluded just because you like to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobry, who is actively campaigning for Republican candidates, is
not in danger of having her residency challenged. She built a
one-bedroom home on a lot at the park and lives there year-round.
</P>
<P>
   But she knows what it is like to have no permanent address.
Before moving to Rainbow's End, she and her husband, Russell, 80,
spent eight years on the road after selling their home in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted in Wisconsin because I had a post office box that
allowed me to register my vehicle there. I never lived in Wisconsin
a day in my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 9,000 members of RV club are similarly situated.
They do not own homes. They spend the year traveling the country in
motor homes staying at RV parks just like Rainbow's End.
</P>
<P>
   They use the RV park as their address, and when they arrive at a
new destination, they call the Rainbow's End post office and have
their mail forwarded to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't own a home, you're in an RV, don't you still have
the right to vote?'' Mobry asks.
</P>
<P>
   Three Polk County residents with ties to the Democratic Party
say ``no.'' They challenged the residency of the RV park residents,
who voted overwhelmingly Republican in the March primary.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to their complaint, Polk County Tax
Assessor-Collector Marion ``Bid'' A. Smith, a Democrat, began
mailing letters to registered voters in the RV park asking them to
verify their addresses by returning a card within 30 days. Voters
who do not return the card by the deadline will have their
registrations suspended and be ineligible to vote in the November
general election.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General John Cornyn, a Republican, and Secretary
of State Elton Bomer, a Democrat, won a court order temporarily
barring Smith from suspending anyone's voter registration without a
hearing. But that prohibition expired this week, and state District
Court Judge P.K. Reiter of Livingston declined to extend it.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn aide Andy Taylor said the attorney general is concerned
about the precedent that would be set if individuals are allowed to
challenge the voting rights of thousands of people without proving
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Club members said RV park residents are particularly vulnerable
to such wholesale challenges because their mail might not be
forwarded to them until after the deadline to respond has passed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Taylor asked Judge Reiter to reopen the case because
he discovered a letter Smith wrote to the director of the RV park
last year telling her it was OK for club members to list Rainbow's
End as their addresses on voter registration cards. The judge is
considering the request.
</P>
<P>
   Austin attorney Buck Wood is representing Democrats in the
fracas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most partisan thing I've seen in my life,'' Wood
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood called the involvement of the secretary of state and the
attorney general in the case unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general has never filed a lawsuit like this in
the history of state ... to keep a registrar from cleaning up his
(voter registration) rolls,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been 15,000 Hare Krishnas that suddenly
registered at a post office box in Anderson County, I think the
secretary of state's position would have been quite different.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said there is no way Rainbow's End could support the number
of people who claim to live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all 9,000 tried to turn up at one time, they'd cover entire
Polk County,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many RV club residents feel betrayed by the challenges to their
residency. Polk County had no reservations about counting them as
residents in the most recent census, they point out.
</P>
<P>
   RV club members contribute a lot to the community, member Judith
Curtis said. They attend Livingston churches, volunteer in
Livingston schools and shop in Livingston stores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And they pay plenty in state and county taxes, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of money through this town,'' she said. ``We buy
local whenever possible. This is our town.''

FORD RAISES RECOMMENDED TIRE PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Ford Motor Co. recommended Friday night that
owners of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles inflate their tires
to 30 pounds per square inch, instead of the 26 pounds that the
automaker has recommended for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., the manufacturer of the Firestone
light truck tires blamed for 101 deaths, mostly in Explorers,
publicly urged Ford on Thursday to raise the recommended pressure.
Ford agreed Friday night, while pointing out that Goodyear tires on
Explorers had performed with virtually no problems at a pressure of
26 pounds, and that even Firestone executives had long agreed that
26 pounds was an acceptable pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Higher pressure allows a tire to support more weight and go
faster with less risk of failure. According to tire industry
guidelines, the higher pressure should allow tires on the Ford
Explorer to carry 400 pounds more weight. The higher pressure
should also raise the maximum speed at which the tires are
certified to operate for at least 10 minutes, to 108 mph from 106
mph.
</P>
<P>
   The top speed of the Explorer, controlled by a computer chip in
the engine, is 99 mph, and the tires have the combined capacity to
carry nearly 3,000 pounds in addition to the weight of the vehicle
itself. But the weight of the Explorer is not evenly distributed,
falling most heavily on the left rear tire, which has also proved
the most prone to failure.
</P>
<P>
   John Lampe, Firestone's executive vice president for sales and
marketing, said in congressional testimony on Thursday that the
Explorer needed a larger margin of safety. An Explorer owner who
allows the pressure to fall seven pounds below Ford's recommended
pressure, to 19 pounds per square inch, leaves the tires without
the capacity to carry the weight of a moderately loaded Explorer,
he said. He also pointed out that the recommended tire pressure for
Chevrolet sport utility vehicles _ 35 pounds per square inch _
could fall by as much as 14 pounds before the tires became
overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, a unit of the Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, announced
on Aug. 9 that it was recalling 14.4 million tires, of which 6.5
million are still believed to be in use. The recall covers all ATX
tires of the P235/75R15 size produced at various factories, plus
Wilderness tires of the same size that were manufactured in
Decatur, Ill. Wilderness tires of this size produced at other
factories have not been recalled, although personal injury lawyers
renewed their call Friday for these tires to be added to the
recall.
</P>
<P>
   The tire maker said on Aug. 9 that 30 pounds was a better
pressure than 26. Ford said then that while it believed that 26
pounds was a safe pressure, a range of 26 to 30 pounds was
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, Ford urged Explorer owners to raise the
pressure in their tires. In a letter addressed to Masatoshi Ono,
the chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone, and
released to reporters, Ford said that, ``even recognizing that your
non-recalled tires and the Goodyear tires have performed well at 26
p.s.i., we are advising our Explorer owners, based on your
recommendation, that their Firestone P235/75R15 tires be inflated
to 30 p.s.i., as this is within the 26-30 p.s.i. range jointly
approved when the Firestone recall was announced and it should help
to eliminate customer confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was from Carlos Mazzorin, who, as Ford's group vice
president for global purchasing, has responsibility for the
automaker's relationships with suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Wednesday, Ford officials had said that the
Explorer was less likely to roll over in everyday driving, without
tire failures, if the tires were inflated to 26 pounds per square
inch. Even with the tire-related deaths, Explorer occupants have a
lower death rate in rollovers than those of most other midsized
sport utility vehicles. But insurance industry figures show that
Explorer drivers are still almost twice as likely to die in
rollovers as drivers of Ford Taurus midsized sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials declined to elaborate on the letter to Ono.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's decision to raise the recommended pressure comes at a
time of deepening mystery on two other issues in the Firestone tire
recall. One mystery is whether the Firestone tires are failing
because of a manufacturing problem in Decatur or because of a
design problem that might affect tires made elsewhere. Another
mystery is whether the Ford Explorer has a defective suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The big mystery at Firestone still lies in what went wrong with
the tires. Lampe has admitted that the company made what he
recently described as ``bad tires,'' while blaming this mainly on
unspecified ``variations'' in the manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   But personal injury lawyers contend that some design defect _
they are not quite sure what _ must be responsible. They want
Firestone to broaden its recall to 15-inch Wilderness tires
manufactured at factories other than the one in Decatur, and they
want Firestone to start recalling 16-inch Wilderness tires as well.
</P>
<P>
   Safetyforum.com, a research firm for personal injury lawyers,
released Friday a review of all complaints to regulators about
Firestone tires that can be mounted on Explorers. For those
complaints in which the tire's size and place of manufacture could
be identified, the majority involved tires that have not been
recalled, the research firm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By selling the fiction that the problem is in Decatur, they
get by with using non-Decatur tires as replacements,'' said Ralph
Hoar, the founder of safetyforum.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the research firm was only able to identify the tire sizes
and places of manufacture for 12 percent of the complaints. While
Ford declined to comment on SafetyForum.com's work, Firestone
seized on the limited sample size, contending in a statement Friday
evening that, ``That is much too small a universe of tires on which
to base such conclusions and such serious allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The tire maker warned that, ``consumers would be replacing good
tires with good tires, delaying and adding confusion to the efforts
to quickly replace the recalled tires.''
</P>
<P>
   On the suspension issue, Ford officials revealed on Wednesday
that the automaker and regulators had received complaints about
possible defects in the Explorer's front sway bar, also known as
the front stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and regulators say that they have not heard of any serious
crashes related to the bar. But this is the suspension component
that limits how much the vehicle tilts from side to side while
going around curves, and it is one of the most important components
in preventing rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis by The New York Times of a federal database
of all fatal crashes across the country found that tire-related
deaths in Explorers were somewhat more likely to involve rollovers
than tire-related deaths in other sport utility vehicles. From 1994
through 1999, rollovers were a factor in 95 percent of the deaths
that occurred in Explorers after a tire failed.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, 80 percent of other sport utilities in
fatal, tire-related crashes also rolled over, as did roughly 40
percent of cars. Since the overall rollover death rate for
Explorers is low by sport utility vehicle standards _ although
still high compared with cars _ the prevalence of rollovers in the
Firestone tire cases is somewhat surprising.
</P>
<P>
   But the type of tire failure occurring on Firestone tires seems
particularly likely to happen at high speeds, and rollovers are
especially likely at high speeds. So the role of the Explorer's
suspension, if any, remains murky.

LA   GUARDIA DELAYS HAVE MAJOR IMPACT ON NATIONS AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDY KENNEDY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported on Friday that
delays at La Guardia Airport had grown so sharply that they
contributed to a 60 percent national increase in August in the type
of delays caused when too many planes were scheduled to take off at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The agency declined to release the number of delays broken down
by individual airport, saying that airport control towers around
the country were still checking the numbers and would probably
release them next week. It is not known, therefore, how many more
so-called volume delays there were at La Guardia Airport in August
compared with August of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a report of national numbers, FAA officials said that
``the growth in volume delays reflects the increase in traffic at
the busiest airports,'' and added, ``One reason is the significant
increase in flights at New York La Guardia.''
</P>
<P>
   The information was released during the same week that officials
of the Port Authority, the agency that manages La Guardia,
announced that airlines could not add any flights during the
airport's peak hours in the morning and evening because traffic has
reached near-gridlock conditions at those times.
</P>
<P>
   The quick rise in flights at La Guardia is the result of a
federal law passed in March that partly lifted flight restrictions
on the busy airport, creating more slots for smaller regional jets
that fly to underserved cities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the change, airlines have added about 200 flights a day at
the airport and some airport officials expected that as many as 400
more would be scheduled soon. Before the new flights began coming
in, the airport would handle about 1,200 flights, counting both
takeoffs and landings, on a very busy day.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in traffic, lines of planes waiting on the
taxiways sometimes grow to more than 25 at La Guardia even on a day
with fine weather. This long line means that planes may have to
wait more than an hour to take off after leaving the gate.
</P>
<P>
   At all the nation's airports, the types of delays recorded by
the FAA _ those caused mostly by weather, excess flight volume,
runway problems or equipment problems _ increased to 47,893 in
August from 37,189 a year earlier. Weather is the biggest cause of
delays. But while weather delays increased somewhat this year,
volume delays rose significantly, to 5,397 from 3,376 last August.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the FAA, clearly referring to the conditions that
have developed at La Guardia, said that ``when an airport that is
scheduled over its capacity for portions of the day receives even a
small amount of additional flights, it will usually experience a
dramatic increase both in delays and their duration.''

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Mo and Marion sailed into the 100-meter-dash
semifinals, Michael and Cathy moved on in the 400, and Adam Nelson
and John Godina missed shot put gold by inches as track and field
made its Sydney Olympics debut Friday.
</P>
<P>
   American sprint world champions Maurice Greene and Marion Jones
each won two heats at Olympic Stadium without having to extend
themselves. Greene had a best time of 10.10 seconds. Jones ran
10.83.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have this first day completed,'' said Jones, who
hopes to win five gold medals here. ``My focus was to set up my
races (Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take faster than (10.83) to win the gold. I'm
capable of going 10.7, or faster than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones might be able to win with a 10.9. Second-fastest qualifier
for the semifinals was Ekaterini Thanoe of Greece, who ran a 10.99.
</P>
<P>
   Chryste Gaines of the U.S. also gained the semifinals, running
11.21, but Torri Edwards went out in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world-record holder, started well and coasted home
in each of his heats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran about 85 percent,'' he said. ``I wanted to start piecing
it all together and putting it all together for the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough, but I know what I'm capable of
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is he capable of, he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Drummond and Curtis Johnson also gained the men's
semis. The finals in the men's and women's 100 are tonight in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Olympic champ and world-record holder Michael Johnson
got out of the first round of the 400 with an eased-up time of
45.25. Alvin Harrison of the U.S. ran the day's top time, a 44.96.
Antonio Pettigrew of the U.S. also reached the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Freeman, Australian torch-bearer and clear favorite in the
women's 400 now that France's quirky Marie Jose Perec has bolted
the Games, coasted through her heat in 51.63 seconds. K.N.Beeba Mol
of India had the day's top time, 51.51. Americans Monique Hennagan
and LaTasha Colander-Richardson advanced.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. shot putters came within inches of another Olympics sweep
in the only event (aside from walking) in which medals were awarded
Friday. Arsi Harju of Finland took the gold with an effort of 69
feet, 10 inches. Nelson (69-7) and Godina (69-6) were right behind
him, with Andy Bloom of the U.S. fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hold in your hand how much first and third were
separatedby,'' Godina said. ``Nine centimeters. That's three
inches.''
</P>
<P>
   Godina wasn't enthused about winning a bronze. ``Third is better
than nothing,'' he said. ``It beats fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic champion Charles Austin failed to advance out of high
jump qualifying, and defending 100-meter gold-medalist Donovan
Bailey of Canada also fell by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Graf of Austria led women's 800-meter qualifying. Also
advancing were all three Americans _ sisters Joetta and Hazel
Clark, and sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Korzeniowski of Poland won the men's 20-kilometer walk.
Runner-up Bernardo Segura of Mexico was disqualified for not
keeping at least one foot on the ground at all times.
</P>
<P>
   American women failed to advance in the triple jump and
5,000-meter run. Breaux Greer gained the men's javelin final, and
America's Horn of Africa emigres advanced in the 10,000-meter run _
Mebrahtom Keflezighi (Eritrea) and Abdihakim Abdirahman (Somalia).

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ ``It's not about chasing headlines,'' say the
television and billboard advertisements on which Roger Kahn has
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, and around the suburbs and
farms of northwest Georgia, there is nothing cryptic about the
meaning of his campaign slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn's target is obvious to area residents, who have seen
headlines like these for years: ``Bob Barr, `Attack dog for
impeachment,' finds himself leading the pack''; ``Even Before
Monica Lewinsky, Bob Barr Had Impeachment on His Mind''; ``Barr
blasts Army for allowing Wiccan celebration at Texas base''; ``Barr
Blasts EPA for Promoting Homosexual Behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Bob Barr, the relentless Republican congressman from
Georgia's 7th District, even skeptical headlines have been a
welcome byproduct of his crusades against liberal orthodoxy. (The
Environmental Protection Agency salvo occurred after the agency
allowed members of same-sex relationships to receive family leave.)
</P>
<P>
   During six years in office, Barr hasn't simply marched into
difficult ideological battles others avoided, he has created them,
and brought home the results to a district that has generally
appreciated his bellicosity with two re-elections.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kahn, a wealthy businessman and a Democrat, is hoping
that voters have finally begun to tire of Barr's whirling fury, and
is spending his own money freely to mount the most significant
challenge Barr has yet faced.
</P>
<P>
   But Barr is far from shying away from his record. While many
national Republicans are reluctant to utter the word
``impeachment,'' Barr is proud of his role as an impeachment
manager and designated antagonist of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district was very clearly in support of the impeachment
effort, and remained very clear in support during the entire
process,'' Barr said in a recent interview. ``People would stop me
in the airport, stop me in the grocery store, the gas station,
writing and faxing in, all in encouragement. In fact, the most
consistent thing I hear from the people in the 7th District is,
don't change.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 7th District, which stretches from the western suburbs
of Atlanta to the Alabama state line, is not quite the same solidly
conservative turf that first elected Barr as part of the 1994
Republican revolution. Atlanta's continued growth has brought to
the district a steady stream of newcomers who may be mostly
registered Republicans, but who may not always as passionately
right-of-center as is their current representative.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, did well here in 1998 _ Barnes
lives in the district and represented a portion of it as a Democrat
in the state's General Assembly before moving to the governor's
mansion. And the state representative from Barr's hometown of
Smyrna in Cobb County recently switched from the Republican party
to become a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's winning percentage slipped from 58 percent in 1996 to 55
percent in 1998; his little-known opponent that year spent only
$14,000 but got 45 percent of the vote and almost carried suburban
Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barr probably viewed his district as safer than it
was, and he got a scare,'' said Charles Bullock, a political
scientist at the University of Georgia. ``I wouldn't bet against
him, but he's such a polarizer that he always attracts opposition,
and when they're credible, the contests can be reasonably close.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, a former liquor distributor who owns a company that
broadcasts PGA golf tournaments on radio, took a look at the 1998
numbers and decided Barr was vulnerable. He moved back to Georgia
from Florida, where he had retired, bought a cattle farm in the
northern part of the district, and began organizing a challenge,
though he has no campaign experience.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kahn has lent $1.1 million to his own campaign and
raised another $800,000, much of which he has spent on television
advertisements that have run all summer during a primary campaign
that raised his visibility.
</P>
<P>
   In advertisements and speeches, Kahn, 54, depicts himself as a
conservative businessman considerably to the right of Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore, one who strongly supports education reform
and gun rights, a touchstone in the district _ Barr is a member
serving on the board of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn has said he does not know whether he would have voted to
impeach Clinton, and criticizes Barr not so much for the content of
Barr's crusades, but, Kahn said, for their quixotism, and the time
they take from the district's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has his own personal agenda, and it brings nothing to the
7th District,'' Kahn said recently. ``He was so focused on getting
rid of witchcraft at Ft. Hood, but that same week, Lockheed
announced 2,800 job cuts in Marietta. That's where he should have
been focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, 51, responded that he tried to eliminate the practice of
witchcraft at the Texas army base because a constituent complained
about it, just as another voter's concerns led him to introduce the
Defense of Marriage Act, a bill that allowed states to refuse
recognition of same-sex marriages, which was signed by President
Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said Kahn seemed to be suggesting government interference
in Lockheed Martin, the aerospace company that is a major employer
in the region, and that stance proves Kahn is a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he favors government control of business, then he's clearly
not a conservative, so he must be a liberal,'' said Barr. ``That
would be very consistent with his intention of voting for Al Gore
and accepting money from abortion groups. Now that I think about
it, he's definitely a liberal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last Saturday afternoon, at a fund-raising barbecue in the
western part of the district where Barr appeared with Lt. Col.
Oliver North, Barr began referring to Kahn as a ``carpetbagger
liquor dealer from Buckhead,'' referring to the exclusive Atlanta
residential district where Kahn used to live.
</P>
<P>
   While Kahn may seem a bit uncomfortable in the weekend-farmer
outfits he wears in his advertisements, he has purported to have a
somewhat stronger claim to the South as an Atlanta native. Barr was
born in Iowa City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But the exchange does indicate that the race is likely to get
more personal in the weeks ahead, especially once Barr's own
television advertisements begin running in mid-October. Barr has
raised about $2.3 million, a third of which came from outside
Georgia. And Barr tends to run his campaigns with the same
cannonball fervor of his congressional life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind a good fight at all,'' Barr said. ``I have a
responsibility to stand up for certain things, and the other side,
they just resent anyone who stands up to the liberal agenda. Well,
I'm certainly not going to back down now.''

FOR SOME, FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FULFILLS A LONGING TO ADOPT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  NEW YORK _ In a windowless room on the eighth floor of a Manhattan
office building, a pair of photo albums are passed around one
recent evening. On page after page, artful portraits of boys and
girls stare up, some smiling solo at the camera, some draping their
arms around a brother, a sister.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The faces are achingly familiar, for they are the famously
hard-to-adopt foster children in the city's custody, many of them
older, some of them with physical or emotional problems, all of
them legally severed from their birth parents but lacking adoptive
homes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser known are the faces assembled around the table,
wordlessly poring over the pages of these so-called family albums.
</P>
<P>
   As wealthier childless New Yorkers turn increasingly to costly
private adoptions, often circling the globe for an orphan to bring
home, these are the New Yorkers willing to adopt the city children
that few seem to want: the New York schoolteacher itching to be a
mother for the first time; the childless couple waiting for
something to call out from one of these pages; the upstate parents
who no longer want to take in foster children, only to have to
return them some years later.
</P>
<P>
   Economics has something to do with their choices. None of them
can afford private adoption, which can easily run up to $20,000.
Adoptions from the foster care system are subsidized, offering $500
to $1,200 a month per child, depending on medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   But money is only part of it, they say. Like Ada Jurado, 48, who
has taken in several foster children over the years, many who wish
to adopt say they are driven by conscience to adopt locally.
</P>
<P>
   Jurado, a school safety monitor in Middletown, N.Y. says she was
driven in part by the memory of her own mother, who raised seven
children and took in a stranger's child as well. The mother of her
husband, Juan, also raised children other than her own. So now,
with two teen-age daughters moving out of the family's sprawling
suburban home in a few years, Jurado said she felt a sense of
obligation to a child without a home. ``I have room now,'' she
said. ``It's like wanting to give back.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Jurado is emblematic of those who adopt the city's
foster children: mostly middle-aged women who used to be foster
parents, according to a study of city adoptions by Trudy B.
Festinger, a social work professor at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 3,820 foster children were adopted in New York City,
and two-thirds of the people who adopted them were single parents,
mostly mothers. Their median age was 51; fathers had a median age
of 52. Half of the adoptive parents were the very foster parents _
including relatives _ who took the children into their care early
on.
</P>
<P>
   The city has had some success in adoptions in recent years, with
the number of completed adoptions climbing from 1,130 in the 1990
fiscal year to a peak of 4,000 in 1997 and then dipping to 3,100 in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, pressed by the new adoption law and financial
incentives offered by the Clinton administration, adoptions have
increased noticeably. According to figures released by the
Department of Health and Human Services this week, adoptions rose
nationwide to 46,000 in the 1999 fiscal year, from 28,000 in 1996.
The federal agency has granted financial rewards to states that
have increased their adoption numbers; New York was not a recipient
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The waits for the city's children are still typically quite
long. According to Festinger's analysis, New York City children who
were adopted in 1998 came into foster care at a median age of 4.4
months, were freed for adoption at 5.6 years old, and were not
adopted until a median age of 8.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such waits in turn can make public adoptions virtually
impossible for those who want to take in a baby. That is what
Patricia, a school paraprofessional, hoped for at first, a baby
that she and her husband of 19 years could raise from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   She does not know anyone who has gone through the private or
international adoption networks, but heard only that they are
prohibitively expensive. She has heard, too, about the sad,
troubled lives of foster children, and seen them firsthand in the
public school system.
</P>
<P>
   But at 44, having all but given up hopes to bear a child, she
has turned to that system anyway. She says that she would now be
happy to have a toddler, the younger the better. ``My husband and I
don't have any children of our own,'' said Patricia, who agreed to
reveal the details of her search for a child on the condition that
her last name be withheld. ``We wanted a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reasons seem about as selfish and selfless as those of
anyone who wants children. ``I would like to take that
responsibility,'' she added, ``try to train children to be able to
contribute to society, to God. I'd really love that. Aside from the
love and sharing and all that, I'd really love that.''

`CHUNHYANG': FRESH USE OF THE FABLE FORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parts of Im Kwon-taek's ``Chunhyang'' have the
enormous and verdant sweep of a fairy tale, complete with the
horrific turns of plot that pound at the heart of unexpurgated
versions of folk stories. This master Korean director, who has made
more than 90 films, uses the blush of ardor to warm the tale's
familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   When the picture shifts into a love story and Chunhyang (Lee
Hyo-jung), the daughter of a prostitute, and the spoiled and
doll-faced Mongryong (Cho Seung-woo), the son of the governor, lock
eyes for the first time, he pays homage to the corniest of romances
as well as the feelings that such stories can evoke. Im knows that
we all want to believe, because it's clear that he does himself. He
toys with the usual conventions of the eager ingenue finding true
love by introducing the governor's son as if he were the heroine
and focal point of the film, lingering over Cho's unlined and
untroubled face.
</P>
<P>
   This year several filmmakers have used this form _ the fable _
as the basis of their movies, but ``Chunhyang'' isn't immersed in
the kind of decorative smugness that lets movie audiences in on the
joke. Instead the story is freshened through the use of a Korean
singing storyteller, a pansori singer, to provide a narration,
belting out the song from a stage in front of an audience. The
pansori, or song, is performed under a proscenium arch to highlight
the ritual elements of folk tales. Even though much of what the
pansori tells us unfolds before the cameras at the same moment, the
forcefulness of the performance lends another layer of feeling to
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The device is a worthy addition, because Im makes the delivery
of the song as integral to ``Chunhyang'' as the story itself, and
it's a neat trick to involve the audience in such a way.
Self-awareness here isn't a cheap gambit, a way for the director to
have his tongue lounge in the hollows of his cheek. The
extravagance of the sets and costumes increases the theatricality;
``Chunhyang'' is an almost childlike delight for the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is at its best when the lovers are playing with each
other and intoxicated by the newness of their flesh. ``Chunhyang''
is most effective in moments when Im lets his cast find the truth
in the individual scenes, because the story's predictability won't
be lost even on the very young. He also uses ``Chunhyang'' as a way
to comment on the ubiquity of legend, paying homage to the West by
showing a fleeting image of Judy Garland, her eyes as wide as
hubcaps and silently pleading for the transformative magnificence
of love. His attachment to pure emotion does a lot for the picture.
