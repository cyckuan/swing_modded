GRANDMOTHER CAPTURED NAZISM IN HER LENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A distinct genre has grown up along with the children and
grandchildren of the Holocaust's Jewish survivors and victims.
Grappling with a past that is both painfully immediate yet forever
beyond their reach, they have created family memoirs that range
from extraordinary to sincere but ineffectual. What makes Lisa
Lewenz's film ``A Letter Without Words, '' to be seen Monday night
on PBS stations, so exceptional and gripping is the rare cache of
films her German-Jewish grandmother left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ella Lewenz was a well-off wife, mother and amateur filmmaker
who for most of her adult life documented everything from family
gatherings in the backyard to traffic on the streets of Berlin.
Relying heavily on these priceless first-hand visions of life in
Germany before and during Hitler's rise, Ms. Lewenz has created an
eloquent hourlong film, illustrating how one person has
reconstructed and absorbed her ancestral past.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ella's films are sharply focused, well-composed,
black-and-white images, though one scratchy bit of film shows
Albert Einstein, a family friend, walking in a park. Later, in a
burst of color, she captures bright red banners with swastikas
hanging from windows everywhere. And in one chilling scene she
turns off the camera abruptly when an SS officer looks her way; by
then such amateur filmmaking had been banned. After the Lewenz
family fled Germany in the late 1930s, Ella chronicled her life in
New York, including the bright balloons in the Thanksgiving Day
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ella's films are the heart of this documentary, its frame
is Lisa's search for her family heritage. Her father, Ella's son,
converted to Christianity when he began a new life in the United
States, and Lisa did not know of his Jewish roots until she was 13.
Her own narrative voice adds a distinctly nonprofessional tone, and
at first her words are cliched. ``In 1981 I found a Pandora's
Box,'' she says of her grandmother's films, which had been stored
away for decades. But like Ella's films, her granddaughter's work
is a home movie in the best sense; they share an immediacy that is
the essence of their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   After Ella's films resurfaced, diaries and letters also began to
appear, allowing Lisa to fill in her grandmother's story. An
off-camera voice reads from her diary the day before Germany's
defeat in World War I: ``Nov. 10th, Sunday. Packed jewelry for
possible flight.'' Lisa interviews two of her aunts, Ella's
surviving daughters, and she travels to Berlin, where she films
some of the same scenes her grandmother did, layering them to
create a pentimento effect. All these elements flow together
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling turn Ms. Lewenz plays an audiotape her father
left, and which she heard only after his death. He says he regrets
turning his back on his Jewish identity; his daughter's passionate
but nonjudgmental film restores it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as much as she has learned about Ella, she admits at the
end, ``She seems elusive even today.'' Such honesty is at the core
of ``A Letter Without Words,'' which becomes more compelling as it
goes along, more powerfully concerned with the enigmas of
personality and history.  &QL;

SHRIMP DISCOVERED ON RUNWAYS MAY BE RELOCATED
</HEADLINE>

BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everybody knows the players in the proposed Los
Angeles International Airport expansion: the backers of the $12
billion enterprise vs. a regional alliance of local governments and
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, enter the fairy shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in the soil and pools of water at the southwestern end of
the runways, these federally listed endangered Riverside fairy
shrimp, also known as (italics) Streptocephalus woottoni (end
italics), have quietly become a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   With eggs, or cysts, so small that researchers working on the
LAX master plan's environmental impact report had to use an
electron microscope to positively identify them, the fairy shrimp
probably will have to be relocated if the expansion moves forward,
said Philip Depoian, Los Angeles World Airports deputy executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated moving bill: about $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Such do the best laid plans of shrimp and men sometimes go awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is to eliminate this problem so it
doesn't get caught up formally in the master plan process. Then the
FAA would have to jump through a whole other series of hurdles,''
said Depoian.
</P>
<P>
   Planning could get even more scrambled, complex and expensive if
the Los Angeles World Airports, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
and the Federal Aviation Administration don't come to an agreement
soon on where their future home should be.
</P>
<P>
   That's because if the shrimp manage to officially squirm into
the environmental impact report, due out at the end of the year, a
whole new layer of federal laws dealing with endangered species
will automatically kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the federal Endangered Species Act passed in the
1970s, with its civil and criminal penalty provisions, Fish and
Wildlife Service officials said the fairy shrimp create a
considerable challenge for LAX.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have a problem and they should take it very
seriously,'' said John Bradley, Fish and Wildlife Service
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   Federal scientists noticed the shrimp habitat early last year
while examining another endangered species' habitat, that of the El
Segundo blue butterfly, located in the nearby dunes.
</P>
<P>
   What caught their attention was a series of vernal pools, or
indentations that fill with rainwater but then dry out for much of
the year. The fairy shrimp cysts hatch in the water, grow to about
the size of a fingernail, lay their eggs and then die when the
pools dry up.
</P>
<P>
   Once a common feature of the Los Angeles Basin, the vernal pools
have largely been destroyed by development, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists would prefer that the airport leave the
shrimp where they are, but ultimately might agree to their
transport elsewhere in the county _ the closer to their existing
home, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to look at avoidance first,'' Bradley said. ``If
that's totally impossible, and they have to have good reasons that
they can explain to the public, then the next thing is to try to
restore some existing, but degraded habitat elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Depoian said the LAX vernal pools have to go, because they serve
as feeders for birds _ the nemesis of jetliners and small aircraft.
He said a recent slight increase in plane-bird collisions at LAX
has the airport and the FAA concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the innocent in between two federal agencies,'' Depoian
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said he doesn't buy the bird theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vernal pools around other airports,'' he said. ``I
think it's a specious argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Depoian said the shrimp cyst-filled earth could be moved to
other fairy shrimp preserves, of which there are about a half dozen
in neighboring Riverside and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said that would defeat the goal of ``biodiversity,''
or the spreading out of species, and that therefore a habitat in
Los Angeles County would be preferred.
</P>
<P>
   The fairy shrimp are among eight shrimp species listed by either
the state or federal governments as threatened or endangered; in
other words, facing possible extinction.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the shrimp got to LAX, though they may have
been carried there in soil sticking to birds' feet.
</P>
<P>
   LAX officials, who are behind schedule on the master plan
largely because of new air quality regulations, said they'll do
whatever it takes to take care of the shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an endangered species,'' Depoian said. ``They don't
have to have a face; they don't have to be cute and fuzzy.''

COSTNER GETS CHEERS, ANGELS GET WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Edison Field became a field of dreams Sunday,
as the Anaheim Angels hosted Cal State Fullerton and Titans alumnus
Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   With the serious business of roster decisions _ including one to
put Jim Edmonds on the disabled list _ completed late Saturday
night, the Angels and fifth-ranked Titans enjoyed a spring day in
the park.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels defeated Fullerton 2-1, but the outcome mattered
little to the crowd of 17,745 who were admitted free and cheered
Costner's every move.
</P>
<P>
   Costner played 72/3 innings at shortstop before striking out Jeb
Daugherty looking in the bottom of the eighth. In the spirit of the
day, the Angels were allowed an extra hitter and Costner got
Anaheim manager Terry Collins to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a serious side to Sunday's game as well. Chuck
Finley and Omar Olivares got in some much needed work. Finley
pitched 51/3 innings for the Angels, striking out seven and
allowing only one unearned run. Olivares pitched four shutout
innings for Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck threw great and the big thing was that he got to the
90-pitch mark,'' said Collins of Finley, whose last start ended in
the first inning, when he was hit on the left arm by a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of spring training is to get pitchers ready. We
needed the game, and I appreciate (Fullerton coach) George (Horton)
taking the time to play us. They didn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing it safe: Edmonds has been sidelined with a right groin
injury and an irritated right shoulder, and the Angels decided they
would take no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy felt with a couple of more days of rest he could play,
but it just doesn't work that way,'' said Collins of Edmonds
jumping back into the lineup after a lengthy absence. ``I don't
want to lose him for a month. Before this guy takes the field he
has to be able to play Jim Edmonds baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Season starters: The Angels will keep only four outfielders, six
infielders and 12 pitchers to begin the season.
</P>
<P>
   With Edmonds starting on the DL and Collins concerned about
Finley's early-season endurance, the Angels optioned first-baseman
Chris Pritchett to Vancouver and kept Tim Unroe, who can play the
infield and outfield as can Jeff Huson.
</P>
<P>
   Called up to be the team's 12th pitcher was young left-hander
Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   More on game's ``star'': Costner made two nice plays Sunday at
shortstop, including a backhanded stop and long throw to get
Charlie O'Brien. But the ``Field of Dreams'' star did drop a pop up
that led to the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, Costner was 0 for 3. Finley blew him down on
strikes in the third inning and he grounded out twice.
</P>
<P>
   Greene pastures: Todd Greene, who will open the season as the
Angels' DH, greeted Fullerton's Barry Hawkins with a booming
first-pitch home run in the fifth inning to tie it 1-1.

HEY, WHAT'S FOR LUNCH AT L.A. SCHOOLS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Staring at a half-eaten heap of chicken nuggets,
Byrd Middle School student Deisy Murillo is on the front line of
the L.A. school district's battle for the minds and stomachs of
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always give us the same food,'' 14-year-old Deisy sighed.
``I just get bored with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal order to cut fat and boost nutrition, the Los
Angeles Unified School District and other school systems are
engaged in a daily struggle to balance food that is good for
students with what students think is good food.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles,
recently found that more than 50 percent of kids in 14 Los Angeles
public schools are obese. Charlotte Neumann, a professor who
conducted the study, said the culprit seems to be bad eating habits
at home _ and fast food.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the high fat and calories and salt come from,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the school district allow high schools to serve
Subway sandwiches and Pizza Hut pizzas? School officials say it is
their best chance of keeping kids on campus, where there is at
least a chance to control what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some wonder whether selling fast food undercuts school
efforts to teach kids how to eat right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're caught in a tough bind here,'' said Phil Shanholtzer,
spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ``They want to
serve nutritious meals, and they want to give students something
they like, because they need to maintain their customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Many schools nationwide serve fast food, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the district's own menu for 700,000 meals a day adheres to
federal nutrition guidelines, brand-name sandwiches and pizzas need
not meet the same standards. And to complicate matters, many
schools sell chips and candy in their student stores.
</P>
<P>
   By offering fast food and candy, schools may be inviting in the
same culprits that are already harming the health of many children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're to teach the kids proper dietary habits, and if we
say you can't smoke on campus because it's bad for you, shouldn't
we have healthier food?'' said Byrd Principal Gerry Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   School officials argue that if they can keep students in the
habit of staying on campus for lunch, they have a greater chance of
giving them a healthy meal. And even a serving from Pizza Hut won't
necessarily throw the whole week's nutritional balance out of
whack, said Laura M. Chinnock, senior nutrition specialist at the
district's Newman Nutrition Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they combine it with the other items served, it would
probably be OK,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrees are balanced with pieces of fruit and vegetables, more
than the federal government requires.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, once kids grab their meals in the lunch line,
they can toss anything they don't like. Fruit and vegetables often
end up in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``On many days, we'll pick up buckets of fruit,'' said Carlu
Hermann of Chatsworth, who volunteers as a monitor at Germain
Street elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann estimates 75 percent of the school's kids won't even
open packets of fruit or vegetables, although they seem fascinated
with furry Kiwi fruit. ``It's a hassle to peel something,'' she
said. ``It's easier to grab that chalupa and eat it. It's easier to
pick up a McNugget.''
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest son, Mark, a fifth-grader at Germain, has a simple
explanation for why he and his peers ditch the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like how it tastes,'' said Mark, 11.
</P>
<P>
   He would prefer a sack lunch. ``That way I get to pick what I
want,'' he said, adding that he would like to fill a sack with food
from Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments lie behind the district's decision to include
some fast food in high school cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight students' preferences, district nutritionists
tinker with popular foods to make them healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza is made with low-fat crust and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The raw meat that becomes school hamburgers has to meet
guidelines on the proportion of fat, Chinnock said.
</P>
<P>
   While not knowing exactly how school nutritionists watch fat
content, Deisy and her friends were not surprised that they do. She
reluctantly said she'd probably take a school lunch over a burger
from a fast-food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, we'd get fat,'' she said. ``And we want to be
skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Los Angeles schools are ahead of the curve in the
battle for student stomachs. While the latest federal nutrition
guidelines became mandatory at the start of this school year, the
school district actually adopted them several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No more than 30 percent of calories in a week's meals can come
from fat, and no more than 10 percent from saturated fat. Violating
those rules could jeopardize the $161 million the district receives
in state and federal funding for food each year.
</P>
<P>
   Testing recipes at the district's central kitchen in East Los
Angeles, nutritionists constantly search for ways to trick kids
into eating healthy meals. Chocolate chip cookies are made largely
from prune paste. Lean turkey masquerades as beef.
</P>
<P>
   But in balancing the 700,000 meals served each day, the
district's food service specialists run smack into the same problem
parents constantly face _ the whims of children's taste.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids hate fish, Chinnock said. If something looks weird to
them, such as creamed spinach, they won't touch it. Finger food,
especially for small children, seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   Field testing offers some clues. ``We'll put it on the menu,''
she said, ``go to the school, stand by the trash and see what they
throw away.''

AMAZING OUTCOME TYPICAL OF ATYPICAL NBA SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A team of basketball scientists, working 24/7 for a
month, could not explain Sunday's outcome at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an NBA schedule made by Bart Simpson, the Houston
Rockets had been living in town long enough to meet state voting
requirements. The Sonics, meanwhile, were playing their sixth game
in eight days, and the first one at home in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had been a good team getting better, evidenced by
nine wins in their past 10 games. The Sonics had been a decent team
going bad, evidenced by seven losses in their past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have a style, a direction and a purpose. The Sonics
make kindergarten recess look like a parade march at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? A 101-84 Sonic win that made sense in only in
that it made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   That means it was a fine metaphor for an NBA regular season so
haywire that almost nothing resonates from one day to the next. The
compressed schedule, the slapdash rosters and the Butterbean
lookalikes passing for pro basketball players have rendered this
exercise as disingenuous as a Bill Clinton affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of presidents ... read my typewritten lips: This
regular season will forecast almost nothing about playoff outcomes.
More weird creatures will emerge from this silliness than next
month's new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Rockets, who have three of the NBA's 50 greatest
players, were beaten mainly by the 19 points of Sonic backup point
guard John Crotty.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to Mr. and Mrs. Crotty, who raised a fine child, but
winning behind the young man is like winning a Pier Six brawl
because Bluto gets a paper cut.
</P>
<P>
   A waiver-wire pickup from the overstuffed Portland Trail
Blazers, Crotty, in seven previous games as a Sonic, scored 25
points. Then in one game, he nearly doubled his season total. Sonic
coach Paul Westphal could coach 10,000 more NBA games and never get
this same result.
</P>
<P>
   How Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen let this
happen is a sports mystery that ranks with the continual granting
of a boxing promoter's license to Don King.
</P>
<P>
   As Barkley put it dryly: ``Giving him 19 in half (actually 14)
was not in our game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads were being scratched so much in the Rocket quarters that
scalp divots were visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe we didn't have that edge against these
guys,'' said Rudy Tomjanovich, the bewildered Rockets coach. ``I
wish I had an answer for why we came out soft and non-aggressive
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich wasn't intending to put down the Sonics, but he,
too, had to figure the Sonics for pulp after a 1-4 road trip
smashed into six semi-horrifying days. Instead the Sonics played
with the kind of energy and poise that were utterly absent in their
last NBC national TV appearance _ a 104-87 embarrassment exactly a
week ago in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of that game, the Sonics were as pulseless
as the Rockets were in the opening period. Both teams were equally
without reasons for the rigor mortis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do anything in the first half,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Give (the Sonics) credit, yeah, but it seemed like when there was
a loose ball, our guys bumped heads.''
</P>
<P>
   A more fitting word picture for this season has yet to be drawn.
But it isn't just the Rockets. The Sonics have been even more
buffoonish, and they're better than at least half the teams in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos extends into coaching. Sunday, Westphal went to his
ninth different starting lineup in 32 games, inserting backup
center Aaron Williams into the power forward spot, while Hersey
Hawkins returned again to start in place of Billy Owens, who sat
out again with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this particular lineup had no more influence on the outcome
than stock prices have on the tides. Williams had nine points and
seven rebounds in 16 minutes, and Hawkins made four field goals,
production that each could have had from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   A look around the league suggests that many teams are similarly
vexed. The Indiana Pacers can't win close games, the Miami Heat
suddenly can't win anything, the Utah Jazz have been in a downward
spiral and the Los Angeles Lakers are one thrown chair from a full
Jerry Springer show (``Freakazoid forward: Can't live with him,
can't live without him!'').
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the trendy NBA darlings, the Trail Blazers,
haven't gotten beyond the playoffs' first round practically since
Bill Walton wore a ponytail. Until they do, and until Isaiah Rider
doesn't need a bail bondsman on 24-hour call, don't speak of them
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, for all the talk of their rise and their stars, are
using an all-rookie starting backcourt of Michael Dickerson and
Cuttino Mobley _ a charade that was exposed embarrassingly. They
well may be good NBA players, but not now, and not next month when
the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   There is no explaining this NBA season. And there is precious
little enjoyment of it, unless you're a fan of bonking heads and
24-percent free throw shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Given the flatness of the competition, the rise in popularity of
pro rasslin is beginning to make sense.

SOME DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, BURNED ONCE, ARE WARY OF FLORIO'S SENATE
BID 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELLMAWR, N.J. _ ``Here he is,'' bellowed the local party
chairman above the raucous crowd of nearly 400 Democratic Party
regulars packed into the fire hall. ``Here is New Jersey's pride _
New Jersey's next United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Jim Florio and his wife, Lucinda, barreled through
white frosted-glass doors, as the crowd erupted. The former
governor made his way to the stage, grabbing outstretched hands,
blowing kisses to old friends and embracing supporters from 16 past
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after voters threw him out of the New Jersey State
House and elected Christie Whitman, a Republican, Jim Florio is
trying to make a political comeback. He is running for the
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated next
year by Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   But as popular as he is here in his base, the southern part of
the state, Florio is having difficulty building support elsewhere
for his candidacy. And the biggest threat comes not from Whitman,
who is also considering making a bid for the Senate seat, but from
leaders within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Many party leaders from northern and central New Jersey shudder
at the prospect of seeing his name on a ballot next year and a
possible rematch with Whitman. Some are even courting other
potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that he has a certain amount of baggage,'' said
Joseph C. Spicuzzo, Middlesex County's sheriff and Democratic Party
chairman. ``He is very popular down south, but the majority of
Democratic leaders in the state have not come out and endorsed
anyone yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Florio is that party leaders are worried that
voters may have lingering memories of his tax increase. Almost a
decade ago, Florio inspired a statewide tax revolt after ramming a
$2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature to meet a court
order demanding more state money for urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, Democrats lost control of the Legislature, and
in 1993 Florio became the first governor in modern history to lose
a second term in a general election. As a result, many Democrats
worry that a Florio campaign could reignite voter anger over the
tax increase and damage the chances of other Democrats, including
the candidate for president on the ticket next year.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Raymond J. Lesniak, an Elizabeth Democrat, said that
while he did not belong to the ``stop-Jim-Florio-at-any-cost
school,'' the party needed to consider other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have better candidates, and I am not ready to hand
over the nomination to Jim Florio,'' said Lesniak, the Democratic
leader in Union County. ``The tax issue is a real concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who has been practicing law since he left office,
insists that he is in the race to stay, whether or not he wins the
backing of the party leaders elsewhere around the state. He has
moved quickly to demonstrate his strength in recent weeks, lining
up two major Democratic fund-raisers and endorsements from nine
county chairmen, mostly from southern New Jersey, where he
represented Camden County in the State Legislature and Congress for
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says that the last few years have softened him a bit
and made him more empathetic to voter concerns, Florio remains very
much the former Navy boxer. Even his opponents acknowledge that he
would be tough to beat in a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not troubled entering the contest, why should they
be?'' he asked as he sipped tea over breakfast. ``Anybody who wants
to run in the Democratic primary should be out there. Tell us what
you think. Tell us what you stand for. And then let the people in
the state _ north, south, central, by area codes, whatever _
decide. I don't have any problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio, 61, has spent all but the last five years of his working
life in politics. He has run for governor four times, winning once,
losing one primary battle and losing two of the closest general
elections in the state's history, including his 1993 re-election
campaign. Whitman's last-minute pledge to cut taxes helped her come
from behind and beat Florio by 26,000 votes out of 2.5 million
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Florio dismisses talk that his 1990 tax increase would hurt his
prospects or the chances of any other Democratic candidates on the
ballot. He defends the tax increase but acknowledges that he did
not properly reach out to voters and explain why it was necessary
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he did not view a possible matchup with
Whitman as a replay of the 1993 gubernatorial campaign, because
Whitman did not have a record then. Now, he said, she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any difficulties with the idea that we had to
fund our schools,'' he said. ``You have to balance the budget. I
think it is interesting that people are bragging now about a $700
million surplus. I came into office with a $600 million deficit,
went through the worst recession since the Great Depression, and
finished my administration with a $400 million surplus. And now,
after these six or seven years of unprecedented prosperity, you're
only talking about a $700 million surplus?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes to pass,'' he said, ``it will almost become an
ideal opportunity for people in this state to contrast dramatically
different individuals, styles, philosophies, backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is seeking vindication or redemption, as some of his
critics have suggested, he replied: ``Redemption is going to
heaven. I'm talking about the Senate. I am very confident. Maybe
too confident. I have a sufficient amount of self-esteem so that I
don't have to prove anything to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned in February that Lautenberg would not seek
re-election, he said he jumped at the chance to get back into the
arena because he believes he can address the public's concerns over
health care, Social Security and education.

NO NETS TAKEDOWN FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ We were told to wait until the home games. Then, things
would turn around. Someone obviously forgot to mention that the
home games would be next year. This year, they are proving to be an
ongoing disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets have won twice on the road all season. Both
wins have come in the FleetCenter. Sunday, with a roster only a CBA
coach could love, Jersey dominated Next Year's Playoff Team, a.k.a.
the 1999 Celtics, with an easy 91-79 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the sixth straight at home for Rick Pitino's
beleaguered boys, who were booed again for their overall,
underwater performance. The franchise record of seven straight home
losses, set in the halcyon days of M.L. Carr and Chris Ford not too
long ago, is on the line Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Celtics play in
Orlando Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was this one? Well, the Nets were 7-24 entering the game
and, at one point, had three guys on 10-day contracts on the floor.
They still won with ridiculous ease. Lucious Harris played 15
minutes and had as many baskets (five) as Ron Mercer and Paul
Pierce, who combined for 72 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Boston shot 37.5 percent, its third-lowest percentage of the
season, and turned it over 23 times, second worst of the season. It
had only 12 assists, a season low. For the second straight Sunday,
the Celtics never led. But this wasn't the Pacers. It was the Nets
of William Cunningham, Jamie Fieck, Mark Hendrickson, and four
pretty good players named Keith Van Horn, Stephon Marbury, Kerry
Kittles, and Kendall Gill. They were all the Celtics could handle.
</P>
<P>
   In their six straight home losses, the Celtics have held no
leads in two games, have led by only 2 points in two others, and by
7 in the other two. Put another way, in the last 24 quarters of
basketball in the FleetCenter, and one overtime period, a span of
293 minutes, the Celtics have not led by as many as 8 points. The
average margin of defeat in those games is 9.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino actually said he liked his team's effort until things got
out of hand in the fourth quarter. That's a bit like saying you
thought ``Saving Private Ryan'' was easy on the eyes and stomach if
you missed the Omaha Beach stretch. But that does not translate
into him liking the result. He says he will be Mr. Mellow the rest
of the way, all the while salivating at the prospect of next
season, his goal for the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me a lot,'' the coach said. ``But yelling and
screaming is not going to do anything to turn it around. It's tough
for the fans, it's tough for you all, it's tough for me, it's tough
for the players. But, I'm committed to winning next year. We're
going to try as hard as we can this year. We're not going to make
the playoffs this year, but we'll give our effort.''
</P>
<P>
   There, does that make you feel better now? The Celtics are going
to try real hard for the rest of the season, including the final 12
at home. Presumably, that means the fans won't be shouting, ``We
want our money back,'' as they did Sunday. The Nets aren't going to
make the playoffs either and have lost key guys for the season,
including all their big men. They merely won for the third straight
time, elevating bon vivant interim coach Don Casey to 5-7 since he
took over for the jettisoned John Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we're looking at things,'' Casey said. ``We're
5-7.''
</P>
<P>
   They're also only two wins astern of the Celtics. Boston had
plenty of chances in this one, but hit every wall/land mine there
was. Antoine Walker had 32 points, matching his season high. But
Pierce bricked his first seven shots and was 1 for 10. Mercer was 4
for 12. The Celtics' bench, once again, was almost nonexistent,
scoring four baskets and 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   But it was still a game, theoretically, starting the fourth. The
Nets led by 7 (Boston had been within 4 in the final minute of the
third) and the Celtics opened the quarter with the ball. But Mercer
missed and Harris nailed a 16-footer to start a quarter-opening,
game-closing, stands-emptying, boo-inducing 10-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics shot 3 for 20 in the fourth, looking like the Swiss
marathoner who stumbled home in the 1984 Olympics. They missed 15
of their first 16 shots, including an uncontested dunk by Walter
McCarty. The 10-0 Jersey run blew the lead to 17 and the Celtics
needed a 6-0 run in the final 1:43 to finish only a dozen points in
arrears.

M'S PAYING FOR AYALA TO PITCH ELSEWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With opening day upon them and the club desperate to
eliminate any lingering stink from last season, the Mariners got it
right _ for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ayala was not only banished from Seattle, the Mariners
sent him across the continent (ITAL) and (END ITAL) north of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the right-hander is an Expo, Ayala's only hope is that
any boos that come his way will be in the unfamiliar patois of the
native Quebecois in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Canada is about as far as Ayala needed to be from the
Mariners, which proves that some moves a ballclub makes are as much
for symbolism as for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   How much of Ayala's $1.8 million salary the Mariners are paying
the Expos to do them this huge favor is not a matter of public
record, but anything less than $1.5 million would fly in the face
of Expo tradition of maintaining baseball's lowest payroll.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Mariners are paying Ayala to pitch in
another city, another league, another country.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Mariners have money to spend on absolute
necessities, like getting rid of a pitcher who is hurting them,
which makes you wonder why they could not have paid to get a
pitcher who could actually help them.
</P>
<P>
   As themes go for the start of a new season, this certainly is
not one the Mariners want. Not when there is so much goodwill to
restore among their suspicious fans. Not when the club is boasting
better defense and better clutch hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played better this spring, we have a clubhouse that is a
lot more energetic and we're not reading in the newspaper every day
about what's happening with Randy Johnson,'' Jeff Fassero, Monday
night's opening day pitcher, said Sunday about the difference
between last year and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one distraction here. Not one person with any
contract problems. Everyone is happy with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the optimism of the season's start, but there was
serious talk about how the M's needed to bolster their rotation.
This winter, Woody Woodwardy, Mariners vice president of baseball
operations, wanted to go after Todd Stottlemyre or Tim Belcher, but
when Arizona and Anaheim offers were too high, the M's would not
play the free agent game.
</P>
<P>
   That fiscal restraint seemed penny-wise, pound foolish then. It
seems even more questionable now _ with Ayala gone, at a big price
_ why wasn't there money to throw at a pitcher who could bolster a
still-wonderful team populated with the likes of All-Stars Ken
Griffey, Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez, Jay Buhner and Dan Wilson?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have arrived on the threshold of 1999 with a
pitching staff that outside of Fassero, Jamie Moyer and Jose Mesa
could double for bubble-gum rockers Backstreet Boys. The combined
experience of six-tenths of the staff is fewer than 50 major league
baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they don't have Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, Bobby epitomized our past failures,'' Lou
Piniella said Sunday from his manager's office in the Kingdome
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some success here, but last year was just terrible. I
don't know what the response would have been here when he was
introduced (opening night), but it was clear that he was growing
more and more apprehensive as spring training came to a end.''
</P>
<P>
   This was most certainly a humanitarian act on the part of the
Mariners, who still like Ayala's arm and his forkball even though
he blew nine saves in '98 and became a lightning rod for Kingdome
rancor.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good deed on behalf of Ayala, who deserved a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be viewed as a good deed to the citizens of
Marinerville, whose late-innings' patience was worn so thin last
season that booing Ayala escalated to a sort of vicious art form.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, on the sick flip side of sports, sometimes the
crowd actually starts rooting for disaster. Another walk, another
blown save, another bullpen implosion.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, on everyone's part, but that's what happened last
season. And it started on Day One, when Ayala and his pen-mates
gave up four walks in the eighth inning and let a 9-6 lead over
Cleveland slip to a 10-9 loss, setting an awful tone for a
disappointing season that made the Kingdome a testy place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans have a right to voice their opinion, but by
the same token, I don't think they should boo the guy just for
walking to the bullpen or standing up,'' Fassero said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They boo him coming out to the mound, he throws three strikes
and then they cheer him. Where's the sense in that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners could not afford to have last year's scenario
repeated. Not when the Kingdome is getting its last baseball opener
and a new stadium looms to the south, waiting for a smiley-happy
bunch of fans to push through the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala is gone, at a price. The pitching staff is still a big
question, at what price we'll soon find out.

DAUBACH WIDE-EYED FOR OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It will not yet be dawn when the caravan
leaves the apple blossoms and peach trees of home, crosses the
Mississippi River near the great arch of nearby St. Louis, then
drives more than 200 miles across the breadth of Missouri for a day
so long in coming, no amount of tears will obscure the view.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else will have to deliver the mail Monday in Belleville,
Ill. Dale Daubach of the United States Postal Service has a date in
Kansas City, where he and his wife, Angie, family members, assorted
friends, and well-wishers will see for themselves that after nine
years of long hours and short paychecks in the minor leagues,
Opening Day finally has arrived for Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox are introduced Monday afternoon at Kauffman
Stadium before their season-opening game against the Kansas City
Royals, Dale Daubach and company will be in the stands when his son
Brian, No. 53 on the scorecard, will assemble on the same
third-base line as Nomar Garciaparra, Mike Stanley, and Jose
Offerman. If Daubach's face is not familiar, just look for the
uniform jersey fluttering from the heart beating so hard
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's going to be a little emotional,'' Daubach said
Sunday. ``I've been through enough. I think I've put in my time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of my grandparents are still living, and they told me
they wanted to see me in the big leagues before they pass away.''
</P>
<P>
   Step aside, Jimmy Connors, the tennis star anointed by Bud
Collins as the Brash Basher from Belleville. For at least a day,
there's a new favorite son in the town of 40,000 tucked away in the
southwestern corner of Illinois, and he bashes baseballs for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time ever in spring, Brian Daubach,
27-year-old rookie reserve for the Red Sox, has found a team that
believes he does it well enough to be in the big leagues. Even he
wasn't sure what to think when Jimy Williams summoned him last week
to tell him he was on the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy called me into his office,'' Daubach said. ``When a
manager calls you into his office, you never know what's going to
happen. I think that was the first time I've ever been called into
the office where it wasn't bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   It may last only as long as it takes Reggie Jefferson's back to
heal. But for now, Daubach has won a job as the team's lefthanded
pinch hitter, on the strength of a spring training performance in
which he batted .313 and had four home runs, two doubles, and a
triple among his 15 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'll stay here,'' Daubach said. ``They say the
hardest part is getting here. But as long as I'm here, I'm going to
have fun every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, a former 19th-round draft pick of the Mets who tore up
his knee in a pickup basketball game back home when he was barely
19, never made it to big-league camp with the Mets. He signed as a
minor league free agent with the Marlins in 1997, the year they
went to the World Series, and was among the team's first cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Even last year, when the Marlins were in the midst of
deconstructing their team, Daubach was dismissed with barely a
glance.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach went back to the minors last season, just as he has done
every year since 1990, in places like Kingsport and Pittsfield,
Binghamton and Norfolk. He'd thought about quitting just once, he
said, the year he was trying to come back from knee surgery and
also broke up with a longtime girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to continue riding the buses and stretching his thin
meal money summer after summer. Winters, he sold sporting goods and
took classes and, for a couple of weeks one year, worked
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, it all fell into place for Daubach on the field. In
Charlotte, playing for the Marlins' Triple A team, he batted .316
and led the International League in almost every slugging category,
including home runs (35) and RBIs (124). A line-drive hitter who
hit to all fields, Daubach said that he finally figured out how to
pull the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he was called up for a cameo appearance by the
Marlins. He hit a double off Curt Schilling of the Phillies. His
parents came to Atlanta to see him play, but he got in just one
game.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marlins let him go after the season, Daubach returned
to the Dominican Republic, where he played for the second straight
winter on a team managed by Sox coach Dave Jauss. He was on the
verge of taking a job playing in Japan, even if it meant going to
the minors over there, when Jauss pleaded with him to reconsider.
Daubach relented, he said, when Sox general manager Dan Duquette
called him in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We're going to give you at least a good look in
spring training,' '' Daubach said. ``That's all I've ever asked
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams gave him that look, and the Red Sox uniform he'll be
wearing Monday.

MOYER MAKING CONTRACT PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners and left-hander Jamie Moyer have made
significant progress toward a contract extension, and though
neither side wants to negotiate too far into the season, an
agreement could be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, the M's No. 2 starter, said negotiations are going too
well to call them off just because the season is starting. He is
optimistic about reaching a deal within a week if progress
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we've done our part and they've done their part,
and it's just a matter of finding out the finality of getting
something done to appease everybody,'' Moyer said. ``If we get to a
stalemate, then we won't worry about it. But I don't foresee that
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Moyer, who is in the last season of a
three-year, $6 million deal, had been hoping for a three-year
extension. The sides now are working on deals of two years or two
with an option, believed to be worth between $4 million and $7
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to go in the three-year direction, but I
kind of understand their situation and where they're coming from,''
Moyer said. ``Any contract negotiation, whether it's one year, two
or five, I think both sides have to give. And I think both sides
here are moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, the M's vice president for baseball operations,
said he also won't let the opening of the season stifle positive
contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to negotiate into the year; we need to
concentrate on getting the season started,'' he said. ``(But) if
there's good progress being made, we'll take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The club is not close to extensions with the other players it
was hoping to sign by opening day, left-hander Jeff Fassero and
first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, who will not negotiate during the season, was seeking a
four-year contract and said he was willing to go well below market
value for it. The Mariners have stuck to a three-year offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that (because of) one year, they didn't want to
get it done,'' said the 32-year-old Segui, who is in the last year
of a two-year, $4.75 million deal. ``They know where we stand. If
they want to get it done, we'll get it done. If they don't, there's
no hard feelings, I'll go somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 choice is to stay here, but I would never be
unreasonable. I'm tired of signing bad deals. I just want what I'm
worth in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero and the Mariners have not had contract talks in two
weeks. In fact, ``There hasn't been any hard negotiating,'' Fassero
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Moyer, Fassero is 36 and could be seeking a three-year
deal. He doesn't want to think about his contract during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd rule out negotiating (during the
season),'' Fassero said. ``I just don't want to be on the phone
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who is in the final year of a deal that will pay him
$4.75 million this year, never has been a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might be fun,'' he said. ``But it definitely is fair to say
I'd like to finish my career here.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Segui landed with the rest of the Mariners at
4:30 a.m. Sunday. But unlike the remainder of the team, which slept
off a weekend in Las Vegas, Segui headed to the Kingdome for an
hourlong workout on his back, chest and triceps. ``Those other guys
are lazy,'' he joked. Segui isn't much on gambling, but he did use
the Vegas excursion to change his hair color from silver to blond.
... Right-hander Ken Cloude threw five innings against the M's
Class AA team in Peoria, Ariz., Sunday and will start again for
Class AAA Tacoma on Friday. He will be on pace to start next
Wednesday against Texas if needed. ``He threw the ball very well
today,'' said farm director Benny Looper. ``He worked on his
changeup a lot, and that's a good pitch he needs to develop.'' ...
Looper said 19-year-old phenom Ryan Anderson will start at Class AA
New Haven _ a level higher than first thought _ but another top
pitching prospect, right-hander Cha Sueng Baek, remains in Korea
with visa problems. ... Here's Woodward's scouting report on
right-hander Jimmy Turman, the 23-year-old Class A right-hander
acquired from Montreal Saturday for reliever Bobby Ayala: ``He's
got to develop a lot, and that's what we're taking a shot at. If he
does, then he's going to be real special. He's got the size and the
potential.'' Turman, 11-7 with two Class A teams last year, might
begin an extended spring training, but eventually will go to Class
A Lancaster.

COURIER CARRIES US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England _ The rowboat named Courier would not sink.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by resounding surf on all sides, assaulted by a tidal
wave called Greg Rusedski, the deceptive rowboat was really a
battleship whose big guns hammered the gallant Brits to the
narrowest of defeats, and carried the US Davis Cup team to Boston
and the wished-for July quarterfinal against Australia at Longwood
Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom, if ever, in the 100 years of the sterling crock's
existence has an American guy come through as brawny James Spencer
Courier did Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in helping the US seize the 3-2 triumph
at the extreme limits of the game _ tail-end of the fifth set of
the fifth match of the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   This was heart-stopping stuff at the seething National Indoor
Arena, which resembled a bygone English madhouse called Bedlam. But
through deafening tumult and shouting, horn-blowing, and chanting
of 9,400 voices (``Go, Greg, Go!'' as well as a minuscule band with
``USA! USA!''), Courier's lionheart didn't miss a beat. He hung on
grimly, coolly in the turbulent rising and falling tides for nearly
four hours, and busted the biggest serve in tennis as a valedictory
to win, 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 1-6, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   For the US, a sunnyside-up Friday start, a 2-0 lead, had gloomed
to 2-2 when Todd Martin couldn't hold off a rampaging shotmaker,
Tim Henman. Despite a bright start, a set and a service break to
4-3 in the second, Martin lost his composure over a disputed line
call. He fought back to hold a set point in the fourth. However,
Henman canceled that with a stunning serve-and-volley volley,
proceeding to win, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   Courier was brazen and bodacious, making everybody forget the
disdainful Pete Sampras. At one point Courier lifted his shirt to
tap his chest and roar: ``Nobody's got a bigger heart than me!''
</P>
<P>
   But inwardly he was another man. ``Calm, serene, peaceful,'' he
said. ``It was eerie. I felt like I was in a rowboat in the middle
of the ocean. The noise, the fans were waves breaking all around
me. I was enjoying it all. And I kept sniffing at Rusedski's serve
until at last I could break it'' _ for only the third time in 26
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the locker room waiting for Todd (Martin) to finish I was
reading a book called `The Perfect Storm.' It put me in this nice,
ocean mood.'' Even though the Gloucester, Mass., fishing boats in
question tragically went to the bottom, Courier had read only the
first 20 pages. Still, to his captain, Tom Gullikson, and
teammates, Courier fit the title _ the perfect storm.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was in the fire, and Courier, who, of course, ``as
a little boy wanted to be a fireman,'' came on to put out the
blaze. As the US' all-time Cup fireman, he is 3-0 in ultimate fifth
matches. His presence means more than a hook-and-ladder truck,
since the team is now 13-0 with him in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times over the century, a US series has gone down to the
fifth set of the fifth match. Four Americans have won: Don Budge
over German Gottfried von Cramm, 1937; John McEnroe over Swede Mats
Wilander, 1982; Michael Chang over Austrian Horst Skoff, 1990; and
Courier twice, stopping Russian Marat Safin last year. He also beat
Netherlander Jacco Eltingh in a fifth match (four sets) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man for the crunch, like no player I've been associated
with,'' lauded Capt. Gullikson. ``I don't care where Jim's ranked''
_ currently No. 54 _ ``but when he's got his Davis Cup game face
on, he's the No. 1 he used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Rusedski launched many torpedoes into that face, serves
that traveled up to 133 miles per hour, 31 of them for aces while
he was miserly with break-point openings, only six. Courier leaped
on the last one, driving a backhand return toward the charging
Rusedski's right hip that he couldn't volley. It was over.
Finished, leaving everyone drained, slowly realizing that the US,
7-4 short-enders with British bookmakers, had won by a margin no
greater than one of Courier's scarlet whiskers. After eight hours
in the asylum, the crowd had to go home at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we lost, but it was a great occasion,'' said a
spectator, framing it well. It had been appropriate in this
celebrational 100th year of the Cup that the original foes should
clash.
</P>
<P>
   Although Courier, who had beaten Henman also in a squeeze (7-5
in the fifth) to open the series, didn't serve as large as
Rusedski, he served tougher (66 percent to 54), and warded off
seven of nine break points. The match could have slipped away from
him a game before he tucked it away. Rusedski goaded him to deuce
with a rifling forehand, whereupon Courier lashed a serve that set
up a forehand winner and got to 7-6 with a service winner.
</P>
<P>
   Courier had missed the lone previous break point of the set as
Rusedski took it away with a snaking second serve, and reached 4-4.
``But in the last game I was reading his serve,'' Courier said.
Rusedski started with his 16th double-fault and was beaten by a
ripping forehand passer, and two concluding backhand returns.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, who had lost to Martin, felt, ``I let the team down.''
Not with his part of the incredibly high-quality performance
Sunday. It was brinksmanship all the way, 3:47 of memorable fury
and firing from both. Rusedski kept coming at Courier, volleying,
half-volleying, and hitting a gang of passers himself. Courier was
a volleying master, too, though storming the net half as much.
</P>
<P>
   Together they made a masterpiece that had Longwood president
Steve Roiter in a deep sweat. ``We wanted the US and Australia, and
we got it. We should give Courier a key to the city,'' he enthused.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least a rowboat to drift and dream victorious thoughts on
the Charles.

PERSEVERANCE IS THE RULE FOR MAINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It did not appear to be the ideal way to end
the regular season and pick up steam heading into playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maine went to a rocking Whittemore Center at
the University of New Hampshire and got rocked. Absolutely rocked.
UNH won the games, 6-1 and 4-1, and won the Hockey East
regular-season championship.
</P>
<P>
   And Maine coach Shawn Walsh was calm as could be afterward. Said
he loved the atmosphere. Couldn't wait for the playoffs to begin.
Loved the way his team played.
</P>
<P>
   But 10-2 in two games, coach?
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem. There were bigger _ much bigger _ to come.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a couple of games in March sure beats losing a game in
April, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Black Bears, who didn't exactly roar into the playoffs,
roared through them and were April perfect. Two wins, no losses. An
NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night they outlasted UNH, 3-2, in overtime at Arrowhead
Pond to finish off their second title of the decade. This team, led
by captain Steve Kariya, matched the 1993 title of the team led by
his older brother, Paul, then a freshman at Maine and now a
superstar for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul said to me all year long just to go out and relax and
have fun,'' Steve said. ``To enjoy the moment. I can't say enough
about my four years here. It's gratifying for me and the fellow
seniors. We knew we'd be a winning team. And there's no better
feeling than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The game and the season _ and the last four years, for that
matter _ were a credit to perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Maine players stuck with the program through the NCAA penalties
for rules violations that kept the school ineligible for the NCAA
tournament in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Maine led, 2-0, on goals by Ben Guite in the
first period and Niko Dimitrakos early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes after Dimitrakos made it 2-0, it was
nearly 3-0. Dan Kerluke put the puck in the net, but the goal was
disallowed after video review because a player's skate was in the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   Still, UNH, getting tons of chances but being denied by an
outstanding effort by Maine goalie Alfie Michaud, was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the Wildcats. They hung in and killed off a minute and 23
seconds of a five-on-three Maine power play. They got a shorthanded
goal from Darren Haydar, breaking out of the penalty box, and it
was 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, junior Mike Souza tied it, finishing a
Haydar-Krog-Souza relay.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last year's championship game at the FleetCenter when
Boston College lost to Michigan, 3-2, in overtime? This was that
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's BC-Michigan game was a great game, and this game
was right there with it,'' said Maine coach Shawn Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular saves from both goalies. Great defensive plays to
break up great scoring chances. Help from the posts. Good bounces.
Bad bounces.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud, who had 46 saves when it was all over, got Maine to
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   UNH sophomore Ty Conklin, who had 36, did his share, too.
Conklin, on the ice, held off a couple of Maine chances 6:47 into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud stopped a Krog tip-in try at 8:53 and then barely got
his stick on an in-close shot by John Sadowski.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Maine senior forward Marcus Gustafsson took a
pass from Cory Larose. He shot and then followed his rebound and
popped it over Conklin.
</P>
<P>
   It was over. At 10:50 of overtime, Maine, which lost in the 1995
title game to Boston University, clinched another title.
</P>
<P>
   And how about Gustafsson for perseverance? He was on the roster
but dressed for only one game in the 1995 season. He went home to
Sweden to fulfill a military obligation. He believed he had
something to prove as a player, and came back to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in myself and I wanted to come back and show
everyone I was a better player than I was in my freshman year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did that. He finished his career on the Black Bears' top line
with Larose and Kariya, and scored a huge goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Maine had one power-play goal _ Guite's _ in seven
tries. New Hampshire was 0 for 7 on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   In Durham last month, Maine was 0 for 12 over the two nights.
New Hampshire was 5 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   The teams split their first four games, and at the end it should
have come as no surprise to anyone that the rubber match went to
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Maine finished 31-6-4, New Hampshire 31-7-3.
</P>
<P>
   UNH took a couple of major steps this season. First outright
Hockey East championship. First NCAA championship game appearance.
Most wins. First Hobey Baker Award winner in Krog.
</P>
<P>
   And the Wildcats came up just short of a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck bounced for Maine and they made a great play to end
the game,'' said UNH coach Dick Umile, who will try to take his
Wildcats one win further next year.
</P>
<P>
   Maine beat league rivals Boston College and then UNH, both in
overtime, to win its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, either of these games could have gone the other
way,'' Walsh said. ``Hey, you get lucky. They didn't score on one
and we scored on one. That's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And what happened was a national championship. No team has won
back-to-back titles since BU in 1971 and 1972. There have been
rumblings that Walsh may move on, but with him or without him, that
will be a target.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes right down to it, one out of three ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears lost the series at New Hampshire and missed out
on the regular-season league title. They lost to BC, 3-2, in the
Hockey East semifinals, and thus missed out on the tournament
title.
</P>
<P>
   Then they bagged the big one.
</P>
<P>
   They'll take that.

SONICS REBOUND TO .500 AFTER SNUFFING ROCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They say this is it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics' 101-84 win over the Houston Rockets on Sunday is
any indication, then that is the public service announcement for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is when the Sonics get on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have to be,'' center Olden Polynice said. ``We
need to definitely switch gears. We can't keep saying it's going to
get better. We did that the first 30 games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (16-16) labored through the first 31 games in which
they talked a good game and played too many bad ones. But after
falling below .500 for the first time in nine seasons, the team
climbed back by demolishing one of the hottest teams in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (22-11) had won 9 of its past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics were the aggressive, irreverent bunch in
snapping a three-game losing streak. The Sonics picked apart the
Rockets with a frantic defense and offensive contributions
throughout the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star point guard Gary Payton's 30 points led the Sonics.
Backup point guard John Crotty scored 14 of his 19 points in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty, who had just 25 points in seven games as a Sonic, summed
up the team's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went right,'' Crotty said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   The only smear was when the Sonics blew a 17-point lead in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They went into the final frame with a just a 65-61 advantage.
But the Sonics then distanced themselves from the Rockets by
scoring their most points in a quarter this season, and outscored
Houston 36-23 down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to come back home and lose. We want to start a
new streak _ going up,'' Polynice said. ``Our defense was the key.
We were very aggressive. We looked like last year's Sonics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have not been as consistent as last year's team that
won 61 regular-season games. The team was coming off a brutal
five-games-in-six-nights stretch in which it finished with a 1-4
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying we've been playing hard on the road trip even
though we were only 1-4,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``I
like a lot of what I've seen from how aggressively we've been
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   With swingman Billy Owens sitting out with a sore left knee,
Westphal used his ninth different starting lineup. Hersey Hawkins
was reinserted at shooting guard, Detlef Schrempf moved to small
forward and Aaron Williams got his first start this season at power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics got off to a fast start, pouncing on the Rockets with
a trapping defense that clogged the middle. They effectively
harassed Houston center Hakeem Olajuwon in the middle. Olajuwon
finished with 18 points and nine rebounds, but he was 2 of 6 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with Payton's early dominance, ignited the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Payton amassed 22 points in the first half and scored at will in
the paint and on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led by nine after the first quarter. The team shot 50
percent in the first half and held the Rockets to 35-percent
shooting. What the defense gave up was 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rockets misfired from long range. Houston missed 21
of 27 3-pointers. Forward Scottie Pippen was 0-for-4 from 3-point
range, and a non-factor the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense set the tone for the way the game went,''
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``The Sonics looked like they
were rested and we looked like we were playing back-to-backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which hadn't played since Thursday's loss at Utah,
turned the ball over 14 times. The Sonics parlayed those miscues
into 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make them hurry the threes,'' said Westphal, whose
troops countered by making 10 of 19 3-pointers. Payton and Hawkins
each had three.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' bomb with 4:02 left in the game was a dagger. The
basket put the Sonics ahead 86-76, and into a not-too-common cruise
control mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this win desperately,'' Hawkins said. ``It was one
of those games where it's gut-check time, where you see what kind
of heart you have, you see what you're made of as a team.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Forward Vin Baker will practice again Monday, and
possibly attempt an early return after sitting out the past nine
games with a partially torn ligament in his right thumb. Baker
hopes to play Tuesday against Sacramento. ... Federal Way High
(Wash.) product Michael Dickerson finished with just two points on
1-for-9 shooting for Houston. ... With his 12 field goals, Payton
(4,499) passed Jack Sikma (4,493) for second place on the team's
list for career field goals.

 M's CALL TO ARMS BEGINS IN KINGDOME  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Joe Carter was going over his Mariners game notes
Sunday, and the former All-Star-turned-ESPN-broadcaster had to
shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been impressed with this team,'' Carter said.
``How many times can a guy hit 56 home runs and get overlooked,
like (Ken) Griffey last year? They've got Alex Rodriguez, Edgar
(Martinez). And the spring they've had? They've got a few young
guys, but when you have a veteran ballclub playing like that in
spring training, it's a positive note. Usually veteran ballclubs
don't play well in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you have to look at is the bullpen. Until they
right that, that'll always be the talk.''
</P>
<P>
   That talk, of course, is a little less shrill these days. The
Mariners finally unloaded Bobby Ayala on Saturday, dealing the
beleaguered reliever to the Montreal Expos, who it's safe to say
won't be paying much of the right-hander's $1.8 million contract.
The move secured the roster spot of right-hander Eric Weaver, the
sixth Mariner pitcher with less than a year of big-league
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the M's introduce a familiar lineup for Monday
night's Kingdome opener against the Chicago White Sox, a lot of
their other players are largely unknown. Ten Mariners _ plus
reliever Mark Leiter, who is on the disabled list _ never have
played for Seattle before. Some of them have hardly played anywhere
before.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one thing the Mariners most wanted from spring
training, it was the development of their young arms. In the course
of winning 20 of 32 games, that happened. Two pitchers, No. 3
starter Freddy Garcia and potential fifth starter Brett Hinchliffe,
made the team despite no major league experience. Relievers Weaver
and Mac Suzuki have seven career appearances, left-hander John
Halama six. Set-up man Jose Paniagua has worked in 40 games over
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they've got talent, but you never know how they'll
perform here,'' said Woody Woodward, M's vice president for
baseball operations. ``It's a very positive thing, the impression a
lot of these pitchers made, but you never know until you run them
out there in the season. It takes a lot of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience won't be a buzzword in the stands, where fans are
expecting the Mariners to recover quickly from last year's 76-85
debacle. Players have the same expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot stronger,'' said David Segui, who is back at first
base as Jay Buhner, less than seven months off serious elbow
surgery, returns to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't judge spring off wins and losses, but what we saw on
the mound was impressive. We know what we'll get from Jeff
(Fassero) and Jamie (Moyer) and the rest of the veteran guys, but
the eye-openers were the Hinchliffes, Garcias and Halamas. A lot of
guys stepped up in roles that we really needed. Our defense is
going to be much better, and when you take into consideration the
amount of runs this offense can score, if you put that together
with good pitching, it's going to allow us to win a lot of
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Although at least one national publication _ Athlon's _ picked
the M's to win the wild-card, few are picking Seattle for first
place in the AL West. The reason most often cited is pitching,
which new catcher Tom Lampkin said is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, a former Blanchet High of Seattle star who signed with
the M's this winter after four years in the National League, said
he'd rather judge for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a chance to see them first-hand, but after it's
beaten into your head on ``SportsCenter'' and all the other media
outlets, you're going to hear about it,'' he said. ``But it's a new
year, and you can throw all the numbers away and put them on the
back of your baseball card. I haven't seen any indication that this
staff is as bad as everyone says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching is better than a lot of people think, and we're
going to surprise some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero starts Monday night, hoping to erase a spring training
in which he had a 13.20 ERA. He will be followed by Moyer, who had
a solid spring, and Garcia, who was at times overpowering. Butch
Henry is the fourth starter, making his M's debut Friday against
the Oakland Athletics.

GOING NOWHERE: `I WON'T MAKE IT TO 30,' GANG KID SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The black (italics) R.I.P. (end italics) tattoo
crudely inked into the neck of 11-year-old Robert Lomas is the
first sign the youngest member of the notorious Langdon Street Gang
has grown up around killing, death and pain.
</P>
<P>
   The second sign is the street name of Robert's gunned down
mentor Sal ``Sneeky'' Saladona, also needled into the
sixth-grader's flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't make it to 30,'' Robert said one recent morning,
staring at the pavement until the last word slipped out his mouth,
and then shrugging his shoulders and turning away.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or the other, someone will get me before I turn 30.
They will. I know I'm going to die. But I like this life and
kicking it with my homeboys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't make me join. I wanted to be with them. They look
out for me, and I stay out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoic and coarse, but still holding on to his little boy grin,
Robert has literally become the poster child for Los Angeles City
Attorney James Hahn's war against gangs in North Hills, northwest
of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When Hahn announced a lawsuit against the Langdon Street Gang
last week, he used a photograph of Robert's tattoos to underscore
the rise of what he says is a new generation of street thugs, in
place ``to terrorize'' residents for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Robert was not among 31 of his older Langdon Street Gang cohorts
specifically named in the proposed gang-abatement injunction which,
if approved by a judge, would prohibit the defendants from
associating with one another in public.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why police photos of Robert and his tattoos were chosen
by the City Attorney's Office was not clear. A spokesman for Hahn
and gang investigators declined to comment on Robert or any other
juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Robert is of prime age for recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At their age, they see the older ones flashing money from a
dope deal, and there is an allure of the gang subculture and
mystique,'' said Marty Vranicar, supervisor of the City Attorney's
Gang Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a constant effort to recruit these kids,''
Vranicar said. ``There is safety in numbers, and you need people to
fill the ranks after arrests and casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not news to Robert or his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to talk to Robert all the time about the gang. But the
more I ask him to leave, the more he's going to get into it,'' said
Melinda Lomas. ``What he does, he does behind my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomas says she's upset that the gang controls her neighborhood
and her son's life.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she is not willing to speak out against the
gang, even though they are responsible for at least three fatal
shootings near Monroe High School since November 1997 and lord over
drug sales in an area known as Los Angeles' drug supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing to say about his homeboys. The guys from
Langdon bring me bags of groceries when we need food. Whatever else
they do, they do for their own personal reasons, and that's their
business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lomas family wound up in Langdon Street Gang turf eight
years ago, when Robert was about 4. They were looking for a better
life and fleeing their past.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking up with Robert's father, Lomas said she threw him
and three of his siblings into a car and sped toward California.
She abandoned a three-bedroom home with a ``big, gigantic back
yard'' on the outskirts of San Antonio for a cramped apartment on
the fringe of the 405 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove here quickly to get away,'' Lomas said. ``We've been
trying to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lomas' 12-year-old son Joey and toddler Frankie are her
only two children not running with Valley gangs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids don't have anything to do around here. There are no
parks, no place to go,'' Lomas explained. ``I'm always worried
about them. Some people are doing good things for them and got Joey
not to get involved in gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Robert was beaten into the Langdon Street Gang behind
an apartment complex by two older street thugs. He says he asked
for the brutal initiation and doesn't regret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They socked me a whole bunch of times. It was all right,'' he
said, quickly adding, ``I got some shots in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down on the ground for a few seconds. When I got back
up,'' he said, ``it ended.''
</P>
<P>
   But the beating was so severe, Robert's older brother Joey, who
had planned to join the gang before witnessing the attack, decided
thug life wasn't for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to join when Robert did,'' he said. ``But I saw him
get his ... kicked _ and I changed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey's resolve was strengthened last month when Robert was
accidentally shot.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert, several of his homeboys were passing around
a semiautomatic pistol when the gun fired. The bullet ricocheted
off the pavement and superficially wounded him in the knee. The
middle schooler has nine stitches; police have no record of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Fiddling with the zipper on his Adidas basketball jacket, Joey
downplayed his brother's shooting and predicted early death. ``I'm
not worried about that. When he's 29 I'll start to worry because
I'll know he has a year left to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother can do what he wants to do. It's his life,'' Joey
said. ``I'm not into the gang.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's mother credits the Rev. Jim Hamilton, the graying,
passionate pastor of the United Methodist Church of Sepulveda, with
saving Joey and handfuls of other children from the Langdon Street
Gang and their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Hamilton has opened the church's gated
courtyard on Rayen Street to local children. He gives them a place
to play basketball, take art classes, do homework, or just hang out
away from both the street violence and the swarms of police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much money, but we give some of them jobs and
give others a safe place to go,'' Hamilton said. ``They're all good
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the kids Robert and Joey hang out with at the church and
local pizza place say they don't have ambitions to be gangbangers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite reports from police and the City Attorney, the
children, ranging from 11 to 16, insist they're not being recruited
or pressured into the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Langdon says they don't want me, but they've never asked me or
anyone to join. You make your own choice. I don't want them,'' said
Tommy Slayton, 15, who recently moved into the neighborhood from
the south side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen too many people die,'' Tommy said. ``But you need to
know the police thing is real bad also.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They already look at you like you're doing something wrong,''
he said. ``Now they'll be bothering us even more. We don't have to
be on that list for them to hassle us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrinkling the right side of his mouth in a display of anger and
sudden worry, Robert glared at two uniformed cops outside the
church courtyard's iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get panicked when I see them. They can't come in here and
hassle me, can they?'' he asked, before shaking off his own
question.
</P>
<P>
   Robert should be scared. If the injunction is approved, police
would have unprecedented powers in the North Hills neighborhood to
roust suspected gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the suspected street thugs would not be allowed to
own cellular phones and pagers or congregate in public. They would
have to abide by a 9 p.m.-to-sunrise curfew in two sections of
North Hills near the 405 Freeway, including around Langdon Street
Elementary School and James Monroe High School. And they would be
forbidden to go on private property without written permission from
the owner.
</P>
<P>
   While 12 of the named members are incarcerated and police
recently reported a 20 percent decline in crime in the area, Hahn
and gang investigators insist the injunction is needed because
traditional law enforcement has failed &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Los Angeles police Officer Adrian Torres,
perhaps the most recognized and feared cop in the neighborhood,
declares: ``There are definite signs that Langdon is raising up yet
another generation of gangsters to terrorize the target area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The youths that I have discussed in my declaration are not
alone. There are others more than willing to take their place on
the streets ... to peddle their drugs,'' Torres continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can only be an increase in the violence and havoc
visited upon the people of the target area as this next generation
works to make names for themselves,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law-abiding people of the target area are forced to live
with Langdon and all its stealing, shooting, robbery, graffiti,
threats, and of course drug dealing,'' Torres writes. ``Just
because they suffer in silence does not mean they don't suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Langdon Street Gang has moved beyond criminal to become a
habitual and commonplace fact of life,'' he concludes. ``In short,
it has become a nuisance and must be dealt with accordingly.''

</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the loss in Utah was a speed bump on an open
highway, this was like talking on a cell phone while driving into
the back of a bus.
</P>
<P>
   If blowing that fourth-quarter lead to the Jazz was supposed to
be a lesson and make them better students, this was trying to tell
the teacher the dog ate your homework.
</P>
<P>
   Shotless in Seattle. Careless in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeless in Seattle. Gutless in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks would have put up more of a fight. Maybe
just Meg.
</P>
<P>
   On the odor-meter, this one would rank up there with the
leftovers from last year's Easter egg hunt. Except in this case,
the Rockets were soft-_ not hard- _ boiled. But still rotten.
</P>
<P>
   You can spin Sonics 101, Rockets 84 like a top until the new
millennium, and there is only one thing positive to say: It's over.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it was essentially over in the first quarter when it
was evident only one team came to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was unsightly, even unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton nailed a 3-pointer to open the game. Then Hersey
Hawkins hit one and then another. Detlef Schrempf dropped in a
finger roll. Payton tore in for a spinning banker. Aaron Williams
slammed home a dunk. When Hawkins finally missed a layup, Payton
came right in behind to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it was the start of daylight-saving time. But with all of
the personal trainers and bodyguards and assistant coaches in the
Rockets' traveling party, certainly it was somebody's job to set
all of their alarm clocks and watches ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting your butt beat in this league, there's no shame in
that,'' said coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``But to go out there and act
surprised that the other team came ready to play, well
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was an energy deal. You could see from a lot of the
loose balls on the floor that they got to before we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Crotty-chopped
</P>
<P>
   You also could see it from the way the Rockets played on
offense, lazily and stubbornly relying all game long on the 3-point
shot, a weapon that misfired (5-for-27), if it was ever loaded at
all. And you could see it from the way the Rockets defended the
basket from start to finish, looking more like polite doormen in
search of a good tip rather than tough, hard-nosed bouncers.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Rudy T, there's no real shame in letting Payton
run rampant and pick you apart off the dribble and with his jumper
for 30 points, eight rebounds and seven assists because he's the
most potent all-around threat at point guard in the NBA today.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't enough shame in a season's worth of Melrose
Place to cover up for the fact somebody named John Crotty exploded
for a career-high 19 points, including 14 in the second half after
the Rockets had gotten up off the floor after trailing by 17 and
taken an oh-so-short-lived 59-58 lead with 4:16 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crotty was definitely the difference in the game,'' Scottie
Pippen said. ``By the second half, we got Payton under control. But
Crotty came in and gave them a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   A lift? He gave the Sonics an express elevator ride to the top
of the Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty, playing for his fifth team in the past five NBA seasons,
is supposed to be the kid who valet-parks your car at the
restaurant or bags your groceries. But the Rockets' listlessness
turned him into as uncontrollable and unrelenting a foe as Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Live by the 3
</P>
<P>
   Which was just the tip of the iceberg. The Rockets were beaten
by the hustle of union-card-carrying bricklayer Olden Polynice, who
shot just 3-for-13 but never stopped working. They were beaten by
Payton going just 12-for-27 and Schrempf 6-for-15 and Dale Ellis
1-for-3. The struggling, .500 Sonics were a cool 45.8 percent from
the field. But the Rockets could not match it because the gyroscope
on their outside shooting was broken.
</P>
<P>
   They tried Michael Dickerson (0-for-5) from long range and
Pippen (0-for-4) and Sam Mack (1-for-7) and Cuttino Mobley
(2-for-7). With the Sonics using their usual assortment of traps
and double teams down low to stop the first option to Hakeem
Olajuwon, what the Rockets never did try was kicking the ball back
outside and then attacking the basket. Or making a return pass back
inside to Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we relied too much on the '3,''' Pippen said.
``I mean, we are a 3-point-shooting team.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, like Linda Tripp was Queen of the May.
</P>
<P>
   So the nine-game winning streak is a thing of the past, and the
good feeling built up on the first part of the five-game road trip
becomes lost luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think things are better than a couple of weeks ago,
even with two losses,'' Pippen said. ``I think we can all look at
ourselves in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is how badly they would flinch.

ACE MARTINEZ KNOWS WHAT'S IN THE CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It was only after he went home to the
Dominican Republic last fall, Pedro Martinez said, that he
recognized the toll his first summer in Boston had taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there had been a lot of stress and strain, a lot of
pressure,'' Martinez said. ``The expectations were so high that
everybody had. They all expected a perfect game, the same thing
every day. It's impossible. I'm only human.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the huge contract, of course. And the specter of Roger
Clemens. And the way Martinez raised the bar of those expectations
himself when in his first Opening Day in a Red Sox uniform, he spun
seven shutout innings and struck out 11 against the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Martinez was able to more than balance that burden on
his slender shoulders, despite a month-long bout with a virus that
left him weak for much of the summer. He won 19 games, plus a 20th
against the Cleveland Indians for Boston's lone win in the
playoffs. His 2.89 earned run average ranked second in the American
League. So did his 251 strikeouts. Eight times he struck out 10 or
more batters, who collectively hit just .217 against him.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Rocket went home with his record fifth Cy Young Award,
with Martinez finishing second. But for as demanding as they have
been, Red Sox fans may have merely gotten a preview of coming
attractions from the 27-year-old ace who will open the 1999 season
Monday afternoon against the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A better year?'' Martinez said. ``It's possible. Why not? I
can't predict that I'm going to have a better year, but it's
reachable.''
</P>
<P>
   For one, he said, he feels stronger, having packed on a few
pounds. He has become acquainted with the American League, not only
the hitters but the umpires, who occasionally frustrated him by
their seeming reluctance to call third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important, he said, he has come to terms with
what others want from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's going to be,'' he said, ``but I
guarantee you I will be more relaxed than last year. I'm getting
paid to do the job I have. I'll take the same responsibility as
always. I'm still well-paid. I'm still the player people expect to
do good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I plan to keep my level as a player, and grow higher if I
can. It's not going to be easy. But if I do the same things I've
done the last six years, work hard and stay healthy, good things
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As close as he is to his older brother, Ramon, who will join the
team for the home opener next Tuesday and may be in the rotation by
mid-July if his shoulder regains its strength, Martinez bristles at
the notion that having big brother around is going to have a
profound effect on his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon doesn't mean anything to my relaxation,'' he said.
``I've been alone the last six years, and I've managed to do well.
The way I am, I will feel more comfortable having Ramon, yes,
that's a fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not like everything is going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Sox, status quo will be just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine he has his own expectations,'' manager Jimy Williams
said. ``He can't worry about other people's expectations. We have
other pitchers who are going to pitch. This is a team concept.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone understands that this team, beginning Monday
afternoon in Kauffman Stadium, when Martinez takes the mound
against Kevin Appier, has something in common with its fans. Great
expectations.

`MATRIX' HAS RIGHT EFFECT: CASHING IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers connected in impressive numbers with
``The Matrix'' as the science-fiction thriller took in an estimated
$27.7 million at 2,849 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period to
dominate the nation's Easter weekend box office, studio sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros.' release, with Keanu Reeves as the leader of a
21st-century rebellion against computers, posted the best opening
weekend this year _ well above ``Payback's'' $21.2 million _ and
pushed its five-day total to $37.2 million in a showing that blew
away earlier forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've hit a home run,'' said studio distribution
chief Dan Fellman. ``People leaving the theaters are saying they've
never seen anything quite like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that the special effects in ``The Matrix,''
which portray a world of liquid-like space and variable time, have
proven a potent draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time that a virtual reality film has done major
business,'' noted Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
tracking service, who predicted ``The Matrix'' will draw $90
million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Film analyst Arthur Rockwell credited the studio, which has lost
market share in recent years, with a savvy promotional campaign
capitalizing on young moviegoers being on spring break.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Matrix' is classic Warner movie-making at its best, with
big action-adventures like the `Lethal Weapon' series,'' he added.
``Not taking anything away from Keanu Reeves, but the concept was
very strong and probably would have worked with other actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellman said ``The Matrix,'' which fell short of the $38 million
record by ``Liar Liar'' for best five-day opening during
January-April, received strong support in all geographic regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' may give 1999's box office, which trails last
year's by 8percent, a jolt in the weeks prior to the May 19 opening
of ``Star Wars Episode 1: Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If `The Matrix' can do this well, think how well `Star Wars'
will do,'' Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a distant but respectable second was Disney's opening
of ``10 Things I Hate About You'' with $8.7 million at 2,271
theaters, giving the teen comedy $11.9 million after five days.
That edged Paramount's debut of ``The Out-of-Towners,'' with Steve
Martin and Goldie Hawn in an update of the 1970 Jack Lemmon-Sandy
Dennis comedy, with $8.1 million at 2,102 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Holdover comedies dominated the rest of the slate, led by
DreamWorks' third weekend of Sandra Bullock's ``Forces of Nature''
with $6.4 million at 2,278 theaters and Warner's fifth weekend of
``Analyze This'' with $6.3 million at 2,335 locations. The latter
has totaled $78.5 million overall and should go past ``Payback''
this week as the top grosser among films released this year.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's second weekend of ``EDtv'' faded to sixth with $4.9
million at 2,630 theaters, a steep 40 percent decline from its
opening despite strong critical support. Miramax's 17th weekend of
``Shakespeare in Love'' continued to bask in the afterglow of its
seven Academy Awards with $3.5 million at 1,735 locations, pushing
its total past $84 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's second weekend of its low-cost ``Doug's 1st Movie''
came in eighth with $3.1 million at 2,268 screens, followed by
Miramax's 24th weekend of ``Life Is Beautiful'' with $2.9 million
at 1,130 theaters. The Italian-language comedy-drama has pulled in
a remarkable $44.9 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   MGM's second weekend of ``Mod Squad'' finished a disappointing
10th with $2.5 million at 2,290 theaters, representing a stunning
59 percent decline from its debut weekend. A pair of art-house
entries opened well, with October Films' ``Cookie's Fortune''
taking in $188,600 at 10 theaters and Sony Classics' ``The
Dreamlife of Angels'' grossing $59,000 at six sites.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses hit about $89 million, up about 6 percent from
the same weekend a year ago when the opening of ``Lost In Space''
led with $20.2 million as it dislodged ``Titanic'' from the top
spot for the first time in 16 weekends. Year-to-date grosses have
hit $1.4 billion.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO alliance offered Sunday to assume
responsibility for the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees,
announcing that it would coordinate an airlift by its member
nations to bring in supplies and take out almost 100,000 people to
temporary shelter on American and European territory.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of what has become a two-front conflict between
NATO and Yugoslavia, the allies sought to take advantage of a break
in the weather by stepping up the bombardment that is only just
beginning to inflict serious damage in the Serbian heartland.
Allied spokesmen said the pace of air assaults would dramatically
increase in coming days following an initial phase in which only 15
percent of the military flights were actual bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   [In a series of raids before dawn on Monday, NATO missiles and
bombers struck Serbia hard, hitting the Yugoslav air force
headquarters in Zemun, a suburb of Belgrade, and other targets
around the country, Serbian television said. Pentagon and NATO
officials confirmed that air raids were going on, but declined to
give any details.)
</P>
<P>
   With the flood of refugees now exceeding 350,000 since the
bombing began March 24, according to U.N. figures, NATO mounted
emergency relief efforts in Macedonia and Albania, where the tide
of hungry and desperate refugees has overwhelmed aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance was sending 6,000 to 8,000 troops into Albania to
help with refugees there and redirecting the 10,000 soldiers in
Macedonia who had been intended for a peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo. Of the refugees who will be brought by the allies, the
United States planned to take in about 20,000, but to house them in
Guam or Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, temporarily, not in the continental
United States. The rest were destined for temporary camps in
Germany, Turkey and other European countries in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   On the 50th anniversary of the founding of NATO, the refugee
crisis has become inextricably woven into the allies' military
strategy after NATO failed to predict the ferocity of the Yugoslav
drive through Kosovo and committed itself to weeks of bombing and
no ground forces. The battle plan is intended to limit allied
casualties, but prolongs the fight against Yugoslav forces and with
it, the plight of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, charged this
weekend that the flood of refugees was part of a deliberate
strategy by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to
destabilize the Balkans and force the allied governments to deal
with humanitarian instead of military issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a calculated, deliberate, arranged, preplanned
humanitarian catastrophe,'' he told a small group of reporters on
Saturday at the alliance's military headquarters in Brussels. ``It
serves two purposes. Not only does it change the demographics in
Kosovo, but it helps to destabilize Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO's eventual goal is to return the refugees to
Kosovo, the prospects for doing so in the near future are bleak.
NATO acknowledges that its air campaign has had little effect in
stemming the Yugoslav effort to evict ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's military goal, NATO officials said, is to do so
much damage to the Yugoslav military and to institutions propping
up the Milosevic government that Belgrade will ultimately agree to
a political settlement for Kosovo or, at least, withdraw its
military forces from the province so that the refugees can return
under NATO protection.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's protracted timetable, however, means that hundreds of
thousands of refugees must be taken care of in the meantime, and it
was this escalating problem that preoccupied the alliance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea announced that Germany had agreed to
temporarily resettle 40,000 of the refugees. In addition to the
United States' commitment, Turkey will accept 20,000, Norway will
take 6,000, and Canada and Greece each will take 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   As refugees streamed out of Kosovo by the tens of thousands, it
has been impossible to make an exact count. But everyone agrees
that the problem is immense. According to the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees, about 350,000 of Kosovo's 1.8 million
ethnic Albanians have fled across the borders of Albania and
Macedonia since the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   NATO puts the number a bit higher, at about 374,000. Another
60,000 refugees were trapped in a ``no man's land'' in southern
Kosovo, near Albania and Macedonia, many of whom have been without
food for two days, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. body had asked NATO to help by airlifting supplies,
setting up refugee camps and resettling refugees. On Sunday, NATO
offered to take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 6,000 to 8,000 troops the alliance is sending
into Albania, the NATO commander in Macedonia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael
Jackson of Britain, has been ordered to mount a refugee assistance
effort there with his 10,000 troops. On Sunday, he had his soldiers
rushing food and water to the refugees near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's force plans to build tent cities for refugees, three
of which are already partly operational. The ultimate goal is
provide accommodations for 20,000 refugees. So far, 3,500 refugees
are living in these tent cities.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the flow of refugees, Macedonia had closed its
border. But Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
flew to Skopje, Macedonia, on Saturday and urged Macedonia to
reopen its border, which it did.
</P>
<P>
   To help take the pressure off of Macedonia, members of the NATO
alliance have agreed to resettle nearly 100,000 on a temporary
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting the refugees is likely to be a daunting and complex
task. Some of the refugees will be flown out on cargo planes that
have delivered relief supplies. Since some cargo planes are not
configured for passengers, some passenger planes will also have to
be flown in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some European diplomats, however, questioned the feasibility of
the plan. Emma Bonino, the European commissioner for humanitarian
affairs, told a press conference in Brussels Sunday that taking
refugees to Europe and North America would merely assist Milosevic
with his campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' and break up families.
She said that camps for the refugees should be established in the
Balkans and nearby central European nations.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, already groaning under the weight of refugees, has
offered to help Macedonia by accepting even more.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO has conducted 11 days of bombing raids, the
alliance's air war is, in a sense, just beginning to get under way.
NATO's air forces have been relatively small and have encountered
both bad weather and restraints on what sorts of missions military
pilots may fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said, for example, that it launched 2,700 air
missions during the first nine days of the campaign, but that is a
small fraction of the combat flights carried out during a
comparable period of the 1991 Persian Gulf war. And of the 2,700
mission, only 15 per cent of them were bombing strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, NATO is expanding its force and attacking a
broader range of targets, including the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request from Clark, the Pentagon announced
Sunday that it was dispatching 24 of the U.S. Army's Apache attack
helicopters and 18 surface-to-surface rocket launchers to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets, which will include longer-range missiles, would be
used to attack air defenses so that Apache helicopters, armed with
anti-tank Hellfire missiles, could fly into Kosovo to seek out and
destroy Yugoslav armor and military vehicles. About 2,000 Army
troops will be sent to Albania to operate, maintain and protect the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a week or longer to get the weapons to Albania, the
Pentagon said. They will not be used until the North Atlantic
Council, the political arm of NATO, formally agrees, and President
Clinton provides final approval.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Army helicopters in Kosovo would technically
puncture the Clinton administration's promise not to employ ground
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said, however, that it preferred to think of the
Army helicopters and ground-based rockets as an extension of the
air campaign. It also insisted that the Army units being sent to
Albania were not the opening wedge of a larger invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure and simple an expansion of the air operation,''
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Also fulfilling a request of Clark, the United States has
ordered the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to the Adriatic Sea
and dispatched 13 F-117s to Europe, essentially doubling the number
of ``stealth'' fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's decision last week to broaden its target list has
already had an effect. Early Sunday morning, cruise missiles struck
Belgrade for a second night, hitting several locations.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said that NATO had hit a thermal power plant,
which supplies heat and hot water to many of the city's residents.
The NATO military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby, insisted
the alliance had attacked a nearby fuel storage site, but offered
no further explanation or details.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also said it hit an ammunition factory, an oil refinery and
a bridge during its evening raids. Yugoslavia said that three
civilians were killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the clouds and rain that have bedeviled the NATO air campaign
began to lift, military officials said the bombardment over the
next few days would be particularly intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are geared up to make the absolute most of the break in the
weather, and you will see us press home our attacks,'' Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces, however, have been pressing their attack and
were moving into position for a final assault against the Kosovo
Liberation Army near the Albanian border. Albanian news
organizations said the Yugoslavs had used two Mig planes to attack
the village of Popova, though this could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials also offered new information Sunday about Ibrahim
Rugova, the ethnic Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the alliance had received reports from associates of
Rugova indicating that Yugoslav soldiers had moved into the
Albanian leader's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no freedom of movement but has to report to the local
police station several times a day,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Shea said, the alliance had information that Yugoslav
officials had altered Rugova's call for a halt to violence in
Kosovo in a taped television message. As edited by Yugoslav
authorities, the message suggested Rugova was opposed to NATO
bombing. Recent pictures televised in Belgrade of a meeting between
Milosevic and Rugova were more than a year old, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   On another development, a Western official said there was
evidence that the three American soldiers now being detained in
Yugoslavia were kidnapped by Yugoslav special forces who crossed
into Macedonia and took the Americans out.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has also toughened its stance about what sort of
peace settlement it will seek in the region. Increasingly,
officials no longer talk about returning to the formula worked out
at the Rambouillet Castle in France in which Kosovo Albanians would
be given maximum autonomy as part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   That formula was accepted by the Albanians but rejected by
Belgrade, which then launched its campaign of ethnic cleansing.
Instead, there is increasing discussion of a possible NATO
protectorate, an entity whose existence would be guaranteed by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces might even escort the refugees back to Kosovo
without a peace agreement with Belgrade under this plan, though
such details have not been agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of an acceptable solution relying on Rambouillet is
increasingly remote,'' a senior Western official said.

ZIMMER MANAGING TO STAY SANE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If this were a 1940s movie, it would be called
``The Reluctant Manager'' and the part of Don Zimmer would be
played by William Frawley. (That's ``Bub'' to you thirty-somethings
and ``Fred Mertz'' to the Social Security set.)
</P>
<P>
   In the climactic scene, Joe Torre, played by Dana Andrews, would
enter the Yankees dugout just as the game is about to begin. Waving
a piece of paper, he would have a big smile on his face, and he'd
say, ``Move over, Zim, the Doc says I'm all clear. Got the medical
clearance right here.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a movie, '40s or otherwise. It is real life, and
Zimmer, who wants to be managing the Yankees as much as he wants to
adopt Bill Lee, is the skipper of the defending world champions,
and will be until the cancer-ridden Torre feels fit enough to
reclaim his job. Or until he runs afoul of owner George
Steinbrenner, and don't laugh. These are the Yankees, remember,
and, as Gilda Radner used to remind us, ``It's always something.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmy has landed in the middle of what the Japanese might call a
Grade A dekigoto, or incident, involving Japanese righthander
Hideki Irabu, who drew the wrath of the principal owner by failing
to cover first base on a grounder to the right side last Thursday.
It was his second such spring training infraction, and it set off
the volatile Steinbrenner, who reached a 10 on the Boss-O-Meter,
labeling his expensive Asian import a ``fat . . . toad,'' among
other things.
</P>
<P>
   Much silliness ensued. Irabu did not immediately accompany the
team to the West Coast, where, following exhibition tilts Saturday
and Sunday at Dodger Stadium, it will begin defense of its world
championship Monday night in Oakland with Roger (``I'm not talking
the day I pitch, the day before I pitch, or the day before the day
before I pitch'') Clemens on the mound. Was it Irabu's idea to stay
in Florida, or was it Steinbrenner's? We heard it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   The fun really started when acting manager Zimmer announced
that, in light of the Irabu developments, Ramiro Mendoza would be
starting on Wednesday in Oakland. Suddenly, The Boss, who has
invested more than $12 million in this particular project, was
again pro-Irabu. Fat Toad or no Fat Toad, he was to remain in the
rotation. Uh-uh, said Zim. I'm the manager, and I say Mendoza is
starting.
</P>
<P>
   Shown newspaper clippings in which The Boss had identified
himself as the only one ``in Irabu's corner,'' Zim fired back in a
very public way, basically telling Steinbrenner that such an idea
is nonsense and that if he didn't like what Zimmer was doing, well,
you can fill in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   So here's where we are now. Zimmer hasn't spoken to Steinbrenner
directly. Mendoza will start Wednesday. Irabu will work out of the
bullpen, but only at the start of an inning. And Zimmer, starting
his 51st season in organized baseball, is doing things his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't read George's mind,'' he explains. ``I said what I had
to say, and I don't regret what I said. As far as I'm concerned,
it's over with until I hear differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The P.S. is that Irabu, communicating through his interpreter,
spoke with both Zimmer and the team before Sunday's game. Referring
to the ``winds blowing around me,'' he apologized to his teammates
for ``making trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of credential-toting folk were surprised with just how
sanguine Zimmer has been through this whole affair, but that just
goes to show they don't quite understand this very straightforward
and uncomplicated man. What they must be made aware of is that
Zimmy is bullet-proof. He never has managed out of fear, and he
certainly isn't going to start now, at age 68, especially when he
is doing the job only because both Torre and Steinbrenner asked him
to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Some poor soul actually asked him if he were nervous.
``Nervous?'' he replied. ``I wasn't yesterday. I'm not now. I
wasn't two weeks ago. I'm too damn old to be nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   I keep thinking back to a day in the summer of 1977. It was
about 3 1/2 hours before the start of a night game, and we were
sunning ourselves in the Fenway Park box seats behind the
third-base dugout. We were talking about this and that, and at one
point Zimmer said, ``I know I'll get fired here some day because
all managers get fired. And when that happens, it will be OK,
because I'll go right back over there (pointing to the third-base
coaching box) and I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 21 years ago. Zimmer would manage in both Texas and
Chicago. He would coach in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and
Colorado before landing in New York in 1996. He has been supremely
happy acting as the consiglieri to Torre, who truly appreciates his
advice and counsel. He has no desire whatsoever to manage _
especially this team.
</P>
<P>
   He is in a lose-lose situation. His team is coming off a
record-breaking season, and the man he's replacing is generally
regarded as merely the perfect man for this particular job. The
best Zimmy can do is not screw things up.
</P>
<P>
   Again, he's not afraid. He's just wary. He knows that if the
Yankees win only 124 this year, someone will have something to say.
That's No. 1. He doesn't think he's as good a manager for this team
as Torre. That's No. 2. The circumstances of his getting the job
are bad. ``Who wants to become a manager because someone has
cancer?'' he inquires. So that's No. 3. He is in daily pain because
he has had no chance to recuperate properly from knee surgery.
That's No. 4. And there's another human element to consider: ``I
know there are other guys who would have liked to have been named
manager,'' he explains. That's No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the stunning announcement that Torre had prostate
cancer, it was far from an idyllic Yankee spring. ``Someone said it
looks like we gave up victories for Lent,'' Zimmer joked. Sunday's
loss gave them a 13-20 March record, and while, yes, spring
training is spring training, there were days when it was just ugly
enough to allow the prime contenders to believe the Yankees are at
least a little vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   When you've been around the game for 51 years, you tend to be
cautious. ``I keep reading here and hearing here that we're a
cinch,'' says Zimmer. ``But no one's ever a cinch. We had a very
good team last year, and everything possible that could have gone
right did go right. If I'm Baltimore, or I'm Cleveland, or I'm
Boston, I'm laughing when I hear New York is a cinch. I know I'd be
laughing if I were them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer/William Frawley will manage the Yankees as long as
he's needed. But he will be waking up every day hoping that Joe
Torre/Dana Andrews will be making him move over on that bench.
``I'll hug him and give him a kiss,'' he promises.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope a photographer is ready when that moment comes.

ROYALS, FANS MAY PAY PRICE

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City Royals posted the best record
in the major leagues this spring (22-9). But based on their
troubles over the last few seasons, they know 1999 could be another
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kansas City, which hosts the Red Sox in the season
opener Monday, finished third in the American League Central, 16
1/2 games behind the Cleveland Indians. That actually was closer
than the wild-card Red Sox came to the Yankees in the AL East (22
GB). So what did the Royals do? They elected to strip payroll,
letting five free agents walk _ pitchers Pat Rapp and Tim Belcher
and infielders Jose Offerman, Dean Palmer, and Hal Morris. (Rapp
and Offerman signed with the Red Sox.) Terry Pendleton retired.
</P>
<P>
   To take their place, Kansas City picked up catcher Chad Kreuter,
shortstop Rey Sanchez, and third baseman Joe Randa, and has added
rookies in outfielder Carlos Beltran and second baseman Carlos
Febles, neither of whom has played above Double A. The strong
spring showing means things could work out. But, then again, maybe
they won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably kidded ourselves in the previous winter,'' said
Royals GM Herk Robinson. ``We'd finished last for two years (1996
and '97), and by signing some of the people we did, we offered some
hope to all. It did allow us to get out of last place and finish
third. But at no time did we compete with the Cleveland club. It
came down to the fact that you just can't compete with a $35
million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in losing $10-12 million. There were days
when our late owner, Ewing Kauffman, would write checks for $1
million, $2 million, or $3 million that would allow us to be
competitive with the payrolls of Toronto or New York. But the same
kind of money just doesn't do anything today.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 72-89 record only got it third place, the club needed a
roster overhaul, as well as an injection of cash and new ownership.
The Royals are trying. But in today's large market-vs.-small market
setup, the outcome is rather predictable.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is to bring the franchise back to where it was from
1976-1985, the task is monumental. After moving into Royals Stadium
in 1973, it took Kansas City three years to win a division title.
In the late '70s, the Royals dominated the West, and in 1980 they
overhauled the Yankees. They won a World Series over St. Louis in
1985. Along the way, George Brett became a Hall of Famer. Frank
White, Amos Otis, Paul Splittorff, Willie Wilson, Darrell Porter,
Cookie Rojas, Steve Busby, Dennis Leonard, and Hal McRae became
Kansas City legends. But that's history. The Royals have placed
second three times but have not won a division title since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, much of the talent from the farm system that
used to fuel the big club was allowed to drift away, or to be
traded away, especially after the death of Kauffman in 1993. The
notion was that Kansas City could remain competitive by spending
millions on salaries of players acquired in trade or via free
agency. That will stop, says Robinson. Now if a minor leaguer has
talent, he will play in the big leagues _ with the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're making an attempt to get younger,'' he said.
``And with that comes a lower payroll. We've lived beyond our means
for several years. It doesn't make a lot of sense to have a $35
million-$36 million payroll, lose a lot of money, and not be able
to compete. We're going to concentrate on signing draft picks and
amateur free agents. We hope to break even.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking even means holding on until the club is sold or there
is an infusion of cash. The current budget is around $26 million.
The eventual goal for this year is $20 million. If the Royals are
in the hunt, that could change. But it's the plan for now.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the team will include some veterans, even pitcher
Kevin Appier, although when he gets healthy he will be traded to
the highest bidder. But Robinson wants to give young players a
chance to see what they can do. After all, Brett, who will enter
the Hall of Fame this year, was an unknown when he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably rushing some guys to the major leagues,'' said
Robinson. ``We know that. We're bringing up two players in Carlos
Beltran and Carlos Febles who have never played Triple A baseball.
In a perfect world you'd allow them to play a year at that level.
We're not going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope by the end of the year for our payroll to be $20
million. To be competitive with the Yankees, you'd have to spend
$80 million. That's a $60 million difference, and our franchise is
hardly going to sell for more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if one of his young prospects develops into another
Brett and then decides to leave? After winning the Series in 1985,
the Royals drew 2 million or more for the next six years. But
attendance began to drop after Brett retired in 1993. Last year,
the club had a horrible 29-51 record at home and drew only
1,494,875.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our fans understand,'' said Robinson. ``They know that
as things stand, there isn't a thing we can do about it. I'm sure
they don't like it. But they also know we don't have the up side of
other small-market teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the saddest things I heard about George being elected
into the Hall of Fame is (someone said) that the Royals will never
have another one because they couldn't keep a player like that
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ongoing need for revenue, requirements have
changed. New stadiums in such places as Milwaukee, San Francisco,
and Detroit all have or will have at least 100 luxury suites that
sell from $75,000 to $100,000. In Chicago, one can take in a show.
In Arizona, one can swim in a pool or take a sauna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a destination like Disney World,'' said Robinson.
``You come to the stadium and park in the lot. You get out of the
car and you go into the park. There's nothing else to do. And when
you get inside, there is little more to do than to go to your
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the play of the Royals has fans getting off those seats
and cheering this season.

DAFOE'S BEEN A NET GAIN FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He has been written about and much discussed in and out
of the Bruins dressing room. If you took an informal poll of
players, chances are excellent that goalie Byron Dafoe would be
voted the most valuable player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   If last year was Dafoe's breakout season, this year has been
even more impressive for a variety of reasons. Last year, Dafoe was
a key part of an efficient defensive machine. He did his job well
but didn't often have to make up for his teammates' lapses since
there weren't very many. This season has been different. Because of
holdouts early in the year and injuries throughout much of it,
Dafoe has had to be better than he was last year. He's been called
on to carry a bigger load and he's seen far more defensive
breakdowns than last season.
</P>
<P>
   His goals-against average and save percentage consistently have
been among the best in the league. The one statistic that was
deceiving was his record, which is only recently beginning to
approach his lofty other numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's 3-0 victory over Philadelphia, Dafoe earned his
ninth shutout of the year, tying Terry Sawchuk (1955-56) for the
most by a Bruin in a season since Hal Winkler's team-record 15 in
1927-28. Dafoe, who came to the Bruins with one career shutout, now
has 16.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe is scheduled to become a restricted free agent July 1, and
his stock keeps rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was pretty much learning for him to be in that role
where he was the main guy,'' said right wing Rob DiMaio. ``This
year, I think he just built on that and developed more, and has
more confidence. Maturity does a lot for a goaltender, especially
somebody like Byron. He wants to play every night. He relishes the
role that he's in, being the main guy, and he's a quality
goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe has started 19 straight games and with the Bruins in
decent playoff shape, an obvious day off might be Thursday's game
in Tampa Bay, a team backup Rob Tallas never has lost to and Dafoe
never has beaten. It also would be the second game in two nights
during a week in which the Bruins are scheduled to play four games
in six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him (Saturday night) and he'd like to play them
all if he could,'' said DiMaio. ``It's good to have a goaltender
back there who really wants to be the guy and who wants to be in
there every night. You know he's going to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was quite a revelation last year but because of the
stringent defensive system put into place by coach Pat Burns, it
was difficult to tell how Dafoe would be if his team were in
trouble. This year, it was Dafoe who bailed his teammates out of
jam after jam.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio, like most everyone, didn't know a lot about Dafoe before
he came to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew of him but I knew of pretty much everybody in the
league,'' said DiMaio. ``I never really played too much against
him. I don't think he got as much ice time or as many games as he
would've liked being in other places. Fortunately he came here and
won the job early and he never gave it up. He developed into a
great goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he'll make that first save and second save a lot of
the time and just having somebody back there gives you a boost.
Obviously, you don't want to abuse that fact and just play a
different game and let teams have their way with you and just think
Byron is going to stop everything, but you know he's going to make
that first save. When he does, it just builds our confidence and we
know he can compete in low-scoring games.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio said Dafoe has his own style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character-wise he's . . . I don't think I've ever met a goalie
who's the same as anybody else, but Byron's a pretty charismatic
guy,'' he said. ``He's a fan favorite, he's good with the media,
and he does a lot of good things for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio, who missed Saturday's game because of an injury he
suffered to his forearm during warmups, said he will play Monday
night against Montreal at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all right,'' said DiMaio, who took therapy Sunday. ``It's
feeling a little better, so I'm playing. I really don't know
exactly how I did it. I took a slap shot, and as soon as I took the
shot in warmup my forearm . . . I thought I ripped something. I
couldn't hold onto my stick and it was pretty painful to straighten
my arm. I thought I did something worse than I did. Fortunately,
it's stiff but not that bad. It just happened. It was strange.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio is the second Bruin to be injured in warmups in the last
two games. In Montreal Thursday night, Tallas was struck in the
head by a puck that ricocheted off the crossbar. It cut him for
five stitches but he was the backup. ``Life for me has been
Murphy's Law lately,'' said Tallas.

Loaded Astros can go a long way
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   This is why time begins on opening day: it is The Truth after
six weeks of make-believe. You will know the season really has
started when you don't see a player wearing No. 92, and in the
bleachers nobody has taken off his or her shirt to catch some rays.
</P>
<P>
   The old and the new blend again Tuesday night, when the Astros
host Sammy Sosa and the Cubs, the liftoff of their final campaign
in the Astrodome. While the fans will be allowed to wallow in
nostalgia, the Astros, The Team That Came in From the Heat, have a
tighter focus. Their mission is to win a third division title in a
row _ and keep going.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, this figures to be a schizoid season. In a quake
of a break with tradition, the Padres and Rockies met Sunday night
in the national opener in Monterrey, Mexico, where beisbol is the
fourth-most popular sport after soccer, bullfighting and riding in
a taxicab.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the schedule makers gave the Cincinnati Reds
the first game, usually a day ahead of the rest of the league. But
this tradition was allowed to disappear, and baseball continues its
quest for expanded markets.
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate dance, this balancing of new concepts and
grandpa's memories. But Houston is literally the last place to
complain. This was where six-guns gave way to spaceships, and Buck
Rogers replaced Roy Rogers. The Astros could put a bonnet on a
ballpark and push the game toward the 21st century, but what they
haven't been able to do is win a National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to remind owner Drayton McLane Jr. that the perfect
exit from the Astrodome would be after a World Series. Hey, the
city has been waiting only 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were good enough a year ago to win 102 games and in
the 1990s have a record second only to Atlanta's in the National
League. They won't have the Big Unit, Randy Johnson, for half a
season or the injured Moises Alou for a full one. But what they
have in their inventory is very, very good.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in his rookie season, manager Larry Dierker doesn't have
to wonder what the cat has dragged in. Rarely, if ever, in their
history have the Astros had a player the quality of Alou go down
and replaced him with a talent like Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   This is a smart team, sound, aggressive, with at least three
players among the best in the league at their positions _ Jeff
Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Ken Caminiti. If they could sing, they
would be the Three Tenors.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros ranked at or near the top of the NL a year ago in
batting average, runs, stolen bases and doubles. And not many teams
can offer a lineup with four .300 hitters: Bagwell, Biggio, Hidalgo
and Derek Bell. In a healthy year, Caminiti, back where he belongs
after a stint with the Padres, will join that group, with 30 homers
and 100 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros play with such group efficiency you tend to overlook
Bell, who gave them an All-Star effort, and Carl Everett, a Mets
castoff who hit .296 and earned a good-conduct medal.
</P>
<P>
   What the pitching staff lacks in glamour, it makes up for in
consistency. Four starters won 11 games or more last year, led by
Shane Reynolds with 19 and the surprising Jose Lima with 16. Billy
Wagner has established himself as a closer, and facing The Kid's
fastball is a heartless way for opposing hitters to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez answered last year's question at shortstop. Time
will tell if the Astros made a major error in trading Brad Ausmus,
but tough Tony Eusebio will get the chance he always wanted to be a
starting catcher.
</P>
<P>
   What these ingredients add up to is a team perfectly tailored
for the big ballpark that has been their Dome, sweet Dome since
1965. With the exception of Eusebio, every player can steal, take
two bases on a single, or score from first on a double.
</P>
<P>
   They finished 12{ games ahead of the Cubs in '98 and became a
veteran ballclub while many of us were thinking of them as
tomorrow's team. Dierker, in his third year as the manager, is a
secure fellow who lets his players do some of their own thinking.
He never has managed a team that finished below first in its
division, and he knows this isn't how the game works. So the Astros
have to raise their sights this season before reality bites.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, on the eve of the season opener, the trained
observer drops in a couple of predictions intended to dazzle the
readership. You can usually get a terrific reaction by picking
someone like Tim Bogar, the utility infielder who hit .154 last
year, to lead the league in hitting. But why put that kind of
pressure on Tim?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Astros are good enough that they don't need any
miracles to go where no Houston team has gone before. And we are
not referring to a new ballpark downtown.

REVOLUTION BELIEVE IN ZENGA'S SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Finally, the Revolution seem to have an
effective blend of fantasy and pragmatism, at least in goal. Walter
Zenga, their 39-year-old player-coach who returned from retirement
in an attempt to save a floundering team, is capturing attention
with both spectacular saves and sheer charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Zenga is hoping his personality and style filter into a
team that has exhibited little of either in its first three
seasons. Zenga was again in top form as the Revolution took a 1-0
victory over the Kansas City Wizards Saturday, increasing their
all-time point total to 102 in 100 Major League Soccer
regular-season and playoff contests.
</P>
<P>
   The timing coincided with the buildup to the Revolution home
opener and not only restored some of the team's confidence, but
also might have recaptured the faith of fans. Season-ticket sales
are just over 5,000, a drop of about 1,000 from last year, as the
Revolution prepare to meet D.C. United at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga seems to have discovered a formula for success. At least
he is indicating a viable path for the Revolution, who had the
lowest points per game average in the 12-team MLS entering this
season. Zenga's tactics are conservative, defense-first, but he is
showing that such a philosophy can generate drama and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution had few choices but to follow Zenga's
lead. In three-plus seasons, they have won only 30 games in
regulation time, half of those with Zenga involved. And Zenga only
has been involved in 31 Revolution matches, 23 as player, six as
coach, and two as player-coach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Revolution set an MLS record with nine consecutive
regular-season defeats after Zenga departed with a knee injury.
Zenga retired, and they matched that losing record last season.
Apparently, Zenga was propping up a porous defense and a team
lacking imagination and resourcefulness. Now, he is providing
guidance as a coach, and restoring confidence as a goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   In the Revolution's first two games, both Miami and Kansas City
have had ample scoring opportunities. But Zenga has discouraged
those chances, usually in a masterful way, allowing the defense to
regain its composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows their role this year,'' defender Richard
Goulooze said. ``And we are appreciative of each other. Everyone is
battling and the guys up front are doing a lot of running. Everyone
is more relaxed. We are not taking a lot of risks, but we have been
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is panicking. If we lose a couple of players with
injuries, we are convinced we can still get a good result.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution played without midfielders Imad Baba (groin),
Edwin Gorter (suspension), John Harkes (right knee), and Kris
Kelderman (right knee), and striker Giovanni Savarese (right
ankle). Gorter is due back this week, Kelderman and Savarese are
probable, Harkes is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter talks a lot back there and he takes his time,''
Goulooze said. ``He has a lot of experience. He helps the defense
and he tells us what he wants. Kansas City had shots but he covered
them. We always know he is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are anticipating some difficult challenges. Zenga
still is adjusting to the exigencies of the MLS schedule. In every
major soccer league in the world, opponents are spread out,
allowing more time for buildup and preparation. Though the
Revolution have gained some stability, they have yet to prove they
can compete with the top contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very difficult for us to play against the best team in
the league two times in two weeks,'' Zenga said.

KIDS, TEACHERS AGREE TEST LOAD CAN BE OVERWHELMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good thing Arizona students get a spring break, because
many of them return to school this month to face a full plate of
tests.
</P>
<P>
   To the alphabet soup mix of Stan9, SAT, ACT, AP and NAEP, plus
district finals and regular classroom exams, students can add AIMS
_ Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards _ which debuts later
this month throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has some teachers and district testing directors
questioning whether students are spending too much time filling in
the bubbles instead of learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are overly testing these kids,'' said Kathy Williams, an
instructional specialist at Dobson High School in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Williams cites the latest example to make her claim. Several
weeks ago, 85 Dobson High students were randomly selected to take
the National Assessment of Educational Progress, called the
nation's report card. It's a mandatory test the students had no say
in. And to add to their angst, the students won't be told how they
scored.
</P>
<P>
   So test-conditioned are students, Williams said, that when she
gives her history class the Alabama Literacy Test as part of its
course study of the Reconstruction, the students ask if the score
will register on their permanent school record.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that testing is important to find out what
students have learned and how they stack up against their peers.
The problem is everyone _ the nation, the state, the university and
college, the district, the teacher _ has a different way of
measuring students' academic progress, leading to a glut of tests.
</P>
<P>
   All of that probing leaves students dreading the sight of No. 2
pencils and circles as they conjure up story problems and
multiple-choice questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all kids are talking about this week,'' said Sal Leyvas,
a 17-year-old student at Chandler's Hamilton High School.
</P>
<P>
   Students care most about the tests that impact them the most,
including classroom tests that determine their grades and advanced
placement exams that can exempt them from introductory college
courses. Soon, AIMS will join that list.
</P>
<P>
   But while conscientious students such as Leyvas _ he even
rehearses basic math concepts before taking the Stanford 9 _ know
testing is important to hold the education they receive
accountable, they sometimes feel overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get a little boring,'' the junior said. ``If it goes on
too long, you start losing your concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing students for multiple exams affects classroom
instruction as well, educators say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Marana school district in southern Arizona,
Superintendent Wade McLean recently formed a curriculum team
composed of teachers and administrators to make sure educators felt
part of the process, everything from revising what is taught in the
classroom to devising successful test-taking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work real hard to get people to celebrate by showing what
they've learned,'' McLean said of the tests. ``If you're not
excited about it, you won't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers feel the pinch for time. Williams finds herself
weighing which lessons to cut and doling out more out-of-classroom
assignments, including homework during school breaks. Students come
in before and after school as well as lunch to stay on top of what
they need to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids keep rising to the occasion,'' said Williams, who
teaches in an already test-heavy district. ``But there will be a
breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the state's approximately 800,000 pupils in about 225
school districts and 270 charter schools will take the Stanford 9
achievement test this week. Many of them will follow it up with one
or more of a half-dozen other tests, including college entrance
exams and semester finals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in late April and early May, AIMS will be given to
high school sophomores, and a pilot version of the state exam will
be administered to some elementary school pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Even testing advocates say the level of testing may have reached
critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one test with the hors d'oeuvre. There's another with
the main course. There's another with dessert,'' said Chester Finn,
president of the Fordham Foundation, a national conservative
education research group. ``It would be nice if the meal had one
test.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a long way off. The reason: Some of the tests
measure different things and follow different formats, state
education officials say. The Stanford 9 achievement test, given to
second-graders through high school juniors, is a timed test to
compare students across the nation. AIMS is a power test that will
measure whether students are learning prescribed standards.
Beginning in 2002, pupils must pass it to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's valuable time in that you're going to get
feedback,'' said Billie Orr, the Arizona Department of Education's
associate superintendent. Testing prepares students who ``will have
to show what they know for the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution to overtesting is to rearrange testing
blocks. In the Tempe Union High School District, one board member
recently suggested giving some annual district tests and the
Stanford 9 during the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't teach kids anymore in April. We only test kids in
April,'' Dick Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Others recommend that the school year be lengthened. But that
may be a pipe dream. For decades, lawmakers have bellyached about
the cost of increasing the instructional days beyond 175.
</P>
<P>
   Some students see little good, educational or otherwise, in the
type and the amount of testing. Carrie Ellingson, now a freshman
elementary education major at Mesa Community College, said
standardized testing only demoralized her when she saw that her
scores weren't as high as other students'.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make her a better student, said the 19-year-old Dobson
High graduate. ``I never saw a use for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest waste of time,'' she insisted. &QL;

QUAYLE MINING GOP DONOR LISTS FOR 2000 CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle is running for president, but
don't expect to see him working rope lines in Iowa or attending
living room coffees in New Hampshire until later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Republican primary voters who hope to meet with Quayle _ and
virtually every other GOP candidate for president _ will have to
pay an admission cost, usually $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the first deadline for filing the first set of campaign
finance reports in the 2000 presidential race approached Wednesday,
Quayle was crisscrossing the country in search of contributions
from big donors. At the same time, his aides were hard at work
beefing up a grass-roots donor list to help him mine smaller
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, well into April, Quayle is in a different city nearly every
night, attending a swank fund-raiser in Manhattan one evening,
making a sweep of smaller fund-raisers in the coastal towns of
Florida on another, raking in as many of the $1,000 donations _ the
maximum allowable contribution by a single donor _ as he can.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several weeks, Quayle's schedule has included
fund-raisers in Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, Louisiana and Oregon.
Quayle's first real campaign event _ his official campaign kickoff
in Indianapolis _ won't happen until April 14.
</P>
<P>
   The donor list, which is being supervised by Oliver North's
former direct-mail guru, Richard Norman, may be the key to Quayle's
future.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in New York, Quayle acknowledged the
strategic importance of the list, which he purchased for $45,000
from his leadership political action committee, Campaign America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised a lot of money. We supported a lot of candidates.
Campaigned for a lot of candidates,'' Quayle said. ``Those lists
are very important, believe me. Those who supported me for Campaign
America, by and large, will support me for president. Not all, but
a good majority.''
</P>
<P>
   As he had hoped, Quayle was able to raise $2 million by the end
of March, when candidates for president were required to file their
first finance reports with the Federal Election Commission. The
forms will be released by the commission April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to raise large sums has been made even more critical
by the virtual money machines of Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Bush have indicated he may forgo federal matching
funds in order to be able to spend at will. Bush fund-raisers have
indicated they will try to raise $45 million, and Gore's supporters
have bragged that they are capable of hauling in $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   By forgoing federal matching funds in the primaries, Bush would
be better positioned to vie with GOP presidential candidate Steve
Forbes, whose self-financed campaign last year allowed him to
bypass state primary spending limits on the way to spending $32
million.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle insisted that he wasn't worried about besting Bush or
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about whether I have the most,'' Quayle said.
``I'm just going to have adequate financing to get my message out,
and once my message is out there, I am convinced that the people
will gravitate toward it, they will support me, and I'll be the
nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance consultant Stan Huckaby, who is advising Quayle
and six other Republican candidates on raising money, has estimated
that candidates must have $15 million to $20 million to compete in
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   That means each candidate must raise $6,000 a day, a task that
is made even more difficult by the limited number of donors who can
shell out $1,000. Huckaby estimates that there are 45,000 such
donors in the GOP fund-raising pool.
</P>
<P>
   By Huckaby's count, to hit the $20 million target, each of the
GOP aspirants must grab 18,000 to 19,000 of these $1,000
contributions, in addition to 5,000 donors who can give $500 to
$999 _ a numerical impossibility, given the limited circle of
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun. Anyone who thinks it's fun, you shouldn't vote
for,'' Quayle admitted of the treadmill atmosphere of fund-raising
this year. ``If you want to have fun, go play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts view the current fund-raising realities
as evidence of a system that has spiraled out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The madness has gotten madder,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
president of Democracy 21, a Washington, D.C., public policy
organization. ``We know that if you've got to raise $20 million in
1999 to be credible, that means you've got to to raise $6,000 a
day, and that just doesn't make sense at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a system that is very out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a system that rewards candidates who cultivate huge
donor lists far in advance of the campaign. A few candidates _
including Quayle, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, publishing
magnate Forbes and Family Research Council President Gary Bauer _
have done this using PACs and, in the case of Forbes, an
issue-advocacy organization. Bauer, a foe of abortion rights, has
proved by far the most effective at turning a PAC into a campaign,
cobbling together 90,000 donor names during his time as director of
the Campaign for Working Families.
</P>
<P>
   The PACs allow candidates to legally ``prospect'' for donors up
to four years before the election without declaring an official
candidacy. Even as they are campaigning for state and federal
candidates, the presidential candidates are gradually building up a
list of Republicans with a record of making donations. Then, just
before or after declaring for the presidency, the candidates
purchase the donor lists from their PACs for use in their own
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   FEC records indicate that Quayle's Campaign for America amassed
a donor list of at least 3,100 names from 1995 to 1999, when the
PAC closed its doors. The PAC raised $6 million during a time in
which Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, campaigned for more than 200
state and federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle advisers believe the list gives them the opportunity to
cultivate grass-roots supporters at the same time the candidate is
attempting to woo big-money donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Dan Quayle has the ability to excite grass-roots
activists out there,'' said Quayle 2000 Campaign Chairman Kyle
McSlarrow. ``What I like about it is, it gives us a balance. I like
the idea that we are not just stuck on raising major donor money.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle plans to continue building the donor list, according to
McSlarrow, despite the high costs associated with prospecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, when you have a list (from a leadership PAC), it
does transfer over, but you also have to kind of build a new
list,'' McSlarrow said. ``People sometimes decide, `Well, maybe for
the presidential race I'm not going to be with you.' '' &QL;

ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS HOPES HIGH ENTERING 2ND SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Year 2 of the Arizona Diamondbacks is upon us with
fresh faces in the lineup and a new focus in the community.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your radical departure from the frenzied buildup to
Opening Day 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks open their season today in Los Angeles against
the Dodgers in the marquee pitching matchup of the day: Arizona's
Randy Johnson, who signed a $52.4 million, four-year deal in
November, against Los Angeles' Kevin Brown, who became baseball's
richest player 12 days later when he signed a $105 million,
seven-year deal. The same two teams come to Phoenix next Monday for
the home opener at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It's been an off-season of transformation for the Diamondbacks,
both on the roster _ thanks to a $119 million free-agent spending
spree _ and in the community. The buzz at BOB this year focuses
more on the team's chances of contending than on the facility, the
controversial quarter-cent sales tax that financed it, or the
novelty factor of major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Baier, director of sports development for the Arizona
Department of Commerce, said that building a baseball tradition and
speeding up economic development downtown have replaced the
controversial stadium funding as key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's definitely starting to be a change,'' he said.
``From the political side those feelings (of resentment) may linger
a little, but from the people especially the feelings are
soothed.''
</P>
<P>
   The off-season has seen the team spend heavily on veteran
talent, with an eye toward contending for a playoff berth right
away. Johnson is foremost among the additions, but the team also
added outfielders Steve Finley, Luis Gonzalez and Tony Womack,
pitchers Todd Stottlemyre, Armando Reynoso and Greg Swindell and
utility man Greg Colbrunn. The heavy investment in payroll came
after a highly criticized decision to raise ticket prices by about
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Season ticket sales are down from 36,000 last year to about
27,000 this year, but the Diamondbacks still expect to be one of
the leading draws in Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   General Managing Partner Jerry Colangelo attributes much of the
drop-off to fans combining their tickets with friends because they
found attending 82 games in a season too much.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks drew 3.7 million fans last year, fifth in the
major leagues. They also were fifth in worldwide merchandise sales
in Major League Baseball, trailing only the New York Yankees,
Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves and Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   They have sold 2.3 million tickets this year before the first
game.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dozer, president of the Diamondbacks, said that there
are about 2,000 tickets left for opening day April 12, and that
season ticket sales will continue for a short while after the
season begins. Dozer also said about 1,000 20-packs have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   For Colangelo, Dozer and others, the trick now is to build
tradition and allegiance, cultivating a baseball culture in the
Phoenix area similar to those in Chicago, New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building an allegiance takes time,'' Colangelo said. ``We
believe that it takes time to build that baseball tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   KTAR-AM (620) talk show host Brad Cesmat wonders if the Valley's
(Phoenix area) typical ``until they win, who cares'' attitude will
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the sense that there's a real buzz about opening
day yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as a city we have the capability of being on the
same par as a Chicago,'' Cesmat said. ``I think the expectations on
the fans should be higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations also are high that the Diamondbacks and BOB will
continue to spur redevelopment and the downtown economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the Diamondbacks have made a huge
improvement for downtown,'' Dozer said. ``The ballpark is almost
the icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The total economic impact of the downtown stadium's operations
last year was projected at $319 million in a study paid for by the
Downtown Phoenix Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Partnership officials have said the challenge this year is to
spread out the benefits beyond BOB, its concession stands and
associated restaurants, including TGI Friday's and the
Leinenkugel's brew pub.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 94 percent of the increase in downtown
sales came from those entities.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's on Third was the major new bar/restaurant venue in the
area for last season, and it is joined this year by Alice
Cooperstown and the Tee Pee Tap room.
</P>
<P>
   Another brew pub has been proposed for Third Street next to the
railroad tracks, a permit has been filed for loft condominiums at
Second and Buchanan streets, and a hotel development has been
proposed for the parking lot between BOB and Jackson's on Third.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on. A lot of this impact is related to the
stadium,'' said Brian Kearney, executive director of the downtown
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're starting to see bit by bit these things happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney said those projects and other housing developments
downtown demonstrate the synergy of a developing area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with what is happening so far and don't see the
momentum slowing down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that brings 3 to 4 million people a year downtown has
to be seen as a large impact.''
</P>
<P>
   But some find the development lagging and wonder when the pace
will pick up, whether downtown will ever be a place to be or just a
place to go for an event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think downtown is a New Orleans or a Broadway,'' said
Art Kaufman, a vocal stadium critic who maintains that the
Diamondbacks ``pulled a fast one'' on the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman believes baseball would have come to the Phoenix area
regardless of whether it was financed by the taxpayers, but now
that it's here, he thinks its impact is a positive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is all right, it's a good sport,'' he said. ``It's
good having a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell whether it's the team that matters to fans, or
whether it's just BOB and its amenities that draw crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they fit in real nicely, they're a great addition to
downtown,'' said Baier of the Department of Commerce. ``It's
especially great that in the summer Bank One Ballpark is someplace
to go in air-conditioning and see great entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will definitely take a while to build a baseball
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition and winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start being competitive,'' Dozer said. ``We need to
keep people coming out in July and August.'' &QL;

 M's CALL TO ARMS BEGINS IN KINGDOME  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Joe Carter was going over his Mariners game notes
Sunday, and the former All-Star-turned-ESPN-broadcaster had to
shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been impressed with this team,'' Carter said.
``How many times can a guy hit 56 home runs and get overlooked,
like (Ken) Griffey last year? They've got Alex Rodriguez, Edgar
(Martinez). And the spring they've had? They've got a few young
guys, but when you have a veteran ballclub playing like that in
spring training, it's a positive note. Usually veteran ballclubs
don't play well in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you have to look at is the bullpen. Until they
right that, that'll always be the talk.''
</P>
<P>
   That talk, of course, is a little less shrill these days. The
Mariners finally unloaded Bobby Ayala on Saturday, dealing the
beleaguered reliever to the Montreal Expos, who it's safe to say
won't be paying much of the right-hander's $1.8 million contract.
The move secured the roster spot of right-hander Eric Weaver, the
sixth Mariner pitcher with less than a year of big-league
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the M's introduce a familiar lineup for Monday
night's Kingdome opener against the Chicago White Sox, a lot of
their other players are largely unknown. Ten Mariners _ plus
reliever Mark Leiter, who is on the disabled list _ never have
played for Seattle before. Some of them have hardly played anywhere
before.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one thing the Mariners most wanted from spring
training, it was the development of their young arms. In the course
of winning 20 of 32 games, that happened. Two pitchers, No. 3
starter Freddy Garcia and potential fifth starter Brett Hinchliffe,
made the team despite no major league experience. Relievers Weaver
and Mac Suzuki have seven career appearances, left-hander John
Halama six. Set-up man Jose Paniagua has worked in 40 games over
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they've got talent, but you never know how they'll
perform here,'' said Woody Woodward, M's vice president for
baseball operations. ``It's a very positive thing, the impression a
lot of these pitchers made, but you never know until you run them
out there in the season. It takes a lot of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience won't be a buzzword in the stands, where fans are
expecting the Mariners to recover quickly from last year's 76-85
debacle. Players have the same expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot stronger,'' said David Segui, who is back at first
base as Jay Buhner, less than seven months off serious elbow
surgery, returns to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't judge spring off wins and losses, but what we saw on
the mound was impressive. We know what we'll get from Jeff
(Fassero) and Jamie (Moyer) and the rest of the veteran guys, but
the eye-openers were the Hinchliffes, Garcias and Halamas. A lot of
guys stepped up in roles that we really needed. Our defense is
going to be much better, and when you take into consideration the
amount of runs this offense can score, if you put that together
with good pitching, it's going to allow us to win a lot of
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Although at least one national publication _ Athlon's _ picked
the M's to win the wild-card, few are picking Seattle for first
place in the AL West. The reason most often cited is pitching,
which new catcher Tom Lampkin said is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, a former Blanchet High of Seattle star who signed with
the M's this winter after four years in the National League, said
he'd rather judge for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a chance to see them first-hand, but after it's
beaten into your head on ``SportsCenter'' and all the other media
outlets, you're going to hear about it,'' he said. ``But it's a new
year, and you can throw all the numbers away and put them on the
back of your baseball card. I haven't seen any indication that this
staff is as bad as everyone says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching is better than a lot of people think, and we're
going to surprise some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero starts Monday night, hoping to erase a spring training
in which he had a 13.20 ERA. He will be followed by Moyer, who had
a solid spring, and Garcia, who was at times overpowering. Butch
Henry is the fourth starter, making his M's debut Friday against
the Oakland Athletics.

SONICS REBOUND TO .500 AFTER SNUFFING ROCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They say this is it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics' 101-84 win over the Houston Rockets on Sunday is
any indication, then that is the public service announcement for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is when the Sonics get on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have to be,'' center Olden Polynice said. ``We
need to definitely switch gears. We can't keep saying it's going to
get better. We did that the first 30 games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (16-16) labored through the first 31 games in which
they talked a good game and played too many bad ones. But after
falling below .500 for the first time in nine seasons, the team
climbed back by demolishing one of the hottest teams in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (22-11) had won 9 of its past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics were the aggressive, irreverent bunch in
snapping a three-game losing streak. The Sonics picked apart the
Rockets with a frantic defense and offensive contributions
throughout the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star point guard Gary Payton's 30 points led the Sonics.
Backup point guard John Crotty scored 14 of his 19 points in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty, who had just 25 points in seven games as a Sonic, summed
up the team's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went right,'' Crotty said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   The only smear was when the Sonics blew a 17-point lead in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They went into the final frame with a just a 65-61 advantage.
But the Sonics then distanced themselves from the Rockets by
scoring their most points in a quarter this season, and outscored
Houston 36-23 down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to come back home and lose. We want to start a
new streak _ going up,'' Polynice said. ``Our defense was the key.
We were very aggressive. We looked like last year's Sonics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have not been as consistent as last year's team that
won 61 regular-season games. The team was coming off a brutal
five-games-in-six-nights stretch in which it finished with a 1-4
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying we've been playing hard on the road trip even
though we were only 1-4,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``I
like a lot of what I've seen from how aggressively we've been
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   With swingman Billy Owens sitting out with a sore left knee,
Westphal used his ninth different starting lineup. Hersey Hawkins
was reinserted at shooting guard, Detlef Schrempf moved to small
forward and Aaron Williams got his first start this season at power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics got off to a fast start, pouncing on the Rockets with
a trapping defense that clogged the middle. They effectively
harassed Houston center Hakeem Olajuwon in the middle. Olajuwon
finished with 18 points and nine rebounds, but he was 2 of 6 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with Payton's early dominance, ignited the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Payton amassed 22 points in the first half and scored at will in
the paint and on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led by nine after the first quarter. The team shot 50
percent in the first half and held the Rockets to 35-percent
shooting. What the defense gave up was 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rockets misfired from long range. Houston missed 21
of 27 3-pointers. Forward Scottie Pippen was 0-for-4 from 3-point
range, and a non-factor the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense set the tone for the way the game went,''
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``The Sonics looked like they
were rested and we looked like we were playing back-to-backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which hadn't played since Thursday's loss at Utah,
turned the ball over 14 times. The Sonics parlayed those miscues
into 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make them hurry the threes,'' said Westphal, whose
troops countered by making 10 of 19 3-pointers. Payton and Hawkins
each had three.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' bomb with 4:02 left in the game was a dagger. The
basket put the Sonics ahead 86-76, and into a not-too-common cruise
control mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this win desperately,'' Hawkins said. ``It was one
of those games where it's gut-check time, where you see what kind
of heart you have, you see what you're made of as a team.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Forward Vin Baker will practice again Monday, and
possibly attempt an early return after sitting out the past nine
games with a partially torn ligament in his right thumb. Baker
hopes to play Tuesday against Sacramento. ... Federal Way High
(Wash.) product Michael Dickerson finished with just two points on
1-for-9 shooting for Houston. ... With his 12 field goals, Payton
(4,499) passed Jack Sikma (4,493) for second place on the team's
list for career field goals.

MOYER MAKING CONTRACT PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners and left-hander Jamie Moyer have made
significant progress toward a contract extension, and though
neither side wants to negotiate too far into the season, an
agreement could be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, the M's No. 2 starter, said negotiations are going too
well to call them off just because the season is starting. He is
optimistic about reaching a deal within a week if progress
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we've done our part and they've done their part,
and it's just a matter of finding out the finality of getting
something done to appease everybody,'' Moyer said. ``If we get to a
stalemate, then we won't worry about it. But I don't foresee that
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Moyer, who is in the last season of a
three-year, $6 million deal, had been hoping for a three-year
extension. The sides now are working on deals of two years or two
with an option, believed to be worth between $4 million and $7
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to go in the three-year direction, but I
kind of understand their situation and where they're coming from,''
Moyer said. ``Any contract negotiation, whether it's one year, two
or five, I think both sides have to give. And I think both sides
here are moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, the M's vice president for baseball operations,
said he also won't let the opening of the season stifle positive
contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to negotiate into the year; we need to
concentrate on getting the season started,'' he said. ``(But) if
there's good progress being made, we'll take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The club is not close to extensions with the other players it
was hoping to sign by opening day, left-hander Jeff Fassero and
first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, who will not negotiate during the season, was seeking a
four-year contract and said he was willing to go well below market
value for it. The Mariners have stuck to a three-year offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that (because of) one year, they didn't want to
get it done,'' said the 32-year-old Segui, who is in the last year
of a two-year, $4.75 million deal. ``They know where we stand. If
they want to get it done, we'll get it done. If they don't, there's
no hard feelings, I'll go somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 choice is to stay here, but I would never be
unreasonable. I'm tired of signing bad deals. I just want what I'm
worth in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero and the Mariners have not had contract talks in two
weeks. In fact, ``There hasn't been any hard negotiating,'' Fassero
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Moyer, Fassero is 36 and could be seeking a three-year
deal. He doesn't want to think about his contract during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd rule out negotiating (during the
season),'' Fassero said. ``I just don't want to be on the phone
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who is in the final year of a deal that will pay him
$4.75 million this year, never has been a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might be fun,'' he said. ``But it definitely is fair to say
I'd like to finish my career here.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Segui landed with the rest of the Mariners at
4:30 a.m. Sunday. But unlike the remainder of the team, which slept
off a weekend in Las Vegas, Segui headed to the Kingdome for an
hourlong workout on his back, chest and triceps. ``Those other guys
are lazy,'' he joked. Segui isn't much on gambling, but he did use
the Vegas excursion to change his hair color from silver to blond.
... Right-hander Ken Cloude threw five innings against the M's
Class AA team in Peoria, Ariz., Sunday and will start again for
Class AAA Tacoma on Friday. He will be on pace to start next
Wednesday against Texas if needed. ``He threw the ball very well
today,'' said farm director Benny Looper. ``He worked on his
changeup a lot, and that's a good pitch he needs to develop.'' ...
Looper said 19-year-old phenom Ryan Anderson will start at Class AA
New Haven _ a level higher than first thought _ but another top
pitching prospect, right-hander Cha Sueng Baek, remains in Korea
with visa problems. ... Here's Woodward's scouting report on
right-hander Jimmy Turman, the 23-year-old Class A right-hander
acquired from Montreal Saturday for reliever Bobby Ayala: ``He's
got to develop a lot, and that's what we're taking a shot at. If he
does, then he's going to be real special. He's got the size and the
potential.'' Turman, 11-7 with two Class A teams last year, might
begin an extended spring training, but eventually will go to Class
A Lancaster.

M'S PAYING FOR AYALA TO PITCH ELSEWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With opening day upon them and the club desperate to
eliminate any lingering stink from last season, the Mariners got it
right _ for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ayala was not only banished from Seattle, the Mariners
sent him across the continent (ITAL) and (END ITAL) north of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the right-hander is an Expo, Ayala's only hope is that
any boos that come his way will be in the unfamiliar patois of the
native Quebecois in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Canada is about as far as Ayala needed to be from the
Mariners, which proves that some moves a ballclub makes are as much
for symbolism as for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   How much of Ayala's $1.8 million salary the Mariners are paying
the Expos to do them this huge favor is not a matter of public
record, but anything less than $1.5 million would fly in the face
of Expo tradition of maintaining baseball's lowest payroll.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Mariners are paying Ayala to pitch in
another city, another league, another country.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Mariners have money to spend on absolute
necessities, like getting rid of a pitcher who is hurting them,
which makes you wonder why they could not have paid to get a
pitcher who could actually help them.
</P>
<P>
   As themes go for the start of a new season, this certainly is
not one the Mariners want. Not when there is so much goodwill to
restore among their suspicious fans. Not when the club is boasting
better defense and better clutch hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played better this spring, we have a clubhouse that is a
lot more energetic and we're not reading in the newspaper every day
about what's happening with Randy Johnson,'' Jeff Fassero, Monday
night's opening day pitcher, said Sunday about the difference
between last year and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one distraction here. Not one person with any
contract problems. Everyone is happy with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the optimism of the season's start, but there was
serious talk about how the M's needed to bolster their rotation.
This winter, Woody Woodwardy, Mariners vice president of baseball
operations, wanted to go after Todd Stottlemyre or Tim Belcher, but
when Arizona and Anaheim offers were too high, the M's would not
play the free agent game.
</P>
<P>
   That fiscal restraint seemed penny-wise, pound foolish then. It
seems even more questionable now _ with Ayala gone, at a big price
_ why wasn't there money to throw at a pitcher who could bolster a
still-wonderful team populated with the likes of All-Stars Ken
Griffey, Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez, Jay Buhner and Dan Wilson?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have arrived on the threshold of 1999 with a
pitching staff that outside of Fassero, Jamie Moyer and Jose Mesa
could double for bubble-gum rockers Backstreet Boys. The combined
experience of six-tenths of the staff is fewer than 50 major league
baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they don't have Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, Bobby epitomized our past failures,'' Lou
Piniella said Sunday from his manager's office in the Kingdome
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some success here, but last year was just terrible. I
don't know what the response would have been here when he was
introduced (opening night), but it was clear that he was growing
more and more apprehensive as spring training came to a end.''
</P>
<P>
   This was most certainly a humanitarian act on the part of the
Mariners, who still like Ayala's arm and his forkball even though
he blew nine saves in '98 and became a lightning rod for Kingdome
rancor.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good deed on behalf of Ayala, who deserved a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be viewed as a good deed to the citizens of
Marinerville, whose late-innings' patience was worn so thin last
season that booing Ayala escalated to a sort of vicious art form.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, on the sick flip side of sports, sometimes the
crowd actually starts rooting for disaster. Another walk, another
blown save, another bullpen implosion.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, on everyone's part, but that's what happened last
season. And it started on Day One, when Ayala and his pen-mates
gave up four walks in the eighth inning and let a 9-6 lead over
Cleveland slip to a 10-9 loss, setting an awful tone for a
disappointing season that made the Kingdome a testy place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans have a right to voice their opinion, but by
the same token, I don't think they should boo the guy just for
walking to the bullpen or standing up,'' Fassero said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They boo him coming out to the mound, he throws three strikes
and then they cheer him. Where's the sense in that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners could not afford to have last year's scenario
repeated. Not when the Kingdome is getting its last baseball opener
and a new stadium looms to the south, waiting for a smiley-happy
bunch of fans to push through the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala is gone, at a price. The pitching staff is still a big
question, at what price we'll soon find out.

AMAZING OUTCOME TYPICAL OF ATYPICAL NBA SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A team of basketball scientists, working 24/7 for a
month, could not explain Sunday's outcome at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an NBA schedule made by Bart Simpson, the Houston
Rockets had been living in town long enough to meet state voting
requirements. The Sonics, meanwhile, were playing their sixth game
in eight days, and the first one at home in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had been a good team getting better, evidenced by
nine wins in their past 10 games. The Sonics had been a decent team
going bad, evidenced by seven losses in their past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have a style, a direction and a purpose. The Sonics
make kindergarten recess look like a parade march at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? A 101-84 Sonic win that made sense in only in
that it made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   That means it was a fine metaphor for an NBA regular season so
haywire that almost nothing resonates from one day to the next. The
compressed schedule, the slapdash rosters and the Butterbean
lookalikes passing for pro basketball players have rendered this
exercise as disingenuous as a Bill Clinton affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of presidents ... read my typewritten lips: This
regular season will forecast almost nothing about playoff outcomes.
More weird creatures will emerge from this silliness than next
month's new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Rockets, who have three of the NBA's 50 greatest
players, were beaten mainly by the 19 points of Sonic backup point
guard John Crotty.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to Mr. and Mrs. Crotty, who raised a fine child, but
winning behind the young man is like winning a Pier Six brawl
because Bluto gets a paper cut.
</P>
<P>
   A waiver-wire pickup from the overstuffed Portland Trail
Blazers, Crotty, in seven previous games as a Sonic, scored 25
points. Then in one game, he nearly doubled his season total. Sonic
coach Paul Westphal could coach 10,000 more NBA games and never get
this same result.
</P>
<P>
   How Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen let this
happen is a sports mystery that ranks with the continual granting
of a boxing promoter's license to Don King.
</P>
<P>
   As Barkley put it dryly: ``Giving him 19 in half (actually 14)
was not in our game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads were being scratched so much in the Rocket quarters that
scalp divots were visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe we didn't have that edge against these
guys,'' said Rudy Tomjanovich, the bewildered Rockets coach. ``I
wish I had an answer for why we came out soft and non-aggressive
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich wasn't intending to put down the Sonics, but he,
too, had to figure the Sonics for pulp after a 1-4 road trip
smashed into six semi-horrifying days. Instead the Sonics played
with the kind of energy and poise that were utterly absent in their
last NBC national TV appearance _ a 104-87 embarrassment exactly a
week ago in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of that game, the Sonics were as pulseless
as the Rockets were in the opening period. Both teams were equally
without reasons for the rigor mortis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do anything in the first half,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Give (the Sonics) credit, yeah, but it seemed like when there was
a loose ball, our guys bumped heads.''
</P>
<P>
   A more fitting word picture for this season has yet to be drawn.
But it isn't just the Rockets. The Sonics have been even more
buffoonish, and they're better than at least half the teams in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos extends into coaching. Sunday, Westphal went to his
ninth different starting lineup in 32 games, inserting backup
center Aaron Williams into the power forward spot, while Hersey
Hawkins returned again to start in place of Billy Owens, who sat
out again with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this particular lineup had no more influence on the outcome
than stock prices have on the tides. Williams had nine points and
seven rebounds in 16 minutes, and Hawkins made four field goals,
production that each could have had from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   A look around the league suggests that many teams are similarly
vexed. The Indiana Pacers can't win close games, the Miami Heat
suddenly can't win anything, the Utah Jazz have been in a downward
spiral and the Los Angeles Lakers are one thrown chair from a full
Jerry Springer show (``Freakazoid forward: Can't live with him,
can't live without him!'').
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the trendy NBA darlings, the Trail Blazers,
haven't gotten beyond the playoffs' first round practically since
Bill Walton wore a ponytail. Until they do, and until Isaiah Rider
doesn't need a bail bondsman on 24-hour call, don't speak of them
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, for all the talk of their rise and their stars, are
using an all-rookie starting backcourt of Michael Dickerson and
Cuttino Mobley _ a charade that was exposed embarrassingly. They
well may be good NBA players, but not now, and not next month when
the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   There is no explaining this NBA season. And there is precious
little enjoyment of it, unless you're a fan of bonking heads and
24-percent free throw shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Given the flatness of the competition, the rise in popularity of
pro rasslin is beginning to make sense.

`AMBASSADOR' TO HOMELESS: TEMPE, ARIZ., BUSINESSES CHANGE AP
PROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA L. JONES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ She's been ignored, yelled at and even called a
Nazi by the people she's trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   But around Mill Avenue, tough love works for Rhonda Bass,
ambassador to the homeless in downtown Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, Bass has been the face of a kinder, gently
aggressive Downtown Tempe Community, a group of business owners
trying to change their approach to the homeless who live on their
doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old's job: to walk the streets, talk to and,
hopefully, help downtown Tempe's street people.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them they're welcome as long as they don't
aggressively panhandle or scare away the customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, prior to this program, we ignored them,'' said
Bass, a DTC employee for two years. ``We're not ignoring it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So there she is, asking homeless people to refrain from cursing,
littering, brushing their teeth in restaurants and blocking
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, she asks them whether they need phone numbers
for shelters, counseling or help landing a job.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a change in a city that for years has treated the downtown
homeless like a shopper with bad credit.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Tempe has outlawed urban camping, aggressive
panhandling and sitting on sidewalks, all measures the homeless say
are designed to keep them from getting comfy downtown.
</P>
<P>
   For Tempe, Bass' ambassador program is a change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty proactive,'' said Tempe police Sgt. Dave Humble.
``Before, it was to just try and chase them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the business community's motive is not entirely
altruistic, Bass said her work appears to be doing some good.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, she intercepts a homeless man before his first
drink and walks him to a free shower at a church on University
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   At the showers, Bass tells a middle-age woman without
identification to go to the Salvation Army across the street for
help.
</P>
<P>
   On her way back to Mill Avenue, Bass helps a Tempe customer put
money in the parking meter.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, Bass is standing outside the Coffee Plantation
talking to some of the homeless youths who spend hours at the
outdoor cafe.
</P>
<P>
   She lends 20-something Ollie Gatz her cellular phone to seek
medical help for the marks on his skin, which Gatz says originated
from a ditch he slept in near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Bass also hands out her personal business card and a second that
reads, ``We'll give you a hand, not a handout.'' The card lists
agencies where homeless can get help in getting off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Bass is one way the city, which spent millions in government
dollars to convert this once-decrepit strip of abandoned stores and
biker bars into a row of trendy pizzerias, brew pubs, art galleries
and boutiques, can keep the homeless from scaring off customers.
</P>
<P>
   The DTC collected $30,000 in business donations for materials
and a salary for Bass, who divides her time between the streets and
DTC's downtown office, where she previously helped promote Mill
Avenue tourism.
</P>
<P>
   After this year, the ambassador job will be funded through
businesses' assessments, which range from $8 to $5,000 each year,
depending on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has really changed the civility of the street,''
said Rod Keeling, DTC executive director. ``It tells them they're
welcome, but they have to behave themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't always happen.
</P>
<P>
   One teenager recently called Bass a Nazi from across the street.
On their next meeting, however, Bass got him to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Others only pout when she empties cups of wine being sipped on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   She carries her phone and radio for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only reason I don't get harassed is because I'm
out there as much as they are,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners tell her about the latest dine-and-dash _ a
homeless person who ate without paying _ or who might be blocking
the entrance to a shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought the city should do something about it,'' said
Mike Jennings, co-owner of two Campus Corner shops. ``As far as I
know, the city has no plans to do anything about it, so it's good
that we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass estimates that 25 to 30 homeless, most runaway teenagers
and young adults, live in downtown Tempe. The homeless, often high
on drugs or alcohol, spend their days drifting between the Salt
River bottom and Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a home for many of them is the sidewalk in
front of the Coffee Plantation, which did not donate to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We donate our tables (all day, every day) to these guys,''
manager Rich Sidoti said. ``We give enough just by not kicking them
out of our restrooms and not constantly kicking them out of our
courtyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and the homeless said it's too early to decide
whether the program is working.
</P>
<P>
   For Tempe businesses, out of sight may be enough.
</P>
<P>
   For Bass, however, just hiding the homeless isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keep asking and asking and asking and hope that one day
they'll say, `Yeah, man, take me home.' Or, `I want to go to
detox,' '' Bass said. ``A lot of people we encounter don't want
anything you offer them, no matter how hard you try.'' &QL;

BEHOLD THE COLD: WINTRY WEATHER MAKES LATE SHOWING IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Another spring storm hit Arizona on Easter morning,
forcing worshipers to move Phoenix-area sunrise services inside and
hiding the red rocks of Sedona under 8 inches of snow. Forecasters
say the unseasonably cold weather will continue at least until the
end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Some Valley families changed tradition, moving their annual egg
hunts inside from wet, muddy and _ in some places like Cave Creek
and Carefree _ snow-dusted yards.
</P>
<P>
   Low temperatures and snow canceled the final round of the 1999
Tradition golf tournament in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, drivers found slow going as police required
chains in some areas and closed roads in others.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's storm, the third in the past four days, dropped
Phoenix-area temperatures to a record afternoon low of 45, 36
degrees below normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, this kind of weather is cold for here
even in the winter. But for April, it's really cold,'' said Craig
Ellis, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Phoenix
office.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-area temperatures are expected to warm to the upper 60s
today then rise to the low 70s on Tuesday. Wednesday will bring
more rain and temperatures in the mid-60s. By Thursday and Friday,
temperatures will rise again to the mid- to upper 70s.
</P>
<P>
   But even by week's end, the temperatures are expected to be 10
to 15 degrees below normal, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another storm is expected to hit northern Arizona on Wednesday,
possibly dumping another 8 inches in Flagstaff and record snowfalls
in other cities, forecasters say.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Ballpark kept its roof closed for the Diamondbacks
exhibition game against the Cleveland Indians. Once again, visitors
from the Midwest found balmier temperatures at home. Cleveland had
a high of 78 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix hit its Sunday high of 58 at 12:01 a.m. That's a record
low, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another cold, low-pressure system will move across the state
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's exactly sure why it's coming this cold this time of
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no patio seating at popular brunch spots.
</P>
<P>
   The popular sunrise services atop Squaw Peak were moved to one
of the ramadas near the parking area.
</P>
<P>
   And the Easter storm left empty picnic tables at Phoenix's
Encanto Park on its busiest picnic day of the year. Some families
huddled under tarps but a few just ignored the cold and hid eggs in
the wet grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so bad,'' said Brenda Mendez, 8, as she peeled the
colorful shell off a boiled egg. ``It's better than having to hide
them in the house, this is harder,'' said the second-grader from
Washington Elementary School, who came to the park with her family.
</P>
<P>
   While Phoenix-area residents were challenged to find indoor
activities for out-of-town guests, those in northern Arizona faced
even bigger problems.
</P>
<P>
   Chains were required for drivers on Interstates 17 and 40 near
Flagstaff where 9 inches of snow set down Sunday. That brings the
month's total to 29 inches, the same amount at the city got all
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona University canceled today's classes to keep
students who traveled home for Easter weekend off the roads.
University officials will decide Tuesday at 6 a.m. when to re-open.
</P>
<P>
   Sedona got a record 8 inches, said Darren McCollum, a
meteorologist with the weather service's Flagstaff office.
</P>
<P>
   East of Phoenix, two adults and six children found themselves
stranded in the wilderness off Arizona 87 near Four Peaks when
their van got stuck in the snow, the Maricopa County Sheriff's
Office reported. The group was camping, had food and heat, and
wasn't in danger, deputies said. A snow plow will clear the road,
and the eight were expected back in town late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The three spring storms that hit are surprising, forecasters
say, though not unheard of. The high snow totals occur about five
times every 100 years, McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first storm was amazing, the second was too, but to get
three, that's another thing,'' he said. ``But to think we might get
another _ wow.'' &QL;

DRUGS LINKED TO KILLING OF 3: FAKE BOOBY TRAPS DIDN'T DETER KILLER
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The wires hung from windows, walls and ceiling were
supposed to look like booby traps set to snare any would-be
thieves. But the decoys didn't stop someone from shooting three
people to death Sunday inside the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Parks, 37, and his sister, Shelly Parks, 33, died in the
living room of the apartment, police said. A third man, whom police
did not identify, was found shot to death in a back bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Wires were strung menacingly throughout the apartment, and the
bomb squad spent an hour looking for tripwires or any explosives
before detectives entered to gather evidence, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the family were afraid to go into there for fear of booby
traps,'' said Lt. Mike DeBenedetto, head of the bomb squad.
</P>
<P>
   All the wire ended up being stereo wire _ some actually hooked
up to speakers but most hooked up to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, police said they found drugs they believe were sold
at the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   DeBenedetto said drug dealers will sometimes put the word on the
street that their places are booby-trapped to prevent thefts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a surveillance camera trained on the front room where
the Parks siblings were found, DeBenedetto said. The monitor for
the camera was in the bedroom where the unidentified man died, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The camera was also hooked to a VCR, but there was no tape
inside it, DeBenedetto said.
</P>
<P>
   A yellow flier posted on the front window warned in red letters,
``Continuous Video Taping.'' There was a faded ``Beware of Dog''
sign on the door frame, but there was no dog inside. Black tape
held wire to one window. The other front window was covered in
aluminium foil.
</P>
<P>
   The patio held furniture, tools and bicycles. A tag on one of
the bikes read, ``$160 obo.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend found the bodies just before 7 a.m. Sunday, police
said. Neighbors said they heard shots and screams around 3 a.m.,
but didn't call 911, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Stone, 45, who lives across a courtyard from the
apartment, described the apartment's occupants as ``long-hair
types, but they were pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said he asked one of the men, whom he described as a
``Harley-Davidson type'' what all the stuff was on the patio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he bought and sold things and that's how he made
money,'' Stone said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said he didn't notice an unusual amount of traffic in and
out of the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any noise,'' he said. ``If they partied, they
did it quietly.'' &QL;

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ NATO cruise missiles and bombers struck
Serbia hard again early on Monday morning, the 13th day of the
bombing campaign, with targets ranging from the air force
headquarters in Zemun, in greater Belgrade, to a factory in Nis,
the Serbian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
   State television urged viewers to remain in air raid shelters in
case of further strikes on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   According to the television, there were also new attacks at
Belgrade's Surcin airport, 10 miles from the city, and Pristina's
Slatina airport, which have both civilian and military landing
strips.
</P>
<P>
   A civil defense headquarters at Raska, 100 miles southwest of
Belgrade, was also hit. The most spectacular television footage was
from Nis, where huge flames were seen rising high above trees at an
unspecified industrial facility.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m. anti-aircraft fire was visible in the skies over
central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were the latest in a widening series of strikes all
over Serbia on civilian as well as military infrastructure. The
official Yugoslav news media reported Sunday that at least 4
civilians had been killed and 17 wounded in the strikes overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens of Belgrade interviewed Sunday expressed new
concern about how long the bombing would last, how many civilian
targets NATO would hit and how the war would end.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns were more widespread among older people who
remember World War II. One of them, a skittish retiree of 68 named
Bojan, returning from church with a sprig of willow on the Orthodox
Palm Sunday, asked that his surname not be used. ``There is more
fear today, that NATO will hit anywhere,'' he said. He also
suggested that his friends ``are more afraid to talk about politics
and to make political jokes on the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, central Belgrade filled again on Sunday
afternoon with thousands of people attending the daily anti-NATO
rock concert and wearing the target symbol that has swept the city.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there was no official word about military or civilian
casualties in Kosovo, where NATO is trying to stop Serbian forces
from destroying the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and forcing more
ethnic Albanian citizens to flee.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no official response to charges made Sunday by
the NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, that television footage of a
meeting said to have taken place on Thursday in Belgrade between
President Slobodan Milosevic and the pacifist ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova had been faked from footage taken two years
ago. Shea said Rugova remained under house arrest in Pristina, the
Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   Given that there was no sound track for the footage, there were
immediate doubts about what Rugova had said, and even whether the
meeting had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry officials, asked on Friday whether there was
any doubt that the two men had met, scoffed at the idea, but a
request to interview Rugova went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an official government statement referred to the
meeting, saying, ``After the Milosevic-Rugova meeting, there is a
strengthening conviction of the people of Kosovo that this crisis
can be solved through political means.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, NATO planes struck bridges, fuel depots, a heating
plant, an oil refinery and a Interior Ministry academy in Belgrade
said to be used for the instruction of high-ranking intelligence
officials. A military hospital near the academy suffered broken
windows, but apparently there were no further casualties among the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   NATO missiles also smashed the Pancevo oil refinery, some 10
miles northeast of Belgrade, killing two refinery workers and
wounding four others, the official Tanjug news agency reported
Sunday. Three more people were reported wounded when a fuel depot
near the town of Kraljevo, 75 miles south of Belgrade, was also
hit.
</P>
<P>
   A 73-year-old woman was killed and seven people were wounded in
another NATO attack _ the third so far _ on the Sloboda factory in
the industrial town of Cacak, 50 miles south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, NATO also destroyed a heating plant in the New
Belgrade district, across the Sava River from the old city center,
filling the sky with flame from a burning fuel storage depot. Three
people were wounded at the plant, according to official media, and
supplies of hot water to thousands of people were cut. A police
academy in the Banjica suburb was also destroyed, but there were no
reported casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday about 8 p.m., NATO destroyed a second bridge over
the Danube River at Novi Sad, leaving only one railway bridge. The
Beta news agency said that cars were using the bridge when a
central span was destroyed, and that seven people on the bridge at
the time were badly wounded. On Sunday, boats ferried people across
the river.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also damaged another Danube River bridge at Backa Palanka,
near the Croatian border.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav media also sharply criticized NATO-led forces in
Bosnia for destroying a railroad link between Serbia and
Montenegro.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 4, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kosovo-related stories &LR;  (Moving in the `i' category):
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ORTHODOX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The NATO attack on Serbia has
provoked strong opposition from many Eastern Orthodox Christians
and nations, raising the question whether there is in fact an
`Orthodox world' in the East that differs fundamentally from the
West in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks
not as a moral crusade against a clear evil, but as a hypocritical
Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox nation. By Serge
Schmemann. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWELL-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Powell Doctrine was a
strict and cautious policy _ espoused by Gen. Colin Powell when he
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _ holding that the U.S.
should intervene militarily only when its vital interests are at
stake, only with decisive force, and only when there is a clear
goal and a defined strategy for getting out. After the 1991 Gulf
war, this idea was discarded as a post-Vietnam relic unsuited to
today's world. But the debacle in Kosovo is suddenly making
Powell's principles look more attractive. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HITECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slobodan Milosevic must be
laughing at U.S. threats to use high technology to hold him
accountable. Three years after the U.S. vowed to uncover evidence
of mass executions at Srebrenica, it seems clear that there are
limits to U.S. technology and that technology can be rendered
superfluous if it is used to mask a lack of political will. By
David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BALKANS-OUTLOOK-REVIEW _ Early summary: some
prognistications on what the Balkan region may be like two or three
years from now. By Roger Cohen. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other stories &LR;  (Moving in the `a' category):
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNITY-POLICING-REVIEW (Undated) _ New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has ostentatiously rejected proposals to implement
community policing, deriding such programs as turning police
officers into social workers. But, perhaps to Giuliani's surprise,
community policing is alive and working successfully in many
cities, from Chicago to San Diego and from Fort Wayne to Fort
Worth. By Fox Butterfield. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-PRIVACY-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Hidden in the
Microsoft Word document that carried the Melissa virus around the
world was an innocuous serial number that may help identify the
computer with which the program was written. It is a powerful
illustration of how technology has growing power for promoting both
good and evil, and is the heart of arguments over tradeoffs between
individual privacy rights and the common good. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The trustees report'
extending the projected solvency of Social Security and Medicare by
a few years was political manna for Congress. It made the problem
seem less urgent and provided an excuse for postponing tough
decisions until after the next elections. But demographic data
buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the matter cannot be
put off indefinitely. By David E. Rosenbaum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-MCGWIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up.
Expecting another `Can you hit 70 home runs again?'
question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis slugger was treated to the
first-ever reverse interview: He got to put questions to other
people, for a change. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   DEPORT-VETERANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent laws requiring the
deportation of resident aliens for minor offenses are being
challenged by supporters of several U.S. military veterans who face
expulsion under the law. Through legal challenges and a publicity
campaign on behalf of the veterans (at least one of who is disabled
due to combat wounds) the law's opponents are targeting what they
hope will prove to be its Achilles' heel: its extreme
inflexibility. By Mirta Ojita.
</P>
<P>
   SATIRICAL-WEBSITES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at Web sites that
make fun of companies. The sites allow disgruntled consumers to
express themselves. The target companies don't seem to see the
humor in this, so they're fighting back with their most familiar
weapon: money. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing industry _ no
stranger to overstatement _ has for a long time been cranking out
multitudes of `bibles' on popular subjects _ the Barbecue Bible,
the Bartender's Bible, etc.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The confusion over the definition of
a blue moon, and some other highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Many middle-aged and elderly
Japanese must struggle through what seems like an endless language
school. In restaurants, in stores, in newspapers, on TV and in
conversation with young people, they find themselves bewildered by
what seems like an explosion of English and other foreign-language
terms. By Nicholas D. Kristof. WITH GRAPHIC.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 4, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kosovo-related stories &LR;  (Moving in the `i' category):
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ORTHODOX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The NATO attack on Serbia has
provoked strong opposition from many Eastern Orthodox Christians
and nations, raising the question whether there is in fact an
`Orthodox world' in the East that differs fundamentally from the
West in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks
not as a moral crusade against a clear evil, but as a hypocritical
Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox nation. By Serge
Schmemann. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWELL-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Powell Doctrine was a
strict and cautious policy _ espoused by Gen. Colin Powell when he
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _ holding that the U.S.
should intervene militarily only when its vital interests are at
stake, only with decisive force, and only when there is a clear
goal and a defined strategy for getting out. After the 1991 Gulf
war, this idea was discarded as a post-Vietnam relic unsuited to
today's world. But the debacle in Kosovo is suddenly making
Powell's principles look more attractive. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HITECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slobodan Milosevic must be
laughing at U.S. threats to use high technology to hold him
accountable. Three years after the U.S. vowed to uncover evidence
of mass executions at Srebrenica, it seems clear that there are
limits to U.S. technology and that technology can be rendered
superfluous if it is used to mask a lack of political will. By
David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BALKANS-OUTLOOK-REVIEW _ Early summary: some
prognistications on what the Balkan region may be like two or three
years from now. By Roger Cohen. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other stories &LR;  (Moving in the `a' category):
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNITY-POLICING-REVIEW (Undated) _ New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has ostentatiously rejected proposals to implement
community policing, deriding such programs as turning police
officers into social workers. But, perhaps to Giuliani's surprise,
community policing is alive and working successfully in many
cities, from Chicago to San Diego and from Fort Wayne to Fort
Worth. By Fox Butterfield. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-PRIVACY-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Hidden in the
Microsoft Word document that carried the Melissa virus around the
world was an innocuous serial number that may help identify the
computer with which the program was written. It is a powerful
illustration of how technology has growing power for promoting both
good and evil, and is the heart of arguments over tradeoffs between
individual privacy rights and the common good. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The trustees report'
extending the projected solvency of Social Security and Medicare by
a few years was political manna for Congress. It made the problem
seem less urgent and provided an excuse for postponing tough
decisions until after the next elections. But demographic data
buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the matter cannot be
put off indefinitely. By David E. Rosenbaum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-MCGWIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up.
Expecting another `Can you hit 70 home runs again?'
question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis slugger was treated to the
first-ever reverse interview: He got to put questions to other
people, for a change. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   DEPORT-VETERANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent laws requiring the
deportation of resident aliens for minor offenses are being
challenged by supporters of several U.S. military veterans who face
expulsion under the law. Through legal challenges and a publicity
campaign on behalf of the veterans (at least one of who is disabled
due to combat wounds) the law's opponents are targeting what they
hope will prove to be its Achilles' heel: its extreme
inflexibility. By Mirta Ojita.
</P>
<P>
   SATIRICAL-WEBSITES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at Web sites that
make fun of companies. The sites allow disgruntled consumers to
express themselves. The target companies don't seem to see the
humor in this, so they're fighting back with their most familiar
weapon: money. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing industry _ no
stranger to overstatement _ has for a long time been cranking out
multitudes of `bibles' on popular subjects _ the Barbecue Bible,
the Bartender's Bible, etc.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The confusion over the definition of
a blue moon, and some other highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Many middle-aged and elderly
Japanese must struggle through what seems like an endless language
school. In restaurants, in stores, in newspapers, on TV and in
conversation with young people, they find themselves bewildered by
what seems like an explosion of English and other foreign-language
terms. By Nicholas D. Kristof. WITH GRAPHIC.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BRINGING OUT THE DEAD &LR;  By Joe Connelly. Vintage Contemporaries,
$12. Frank Pierce, a paramedic working the night shift in the
Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York, is driven to emotional
exhaustion by the brutal world he witnesses. Last year in The New
York Times Book Review, Charley Rosen called this ``a stunning
first novel'' and praised ``the vigorous rhythms of Connelly's
writing _ the poetry of broken bodies and broken lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILD THOUGHTS FROM WILD PLACES &LR;  By David Quammen.
Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13. This collection of magazine
articles covers a lot of territory _ from the Missouri River to
Tasmania to Chile _ but is grounded in the author's reverence for
the natural world. ``Quammen easily passes the acid test of any
essayist: He is a good companion,'' James Gorman wrote in 1998.
``He has a wide range of knowledge, an agile pen and a generous
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RED HOURGLASS: LIVES OF THE PREDATORS &LR;  By Gordon Grice.
Delta, $11.95. This is an arrestingly macabre ode to rattlesnakes,
black widow spiders, tarantulas, jackals and other creepy critters.
Grice ``combines the observations of a naturalist with a dry,
homespun philosopher's wit,'' Richard Bernstein wrote last year in
The New York Times. ``This is first-rate, unsentimental writing
about nature and about the ways that human beings try to cope with
the most terrible cruelties that nature offers up.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PACK OF CARDS: AND OTHER STORIES &LR;  By Penelope Lively. Grove,
$13. A young intellectual and his materialistic girlfriend, a
sharp-eyed grandmother visiting her daughter in London and an
agoraphobic housewife are among the characters featured in these
realistic, small-bore tales of British life in the Thatcher years.
``Lively writes beautifully, with meticulous detachment,'' Jay
Parini wrote in 1989. ``The stories ... are uniformly entertaining
and, often, inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued the author's first novel,  &UR; THE
ROAD TO LICHFIELD &LR;  ($12), in which a 40-year-old suburban mother
traveling back and forth to an English village to tend to her dying
father falls in love with one of his neighbors. In 1991 Ellen Pall
called this ``a homey, companionable book'' that is ``concerned
with time and memory.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CHILDREN &LR;  By David Halberstam. Fawcett/Ballantine, $17.95.
The author, who was a young reporter in Nashville, Tenn., in the
1950s, tells the story of the black college students there whose
protests were instrumental in igniting the civil rights movement.
The result is a ``powerful, densely packed'' narrative, David M.
Oshinsky wrote last year. ``There is much to admire in Halberstam's
book.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; KILLING THE DREAM: JAMES EARL RAY AND THE ASSASSINATION OF
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. &LR; , by Gerald Posner (Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$15), the writer who attacked Kennedy conspiracy theories in ``Case
Closed'' takes on Ray's claim of innocence in the 1968 murder of
King. This skeptical account is ``a model of investigation,
meticulous in its discovery and presentation of evidence,'' Anthony
Lewis wrote in 1998. ``And it is a wonderfully readable book, as
gripping as a first-class detective story.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KALIMANTAAN &LR;  By C.S. Godshalk. Owl/Holt, $14. In the 19th
century, a young Englishman is driven by his idealized love for his
dead mother to create his own private raj in Borneo and help the
British government expand its trading empire. This is ``a first
novel of formidable imaginative power,'' Annette Kobak wrote in
1998. ```Kalimantaan' is the work of a born storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: A LIFE &LR;  By Roxana Robinson. University Press
of New England, $19.95. This authorized biography chronicles the
artist's long life and career and ``does much to give body to the
O'Keeffe myth,'' Hayden Herrera wrote in 1989. ``The author
presents a person who was both vulnerable and fierce, passionate
and coolly withholding, sensuous yet oddly unsexual.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DARKNESS VISIBLE &LR;  By William Golding. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$13. This disturbing novel explores the intertwined fates of a boy
hideously scarred during the London blitz and a set of beautiful
twins scarred by their father's icy neglect. ``Golding's magical
fable ... draws us with seductive words into a vision of elemental
reality so vivid we seem to hallucinate the scenes,'' John Thompson
wrote in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAFE EUROPA: LIFE AFTER COMMUNISM &LR;  By Slavenka Drakulic.
Penguin, $12.95. In these essays, a Croatian journalist finds a
metaphor for the daunting problems of Eastern Europe in the bad
teeth of her friends and relatives. ```Cafe Europa' ... is studded
with such everyday observations that open out, like windows, to
reveal wide-angled historical vistas,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in
The New York Times in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNEXPECTED SALAMI &LR;  By Laurie Gwen Shapiro. Algonquin,
$10.95. At the center of this 1990s screwball comedy are a spoiled
New Yorker, her Aussie bass-player boyfriend and his ex-bandmate, a
recovering heroin addict who is taken in by a Jewish-Italian family
in New York. It all makes for an ``endearingly quirky first
novel,'' Anthony Bourdain wrote last year.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

FINALLY, COMEUPPANCE FOR MOTORISTS WHO WON'T HANG UP AND DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooklyn (no, not that Brooklyn; the one in Ohio near Cleveland)
has done a marvelous thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove all communities everywhere to follow suit.
Brooklyn has banned the use of cellular phones by people driving
cars. Well, almost. The newly passed ordinance says it's a minor
misdemeanor for a driver to use a cell phone unless both hands are
on the wheel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The law makes an exception for ``emergencies,'' which I take to
be something more serious than needing to order pizza for your
Dow10K party. And the Solons of Brooklyn will let you use a car
phone if the transmission is in ``park'' or if you use a
speakerphone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not know how many accidents car phones cause, but surely
more than they get blamed for. I do know that most drivers can't
even drive and breathe at the same time without losing
concentration. Driving and telecommunicating is altogether beyond
the capacity of most humans to sustain safely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I applaud the eminent good sense of the leaders of Brooklyn
and I suggest this is a battle all people of good will should
join. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would be progress, in fact, if, as a start, we could simply
get all the other Brooklyns in this country to adopt similar
ordinances. Besides the Brooklyn in Ohio _ and the one in New York
I alluded to in the opening paragraph of this remarkably sensible
column _ you will find Brooklyns in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Maryland, Michigan and Mississippi, to say nothing of
Brooklyn Center and Brooklyn Park, both in Minnesota. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can find them if, that is, you know where to look for
them. Some of them _ like my essay on ``How Al Gore Invented the
Internet'' _ don't take up much space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But while we're trying to spread the no-car-phones movement, I
think we should not neglect several other modern automobile
hazards, annoyances and idiocies that need reform. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, is there no municipal statesperson anywhere in the
country with the chutzpah and foresight to lead the drive for an
ordinance that would ban the playing of any car radio, tape deck or
CD player that can be heard anywhere outside that very car? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the city council of my own community would adopt that
ordinance, I would speak kindly of its members for years. And the
best part is that my honorific words might actually be heard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and while we're banning various appliances and distracting
car devices, let's make it illegal for drivers to shave, apply
makeup or consume a six-course dinner while cruising the highways.
Please, people, the person you kill while edging your sideburns,
lipsticking your mouth or devouring a leg of ram might be me. And I
would take a very dim view of such an outcome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, can we please get rid of stupid bumper stickers and
``Knucklehead on Board'' signs that demand our attention as we come
up behind or alongside other cars? We already have way too much
information flowing our way from way too many sources. There is no
public demand at all for you to tell us via a bumper sticker what
your position is on Kosovo or nuclear waste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy you've developed a position on Kosovo. So have I. But
if it can be contained on a bumper sticker, it's so amazingly
moronic and meaningless that you should not want to advertise and
reveal its nincompoopness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if I see such an annoying bumper sticker on your car, I
will pull off the road, find a pay phone, ring your car phone and
tell you how dumb it is. If you're stupid enough to answer while
driving, I win the point. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Blues Over Blue Moons
</P>
<P>
   That howling heard last week was probably just the neighborhood
dogs sounding off at the full moon, the second in March _ and thus,
by common understanding, a blue one. Then again, it could have been
a reaction to the disclosure by the venerable astronomy magazine
Sky &AMP; Telescope that the common understanding of blue moons was
based on a misunderstanding, perpetrated by the magazine 53 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Sky &AMP; Telescope writer with an apparently hazy memory was at
fault, the magazine said. Writing in 1946, he recalled a reference
to blue moons from an edition of the Maine Farmers' Almanac from
the 1930s. But his recollection was incomplete. ``He heard the
phrase `13 full moons in a year' and made, I'd guess you'd call it,
an error,'' said Donald Olson, a Texas astronomer who researched
the mistake. ``He inferred incorrectly that there must be a month
with two, and that the second of the month was called the blue
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what the almanac's editors were thinking, Olson
determined. To them, a blue moon was an extra moon in a season,
which normally has three. If the writer had checked the almanac, he
would have quickly realized the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Moon lovers can rest easy, however. They may have lost one blue
moon in March (and another in January, which had made this year a
two-blue-moon special), but they gained one in February 2000.

   A Crowd-Pleasing Campaign
</P>
<P>
   New York City transit officials had a short-lived and, in the
end, ill-advised idea to make the trains run on time: Ordering
subway conductors not to use the word ``please'' in announcements
over the public-address system. As in, ``Please stand clear of the
closing doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the officials dropped the idea in the face of protests from
riders. After all, even in New York there has been a trend toward
customer-friendly civility: Toll collectors have been ordered to
say, ``Thank you,'' and taxis blast cheery fasten-your-seat belt
reminders by celebrities like Sally Jessy Raphael and Paul Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   As for the subways, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
was trying to solve a system-wide problem arising from a boom in
ridership. No, not the problem of incomprehensible announcements.
(That remains a problem, though: The agency's own surveys indicate
that only 3 in 5 announcements come through loud and clear.) This
time, the issue was time: The MTA calculated that dropping the word
``please'' would save several seconds at each stop, or several
minutes on each run. Pressed to provide more service, the agency
saw shorter announcements as a way to clear the way for the next
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every second counts,'' said Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the
transit agency. ``In some stations at some times of the day, it
would take longer to make the announcements than to get the
passengers on and off.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule-conscious agency does not want conductors turning
mundane announcements into Shakespeare (``To close, or not to
close, that is the question''). So conductors are being told to
stick to the script, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're taking away, stylistically, is the freedom
conductors had to become flowery and descriptive,'' O'Leary said.

   Dow Finishes Above 10,000 Before Getting a Hangover
</P>
<P>
   The trek of the Dow Jones industrial average has looked like an
assault on Everest lately _ a steady march toward the summit for
its select group of 30 stocks, leaving most of the others behind at
base camp.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of near misses, the Dow finally finished above the
magical _ but essentially meaningless _ 10,000 level on Monday. The
achievement brought cheers on Wall Street and the biggest headline
in The Wall Street Journal since the outbreak of the gulf war. But
the celebration was short-lived: The index fell back on Tuesday and
finished the week at 9832, only slightly above its level a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most stocks remain far below record levels. Nearly 9
out of 10 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange are more
than 10 percent below their record highs. And on the same day the
Dow peaked, twice as many Big Board stocks fell to new lows as hit
new highs.

   After weeks of protests calling for their arrest and indictment,
the four New York City police officers whose 41 shots killed an
unarmed African immigrant Feb. 4 were suspended from duty and
arraigned on charges of second-degree murder and reckless
endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss
and Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming
from the death of Amadou Diallo. Bronx District Attorney Robert
Johnson, demanded that the officers be put in custody, but the
judge set bail at $100,000 each, which the officers posted. Now the
real waiting begins: it could be a year or longer before a trial
starts.

   $81 Million Smoking Verdict
</P>

   In another legal setback for the tobacco industry, an Oregon
state jury awarded $81 million to the family of a man who smoked
Marlboro cigarettes for 40 years before his death.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a California state jury ordered the Philip Morris
Companies, the maker of Marlboro, to pay $51.5 million in another
case brought by a smoker. Both awards involved largely punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The release of damaging tobacco company documents in recent
years is cited by experts as one factor behind the verdicts. And
analysts predict more legal setbacks for producers in the future.

   Prison for Baptist Leader
</P>
<P>
   The former president of the National Baptist Convention, the
nation's largest black religious organization, was sentenced to
five and a half years in prison for swindles that brought him more
than $4 million during his tenure. The Rev. Henry Lyons, 57, who
was also ordered to repay almost $2.5 million, was convicted in
February of selling bogus convention membership lists to companies
seeking to do business with the group's members.
</P>
<P>
   He was also convicted of stealing nearly $250,000 donated by a
Jewish organization to rebuild Southern black churches destroyed by
arson. Apologizing for that crime, Lyons told the judge, ``It
stinks in God's nostrils, and I know it stinks in the law's
nostrils, and it stinks in mine.''

   Doubts on Bottled Water
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend about $4 billion a year on bottled water. Is it
worth it? Not from the standpoint of purity or healthfulness, says
the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   The group tested about a thousand bottles of water, sampling
more than a hundred brands. While most of the water was fine, in
many bottles the tests detected traces of microbial or chemical
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no assurance that bottled water is any safer than tap
water,'' the council said in its report.
</P>
<P>
   The group is seeking tougher regulations and better labeling.

   Eskimos Get a New Land
</P>
<P>
   Existing maps of North America became outdated with the addition
of a new territory called Nunavut in the far reaches of Canada's
icy north. Roughly the same size as Mexico, the region has only
27,000 people (85 percent of them Eskimos, or Inuit) in 28
communities. Caribou outnumber people 28 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   The new government, led by Inuit, faces enormous challenges.
With few industries or natural resources in the territory, the
fledgling bureaucracy is the only sure source of new jobs to combat
the region's high unemployment.

   Missile Defense Fails Test
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth time in a row, the Pentagon's experimental missile
defense system flunked its most basic test and failed to intercept
a missile, forcing engineers at Lockheed Martin back to the drawing
board and costing the company $15 million in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The United States hopes to eventually deploy the defense system
in Japan, South Korea and possibly Taiwan _ a prospect that has
infuriated China. But the latest failure shows how far such a
system is from reality.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.9 billion program began in the early 1990's and has had a
nearly unending series of setbacks. Lockheed has two more chances
to pass the test or face another $20 million in penalties.

   Dow Finishes Above 10,000 Before Getting a Hangover
</P>
<P>
   The trek of the Dow Jones industrial average has looked like an
assault on Everest lately _ a steady march toward the summit for
its select group of 30 stocks, leaving most of the others behind at
base camp.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of near misses, the Dow finally finished above the
magical _ but essentially meaningless _ 10,000 level on Monday. The
achievement brought cheers on Wall Street and the biggest headline
in The Wall Street Journal since the outbreak of the gulf war. But
the celebration was short-lived: The index fell back on Tuesday and
finished the week at 9832, only slightly above its level a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most stocks remain far below record levels. Nearly 9
out of 10 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange are more
than 10 percent below their record highs. And on the same day the
Dow peaked, twice as many Big Board stocks fell to new lows as hit
new highs.

   Pleas in Diallo Case
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of protests calling for their arrest and indictment,
the four New York City police officers whose 41 shots killed an
unarmed African immigrant Feb. 4 were suspended from duty and
arraigned on charges of second-degree murder and reckless
endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss
and Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming
from the death of Amadou Diallo. Bronx District Attorney Robert
Johnson, demanded that the officers be put in custody, but the
judge set bail at $100,000 each, which the officers posted. Now the
real waiting begins: it could be a year or longer before a trial
starts.

   $81 Million Smoking Verdict
</P>
<P>
   In another legal setback for the tobacco industry, an Oregon
state jury awarded $81 million to the family of a man who smoked
Marlboro cigarettes for 40 years before his death.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a California state jury ordered the Philip Morris
Companies, the maker of Marlboro, to pay $51.5 million in another
case brought by a smoker. Both awards involved largely punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The release of damaging tobacco company documents in recent
years is cited by experts as one factor behind the verdicts. And
analysts predict more legal setbacks for producers in the future.

   Prison for Baptist Leader
</P>
<P>
   The former president of the National Baptist Convention, the
nation's largest black religious organization, was sentenced to
five and a half years in prison for swindles that brought him more
than $4 million during his tenure. The Rev. Henry Lyons, 57, who
was also ordered to repay almost $2.5 million, was convicted in
February of selling bogus convention membership lists to companies
seeking to do business with the group's members.
</P>
<P>
   He was also convicted of stealing nearly $250,000 donated by a
Jewish organization to rebuild Southern black churches destroyed by
arson. Apologizing for that crime, Lyons told the judge, ``It
stinks in God's nostrils, and I know it stinks in the law's
nostrils, and it stinks in mine.''

   Doubts on Bottled Water
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend about $4 billion a year on bottled water. Is it
worth it? Not from the standpoint of purity or healthfulness, says
the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   The group tested about a thousand bottles of water, sampling
more than a hundred brands. While most of the water was fine, in
many bottles the tests detected traces of microbial or chemical
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no assurance that bottled water is any safer than tap
water,'' the council said in its report.
</P>
<P>
   The group is seeking tougher regulations and better labeling.

   Eskimos Get a New Land

   Existing maps of North America became outdated with the addition
of a new territory called Nunavut in the far reaches of Canada's
icy north. Roughly the same size as Mexico, the region has only
27,000 people (85 percent of them Eskimos, or Inuit) in 28
communities. Caribou outnumber people 28 to 1.

   The new government, led by Inuit, faces enormous challenges.
With few industries or natural resources in the territory, the

   Missile Defense Fails Test

<P>
   For the sixth time in a row, the Pentagon's experimental missile
defense system flunked its most basic test and failed to intercept
a missile, forcing engineers at Lockheed Martin back to the drawing
board and costing the company $15 million in penalties.
</P>

   The United States hopes to eventually deploy the defense system
in Japan, South Korea and possibly Taiwan _ a prospect that has

   BERLIN _ All is dark again in southeast Europe. Close your eyes
and those long lines of ragged ethnic Albanian refugees traipsing
out of Kosovo fuse with so many other processions of the Balkan
bedraggled: 1 million Greeks out of Turkey in 1923, 500,000 Turks
out of Greece in the same year, over 750,000 Muslims out of Bosnia
in 1992, and 175,000 Serbs out of Croatia in 1995. Where will it
end?
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, confusion seemed
absolute. A war begun to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to agree to a peace plan offering autonomy to Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians had become a battle to stop him from evicting all
those Albanians under cover of the mayhem of NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO air campaign with limited goals about a place the size of
Connecticut had begun to look like a full-scale war whose true
target was Milosevic _ and whose potential to spread to Macedonia
and Albania seemed real as more than 200,000 Kosovo refugees
staggered across their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Another somber possibility was that the alliance itself could be
threatened by the ignominy of failure on the eve of what had been
billed as a glorious 50th birthday party this month at a gathering
in Washington. ``The credibility of the alliance has been heavily
damaged,'' commented Christoph Bertram in the German weekly Die
Zeit. ``And it is a bitter irony that in the beginning it was
concern for this credibility that was the decisive factor behind
the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   That attack has now gained an unpredictable momentum. ``To say
we are not at war seems to me a statement too ridiculous even to
refute,'' said Gen. William Odom of the Hudson Institute. ``And
wars, as von Clausewitz noted, are acts of force to compel our
enemies to do our will. So let's get on with it before the
president inadvertently tears up our alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   But America's will seemed unclear, even on such fundamental
issues as whether to terrorize or talk to Milosevic, and what
degree of independence Kosovo should have.
</P>
<P>
   A number of outcomes now seem possible, but one trend is
inescapable: The history of the Balkans since the beginning of the
19th century is broadly that of the emergence of nation states.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires, and
later the multinational state of Yugoslavia, smaller countries of
peoples claiming the same language, religion and culture have
emerged. The process began with Greece, which rose against the
Ottomans in 1821 and gained independence in 1930. More recently,
the process has brought the establishment of Slovenia and Croatia
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the intermittently bloody unscrambling of mixed
populations who often had scant sense of ``nationality'' has been
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The trend seems unlikely to stop. It suggests that the
truncated, surviving Yugoslav federation is unlikely to fare better
than its far larger predecessor. One day, Kosovo and Montenegro
will probably go their own ways, allowing Serbia, at last, to
proclaim itself once more a nation state, as it was in the 19th
century. But in the interim, many scenarios seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   The first critical issue, officials said, is whether to keep a
diplomatic channel open to Milosevic that might permit some
salvaging of an accord on autonomy for Kosovo. For now, the channel
remains, meager and reduced further by each new reported Serbian
atrocity against the ethnic Albanians, but not entirely abandoned.
``We have yet to make the final break,'' said Ron Neitzke, the
former deputy chief of mission in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no clear decision has been made to go for
Milosevic's overthrow. Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, a top NATO
general, did say that ``we clearly intend to loosen his grip on
power and break his will to continue.'' But only with Saturday's
bombing of the Serbian Interior Ministry in Belgrade did the
alliance begin to appear ready to place Milosevic's jugular in its
sights.
</P>
<P>
   What could further radicalize this NATO approach? Perhaps a
revelation of large-scale Serbian executions of the many missing
ethnic Albanian men of fighting age. Or gross Serbian mistreatment
of the three U.S. soldiers captured last week.
</P>
<P>
   Another catalyst could be reliable intelligence suggesting that
resistance to Milosevic in the army and security forces is rising
fast, so that only a coup de grace is needed. Or a further
deepening of the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, NATO might intensify its bombing of Belgrade and
also bomb the Yugoslav fleet on the presumption that a navy without
a fleet is likely to get extremely restive. President Clinton could
turn up the propaganda war by appealing directly to the Serbian
people to rise against Milosevic because he has brought them to
ruin. Major resources could be invested in stirring Montengrin
restiveness, already strong.
</P>
<P>
   All these measures could undermine Milosevic. Whether they would
remove him is another matter. Milosevic has shown extraordinary
resilience even as he has unleashed waves of destruction. After so
much time, and so much propaganda, what democratic Serbian forces
may lie concealed in his shadow is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What does seem clear, however, is that it will be
extraordinarily difficult for Kosovo's Albanian leaders to agree
now to any accord with the man who has terrorized them. In this
sense, Milosevic's removal may eventually favor a diplomatic
settlement structured around Kosovan autonomy, at least as a first
stage, or a Serbian-Albanian partition of the province.
</P>
<P>
   But as Richard Holbrooke, who long negotiated with the Serbian
strongman, has observed, Milosevic ``likes to pull rabbits out of
his hat.'' He might free the U.S. prisoners in the hope that the
gesture will stimulate opposition to NATO's bombing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He could try to work on the Greeks and Italians, who have
wavered in their support of the war. He could turn up the
propaganda of Serbian suffering in the hope that the once-pacifist
Green Party, now part of the German government, rediscovers its
roots and brings down the coalition of Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   None of these strategies seems likely to work. But what may
favor Milosevic, and undermine Western unity, is a widespread sense
that NATO has made serious errors. Political goals have been
constantly reformulated since the bombing began. A war to save an
international plan for autonomy formed at Rambouillot, France, may
be destroying that plan once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Most profoundly, NATO's efforts to take on new roles of crisis
management while avoiding the commitment of ground troops may be
the biggest risk. History does not suggest that air power alone can
drive out an army. The longer the conflict goes on, the more
strains in the alliance could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton has looked unusually determined of late.
The one million dead in Bosnia and Rwanda during the 1990s have
clearly had an effect on him. Where he long looked the other way in
Bosnia, he now seems ready to fight for Western values and against
the repetitive destruction wreaked on Europe by Milosevic in
Croatia, in Bosnia and now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week at the Norfolk Naval Air Station, the
President said he was determined to make Milosevic ``pay the price
of aggression and murder.'' He asked whether America could look the
other way ``as entire peoples in Europe are forced to abandon their
homelands or die.'' He said America could not stop every tragedy
but that this did not mean it should ``do nothing for no one.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still seemed entrenched in his rejection of the use of
ground troops, and that position may not hold over time. If
negotiation is impossible with Milosevic, the only way to ram home
the message may be to mass troops and tanks in Macedonia, or even
use the new NATO member, Hungary, as a base from which to send the
alliance's immense armored divisions rumbling over the plains to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Would the American people support such a move? From the
slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia in 1992 to the ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo today, there is much devastating ammunition that could be
marshalled to move public opinion. But perhaps the most convincing
argument would be the simple one expressed by Robert Hunter, a
former United States ambassador to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Milosevic is in power, we are not going to have
stability,'' Hunter said. ``He's the last of the Communist thugs
and he's standing in the way of what we want to do in Europe. What
we want, as George Bush put it, is a Europe whole and free.''
</P>
<P>
   A Europe, in other words, where the little nation states of the
Balkans, including perhaps Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, would
finally have completed the cycle of painful nation-building and
uprooting of populations begun so long ago. Then it might be free
to begin the long process of re-integration that has already made
irrelevant the border between two other former enemies in Europe,
Germany and France.

<P>
   THE ARCHER'S AND BOWHUNTER'S BIBLE (Doubleday Outdoor Bibles,
1993) by H. Lea Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``The display of dead animals isn't appreciated by
the public nor, for that matter, by most hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation: ``In many ways, the wily coyote could be classed as
the king of the varmints. It is intelligent, crafty, fast, rough
and, best of all from a varmint hunter's standpoint, numerous.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BARBECUE! BIBLE (Workman, 1998) by Steven Raichlen
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``Cleanliness may be next to godliness when it
comes to personal hygiene, but don't overdo it when it comes to
your grill.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation: Beer Can Chicken! ``This odd recipe makes some of
the most moist, succulent, flavorful barbecued chicken I've ever
tasted. The secret: an open can of beer is inserted into the cavity
of the bird. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   THE BARTENDER'S BIBLE (Harper Collins, 1991) by Gary Regan
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``Be forewarned. . . . There will always be someone
who wants a liqueur you don't have. You know, the one he drank on a
riverboat on the Ganges back in 1927; it tasted a little like
kirsch, except that it reminded him of cornflakes with sliced
bananas at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation: ``Within the book, drinks are listed alphabetically
under the predominant liquor in that drink. A Harvey Wallbanger is
listed under Vodka.''
</P>

   THE CHEESE BIBLE (Penguin Studio, 1998) by Christian Teubner
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``Tilsit and other semi-hard loaf-shaped cheeses
are cut into slices with a two-handled knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation (from the jacket blurb): ``The title of this book is
no idle boast, for it is  &UR; the &LR;  most complete and most beautifully
illustrated reference work on one of mankind's most popular foods.
The first chapter tells us exactly what cheese is and discusses the
methods of its production. The next chapter is a comprehensive
encyclopedia of cheeses from all around the world. After telling
the readers about Cheese in the Kitchen, the remainder of this
gorgeous book is devoted to the many imaginative ways that cheese
can be used.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CHOCOLATE BIBLE (Penguin Studio, 1997) by Christian Teubner
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``Macaroons and chocolate go together well.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation (from the jacket blurb): ``The title of this book is
no idle boast, for it is  &UR; the &LR;  most complete and most beautifully
illustrated reference work ever to be published on one of mankind's
most delectable foods. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   THE HOME DECORATOR'S BIBLE (Crown, 1996)
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``Clean off any paint that drips onto woodwork
immediately. It is easier to remove when it is still wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation: ``Color in particular is so much a part of our lives
that we often take it for granted _ until such time as we are
deprived of it. Not so long ago, visitors to the former Soviet
Union invariably remarked on how colorless the cities there seemed,
thanks to the absence of any street advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BIBLE OF KARATE: BUBISHI (Charles E. Tuttle, 1995)

the groin.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE PIE AND PASTRY BIBLE (Scribner, 1998) by Rose Levy
Beranbaum, also author of ``The Cake Bible''
</P>
<P>

the truth is I am more a pastry person!''
</P>
<P>
   THE ROSE BIBLE (Chronicle Books, 1998) by Rayford Clayton
Reddell
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``Pruning rules are made to be broken, such as the
number of canes left on a well-pruned bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelations:`` `President Herbert Hoover' is an eternally
popular bicolor. . . . `Sexy Rexy,' as its name would imply, has
proved to be a virile stud in current hybridizing trends.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOOTER'S BIBLE (Stoeger Publishing, 1998)
</P>

   Commandment: ``Ruffed grouse that offer hard and fast crossing
shots are invariably ahead of the muzzle, which means you must come
from behind and swing through the target.''

need to delete superfluous items through Taskbar Properties. Just
navigate to the item you want to prune, right-click it and pick
Delete.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation: ``Unlike DriveSpace, which plays tricks with
compression and slack space, FAT32 installs an entirely new _ and
significantly more space efficient _ filesystem that radically
decreases cluster size. By doing so, it alleviates the most
wasteful aspect of FAT16 and brings the FAT filesystem into sync
with the modern world of multi-gigabyte drives.''
</P>
<P>
   EARL MINDELL'S VITAMIN BIBLE (Warner Books, 1991)
</P>
<P>
   Commandment: ``If you're unsure as to whether you'd be better
off with a powder, a liquid, or a tablet, regular vitamin E or dry,
taking supplements three times a day or time released, my advice to
you is to experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation: `` `Spanish fly' is actually `cantharides' made from
the outer skeletons of beetles. It causes itching, but not
necessarily for sex.''

   If someone in Afghanistan were to title a cookbook ``The Koran
of Barbecue,'' it's a fair bet that the mullahs would show their
appreciation by employing its wisdom to roast the author himself on
the spit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things are different in America. Here the sacred and the
secular have mixed readily to bring forth biblical film
blockbusters featuring bad 1950s hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   And in that tradition, the publishing industry _ no stranger to
overstatement _ has for a long time been cranking out multitudes of
``bibles.'' Behold, an Easter assortment!

NEW COLLISION OF WEST AND EAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Americans who never gave much if any thought to Kosovo until
the terrible stories and images began to emerge of Albanians in
flight from an evil man called Slobodan Milosevic, it might have
come as something of a rude shock last week that other countries,
like Russia or Greece, seemed to actually see the United States and
NATO as the bad guys for bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his ever-shrinking Yugoslavia, after all, were
already responsible for infamous ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. And,
President Clinton explained, the United States had a moral
obligation to block them before the nastiness in Kosovo spilled
over and threatened Yugoslavia's neighbors, Europe itself and even
America's national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Russians were venting bitter fury at the United States as
Greek Orthodox leaders around the world condemned the bombing.
Russia demonstratively sent a spy ship into the Adriatic. The
ruling Synod of the Orthodox Church in Greece issued a statement
expressing ``pain at the military attacks against a heroic and
glorious Christian people, such as the Serbs.'' And very early on,
Greece was arguing within NATO councils for a quick end to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions raise the question of whether there is in fact an
Orthodox world in the East that differs fundamentally from the West
in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks not
as a morally justified crusade against a clear and present evil,
but as a hypocritical Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a poignant statement that circulated by e-mail among Orthodox
churches in America, Father Sava of the Serbian Orthodox Church _ a
church whose patriarch and bishops have consistently and
courageously opposed Milosevic _ bitterly derided the Western logic
for the bombing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic statements that the goal of this operation is to
prevent suffering of civilians are absolutely hypocritical and
tragic,'' the message said. ``President Clinton speaks sweet words
to the Serbian people while the bombers mercilessly destroy
schools, kindergartens and fill the hearts of children with hatred
against the peoples which they believed were their friends and
supporters of true peace and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such protests seem to support the thesis made popular by Samuel
P. Huntington of Harvard in his book ``The Clash of Civilizations
and the Remaking of World Order,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1996) that
the world is not moving inevitably toward Western values, as the
West's victory in the Cold War seemed to promise, but, on the
contrary, that it is moving toward a clash of cultures in which the
Western model is confronted by increasingly assertive civilizations
of the East _ Islamic, Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Orthodox
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo certainly has all the elements of a case in point: Here
is a democratic West, its humanitarian instincts repelled by the
barbarous inhumanity of the Orthodox Serbs, going to war on behalf
of largely Muslim Albanians, all to a chorus of denunciations from
the Orthodox world. The substance of the conflict may not be clear
to Americans, who persist in believing that the rest of the world
is ``like us,'' or at least should want to be, Huntington said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Europe and elsewhere people certainly recognize the
idea of dividing lines,'' he said. ``West Europeans know what West
Europe is; people in Orthodox countries know that however much they
want to be in the European Union, they are in a different world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly one of the fascinating things is the changing
pattern of alliances. Russia and Greece are very close now. There
is a substantial Russian presence on the Greek part of Cyprus,
Russia provided missiles to the Cypriot government, and Greece
actively supported Serbia in the Bosnian wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scholars agree that there is something to the notion of
viewing the Balkans as a fault line between Western and Eastern
civilizations. But as in all efforts to impose comprehensive
templates on specific conflicts, there are also problems. For one
thing, the Serb-Albanian conflict is more territorial and tribal
than cultural or religious. Xenophobic passions have been fanned to
murderous levels by dictators in the East, the West and everywhere
else, whether under Hitler or Hutu warlords. Russia's reactions
reflect not only support for southern Slavic Orthodox brothers _
who were seen as adversaries in the Soviet era _ but also
resentment at no longer being treated as a superpower. Greek
support reflects not only a shared confession but a shared history
of domination by the Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's attractive to see this as a lab for Huntington's
thesis,'' said Jaroslav Pelikan, professor emeritus of history at
Yale. ``If you put Muslim, Orthodox and Catholic into the mix in
Croatia, Bosnia and now this, it does seem to fit. But it gets
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of the journal Foreign Affairs,
where Huntington laid out his thesis in an article in 1993, agreed.
``I myself am always skeptical of such explanations,'' he said. ``I
find states somewhat less sentimental about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is hard to dispute that on the Eastern side, at least,
the anger at NATO's bombing is at least in part a reflection of a
deeper sense of difference and exclusion. The eastern borders of
NATO, Pelikan noted, are unmistakably similar to the division of
the Roman Empire under Diocletian in the 3rd century or the
separation of the Orthodox and Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
   The recent expansion of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the
Czech republic _ all Catholic or Protestant countries _ while
excluding the Orthodox states of Bulgaria and Romania affirmed a
sense that the West was promoting its own into its exclusive club.
The Poles, for example, have always insisted that their Catholicism
is their true membership card in the West, even if they are ethnic
cousins of the Russians.

</P>

</P>
<P>
   And while Greece is in NATO and the European Union, it has
always felt itself a junior member of the Western club, included
for geographical, not cultural, reasons. The Greeks know that they
were Byzantium, and that Orthodoxy's spiritual leader is a Greek
with the title of Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The
British philosopher Isaiah Berlin once noted that a trip from
Russia to Greece is not really going abroad.
</P>
<P>
   That history has served to inculcate in the Orthodox a sense of
uniqueness and otherness. The very word ``orthodoxy'' reflects a
sense that they are the bearers of the true faith against the
dissolute dilutions of Western Christianity and the apostasy of
Islam. Often in that history, the West has been seen as a greater
threat than the Islamic East. After the rampages of the Crusaders,
who went to fight Islam and incidentally sacked Constantinople, the
wisdom spread among Eastern Christians that ``better the turban of
the sultan than the tiara of the pope.'' Russia's medieval hero,
Prince Alexander Nevsky, entered national lore because he battled
the Teutonic Knights, even though he made peace with the Mongols.
Moscow's proclamation of itself as the ``Third Rome,'' and then as
the convener of the ``First International,'' reflected its
perception of itself as not only the capital of an empire, but of a
civilization, and it is as such that it still lays claim to a voice
in world affairs.

   Even when the West is not seen as a conscious enemy, it is seen
to be blind or patronizing. When elements of nationalism appear in
the Russian Orthodox Church, clerics complain, it is seen to flow
from the very nature of a religion denied the intellectual
advantages of the Enlightenment or Reformation; when the same
elements surface among Irish Catholics or American Christian
fundamentalists, they are treated as exceptions to Western culture.
</P>
<P>
   These feelings run strong in the current conflict over Kosovo.
Though the large majority of Orthodox, including the Serbs, are
undoubtedly horrified at the ethnic purge under way against the
Albanians in Kosovo, there is also a powerful resentment against
NATO for what is seen as hypocrisy and condescension. Again and
again, the argument is heard that the West is not even aware of
Albanian actions against Serbian Kosovars in the recent past, or
that NATO did nothing to help the Kurds in Turkey, or the Tutsis in
Rwanda. There is fury that in its simplistic faith in the efficacy
of bombing, the West is only consolidating Milosevic's power and
demonizing the entire Serbian nation.

   ``There is a sense that the Orthodox are quickly stereotyped and
quickly demonized,'' said the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, ecumenical
officer of the Orthodox Church in America.

Moscow, Athens or Belgrade include not only ultra-nationalists, but
apparently average young people. Even among the most pro-Western
Russians and Serbs, he said, there is a growing resentment over
Washington's approach.

<P>
   And while Greece is in NATO and the European Union, it has
always felt itself a junior member of the Western club, included
for geographical, not cultural, reasons. The Greeks know that they
were Byzantium, and that Orthodoxy's spiritual leader is a Greek
with the title of Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The
British philosopher Isaiah Berlin once noted that a trip from
Russia to Greece is not really going abroad.
</P>
<P>
   That history has served to inculcate in the Orthodox a sense of
uniqueness and otherness. The very word ``orthodoxy'' reflects a
sense that they are the bearers of the true faith against the
dissolute dilutions of Western Christianity and the apostasy of
Islam. Often in that history, the West has been seen as a greater
threat than the Islamic East. After the rampages of the Crusaders,

the sultan than the tiara of the pope.'' Russia's medieval hero,

WHEN PRIVACY IS MORE PERILOUS THAN THE LACK OF IT

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hidden in the Microsoft Word document that
carried the Melissa virus around the world last week was an
innocuous serial number that helped federal agents identify the
computer responsible for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The incident dramatically illustrated technology's growing power
for promoting both good and evil. The serial number itself _ known
in computer parlance as a global unique identifier _ lies at the
heart of a continuing controversy over tradeoffs between individual
privacy rights and the common good.
</P>
<P>
   The incident involving the Microsoft numbering system came just
weeks after the company's partner, Intel Corp., announced that it
was building serial numbers into each copy of its newest
microprocessor, the Pentium III. The announcement touched off
protests from privacy activists, who argue that such numbering
spells the end of anonymity in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But computer engineers say that as computer networks become
pervasive, similar numbering schemes are necessary for the networks
themselves and for the functioning of increasingly sophisticated
software systems.
</P>
<P>
   In response, privacy rights experts say that society has always
found ways to balance its needs with the right to individual
privacy. Published telephone numbers, for example, were later
offset by the option of unlisted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Web has seen an explosion of ambitious marketing
organizations that have used the infrastructure in unforeseen ways
to build remarkably invasive profiles of Internet surfers. By
combining vast data bases with data-mining software to form
something resembling a vast vacuum cleaner, these new automated
systems are rapidly tracking as well as predicting human behavior.
What advertisers have been doing on a mass scale for decades is now
done one on one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 threat today to privacy is not Big Brother, it's big
bucks,'' said Amitai Etzioni, a social scientist at George
Washington University, who is the author of the newly published
``Limits of Privacy'' (Basic Books).
</P>
<P>
   The invasiveness of such Internet data miners is balanced by the
power of the technology to help track criminals, as Richard Smith
showed last week by helping to identify the New Jersey man who was
arrested and charged with spreading the Melissa virus.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Smith, who is president of Phar Lap Software in
Cambridge, Mass., publicized the existence of the serial number in
Microsoft's Office documents. He raised ethical questions about the
company's intention in automatically recording such numbers in its
data base. After his announcement, Microsoft immediately said it
would stop the practice and erase the numbers _ which it said were
being collected in error _ from its data base. Last week the
company issued a software utility program enabling computer users
to delete the numbers from their documents.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a computer hacker in the constructive sense of the word
and an amateur sleuth, was able to compare the document's number
with those in other documents posted on the Web. His research paid
off quickly when late Thursday state and federal officials arrested
David L. Smith, a 30-year-old software programmer who lives in
Aberdeen, N.J. Smith was charged with three second-degree offenses,
including interference with a public service and conspiracy,
together carrying a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and
$480,000 in fines. Smith's name had appeared in one of the
documents found on a Web site maintained by a virus author who
called himself VicodinES.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic identity is both useful and increasingly necessary in
cyberspace, say technologists. ``I think the psychology surrounding
this debate is very interesting,'' said Jim Waldo, a Sun
Microsystems software engineer, who helped design an early
predecessor to Microsoft's software numbering system. ``People want
anonymity, but at the same time they want to track everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology tradeoffs won't necessarily become simpler as
technology becomes more sophisticated. For example, the Federal
Communications Commission has mandated that the nation's cellular
phones be able to provide location information to within 400 feet
by 2001. Because most 911 calls are now made from mobile phones,
such information is vital for emergency response teams.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy activists, however, are concerned that such information
will be misused by law enforcement. There is a simple solution,
they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general approach is to collect the minimum of personally
identifiable information possible and to explore new techniques
that permit authentication without identification, said Marc
Rotenberg, the director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy rights must be balanced against the common good, says
Etzioni, who worries about the growing computing powers of Internet
marketing companies. ``Their data bases have more information about
people than the Stasi secret police ever had about the East
Germans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he says, the dangers of allowing criminals and
terrorists access to unbreakable encryption software are
particularly high. The answer lies in striking a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming a world city,'' he said. ``Everything
happens in it from commerce to crime. To leave the role of
government out is foolish.''

   TOKYO _ Toshiyki Shimizu picked up a computer instruction manual
and frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' he complained. `` `Start button.' `Click.'
`Start menu.' `Device.' `Slot.' This is all English!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite all English but pretty close. The actual first
sentence read: Sutaato botan (start button) o kurikku (click) suru,
sutaato menyuu (start menu) ga hyoji sareru.
</P>
<P>
   For many middle-aged and elderly Japanese, life these days is a
perplexing struggle through what seems like an endless language
school. In restaurants, in stores, in newspapers, on television and
in conversation with young people, they find themselves bewildered
by what seems like an explosion of foreign terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very annoying when you walk down the street and you can't
understand a word on the street signs,'' complained Hideko
Nabekura, an 82-year-old fireball of a woman, her arm gesturing
furiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friends and I go to lunch these days, we can't
understand the menu,'' Mrs. Nabekura continued. ``One time I went
by myself, and I couldn't understand the items on the menu, so I
picked what seemed to be the cheapest. And the waitress said, `No,
it's a kid's meal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant menus are particularly challenging because, out of
snob appeal, they translate the sounds of foreign words rather than
the meanings. That results in offerings ranging from paati menyuu
(party menu) or happii awaa (happy hour) at the simpler end to
haabu-roosutochikin (herb-roasted chicken) and ruijiana sutairu
kurabukeeki (Louisiana-style crab cakes).
</P>
<P>
   English words may seem challenge enough, but for many Japanese
it is the menus of French restaurants that are the most baffling.
For example, l'Ecrin, a French restaurant in Tokyo, offers a fish
and shrimp dish that is ``poware ju do omaaru.'' The chef explains
that this is ``poilee, jus de homard,'' or sauteed in a special way
in the juice of lobster.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to the use the restroom, the less
cosmopolitan face similar challenges. One club writes the words
``Gentleman'' and ``Ladies'' in English calligraphy so curved and
fancy that almost all guests look a bit tentative making their
choice for the first time, and patrons of restaurant toilets often
must rely on the typical Japanese color coding of blue for men and
red for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what bathroom to go into from the signs,'' sighed
Hisako Sekine, an elderly housewife. ``You just have to look at the
pictures, or else see if one is blue and the other red.''
</P>
<P>
   The linguistic challenge is perhaps most pronounced in
computers. In the 19th century, Japan tended to come up with
traditional ways of writing new products or concepts, so that a
telephone was dubbed ``denwa'' or ``electronic talk.'' But while
China continues in that approach, terming a computer a ``electronic
brain,'' Japan in recent decades has shifted almost exclusively to
simply transcribing the sounds of foreign words, so that computer
in Japanese is ``konpyutaa.''
</P>
<P>
   This has some advantages for intellectuals who travel abroad and
communicate in English as well. But it is a bit overwhelming for
the person who sits down at a kiiboudo (keyboard) for the first
time and is told to move the mausu (mouse) and daburu-kurikku
(double-click) on the aikon (icon).
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at a computer book and I can't even figure out how to
get started,'' fretted Kimii Oishi, a 74-year-old woman who has
joined Tokyo's Grandma ``Pasukon saron'' (personal computer salon)
and was clutching a ``konpyutaa manyuaru.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' she added. `` `Manyuaru.' I don't even know
what that is. What's a manyuaru? I don't even know how to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   A manyuaru is a manual. And since there is already a word in
Japanese meaning the same thing, ``manyuaru'' reflects the tendency
to adopt foreign words even when their are already perfectly good
ones available in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Oishi said in some cases she feels more comfortable
with computer word transcriptions like mausu rather than
translations like ``nezumi,'' the Japanese word for a mouse or a
rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, the image of a nezumi is rather dirty,'' Mrs. Oishi
said primly. ``So I think for that, it is better to use the English
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lesson for Americans is that when they are ready to
smash their computers for generating error messages, they should
realize that it could be worse. They could be
``toraburushyuutingu'' (trouble-shooting) using the Japanese
version of Microsoft Windows and getting ``herupu'' (help) like the
one beginning: ``What to do if the fairu (file) does not appear in
the correct doraibu (drive) and foruda (folder) of the open fairu
(file) daiarogubokkusu (dialogue box).''
</P>
<P>
   For all the image in the West of Japan as a country unusually
resistant to foreign currents, in fact Japan has long been an eager
importer of foreign terms. In serious discourse, about half of
expressions are originally Chinese, some imported more than 1,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western words came drifting in as well, and are usually written
in a separate alphabet called katakana, or sometimes directly in
Roman letters. Thus a single sentence of written Japanese can be a
mixture of four writing systems: Chinese characters, katakana,
Roman letters and a Japanese alphabet called hiragana.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of foreign words often seems aimed not at
facilitating communication but obstructing it. Just as Americans
might show off by using Latin ad infinitum, or by using French
words to demonstrate their savoire-faire, Japanese often use new
foreign words because they have the appiru (appeal) that not
everyone understands them.
</P>
<P>
   This snob appeal of foreign words has accentuated the generation
``gappu'' (gap) in Japan, for young people in the cities
enthusiastically adopt new words that leave the elderly befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandkids are speaking their weird way, I don't
understand it but I don't mind,'' said Fumiko Kawaguchi, an
87-year-old woman living in western Tokyo. ``But if they want to
talk to me, then I tell them that they'll have to speak Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the foreign words, there is no French-style political
opposition to imported words, and most people seem to accept them
as useful _ even if a growing number of elderly people feel left
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people and young people may live together in the same
house, but they are living in different worlds,'' mused Matome Ito,
a 64-year-old porcelain salesman in a small shop in Tokyo. ``For
young people, the whole life style is all American now. Their food
is different, and they can't even use chopsticks right any more.
Even the smell of the houses is different: The homes of older
people smell of fish and miso soup, and the kids' houses smell of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ito paused and sighed, and, perhaps getting carried away, added
sorrowfully: ``Young people are so different now, even their faces
have changed. They're like Westerners _ they don't have chins
anymore. I think maybe it's partly because they don't chew on
things like dried squid any more.''

   For many middle-aged and elderly Japanese, life these days is a
perplexing struggle through what seems like an endless language
school. In restaurants, in stores, in newspapers, on television and
in conversation with young people, they find themselves bewildered
by what seems like an explosion of foreign terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very annoying when you walk down the street and you can't
understand a word on the street signs,'' complained Hideko
Nabekura, an 82-year-old fireball of a woman, her arm gesturing
furiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friends and I go to lunch these days, we can't
understand the menu,'' Mrs. Nabekura continued. ``One time I went
by myself, and I couldn't understand the items on the menu, so I
picked what seemed to be the cheapest. And the waitress said, `No,
it's a kid's meal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant menus are particularly challenging because, out of
snob appeal, they translate the sounds of foreign words rather than
the meanings. That results in offerings ranging from paati menyuu
(party menu) or happii awaa (happy hour) at the simpler end to
haabu-roosutochikin (herb-roasted chicken) and ruijiana sutairu
kurabukeeki (Louisiana-style crab cakes).
</P>
<P>
   English words may seem challenge enough, but for many Japanese
it is the menus of French restaurants that are the most baffling.
For example, l'Ecrin, a French restaurant in Tokyo, offers a fish
and shrimp dish that is ``poware ju do omaaru.'' The chef explains
that this is ``poilee, jus de homard,'' or sauteed in a special way
in the juice of lobster.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to the use the restroom, the less
cosmopolitan face similar challenges. One club writes the words
``Gentleman'' and ``Ladies'' in English calligraphy so curved and
fancy that almost all guests look a bit tentative making their
choice for the first time, and patrons of restaurant toilets often
must rely on the typical Japanese color coding of blue for men and
red for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what bathroom to go into from the signs,'' sighed
Hisako Sekine, an elderly housewife. ``You just have to look at the
pictures, or else see if one is blue and the other red.''
</P>
<P>
   The linguistic challenge is perhaps most pronounced in
computers. In the 19th century, Japan tended to come up with
traditional ways of writing new products or concepts, so that a
telephone was dubbed ``denwa'' or ``electronic talk.'' But while
China continues in that approach, terming a computer a ``electronic
brain,'' Japan in recent decades has shifted almost exclusively to
simply transcribing the sounds of foreign words, so that computer
in Japanese is ``konpyutaa.''
</P>
<P>
   This has some advantages for intellectuals who travel abroad and
communicate in English as well. But it is a bit overwhelming for
the person who sits down at a kiiboudo (keyboard) for the first
time and is told to move the mausu (mouse) and daburu-kurikku
(double-click) on the aikon (icon).
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at a computer book and I can't even figure out how to
get started,'' fretted Kimii Oishi, a 74-year-old woman who has
joined Tokyo's Grandma ``Pasukon saron'' (personal computer salon)
and was clutching a ``konpyutaa manyuaru.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' she added. `` `Manyuaru.' I don't even know
what that is. What's a manyuaru? I don't even know how to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   A manyuaru is a manual. And since there is already a word in
Japanese meaning the same thing, ``manyuaru'' reflects the tendency
to adopt foreign words even when their are already perfectly good
ones available in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Oishi said in some cases she feels more comfortable
with computer word transcriptions like mausu rather than
translations like ``nezumi,'' the Japanese word for a mouse or a
rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, the image of a nezumi is rather dirty,'' Mrs. Oishi
said primly. ``So I think for that, it is better to use the English
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lesson for Americans is that when they are ready to
smash their computers for generating error messages, they should
realize that it could be worse. They could be
``toraburushyuutingu'' (trouble-shooting) using the Japanese
version of Microsoft Windows and getting ``herupu'' (help) like the
one beginning: ``What to do if the fairu (file) does not appear in
the correct doraibu (drive) and foruda (folder) of the open fairu
(file) daiarogubokkusu (dialogue box).''
</P>
<P>
   For all the image in the West of Japan as a country unusually
resistant to foreign currents, in fact Japan has long been an eager
importer of foreign terms. In serious discourse, about half of
expressions are originally Chinese, some imported more than 1,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western words came drifting in as well, and are usually written
in a separate alphabet called katakana, or sometimes directly in
Roman letters. Thus a single sentence of written Japanese can be a
mixture of four writing systems: Chinese characters, katakana,
Roman letters and a Japanese alphabet called hiragana.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of foreign words often seems aimed not at
facilitating communication but obstructing it. Just as Americans
might show off by using Latin ad infinitum, or by using French
words to demonstrate their savoire-faire, Japanese often use new
foreign words because they have the appiru (appeal) that not
everyone understands them.
</P>
<P>
   This snob appeal of foreign words has accentuated the generation
``gappu'' (gap) in Japan, for young people in the cities
enthusiastically adopt new words that leave the elderly befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandkids are speaking their weird way, I don't
understand it but I don't mind,'' said Fumiko Kawaguchi, an
87-year-old woman living in western Tokyo. ``But if they want to
talk to me, then I tell them that they'll have to speak Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the foreign words, there is no French-style political
opposition to imported words, and most people seem to accept them
as useful _ even if a growing number of elderly people feel left
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people and young people may live together in the same
house, but they are living in different worlds,'' mused Matome Ito,
a 64-year-old porcelain salesman in a small shop in Tokyo. ``For
young people, the whole life style is all American now. Their food
is different, and they can't even use chopsticks right any more.
Even the smell of the houses is different: The homes of older
people smell of fish and miso soup, and the kids' houses smell of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ito paused and sighed, and, perhaps getting carried away, added
sorrowfully: ``Young people are so different now, even their faces
have changed. They're like Westerners _ they don't have chins
anymore. I think maybe it's partly because they don't chew on
things like dried squid any more.''

<P>
   By now, the whole world knows there's no hotter property than
companies that make Internet Web sites. Now here's something even
hotter: Web sites that make fun of companies.
</P>
<P>
   The sites allow disgruntled consumers to, well, express
themselves. For example, a site targeting Chase Manhattan Bank
features a cartoon of a half-naked little man in red shorts loping
across the top of the screen and dropping his drawers before
urinating on Chase's name. Mission accomplished, the little man
turns and smiles broadly at the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the companies aren't thrilled with this new
chapter in America's love affair with griping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most companies, we value customer feedback,'' said Ken
Herz, a Chase spokesman. ``But it's a pretty offensive Web site and
most of the information there is inaccurate. It's kind of pathetic,
frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has always been home to plenty of unvarnished brio,
and this new form of guerrilla consumerism is no exception. Much of
it is marked by a heavy dose of invective. Designers of the sites
might have chosen names like Chase-Gouged-Me.com or
AT&AMP;T-Isn't-Very-Nice.com, but most haven't. Instead, they use names
far too vulgar for breakfast time in the homes of readers of
high-toned newspapers like this one. (Terms sort of like
``stinks,'' only nastier.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the companies don't seem to see the humor in all this,
so they're fighting back with their most familiar weapon: money.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has been buying up the rights to names like
``ChaseStinks.com'' and ``IHateChase.com.'' Likewise, brokerage
giant Charles Schwab is protecting its flank by buying the rights
to dozens of unseemly domain names before angry consumers get their
hands on them. The same holds for General Electric, Hyatt and other
corporate heavyweights that pay between $70 and $120 to register
each domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating such preemptive strikes by Corporate America, Dan
Parisi, a Secaucus, N.J., lawyer and an operator of a pornographic
Internet site, has been stockpiling the rights to all sorts of
pejorative domain names, including those invoking well-known
companies like AT&AMP;T, Sears and Kmart, according to a recent issue
of American Banker. Parisi did not respond to repeated requests for
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are already plenty of places to complain about
companies. Some of the tamer ones have names like ``Untied
Airlines'' (for unhappy United Airlines fliers), ``Allsnake''
(featuring rants against Allstate Insurance) and ``I Hate
McDonalds'' (for those with indigestion courtesy of the golden
arches).
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who favor broad-brush venting can visit
complainline.com or grumbling.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies shrug off the advent of guerrilla consumerism.
Wal-Mart, the target of a Web site where a customer calling herself
Elaine describes the company as ``underhanded and dishonest,'' said
it has no interest in securing rights to offensive site names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that these sites are out there, but our feeling
is that our customers and associates are knowledgeable enough about
our company, services and reputation to see right through them,''
said Jessica Moser, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. The attitude of some
Wal-Mart customers bolsters that viewpoint. ``All you guys who
write in and complain about stupid things need to go get a life,''
a customer calling herself Kim wrote on the Wal-Mart site. ``What's
wrong with you? It's just a store.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla Web sites, of course, are not confined to the business
world. Last week, supporters of New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani erected Hillaryno.com, a site aimed at deflating a
possible run for the U.S. Senate by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Giuliani is said to harbor his own designs for the Senate, and the
site chides Mrs. Clinton for her slender government resume.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians are used to bruising, bare-knuckles criticism.
Many companies never experience full-blown invective until they
reach a certain size, and even then they remain skittish about
threats to their image. Consequently, some corporations have
launched robust counteroffensives to guerrilla consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the health club operator Bally Total Fitness filed a
trademark infringement suit against a site featuring an indecorous
variation on Bally's name. The suit was quickly dismissed and
experts on trademark law think few courts would back similar ones.
Trademark protection typically extends only to a company's
corporate name _ if an offensive adjective or verb is appended to
the name on a Web site, trademark protections evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this vast concern among corporations about whether a
domain name is a trademark or not,'' said Richard Forman, president
of register.com, a leading provider of Internet domain
registrations. ``But the courts have resoundingly ruled that a
domain name is not a trademark name.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is quite acceptable to Scott Harrison, a 23-year-old
promotions director for a Manhattan nightclub, who started the
anti-Chase site after the bank mishandled some of his accounts.
``Anything goes on the Internet, and my site is about free
speech,'' said Harrison. ``It's a way for me to literally tell the
entire world about why not to do business with this bank.''

FIGHTING MANDATORY DEPORTATION: VETERANS LEAD A NEW CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Fear of crime and resentment against immigrants are perennial
themes of U.S. politics, and Congress touched both when it revised
American policy toward legal residents in the mid-1990s.
Non-citizens, even permanent residents, were made subject to
deportation for a wide range of crimes that had previously been
considered too minor. There was, at least according to immigration
officials, no flexibility in deciding whom to deport.
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian nature of the change brought immediate cries from
civil libertarians and advocates for immigrants, but so far court
challenges have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new tactic is being pursued, and last month it reached the
floor of the Senate, where Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., spoke on
behalf of five legal residents who face deportation even though
they have served in the U.S. military, some of them in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zealousness of Congress and the White House to be tough on
aliens has successfully snared permanent residents who have spilled
their blood for our country,'' said Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   The five, and other veterans, have come forward as extreme
examples of the law's inflexibility. Some earned medals fighting in
Vietnam, and at least one is disabled as a result of service there.
Through legal challenges and a campaign for public attention, they
have targeted what they hope is the law's Achilles heel: its
rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   Can enforcement of the law stand up to public scrutiny in their
cases? If it can't, will exceptions be made? And if that happens,
they argue, wouldn't it undermine the notion of mandatory
deportation without exception?
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the case of Rafael Ramirez, a 35-year-old New
Yorker. Nine years after his honorable discharge from the Army as a
sergeant, he faces deportation to the Dominican Republic. His
offense: In 1990, just months after leaving the Army, he pleaded
guilty to possessing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez left the Dominican Republic 28 years ago, and today his
life is in the United States. He has a home in upper Manhattan's
Washington Heights, four children, a job and a small construction
business. His Army record as a truck driver in Germany and the
United States _ he enlisted in 1984 and left six years later _ is
unblemished.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Washington have been unmoved by such
cases, aware that making an exception can demolish the principle
behind its enforcement policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the law that says if you are a veteran and
a criminal you are exempt from deportation,'' said Russell
Bergeron, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman in
Washington. ``It is inconceivable to me that someone who is willing
to die to defend the Constitution of the United States can then
turn around and violate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, of course, argues just the opposite: He says that when
he enlisted, his superiors did not ask where he came from, and that
his loyalty to the United States was assumed. His offense, he says,
hardly amounts to an assault on the Constitution, and the fact that
he was sentenced to five years probation and never went to prison
proves the point.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and veterans involved in the campaign don't argue
against using criminal behavior as grounds to deport people who
endanger American society. But they argue that the INS should only
go after hardened criminals. Even these cases, they say, should be
open to judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say they have no choice but to follow the
mandate of Congress. In the past two years, 106,442 immigrants have
been deported. But advocates for immigrants, their lawyers and some
members of Congress insist that the immigration service distorts
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Congress and the administration want to wash their
hands,'' said Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``Both are
responsible and, by neither one accepting responsibility, nothing
gets changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What Congress did in 1995 and 1996 was to expand the definition
of a felony and make all felonies and crimes of moral turpitude
punishable by deportation. It stripped immigration judges of the
power to reverse deportation orders. The INS, for its part, chose
to apply the law retroactively, although the law is not specific on
that point. The INS has also chosen to go after all convicted
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law goes too far,'' said Laura Kozuba, who heads an
anti-deportation group in Dallas. ``We want to change it for all,
but it seems particularly egregious to try to deport someone who
has served this country.'' She is married to Danny Kozuba, a
46-year-old kitchen installer, who has been ordered deported. He
came to the United States from Canada when he was 5 and was in the
Army from 1970 to 1973. He has been convicted of possessing
methamphetamines several times, the last in 1990, and spent three
years in a Texas state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the Clinical Law Center at New York University
School of Law, under the guidance of Professor Nancy Morawetz, are
focusing on several other veterans. One is Perry Gumbs, 35, of
Newburgh, N.Y., who was born in St. Kitts and served in a field
artillery unit during the gulf war. In 1995, he was convicted of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and served a year in jail. Another
is Ralph Hesselbach, who came to the United States from Germany
when he was 11 and was disabled while serving in Vietnam. At 49, he
is HIV. positive and has been convicted several times of possessing
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Morawetz said the INS could have chosen to leave
Hesselbach and Gumbs alone. They are not in jail now, are not
involved in crime and are not abusing drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything in the law that says that the INS doesn't
have prosecutorial discretion,'' she said. ``Where does it say that
you have to deport everybody that you can deport? Why would you
want to?''

Vietnam, and at least one is disabled as a result of service there.
Through legal challenges and a campaign for public attention, they
have targeted what they hope is the law's Achilles heel: its
rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   Can enforcement of the law stand up to public scrutiny in their
cases? If it can't, will exceptions be made? And if that happens,
they argue, wouldn't it undermine the notion of mandatory
deportation without exception?
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the case of Rafael Ramirez, a 35-year-old New
Yorker. Nine years after his honorable discharge from the Army as a
sergeant, he faces deportation to the Dominican Republic. His
offense: In 1990, just months after leaving the Army, he pleaded
guilty to possessing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez left the Dominican Republic 28 years ago, and today his
life is in the United States. He has a home in upper Manhattan's
Washington Heights, four children, a job and a small construction
business. His Army record as a truck driver in Germany and the
United States _ he enlisted in 1984 and left six years later _ is
unblemished.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Washington have been unmoved by such
cases, aware that making an exception can demolish the principle
behind its enforcement policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the law that says if you are a veteran and
a criminal you are exempt from deportation,'' said Russell
Bergeron, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman in
Washington. ``It is inconceivable to me that someone who is willing
to die to defend the Constitution of the United States can then
turn around and violate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, of course, argues just the opposite: He says that when
he enlisted, his superiors did not ask where he came from, and that
his loyalty to the United States was assumed. His offense, he says,
hardly amounts to an assault on the Constitution, and the fact that
he was sentenced to five years probation and never went to prison
proves the point.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and veterans involved in the campaign don't argue
against using criminal behavior as grounds to deport people who
endanger American society. But they argue that the INS should only
go after hardened criminals. Even these cases, they say, should be
open to judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say they have no choice but to follow the
mandate of Congress. In the past two years, 106,442 immigrants have
been deported. But advocates for immigrants, their lawyers and some
members of Congress insist that the immigration service distorts
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Congress and the administration want to wash their
hands,'' said Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``Both are
responsible and, by neither one accepting responsibility, nothing
gets changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What Congress did in 1995 and 1996 was to expand the definition
of a felony and make all felonies and crimes of moral turpitude
punishable by deportation. It stripped immigration judges of the
power to reverse deportation orders. The INS, for its part, chose
to apply the law retroactively, although the law is not specific on
that point. The INS has also chosen to go after all convicted
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law goes too far,'' said Laura Kozuba, who heads an
anti-deportation group in Dallas. ``We want to change it for all,
but it seems particularly egregious to try to deport someone who
has served this country.'' She is married to Danny Kozuba, a
46-year-old kitchen installer, who has been ordered deported. He
came to the United States from Canada when he was 5 and was in the
Army from 1970 to 1973. He has been convicted of possessing
methamphetamines several times, the last in 1990, and spent three
years in a Texas state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the Clinical Law Center at New York University
School of Law, under the guidance of Professor Nancy Morawetz, are
focusing on several other veterans. One is Perry Gumbs, 35, of
Newburgh, N.Y., who was born in St. Kitts and served in a field
artillery unit during the gulf war. In 1995, he was convicted of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and served a year in jail. Another
is Ralph Hesselbach, who came to the United States from Germany
when he was 11 and was disabled while serving in Vietnam. At 49, he
is HIV. positive and has been convicted several times of possessing
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Morawetz said the INS could have chosen to leave
Hesselbach and Gumbs alone. They are not in jail now, are not
involved in crime and are not abusing drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything in the law that says that the INS doesn't
have prosecutorial discretion,'' she said. ``Where does it say that
you have to deport everybody that you can deport? Why would you
want to?''

   JUPITER, Fla. _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up as if he'd just seen
a down-the-pipe fastball. Expecting yet another, ``Can you hit 70
home runs again?'' question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis
Cardinals slugger was asked if he'd like to reverse roles and pose
questions to other people for a change. ``That's great,'' he said,
clearly relieved. ``I love it!''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire came up with one question for a dozen people from
baseball and beyond. Some declined to answer _ President Clinton
passed on, ``Are you glad Sammy Sosa and I took some pressure off
you last summer?'' _ but most everyone enjoyed giving the most
interviewed man in sports a break. With today being Opening Day, it
might be his last. McGwire's questions and his subjects' answers
follow.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Rich DeLucia of the California Angels has
only a 38-50 career major league pitching record, but he owns
McGwire, yielding him just a single and double in 19 at-bats. This
begged McGwire's question, ``Why don't you ever throw me anything
over the plate?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   DeLucia: Last year there were 70 balls over the plate, I know
that. I'm not stupid. I just try to get ahead of him and then move
the ball off the plate. If you miss early and you have to come over
the plate, you're in trouble. I throw him down and away hard stuff
and belt-high up and in. But believe me, out of all those at-bats,
I'm sure I got lucky sometimes.

<P>
   Brooks: Tell Mark he'd better buy his own record label. That's
the best way to do it. But tell him not to quit his day job. He's
too good at what he does.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Tim Forneris, a 22-year-old computer analyst
from Collinsville, Ill., and part-timer on the Cardinals grounds

Sept. 8 _ and baffled some by giving it to McGwire rather than
auctioning it off for $1 million or more. But Forneris didn't go
away empty-handed: A Chrysler dealer gave him a fully loaded red
minivan with ``No. 62'' license plates. McGwire wanted to know,
``Hey, how's the van running?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Forneris: It's running awesome! The only problem is it's much
bigger than my old car. I've had a tough time parking and I hope I
don't cut people off and cause an accident.
</P>
<P>
   I met Mark at a dinner a few days after they gave me the van.
You might remember he got a '62 Corvette the night he hit 62, and
he was telling me that he was having a hard time fitting into it _
he's so big. I told him, ``Next year in St. Louis, we can
car-pool.''

   Trachsel: It was actually a little lower than I'd planned. We'd
had success and other teams had had success pitching him up and in,
and I was trying to do that that night, too. I pretty much missed
my spot and he got it.

Mets fans surely want answered as well: ``Why didn't you take me
No. 1?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine: We called the night before the draft and talked for
45 minutes with his father. We never once mentioned money. Our
question was, ``If we draft your son, would you have any interest
in signing with the New York Mets?'' They kept saying: ``We need
more time. We're not sure. We like the West Coast. . . . '' They
just wouldn't say they'd be interested in signing with us. Do I
regret not taking him? Of course. He was my pick. I loved him.

actually know how to coach a basketball team. I'm just an actor who
plays a part.

time we play?''(END ITALICS HERE)

   WASHINGTON _ At first blush, last week's news from the Medicare
and Social Security trustees was good. The economy over the last
year has been so strong, actuaries found, that even with no changes
in the law, the Medicare system should be solvent until 2015, seven
years longer than previously expected, and Social Security reserves
should be sufficient to pay full retirement benefits until 2034,
two years more than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, President Clinton and Republican leaders were quick to
say that the wise course would still be to resolve their
differences and act this year to put Medicare and Social Security
on sound footing. But the truth is that for Congress, now on recess
for Passover and Easter, the news was political manna. It made the
problem of the insolvency of the two largest and most popular
federal programs seem less urgent. And it provided an excuse for
postponing tough decisions until after the next election.
</P>
<P>
   But data buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the
matter cannot be put off indefinitely. The figures showed how the
ratio of people of retirement age (who receive Medicare and Social
Security benefits) to those of working age (who pay the taxes that
finance the benefits) will rise after the baby boomers begin to
retire. This almost certainly means that sooner or later taxes will
have to be increased or retirement benefits reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, for example, there will be 210 people age 65 and over
for every 1,000 people ages 20 through 64. By 2030, the number of
Americans of retirement age will rise by 69 percent to 354 for
every 1,000 people of working age. And by 2075, it is projected
that the figure will nearly double.

THE POWELL DOCTRINE IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember the Powell Doctrine?
</P>
<P>
   That was the strict and cautious set of standards espoused by
Gen. Colin Powell when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
for determining where, when and how U.S. military force should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   It held that the United States should intervene militarily only
when the nation's vital interests were at stake, only with decisive
force and only when there was a clear goal and a defined strategy
for getting out.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, those tenets were discarded
as Vietnam-era relics that raised barriers to military intervention
too high to suit the realities of today's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point of having this superb military that you've
always been talking about if we can't use it?'' Madeleine Albright,
now secretary of state, demanded of Powell when she was the
country's United Nations ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clinton administration embraced Albright's ``Doability
Doctrine'' _ that the United States should use its military power
in more flexible ways to achieve practical, if limited, goals.
Successes in providing relief to Rwanda, mounting air strikes in
Bosnia and restoring some semblance of democracy in Haiti helped
bolster the new thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Nearly two weeks of NATO bombing has failed to stop
the Yugoslav army's brutal removal of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo,
and starkly revealed the limitations of an air-only campaign in
trying to break President Slobodan Milosevic's will to wage war.
The capture of three U.S. soldiers along the Macedonia border only
made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Powell's principles are looking a lot more attractive.
``This only affirms the Powell Doctrine,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who joined the growing chorus of those clamoring to send
ground troops into Kosovo. ``This is more reminiscent of the
gradual escalation and bombing pauses that characterized the
Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Powell broke his usually self-imposed silence on continuing
military operations last week, offering remarks that carried a
distinctly I-told-you-so ring. ``The challenge of just using air
power is that you leave it in the hands of your adversary to decide
when he's been punished enough,'' Powell told reporters before a
speech in Blacksburg, Va. ``So the initiative will remain with
President Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Powell principles served to neatly reconcile two strains of
U.S. foreign policy that have influenced U.S. administrations for
decades. One is never again to appease a tyrant who threatens vital
interests, as British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did with
Hitler in Munich. With this goal painfully in mind, Clinton has
always regretted that the United States failed to address the
Bosnia problem sooner than it did.
</P>
<P>
   The second foreign policy strain weighing heavily on Clinton,
and at the heart of Powell's doctrine, is the conviction that U.S.
military forces should never again become bogged down in a quagmire
like Vietnam. A clear exit strategy now is supposed to be a
prerequisite for mounting a military operation.
</P>
<P>
   Powell believed that the military should be used only when the
country's vital interests were at stake and, when it was, used to
win and win quickly. Yet Albright has not been alone in championing
her vision of using military force as a more flexible instrument of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1993, Powell's hand-picked successor, Gen. John
Shalikashvili, almost immediately began to distance himself from
his mentor's doctrine. Shalikashvili broadened it to include
important interests that affected the nation's well-being, if not
its very survival, along with humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powell was good for a period of time,'' said Gen. George
Joulwan, a retired commander of U.S. forces in Latin America and
Europe, who supervised the Rwanda relief operation. ``But we must
be able to adapt to the new challenges we face.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joulwan cautioned that there are still Powell principles
worth remembering, like maintaining a clear political and military
objective. ``Sometimes the State Department likes to have fuzziness
in all this, but when you commit forces, you have to have
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security
adviser, agreed. ``You have to tailor the use of force to the
objectives you're trying to achieve,'' he said. ``But you've got to
know what you're trying to do. You've got to look at all the
alternatives, and not just say, `We'll do this and hope it works.'
What if it doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   And here is where, critics say, the Clinton administration
blundered in Kosovo. While the objectives may have been clear _ to
stop Serb brutality, expel Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and force
Milosevic to the peace table _ the execution was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, NATO drew up plans that could have satisfied the
demands of the Powell Doctrine, calling for as many as 200,000
allied troops to occupy Yugoslavia _ about 75,000 for Kosovo alone
_ if Belgrade refused to negotiate. Administration officials
gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would oppose NATO ground troops, administration
officials said. And few in Washington predicted that the 19-member
alliance would remain united behind a land campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem was that no one on Capitol Hill had signed on
to that,'' said an administration official deeply involved in the
planning for Kosovo. ``This administration was operating on the
assumption ground troops would raise this to a new level, and we
hadn't prepared public for that or gotten the allies on board.''
</P>
<P>
   So President Clinton and NATO turned to the air campaign, even
though U.S. intelligence analysts and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
warned them that an aerial bombardment wouldn't work, and might
even hasten the Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told lawmakers in private meetings that air power had
driven Milosevic to the Bosnia peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, in
1995. But in fact, the air campaign was successful because a joint
offensive by Bosnian Muslim and Croatian forces changed the
equation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying we won't send in ground troops may be good for American
domestic political consumption, but it tells Milosevic there's a
limit to our commitment,'' said Maj. Gen. William Nash, a retired
commander of U.S. troops in Bosnia. ``He calculates there's no
reason for him to give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the air campaign has been politically shackled. Explicit in
the Powell Doctrine's notion of overwhelming force were the goals
of winning quickly while keeping casualties low and maintaining
public support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the Balkans, the goals haven't meshed well. When fog and
rain set in, NATO commanders called off bombing runs because they
didn't want pilots to have to fly under the clouds and face a
greater risk of ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And even as U.S. political leaders fear for their pilots in the
sky, they also fear civilian casualties on the ground. So NATO
hesitated last week before attacking government ministries in
Belgrade, targets dear to Milosevic's hold on power. Such
hesitation offers him another reason to hold firm.

THE POWELL DOCTRINE IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember the Powell Doctrine?
</P>
<P>
   That was the strict and cautious set of standards espoused by
Gen. Colin Powell when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
for determining where, when and how U.S. military force should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   It held that the United States should intervene militarily only
when the nation's vital interests were at stake, only with decisive
force and only when there was a clear goal and a defined strategy
for getting out.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, those tenets were discarded
as Vietnam-era relics that raised barriers to military intervention
too high to suit the realities of today's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point of having this superb military that you've
always been talking about if we can't use it?'' Madeleine Albright,
now secretary of state, demanded of Powell when she was the
country's United Nations ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clinton administration embraced Albright's ``Doability
Doctrine'' _ that the United States should use its military power
in more flexible ways to achieve practical, if limited, goals.
Successes in providing relief to Rwanda, mounting air strikes in
Bosnia and restoring some semblance of democracy in Haiti helped
bolster the new thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Nearly two weeks of NATO bombing has failed to stop
the Yugoslav army's brutal removal of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo,
and starkly revealed the limitations of an air-only campaign in
trying to break President Slobodan Milosevic's will to wage war.
The capture of three U.S. soldiers along the Macedonia border only
made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Powell's principles are looking a lot more attractive.
``This only affirms the Powell Doctrine,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who joined the growing chorus of those clamoring to send
ground troops into Kosovo. ``This is more reminiscent of the
gradual escalation and bombing pauses that characterized the
Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Powell broke his usually self-imposed silence on continuing
military operations last week, offering remarks that carried a
distinctly I-told-you-so ring. ``The challenge of just using air
power is that you leave it in the hands of your adversary to decide
when he's been punished enough,'' Powell told reporters before a
speech in Blacksburg, Va. ``So the initiative will remain with
President Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Powell principles served to neatly reconcile two strains of
U.S. foreign policy that have influenced U.S. administrations for
decades. One is never again to appease a tyrant who threatens vital
interests, as British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did with
Hitler in Munich. With this goal painfully in mind, Clinton has
always regretted that the United States failed to address the
Bosnia problem sooner than it did.
</P>
<P>
   The second foreign policy strain weighing heavily on Clinton,
and at the heart of Powell's doctrine, is the conviction that U.S.
military forces should never again become bogged down in a quagmire
like Vietnam. A clear exit strategy now is supposed to be a

country's vital interests were at stake and, when it was, used to
win and win quickly. Yet Albright has not been alone in championing
her vision of using military force as a more flexible instrument of

Shalikashvili, almost immediately began to distance himself from
his mentor's doctrine. Shalikashvili broadened it to include
important interests that affected the nation's well-being, if not
its very survival, along with humanitarian missions.

A HIGH-TECH THREAT WITH A LOW-TECH TRACK RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The warnings from Washington were clear. Spy satellites and high
technology eavesdropping equipment will be monitoring your forces
in Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was told last
week. Any evidence of atrocities carried out by Serbian soldiers
will be forwarded to the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is extremely alarmed by reports of an
escalating pattern of Serbian attacks on Kosovar Albanian
civilians,'' said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
``We are using our national technical means to observe events in
Kosovo and are prepared to share that information.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech saber rattling was meant to conjure up certain
images in the Serbian leader's mind: stark aerial photographs of
swaths of freshly turned earth near Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995. In
a dramatic presentation to the United Nations Security Council,
Madeleine Albright, who was then the chief U.S. delegate to the
United Nations, unveiled detailed overhead photographs of what
appeared to be mass graves near Srebrenica, which had recently
fallen to Bosnian Serb forces despite its status as an area that
the United Nations had declared a safe haven for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 Muslim men are believed to have been killed by the
Bosnian Serbs after Srebrenica fell, and war crimes investigators
later exhumed the graves and found the bodies of dozens. If such
savagery occurs in Kosovo, Milosevic was implicitly warned, it too
will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic may not be so frightened by such threats. Three
and a half years later, Srebrenica stands as an example not of the
power of U.S. technology but of its limits; even more clearly, it
also stands as an example of how any technology can be rendered
superfluous in the absence of political will.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. satellites and spy planes indeed captured images of a dozen
suspected mass graves around Srebrenica in the summer and fall of
1995. But war crimes investigators who entered Bosnia the following
spring to exhume the graves after the signing of the Dayton, Ohio,
peace accords were troubled by their findings. Several of the
graves appeared to have been exhumed already _ by the Bosnian
Serbs. Hundreds of bodies were missing.
</P>
<P>
   A t the time, U.S. officials, who had promised that the graves
would be monitored by spy planes and satellites, said they had no
images of Bosnian Serbs removing bodies. Several explanations were
possible. Perhaps U.S. spy planes and satellites had not been
monitoring the graves as promised. Perhaps the satellites had
failed to capture the Bosnian Serb exhumations because they either
passed overhead at the wrong time or could not see through clouds.
Or perhaps the Americans had the images but, for whatever reason,
would not give them to tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   So the hunt for bodies continues around Srebrenica two years
later. Only about 1,500 of the presumed 7,000 have been recovered.
Breakthroughs last spring came from low-technology sources. A
Bosnian Serb reported seeing suspicious activity in one area where
graves were later found, and a NATO work crew widening a road dug
up what turned out to be a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   But looming far larger than the shortcomings in finding
Srebrenica's victims has been a lack of will to arrest the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Bosnian Serb troops who carried out the
executions, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic have both been indicted for command responsibility at
Srebrenica, but neither has been arrested and Mladic has reportedly
lived safely in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   While peacekeeping forces in Bosnia have arrested some low-level
officials, U.S. and European fears of heavy casualties have halted
attempts to arrest top leaders. And the international war crimes
tribunal itself has at times been slow to press the Americans for
intelligence, mount investigations of war crimes in Kosovo or
investigate Milosevic himself.
</P>
<P>
   Given that record, Milosevic seems unlikely to tremble at the
threat posed to him by U.S. surveillance equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The spy technology also appears, in one sense, to be a
double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a coalition of groups demanding stronger U.S.
action in Kosovo called on the Clinton administration to release
all aerial reconnaissance photos documenting human rights
violations in Kosovo. Now that the administration has used spy
photos to expose one atrocity, it is expected to capture evidence
of another and release it.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Basseuner, associate director of the Balkan Action Council,
accused the administration of trying to use vows of high-technology
monitoring as a substitute for bold action. ``I get the feeling
that they're saying that,'' he said, referring to the monitoring,
``as a filler to get around the fact that they're not fighting this
war with the drive that they should.''

CITIZENS AS ALLIES: RETHINKING THE STRONG ARM OF THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the shooting death of an unarmed African immigrant by four
police officers, New York City has grimly discovered there is a
price for the tough law enforcement tactics that have led to its
steep drop in crime: estrangement between police and citizens,
something that many cities successfully combating crime have
managed to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   This estrangement erupted in weeks of protests since Amadou
Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was shot 19 times at his Bronx
home Feb. 4, and has also given rise to widespread complaints that
police officers mistreat residents of minority neighborhoods. A
question many law enforcement officials around the country are
asking is how much of this was self-inflicted after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir abandoned efforts by
their predecessors to establish community policing, scorning it as
social work.
</P>
<P>
   But community policing, which makes citizens allies of the
police, is thriving in many cities, from Chicago to San Diego and
from Fort Wayne, Ind., to Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Based on statistics alone, several of these cities have
surpassed New York City in reducing crime. Where homicides in New
York City have dropped by two-thirds from a record high in 1990, in
San Diego they have dropped by three-fourths from their peak in
1991. Where New York City has seen a 41 percent decline in overall
violent crime in the past decade, Fort Worth has recorded a 56
percent drop, according to a new study by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   These cities have achieved their gains without the
confrontations seen in New York City. Jerry Sanders, the police
chief of San Diego, which has a population of 1.2 million, measures
progress as much by an annual survey of public satisfaction with
the police as by the actual reduction in the crime rate. The most
recent survey, conducted by an outside consultant, showed approval
at 89 percent, he said. In a New York Times poll conducted March 8
through 14, 43 percent of New Yorkers thought the police were doing
an excellent or good job.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Wayne, a city of 200,000, neighborhood leaders help
evaluate prospective police candidates and sit in on
computer-generated crime statistics sessions similar to those in
New York City in which local police commanders are held accountable
for crime reduction in their districts. ``When you isolate yourself
and don't let people know what you are doing, they become
suspicious,'' said Nancy Becher, Fort Wayne's deputy police chief.
``We learned long ago that we can't do it all ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether police officers can do it all by themselves is at the
center of the debate between New York City's approach _ which
relies on the massive use of officers to suppress crime _ and the
strategy of community policing and a related approach called
problem-solving policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic premise is, we don't have enough police officers to
do it all, so we need community participation,'' said Sanders. San
Diego has only 1.7 officers per 1,000 residents, compared with 5
per 1,000 in New York City. The reliance on community participation
has another benefit, Sanders said: It avoids ``the long-term perils
of zero tolerance,'' Giuliani's policy of arresting minor
lawbreakers like jaywalkers, graffiti artists and others as a way
to avert more serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego has, of course, far fewer people than New York City,
but unlike New York City, it borders Mexico, which is a major
corridor for drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Its community
policing begins with a practical consideration: ``listening to the
community,'' Sanders says, ``and letting them tell us what their
priorities are.''
</P>

<P>
   ``The things people wanted us to work on,'' Sanders said, ``were
not serious crimes, but mostly abandoned cars, or abandoned houses,
that attracted other problems to the neighborhoods, and in some of
the worst areas, drug houses.'' Once residents came to know their
officers and met regularly with them, they began providing a
constant flow of tips.

   Another component in community policing is 1,200 volunteers,

<P>
   Problem-solving is also emphasized instead of simply making
arrests. This style of policing analyzes why certain locations
attract more crime or why particular people are repeatedly
victimized.

   In one case, Agnes Brookes, a 69-year-old civilian volunteer,
was assigned to figure out why a self-storage warehouse had been
burglarized 150 times in six months. After studying other

was removed, and then she had the owner install better lighting,
fencing and an electronic lock. The burglaries stopped.

CITIZENS AS ALLIES: RETHINKING THE STRONG ARM OF THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the shooting death of an unarmed African immigrant by four
police officers, New York City has grimly discovered there is a
price for the tough law enforcement tactics that have led to its
steep drop in crime: estrangement between police and citizens,
something that many cities successfully combating crime have
managed to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   This estrangement erupted in weeks of protests since Amadou
Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was shot 19 times at his Bronx
home Feb. 4, and has also given rise to widespread complaints that
police officers mistreat residents of minority neighborhoods. A
question many law enforcement officials around the country are
asking is how much of this was self-inflicted after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir abandoned efforts by
their predecessors to establish community policing, scorning it as
social work.
</P>
<P>
   But community policing, which makes citizens allies of the
police, is thriving in many cities, from Chicago to San Diego and
from Fort Wayne, Ind., to Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Based on statistics alone, several of these cities have
surpassed New York City in reducing crime. Where homicides in New
York City have dropped by two-thirds from a record high in 1990, in
San Diego they have dropped by three-fourths from their peak in
1991. Where New York City has seen a 41 percent decline in overall
violent crime in the past decade, Fort Worth has recorded a 56
percent drop, according to a new study by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   These cities have achieved their gains without the
confrontations seen in New York City. Jerry Sanders, the police
chief of San Diego, which has a population of 1.2 million, measures
progress as much by an annual survey of public satisfaction with
the police as by the actual reduction in the crime rate. The most
recent survey, conducted by an outside consultant, showed approval
at 89 percent, he said. In a New York Times poll conducted March 8
through 14, 43 percent of New Yorkers thought the police were doing
an excellent or good job.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Wayne, a city of 200,000, neighborhood leaders help
evaluate prospective police candidates and sit in on
computer-generated crime statistics sessions similar to those in
New York City in which local police commanders are held accountable
for crime reduction in their districts. ``When you isolate yourself
and don't let people know what you are doing, they become
suspicious,'' said Nancy Becher, Fort Wayne's deputy police chief.
``We learned long ago that we can't do it all ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether police officers can do it all by themselves is at the
center of the debate between New York City's approach _ which
relies on the massive use of officers to suppress crime _ and the
strategy of community policing and a related approach called
problem-solving policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic premise is, we don't have enough police officers to
do it all, so we need community participation,'' said Sanders. San
Diego has only 1.7 officers per 1,000 residents, compared with 5
per 1,000 in New York City. The reliance on community participation
has another benefit, Sanders said: It avoids ``the long-term perils
of zero tolerance,'' Giuliani's policy of arresting minor
lawbreakers like jaywalkers, graffiti artists and others as a way
to avert more serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego has, of course, far fewer people than New York City,
but unlike New York City, it borders Mexico, which is a major
corridor for drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Its community
policing begins with a practical consideration: ``listening to the
community,'' Sanders says, ``and letting them tell us what their
priorities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the ideas of residents themselves, the police divided
the city into 99 neighborhoods, with a police team assigned to
each. These areas are on the department's Web site, and anyone can
look up a specific neighborhood and see what the police are doing
about crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things people wanted us to work on,'' Sanders said, ``were
not serious crimes, but mostly abandoned cars, or abandoned houses,
that attracted other problems to the neighborhoods, and in some of
the worst areas, drug houses.'' Once residents came to know their
officers and met regularly with them, they began providing a
constant flow of tips.
</P>

many of them retired people who receive police training, wear
police-like uniforms and drive around in official vehicles. They
help watch their neighborhood or work on police department
computers so officers can patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Problem-solving is also emphasized instead of simply making
arrests. This style of policing analyzes why certain locations
attract more crime or why particular people are repeatedly
victimized.

<P>
   Community policing began in the aftermath of the urban riots of
the late 1960s when the Kerner Commission, appointed by President
Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that part of the problem lay with the
failure of the police to involve local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Goldstein, a professor emeritus at the University of
Wisconsin Law School who is regarded as the originator of
problem-solving policing, said the first step was ``to get the
police to recognize that they cannot combat crime by themselves.''
The next step, he said, was ``to get people to like us, and then to
have the community help set police policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s Mayor David Dinkins and Police Commissioner
Lee Brown inaugurated some early and successful experiments with
community policing, including the removal of abandoned cars.
</P>
<P>
   But after defeating Dinkins, Giuliani and his first police
commissioner, William Bratton, eliminated community policing and
invested heavily in police operations. ``This was almost coming
full cycle back to the 1960s, to the idea that the police alone can
fight crime,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy is implicit in the macho motto of the Street
Crime Unit, whose members included the four officers indicted last
week in Diallo's death: ``We own the street,'' members boast.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Safir scoffed at community policing. ``If you
think back to 1990, '91, the total focus of this department was
community policing, and we had the highest crime rate in the
history of the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be bullied by the community activists who say
we want feel-good cops,'' Safir said in another interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Wayne has tried to carry community policing a step further
than San Diego, Ms. Becher said, moving toward a concept of
community government. The city is divided into 227 neighborhoods,
each with an assigned police officer who has the authority to call
on city agencies like the parks department or the housing code
department to deal with problems like loud music or abandoned
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also created a higher-level body where neighborhood
representatives can meet with senior police and city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Wayne's homicides have been cut in half since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that New York has achieved stunning reductions
in crime. But Rana Sampson, a former police sergeant in the city,
who is director of public safety for the University of San Diego,
said: ``What NYPD did was throw people at the problems. You can't
put a cop on every corner, and do you really want to live in a
society with a cop on every corner?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping peace by peaceful means'' was the credo of Sir Robert
Peel, who created the first modern police department in London in
the 1820s. ``The degree,'' he said, ``of cooperation of the public
that can be secured diminishes, proportionately, the necessity for
the use of physical force.''

FINALLY, COMEUPPANCE FOR MOTORISTS WHO WON'T HANG UP AND DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooklyn (no, not that Brooklyn; the one in Ohio near Cleveland)
has done a marvelous thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove all communities everywhere to follow suit.
Brooklyn has banned the use of cellular phones by people driving
cars. Well, almost. The newly passed ordinance says it's a minor
misdemeanor for a driver to use a cell phone unless both hands are
on the wheel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The law makes an exception for ``emergencies,'' which I take to
be something more serious than needing to order pizza for your
Dow10K party. And the Solons of Brooklyn will let you use a car
phone if the transmission is in ``park'' or if you use a
speakerphone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not know how many accidents car phones cause, but surely
more than they get blamed for. I do know that most drivers can't
even drive and breathe at the same time without losing
concentration. Driving and telecommunicating is altogether beyond
the capacity of most humans to sustain safely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I applaud the eminent good sense of the leaders of Brooklyn
and I suggest this is a battle all people of good will should
join. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would be progress, in fact, if, as a start, we could simply
get all the other Brooklyns in this country to adopt similar
ordinances. Besides the Brooklyn in Ohio _ and the one in New York
I alluded to in the opening paragraph of this remarkably sensible
column _ you will find Brooklyns in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Maryland, Michigan and Mississippi, to say nothing of
Brooklyn Center and Brooklyn Park, both in Minnesota. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can find them if, that is, you know where to look for
them. Some of them _ like my essay on ``How Al Gore Invented the
Internet'' _ don't take up much space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But while we're trying to spread the no-car-phones movement, I
think we should not neglect several other modern automobile
hazards, annoyances and idiocies that need reform. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, is there no municipal statesperson anywhere in the
country with the chutzpah and foresight to lead the drive for an
ordinance that would ban the playing of any car radio, tape deck or
CD player that can be heard anywhere outside that very car? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the city council of my own community would adopt that
ordinance, I would speak kindly of its members for years. And the
best part is that my honorific words might actually be heard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and while we're banning various appliances and distracting
car devices, let's make it illegal for drivers to shave, apply
makeup or consume a six-course dinner while cruising the highways.
Please, people, the person you kill while edging your sideburns,
lipsticking your mouth or devouring a leg of ram might be me. And I
would take a very dim view of such an outcome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, can we please get rid of stupid bumper stickers and
``Knucklehead on Board'' signs that demand our attention as we come
up behind or alongside other cars? We already have way too much
information flowing our way from way too many sources. There is no
public demand at all for you to tell us via a bumper sticker what
your position is on Kosovo or nuclear waste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy you've developed a position on Kosovo. So have I. But
if it can be contained on a bumper sticker, it's so amazingly
moronic and meaningless that you should not want to advertise and
reveal its nincompoopness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if I see such an annoying bumper sticker on your car, I
will pull off the road, find a pay phone, ring your car phone and
tell you how dumb it is. If you're stupid enough to answer while
driving, I win the point. &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    FEDERAL FINANCIAL RECORDS STILL A MESS, AUDIT FINDS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Suppose a major corporation sent out an annual
report confessing to problems with fundamental record-keeping that
kept the company from accurately reporting a significant portion of
its assets, liabilities, and costs.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that same company admitted that last year, it wrote
checks for billions of dollars in improper payments, had only a
rough estimate of its loans, and lacked adequate records for a
majority of its buildings, facilities and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Few people would seek to invest in such a company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the financial condition of the U.S. government and
its 24 major departments and agencies, according to the 1998
financial audit released last week.
</P>
<P>
   So faulty is the bookkeeping, in fact, that government auditors
disclaimed any opinion about the reliability of the financial
statements from most of the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These deficiencies significantly impair the federal government's
ability to adequately safeguard assets, properly record
transactions, and comply with selected
</P>
<P>
   provisions of laws and regulations related to financial
reporting, U.S. Comptroller
</P>
<P>
   David M. Walker said in his overview of the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin pointed out that it was only
the second year that the government has attempted such an
accounting and said it represented an important step in providing
the American public with useful information about their government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress we have made to date is extraordinary,'' said
Edward DeSeve, deputy director for management in the White House
Office of Management and Budget. ``We are working hard to resolve
the problems, but much work remains to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress is coming, but we've sure got a lot to do,'' agreed
Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government Reform
subcommittee on government management, information and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the public can learn from the 90-page report issued
by the U.S. General Accounting Office:
</P>
<P>
   _ The government can't balance its checkbook. A private citizen
may struggle over a few dollars that throw a bank account off
balance at the end of the month. The government last year had an
unexplained $24 billion, which bookkeepers simply plugged into the
federal financial statement as unreconciled transactions. The
Treasury Department has attributed the problem to a failure to
track transactions among federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agencies do not keep good records of how money is spent. They
were unable to
</P>
<P>
   support significant portions of the more than $1.8 trillion
reported as the total net cost of government operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare, which has been listed as in grave financial danger
already, doles out a huge amount of improper payments. The program
made $12.7 billion in improper
</P>
<P>
   fee-for-service medical payments. Although that was down from
$20 billion the
</P>
<P>
   year before, the error rate for 1998 was still huge, 7 percent
of the fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Computers, vital to government operations, have been poorly
safeguarded and
</P>
<P>
   vulnerable to fraud and illegal snooping, even at the Defense
Department. Attackers have accessed systems and stolen, modified,
and destroyed both data and
</P>
<P>
   software at the Defense Department and shut down entire systems,
said the audit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internal Revenue Service computers are so inadequate that the
tax agency regularly pursues collection efforts against taxpayers
who already have paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the end of 1998, the government had no accurate accounting
for its loan and credit programs. It reported that it was owed $167
billion and that it had liabilities of $38 billion for loans that
it had guaranteed against default. Auditors said those
</P>
<P>
   amounts could not be reasonably estimated because of a lack of
adequate historical data or other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government reported that it had $225 billion in
liabilities for cleaning up
</P>
<P>
   hazardous waste caused chiefly by weapons systems and other
military operations. The auditors said that amount was understated
by at least tens of billions of dollars.

 &HT;    Fears of Y2K bug mean all work, no play
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For years, many Americans have been planning to party
madly at midnight on New Year's Eve 1999. As the 12 o'clock
countdown begins, they want to hear horns, fireworks, cheers and
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   But what they may hear is a chorus of beepers. ... assuming the
beepers work. Millions of would-be celebrants are just now
realizing that because of the Y2K computer bug, they will be
sitting at their desks on 12-31-99, not dancing in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers, computer programmers, factory supervisors, government
regulators and many others who haven't worked a holiday since they
waited on tables in college are being warned not to make party
plans for New Year's Eve. They will be needed to help ward off
snafus related to the Year 2000 Bug, or Y2K, the software flaw that
could cause equipment to malfunction when the year changes.
</P>
<P>
   Many computers and computer chips embedded in equipment were
programmed to read only the last two digits of the year, so 1999 is
read as 99. When the date changes from 99 to 00, the computers and
chips may interpret the date as 1900 and become confused enough to
shut down. Computer programmers are working furiously to stamp out
such bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Though most businesses and governmental agencies insist they
will be fully prepared for Dec. 31, many bosses are taking no
chances. They will want staff on duty to fix any glitches or simply
to reassure customers and journalists that everything is going
well. So throughout the land, word is going out: Don't even think
about taking vacationbetween Christmas and New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist for CNN, Clay Owen ``was used to working on the
4th of July, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.'' By moving to
the corporate world, ``I thought I had finally gotten out of
working every holiday,'' said the BellSouth spokesman, who will be
handling press inquiries about potential Y2K problems on New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Owen will be among the hordes of phone company supervisors,
programmers and others stationed in places ``where we can keep an
eye on the system.'' Even those who aren't expected to work will be
``on call,'' he said. Many bankers who usually work, well, bankers'
hours will be burning the midnight oil rather than lighting
firecrackers. At the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the lights
will be shining in the offices of supervisors and others who ``will
be working to ensure that things are progressing well,'' bank
spokesman Pierce Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. workers stationed in other countries will be downing
only dry data at midnight and even days beyond. For example,
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the financial services company with 64,000
employees worldwide, has ordered managers and other key personnel
to remain tethered to their desks from Dec. 1 through Feb. 15,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And for some government regulators, monitoring the millennium
midnight will be more than a job, it'll be an adventure. Take
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey. Like aviation
officials in countries from China to England, Garvey has promised
to be flying in a airplane on New Year's Eve to show confidence in
the air-traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting thing expected to happen on her flight is that
a few passengers may toss their peanuts in the air and exchange
kisses. It may not be the most lavish New Year's Eve party, but
it's all the excitement Garvey and other FAA officials will want.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hey, just kidding!
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There's a fine line between humor and insult.
Comedian Don Rickles, the master of insult, built a career on
knowing where that line was. Our sons haven't figured it out yet,
but they're about to.
</P>
<P>
   They've entered an annoying phase (is there one that isn't?) in
which they say something that draws an unfavorable response, then
they try to make it all right by smiling and saying ``Just
kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   As is normal with teens, they're testing their _ and my _
limits. The latest is this ``just kidding'' phase. Here's how they
try to make it work:
</P>
<P>
   ``How come we never go skiing over spring break?''
</P>
<P>
   (Parents quickly snarl something about money growing on trees.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that shirt's kinda straining the buttons, old man.''
</P>
<P>
   (Weighty reply from Dad in angry tone.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you always have to know where I'm going and who will be
there?''
</P>
<P>
   (Parents leap from chairs, backing child into a corner.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you ever cook anything worth eating?''
</P>
<P>
   (Mom replies with well-chosen words, each syllable emphasized by
a jabbing motion with wooden spoon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if we don't ``chill'' and ``lighten up'' and ``get
over it,'' then we're just uptight fuddy-duddies who can't take a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a joke works, boys. If just one of us is smiling, and
it isn't a parent, then it isn't a joke.
</P>
<P>
   There's another angle to this whole ``just kidding'' thing. They
use it as a trial balloon _ you know, run a wild idea up the
flagpole and see who goes ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go pick up a bunch of the guys and then go over
to some girls' houses and then go to a late movie and I'll probably
spend the night at somebody's house. Good-bye!''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing my eyeballs bulge, my face redden in anger and the steam
begin to come from my ears, my son backs off quickly with ``Just
kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   You know what, kids, I'm tired of the kidding.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recall having a handy, quick-draw phrase like that when
I was growing up. If I had dared open my mouth to, say, criticize
my mother's cooking, I would have found myself in my bedroom until
7 the next morning, starving for whatever incredibly delicious food
she would deign to put on the table.
</P>
<P>
   If I had had the nerve to tell my dad it was none of his
business where I was going and who I would be with, I would have
been going nowhere and seeing no one other than my immediate family
for a whole week.
</P>
<P>
   A feeble ``Just kidding'' wouldn't have changed my fate, either.
</P>
<P>
   But, you know, I'm willing to play the game a bit. Let's see if
I can get the hang of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, I'm not happy with your study habits, so you can't drive
again until you bring home straight As.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys, if I see your clothes scattered all over your floor like
this again, you're grounded from the computer and TV for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since you don't like what I cook for dinner, you're making
dinner for the next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you've complained about how I iron your cargo pants,
with these stupid luggage-sized pockets on each outer leg, you can
do your own ironing from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the punchline, guys. ``I'm not kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   Geez fellas, chill. Where's your sense of humor?
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Read this! Important column below
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ ``Important message.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone rush to open an e-mail that says ``important
message''? Like people, e-mails that announce their importance
usually aren't important. Yet the header worked. It helped deliver
the Melissa computer virus to systems around the world.
</P>
<P>
   If you use Microsoft Word and open the computer file that comes
with the Melissa bug e-mail, the program will find your e-mail
address book and mail itself to the addresses it finds. Then it
will let your cat out, stain the carpet with fruit juice and burn
popcorn in the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Those last dangers are hypothetical. They involve the virus
working with suggestible 13-year-olds. It seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   I am becoming ever more grateful for the boring reliability of
the mailbox at the end of my driveway. The worst thing it has done
to me lately has been to accept junk mail in envelopes printed to
look like tax refunds. Fools me every time.
</P>
<P>
   In my electronic mailbox, by contrast, I've received the Melissa
and Happy99 viruses within a month of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Happy99 shows a hokey little fireworks display and then attaches
itself to your outgoing e-mails. If the recipients, in turn, click
on the attachment, they also will see the hokey little fireworks
display and it will go out on their e-mails. And so on and so on
around the world forever.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I did not open the Melissa or Happy99 files. I
deleted Melissa unopened because I saw the heading ``important
message'' and assumed it was junk mail. By the time Happy99 got to
me I had already heard about the way it made people unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Close calls.
</P>
<P>
   Next time I may not be so lucky. If somebody is bright enough to
use the header ``Do Not Open Under Any Circumstances'' that would
be it. My number would be up, my virtual goose metaphorically
cooked, my posterior fit to be mowed.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how I'd respond if a more savvy virus-maker came up
with a header that directly challenged my perverse nature. I don't
think I want to know.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail headers are a powerful new literary form. As we get more
mail, it's harder to tell it apart. This forces us to be our own
headline writers and come up with cooler or louder headers. Few of
us are any good at it.
</P>
<P>
   I send out e-mail with headers like: Stuff, Hectic Friday,
Misc., Hey ... . To think I was once paid American money to write
hard-copy headlines.
</P>
<P>
   When we write old-fashioned lick-the-envelope-shut mail, we
don't have to write a header that shouts ``pick me! pick me!'' from
the swarm of incoming data. A handwritten envelope can accomplish
the same thing in a fistful of hard-copy junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-mailers also have the advantage of not being expected to
say what's on our mind until the third paragraph. You are supposed
to say hello, offer profuse apologies for not writing earlier and
then say a word about the weather, changing seasons or the
children's state of health. Only after these customary matters are
exhausted, do you need to say anything. By then you're warmed up
and ready.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, however, is supposed to announce itself in the heading
and run from there. Cyberspace doesn't have time for pleasantries.
The only time I write about weather in e-mail is to razz Canadians
and New Englanders. E-mail also brings out latent aggressiveness in
people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps over time, people will develop mindless niceties
tailored for e-mail. Instead of straining for importance in the
header, we will work out new little rituals to warm up to the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we will start by assuring our correspondents that we, the
writers, are not e-mail-generating programs but real humans and
that the message is certified clean of viruses, worms and prank
macros.
</P>
<P>
   That would feel comforting even if untrue _ the sure sign of a
good beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, don't worry that this column will disrupt the
rest of the paper or harm the other contents of your recycling bin.
There are no viruses yet developed for newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   All we can ruin is your morning.

 &HT;    Bad manners no indicator of independence, kids
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Each Monday morning, my eighth-graders and I
respond to a voice crackling over the intercom asking us to please
stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. Setting aside whatever we
happen to be doing, we pause to pay our respects to the country we
live in. Always, one or two kids in an effort to demonstrate their
``cool'' lag behind, pretending either they didn't hear, or that
they're inextricably entwined with their desks and unable to make
it to their feet. Thanks to a little peer pressure (``Oh, get over
it, stupid'') they're usually upright and mumbling along by the
time we reach the part about ``...and to the Republic for which it
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no federal law commanding the pledge be recited in
American classrooms. As citizens, we cannot be forced to swear
allegiance to our country, nor can we be compelled to speak or
think in any particular way. We
</P>
<P>
   are free to decide for ourselves, and should we choose not to
``pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,''
the same flag that we are free to burn in protest, no soldiers will
come to arrest us.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I'm concerned, freedoms like these are a good enough
reason to pledge allegiance to the country that guarantees them.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are things happening that we don't like, but
isn't it terrific that we can complain out loud? I'm not
particularly happy about living in the shadow of a morally bankrupt
president, but I am glad there are no
</P>
<P>
   laws demanding ``death for stupidity.'' And as objectionable as
I find an oddity with purple and gold hair who makes ungodly
amounts of money pushing a ball through a hoop, I'm proud to be
part of a system where folks can't be locked up for bad taste and
looking funny.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I have a major problem with kids who are too young to
have walked a mile in anybody's shoes, complaining that the
recitation of the ``Pledge of Allegiance'' in their classrooms is
the establishment's attempt to ``robotocize'' them and brainwash
them into conformity. If it's a loss of individuality that's
worrying them, then they're raising hell in all of the wrong
places. Adolescents instinctively travel with the herd and fear
difference more than a dateless Saturday night. So why carry on
about the pledge? Because it wasn't their idea?
</P>
<P>
   Young folks, like the ones I recently read about in a Washington
state high school, who are responding to a recital of the ``Pledge
of Allegiance'' with a Nazi salute, or a refusal to face the flag,
seem to be confusing singularity with rude behavior; they have not
yet learned that bad manners aren't an indicator of independence.
They don't understand that complaint without contribution rings
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   So may I suggest that until they've gotten over zits and into
taxes, until they've registered for the draft and seen more of the
world than Disneyland, or until they've had a chance to talk with a
WW2 Gold Star mother, they just stick to what they know. When
they've paid their dues, then maybe somebody will listen.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: When lawn care turns vicious
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been an urban dweller for going on two decades, but I grew
up before World War II in a community that was a virtual prototype
for the standard-issue suburbs that would be spread out like
mayonnaise around our cities after the war. So don't get me wrong.
I know suburbanites are capable of at least a base-line humanity.
</P>
<P>
   How shocking it is then to learn that all these years
suburbanites have been literally torturing nature, Saturday sadists
absolutely devoted in the practice of their peculiar cruelties.
</P>
<P>
   This intelligence comes from the journal ``Geophysical Research
Letters.'' On the off chance you missed the recent issue _ hard to
believe, but I suppose a few of you may have been, let me be blunt,
lazy _ I'll recap: Homeowners and hireling lawn-care companies have
been routinely, and here I quote, ``wounding'' their grass by
cutting it.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found that when grass and crops are cut and
begin to dry, they release methanol, hexanal, acetaldehyde, acetone
and butatone. These the researchers characterize as ``wound-induced
compounds.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand the full implications of all those chemicals,
but none sounds friendly and there is no way to stay upwind of
them. Researchers say they add to smog and other pollution. Cutting
and cropping produce 1.6 million tons of acetone alone every year.
That's a whopping lot of acetone. Or, at any rate, I suppose it is,
although I have to admit that my idea of just what constitutes ``a
little acetone'' is not yet fully formed.
</P>
<P>
   One Carlton J. Howard of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., has been
quoted as saying this discovery ``is something that needs to be
looked at carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, but we are counseled by the researchers not to panic.
Ray Fall of the University of Colorado says the smell of newly mown
grass probably isn't toxic _ the cautious will note that
``probably'' _ and mowing the lawn is no more hazardous than eating
fresh vegetables, inasmuch as chewing vegetables releases the same
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   (This would seem to raise a problem for vegetarians, because if
chewing and harvesting vegetables is, scientifically speaking,
wounding them, then where is the ethical advantage over eating
animals, which we at least have the decency to put entirely out of
their misery before consuming? But this is another matter entirely
and we will just have to come back to it another day.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Wounding'' may seem strong language but, really, what are all
those emissions if not a cry for help?
</P>
<P>
   So, while we're awaiting that further, close look that Mr.
Howard suggests, it would seem prudent, as an interim strategy,
that lawn movers be put away until further notice. The new suburban
status symbol will be, not the manicured, but the profligate yard.
And the makers of lawn fertilizers might be wise to get their
research shops hopping on new grass-stunting products.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, homeowners, be a prince to nature. Not a Marquis
de Sod.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Draga vs Tito: a precursor?
 &HT;    (For release April 7, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was an impressional youngster during World War II, I
became infatuated with Yugoslavia because, I believed, this was the
one country overrun by the Nazis that was giving its occupiers a
truly nasty time.
</P>
<P>
   This was enhanced by the 1943 motion picture ``Chetniks!,''
starring Philip Dorn and a ton of people nobody ever heard of.
``Chetniks!'' was what they called a B-movie. It was so much a
B-movie that it isn't even available on videotape for me to have a
refreshed remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   As the ethnic cleansing takes its toll and as the missiles fly
into Yugoslavia, I recall the film _ but vaguely. I know it was
about a man named Mihailovich, and he was the heroic leader of a
Nazi-fighting group called the Chetniks. It was patriotic stuff;
it's called wartime propaganda now.
</P>
<P>
   A long time has passed since Mihailovich. Students of
Yugoslavian history know that his first name was Dragomir, and that
his last name was sometimes spelled as Mihajlovic and that he also
was known as Draga or Draza, and that he was mysterious except that
he was fighting Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   There was at the time another group fighting the Nazis in
Yugoslavia. They were called the Partisans but they hated the
Chetniks as much as they did the Nazis. Their paramount commander
was Josip Broz, a.k.a. Tito. I don't recall any of that being in
the film so I looked it up.
</P>
<P>
   Know this: Draga was a Serb, Tito was a Croat. They were an
extension of the hostilities that have obsessed Yugoslavia since
its forced formation at the end of World War I. These were peoples
with diverse languages, cultures and governments who were jammed
together for postwar political accommodation. But it wasn't
felicitous.
</P>
<P>
   When Draga and Tito weren't killing Nazis, they were killing
each other.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Nazis dissected the patched-together
Yugoslavia and doled out portions of it to other members of their
Axis alliance. At its conclusion, Tito emerged the more powerful _
largely because the Western powers discarded Draga (why, I don't
know) while the Soviets embraced Tito. A communist, Tito was
strongly anti-West and wanted a return to the unification of the
states comprising Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   To benefit his assumption of power, Tito captured Mihailovich
and had him executed. That out of the way _ i.e., a Serbian
nationalist disposed of _ Tito proceeded to reunify Yugoslavia with
an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today's Slobodan Milosevic, Tito demanded all parties get
along, even though they despised each other. Milosevic goes in a
different direction. Keeping the land together is fine with him but
some of the people have to go. Thus, the ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the communist leaders, Tito was perhaps the most
independent, and flexible. When Cominform, the association of
communist states, excommunicated Tito because of independent
thought, the old Nazi fighter just rolled a little to his right and
took up with the U.S. and other Western nations, which, by 1951,
were already providing him military equipment in case the Soviets
thought they could shove him around.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling what would have happened if Mihailovich had
won over Tito. As a Serbian nationalist, might he have done earlier
what Milosevic is now doing?
</P>
<P>
   But it was Tito who prevailed and, despite his dictatorship,
Yugoslavia enjoyed a lengthy period of relative peace. It was Tito
who created what we now call the Third World, that in-between
buffer that separated the U.S. and the West from the hard-line
communist bloc.
</P>
<P>
   If communism can have a good side, Yugoslavia was there.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mihailovich, I'll always remember him fondly. Not because
of who he was or wasn't _ I was too young to comprehend _ but for
the motion picture in which he killed lots of Nazis. In retrospect,
I thought it was better than a B-movie.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: When lawn care turns vicious
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been an urban dweller for going on two decades, but I grew
up before World War II in a community that was a virtual prototype
for the standard-issue suburbs that would be spread out like
mayonnaise around our cities after the war. So don't get me wrong.
I know suburbanites are capable of at least a base-line humanity.
</P>
<P>
   How shocking it is then to learn that all these years
suburbanites have been literally torturing nature, Saturday sadists
absolutely devoted in the practice of their peculiar cruelties.
</P>
<P>
   This intelligence comes from the journal ``Geophysical Research
Letters.'' On the off chance you missed the recent issue _ hard to
believe, but I suppose a few of you may have been, let me be blunt,
lazy _ I'll recap: Homeowners and hireling lawn-care companies have
been routinely, and here I quote, ``wounding'' their grass by
cutting it.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found that when grass and crops are cut and
begin to dry, they release methanol, hexanal, acetaldehyde, acetone
and butatone. These the researchers characterize as ``wound-induced
compounds.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand the full implications of all those chemicals,
but none sounds friendly and there is no way to stay upwind of
them. Researchers say they add to smog and other pollution. Cutting
and cropping produce 1.6 million tons of acetone alone every year.
That's a whopping lot of acetone. Or, at any rate, I suppose it is,
although I have to admit that my idea of just what constitutes ``a
little acetone'' is not yet fully formed.
</P>
<P>
   One Carlton J. Howard of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., has been
quoted as saying this discovery ``is something that needs to be
looked at carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, but we are counseled by the researchers not to panic.
Ray Fall of the University of Colorado says the smell of newly mown
grass probably isn't toxic _ the cautious will note that
``probably'' _ and mowing the lawn is no more hazardous than eating
fresh vegetables, inasmuch as chewing vegetables releases the same
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   (This would seem to raise a problem for vegetarians, because if
chewing and harvesting vegetables is, scientifically speaking,
wounding them, then where is the ethical advantage over eating
animals, which we at least have the decency to put entirely out of
their misery before consuming? But this is another matter entirely
and we will just have to come back to it another day.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Wounding'' may seem strong language but, really, what are all
those emissions if not a cry for help?
</P>
<P>
   So, while we're awaiting that further, close look that Mr.
Howard suggests, it would seem prudent, as an interim strategy,
that lawn movers be put away until further notice. The new suburban
status symbol will be, not the manicured, but the profligate yard.
And the makers of lawn fertilizers might be wise to get their
research shops hopping on new grass-stunting products.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, homeowners, be a prince to nature. Not a Marquis
de Sod.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please tell me how to get June tickets for a tour of
Buckingham Palace. _Virginia Beddow
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, Buckingham Palace is open to the public only
from Aug. 6 to Oct. 3. Maybe next trip? Buckingham House was
purchased by King George III in 1761 for his wife, Queen Charlotte,
to use as a comfortable home close to St. James' Palace. In fact,
14 of George's 15 children were born there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About two years ago in Iowa, people broke into an animal
shelter and killed a bunch of animals. I want to know the status of
that case. Were the people put in jail? What is the address of the
animal shelter so I can make a donation? _H. Dalton
</P>
<P>
   A: The incident involved Iowa teens who bludgeoned cats with
baseball bats after breaking into the Noah's Ark Foundation
facility. Sgt. Joe Smutz of the Jefferson County sheriff's
department said the four teens were sentenced to one day in jail
for each cat killed and three years' probation in the juvenile
offender program. Smutz says the Iowa Legislature is considering
legislation to change the penalty for such crimes. Contact the
facility by writing Noah's Ark Foundation, P.O. Box 748, Fairfield,
Iowa 52556.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a disturbing telephone call in which I heard,
``This is a collect call from the IRS to confirm your address.'' I
was so shocked I did nothing, and the call was disconnected. Was
this actually the Internal Revenue Service IRS or an outfit using
the initials to sell something? _Frieda R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although the IRS does many things taxpayers find annoying,
calling collect is not one of them. IRS spokesman Kenneth Vargas
says IRS agents are required to give a name and badge number as
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I used my sister-in-law's gas dryer, and there was a pen left
in some clothes. Now there are streaks all over the inside of the
dryer drum. I have used every cleaner I can think of with no luck.
_Donna G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try Maytag consumer information at (800) 688-1120.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent hail storm left our new car with slight damage.
While we have full insurance, I have heard that using dry ice on
dents will cause them to pop out. Does this work? _ Wade W.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can try it and it may work _ more importantly it won't
hurt. Let the sun heat the metal and pick up some dry ice at a
local store (handle carefully). The warm metal may pop back into
shape when the ice contacts it.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com

 &HT;    Net sites take aim at computer viruses
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you use the Internet at all, it doesn't take a
psychic to know viruses, especially the ``Melissa'' e-mail virus,
have been on your mind lately.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the viruses you read about these days are spread over
the Internet. So it's only right we use the Net to find ways to
fight them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at what may be the best anti-virus site on the Web,
the federal Energy Department's Computer Incident Advisory
Capability, most commonly known by the initials CIAC. You'll find
this site at ciac.llnl.gov/.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, you'll immediately recognize it as a government
site. It isn't fancy, and most of the information consists of text
files with information about the latest viruses. Last week, for
instance, the latest bulletin on the site discussed Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of features of the site that make it so
valuable. For one thing, you'll be able to understand most of the
information without having a degree in computer science. For
another, most of the text bulletins contain Web links that take you
to other sites with valuable data and information. For example, the
Melissa bulletin has a link that takes you to a Microsoft site
which offers a patch (a tiny program that updates or fixes a
problem in another program) for Word 97 that makes changes so the
word processing program is less vulnerable to Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   The same document provides step-by-step information for making
changes in the options for Word to make it safer when it comes to
viruses such as Melissa that tamper with macros (tiny programs that
automate many tasks).
</P>
<P>
   The Web is actually crammed with anti-virus pages. Some of them
are owned by the publishers of commercial anti-virus software.
Don't look down your nose at these sites just because they're
commercial. You'll find plenty of useful information and _
sometimes _ free demo programs. Since there are so many sites, the
next page is a good one to bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Anti-Virus Web sites and is basically a collection
of links to some of the best places on the Web for virus
information. You'll find this page of links at www
</P>
<P>
   .virusbtn.com/AVLinks
</P>
<P>
   /sites.html. You'll find everything from the expected (the CIAC
site we've already mentioned) to the bizarre, a link to sites you'd
never stumble across such as the Slovak Anti-Virus Centre (CQ) at
ftp.elf.stuba.sk/packages
</P>
<P>
   /pub/pc/.
</P>
<P>
   As you learn more about viruses from visiting some of these
pages, you'll discover that rumors and myths spring up on a regular
basis. The real viruses are bad enough but, if all the
misconceptions about viruses and all the phony virus warnings were
true, the Internet would be virtually useless.
</P>
<P>
   At the Computer Virus Myths Homepage at kumite
</P>
<P>
   .com/myths/home.htm, you'll learn some of the legends that
abound in the virus world, including an especially harmful rumor
that circulated on the Web concerning an electronic greeting card
site. The rumor was that a site spread viruses along with the
electronic cards it delivered. That just isn't so, but the buzz
became so pervasive that the site was forced to run a large
disclaimer promising its products were virus-free.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of sites that offer do-it-yourself virus kits and hacking
software. While the information on these sites can be fascinating,
the prudent will avoid visiting these sites and should resist the
temptation to download anything.

 &HT;    Net brings depth to Kosovo issues
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a generation used to wars and international
conflicts that start on Friday and are over by Sunday and broadcast
live or at least in part by CNN or ``Nightline,'' NATO's air
strikes in the Balkan province of Kosovo are bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Iraq, Iran or even the former Soviet Union, the names and
nationalities of the players in the Balkan drama are unfamiliar to
many Americans. Just as TV can bring graphic depictions of war and
its aftermath to people around the world, the Internet can provide
breadth and depth of content impossible to find anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk about community on the Net, but the
international community that has formed around this issue is
something Web surfers should take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of personal feelings about NATO, Kosovo or the
Serbian government, the Web provides the opportunity for an
exchange of views and information that can't be found anywhere
else. There are many sites that can help you understand the
geography and the nature of the conflict, and they are worth
checking out. But after that, why not go a bit deeper and listen to
the voices, American, British, Serbian and Albanian, sharing their
thoughts, feelings and strongly held opinions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Internet is so appropriate now because there is
a general lack of knowledge. The geography is certainly an issue as
well, as well as the nationalities involved,'' says Katherine
Dillon, ABCNews.com's vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com features a special section on its Web site called
``Balkans for Beginners,'' which provides maps, time lines and
other background to help readers understand where the fighting is
and who the participants are.
</P>
<P>
   It's an excellent geography and history lesson and a good
jumping-off point for anyone attempting to understand the conflict.
The Web site is one of the best there is for breaking complicated
news stories down to basics without talking down to or over the
heads of its readers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CNN and MSNBC report large numbers of postings to message
boards from national and international users. CNN has also set up a
special message board for Balkans residents only, but doesn't vouch
for the validity of the posts. ABCNews.com says it has received
more than 13,000 posts on the subject in just over a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional story,'' says Dillon. ``People are
opinionated, and they are angry. Nobody seems to be wishy-washy on
this. We've never seen the flood of reaction. We are amazed how
focused and informed and intelligent these boards are.''
</P>
<P>
   British Broadcasting Co. (news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english
</P>
<P>
   /specialreport/1998/kosovo/), considered by some to be the
finest news organization in the world, offers an international
perspective on the crisis. A RealAudio clip of the BBC World
Service featuring the BBC's John Humphreys in a heated argument
with Milodrag Popovic, deputy information minister in Belgrade,
winds up in a near shouting match that's nothing like the staid
impartiality of the BBC's World Service radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in tears for the millions of people who have lost
their lives and their homes in Kosovo,'' Humphreys nearly screams,
as Popovic maintains the genocide _ if there is any genocide _
didn't begin until NATO began bombing. ``Why did you call me if you
don't want to listen to me?'' Popovic shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC also offers an interactive guide to the Kosovo crisis at
news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/natointeract/nsinteract.html,
which includes an area called talking points, where users can post
opinions and responses.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC has highlighted two comments that illustrate the
complexity of the situation. A Kosovo Albanian writes: ``NATO, we
were waiting for this day to bomb Serbian terrorists. We love you
Nato.'' From the other side, a Belgrade resident writes: ``NATO
please stop your bombs it is not our fault. We are not Slobodan
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on CNN, one reader wrote to another: ``Again, what
evidence there is seems to dispute your version of events, or at
least your sources' version. What is NOT in dispute are the tens of
thousands of refugees being created in Kosovo by Milosevic and his
henchmen. This forced exodus is a human disaster of epic
proportions not seen since WWII.''
</P>
<P>
   While the BCC and others continue to cover the war and engage
its participants, there is no longer any news from Belgrade radio
station B92 (www.b92.net). The posting on the Web site says the
station was shut down on Good Friday by inspectors, policemen fired
the station's director and a court appointed a new director who
will take over on Monday. The signoff reads: ``The struggle
continues. We shall never surrender. Radio B92, Belgrade, Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The B92 site uses RealAudio to replay the chilling sound of an
air-raid siren that lasts for what seems like hours but is in
reality a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Even from the comfort of your den, in front of your computer
with perhaps the TV or a favorite CD playing in the background, the
Balkan war seems to come right into your living room. And when it
does, it gets harder not to become just a little bit smarter and
just a little bit more interested in events taking place half a
world away.

   ATLANTA _ ``The X-Files'' has a little competition on the Web.
It's called the Why Files _ and unlike TV's FBI agents Fox Mulder
and Dana Scully, it has the answers. The Why Files, at
whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/welcome/index.html, provides in-depth
articles about science and how it affects our everyday lives.
Recently the site explored how science can help solve art crimes
and looked at chickens with three legs. Plus, the site offers a
Cool Science Image feature with pictures from the front lines of
science.

   Kids choose what rules
</P>
<P>
   Pizza rules for dinner, and chocolate ice cream is tops for
dessert, according to a recent survey by the Quaker Oats Co. Kids
ages 3 to 12 voted online to ``Choose Who Rules.'' Here's how the
votes shook out: 70 percent would like to have pizza for dinner
over mac and cheese (19 percent) and PB&AMP;J (11 percent); 42 percent
would rather listen to oldies as compared to 34 percent for rap and
24 percent for swing; while 50 percent want chocolate ice cream
over vanilla (32 percent) and strawberry (18 percent). At school,
52 percent of girls preferred art while 42 percent of boys were
crazy for science. You can find more results at

 &HT;    Tennis anyone? It's never too late _ or too early _ to get
started
 &HT;    By Susan Masten
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eighteen-year-old Venus Williams and her 17-year-old
sister, Serena, proved once again you don't have to be an adult to
be fantastic on the tennis court. The two sisters duked it out two
weeks ago for the Lipton Championship title. In the end, Venus beat
her younger sister, but the trophy still went to the same home.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of juniors playing tennis, there's no doubt it's
popular and a game that can be picked up at almost any age.
</P>
<P>
   History of the game
</P>
<P>
   The origins of tennis are somewhat unknown. Some say a game
resembling tennis was played by the Egyptians and later the Greeks.
But it is the French monks in the 12th century that are credited
with developing a game where they tried to hit a ball off the wall
of a courtyard _ hence the name court tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the Royals were playing the game, it then became
known as royal tennis. The ball was made of cloth, wrapped so it
was solid, and players used their hands to hit it. The players got
tired of using their hands and invented rackets. The modern game of
tennis began in 1873 when a British officer developed it from the
earlier game of court tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a racket
</P>
<P>
   To play, you'll need a racket, a can of tennis balls and a
court. There are rackets designed for kids ages 6 to 10. They are
lightweight, shorter in length and have a large head. Longer junior
rackets are designed for ages 8 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to wear a pair of tennis shoes and maybe a hat if
you're playing outside. It's nice if you have someone to hit
against. Some facilities have backboards, so you don't need a
partner to practice.
</P>
<P>
   Getting started
</P>
<P>
   If you've never played before, you might want to take a lesson
from a tennis pro. In an effort to ``Grow the Game'' of tennis in
the Atlanta area, the United States Tennis Association and the
Georgia Professional Tennis Association will offer free beginner
group lessons May 1-16 at 30 sites in the Atlanta area. After
which, you can sign up for six lessons via the USA Tennis 1-2-3
program or sign up for USA Team Tennis, which starts July 10. For
information, or to locate a participating facility near you, call
404-327-5158 or visit the Georgia Tennis Association Web site at
www.georgiata.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of Metro Atlanta run the ACE (AT&AMP;T
Challenge of Excellence) tennis program at 18 facilities throughout
the Atlanta area. More than 400 kids participate in weekly lessons
and annual tournaments. For information or to become a Boys &AMP; Girls
Club member (annual fee of $15), call 404-527-7100. Toon into
tennis at the Cartoon Network's Smash Tennis, which will be out and
about in the Atlanta area April 24 to 27. Costumed cartoon
characters will let you try your luck at skill contests such as
Bedrock Serve-A-Rama, a speed serve game; Dexter's Ultimate Serving
Machine, which works on service return; and the Jetson's Galactic
Blast, which works on the overhead smash. Cartoon Network's Smash
Tennis will be from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 23 and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
April 24 at Piedmont Park and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. April 26 and 2
to 8 p.m. April 27 on-site at the AT&AMP;T Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are you waiting for? Get out on the court and have some
fun.

 &HT;    U.S. increases attacks on Serbian troops
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The United States and its allies in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) increased their bombing of Serbian
troops in Yugoslavia last week. NATO warplanes destroyed a bridge
over the Danube River and struck at military units in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say the Serbs, who rule Yugoslavia and are
Christians, are trying to kill or run out the Albanians who live in
the country's Kosovo province. The Kosovar Albanians are Muslims
and would like their province to be independent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 refugees have overwhelmed neighboring
countries in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. soldiers were captured by the Serbs last week.
President Clinton told Serbs the United States would protect its
own.

   Florida kids smoking less
</P>
<P>
   Middle school students in Florida are lighting up a lot less,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From
1998 to 1999 smoking has declined among those students 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some are crediting an anti-smoking ad campaign for the decrease.
The Florida Legislature provided $70 million to enforce smoking age
limits and for a series of TV and radio ads produced by teenagers
that poke fun at the tobacco industry. The program started last
April.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is the largest among kids since 1980.

Phillies at 4:10 p.m. at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The team is a little less confident than last year with several
key members not playing. Andres Galarraga is fighting back cancer,
Kerry Ligtenberg tore a ligament in his pitching elbow and Bruce
Chen flopped as the newest member of the pitching rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Cloned sheep gives birth
</P>
<P>
   Dolly, the first mammal created by cloning, gave birth to
triplets last week. The three lambs were not created by cloning,
but by Dolly mating with a ram.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the lambs indicate Dolly can make healthy babies.
Her creators say it is important to breed from cloned animals to
check for any unexpected changes in their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly had another baby last year from the same ram. Scientists
say that lamb, Bonnie, appears to be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly was born in July 1996 after scientists cloned her from a
cell from another sheep's udder. She was named after the singer
Dolly Parton.

 &HT;    Backups simplify desktop brain surgery
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yea, though I walk through the valley of Win95, I fear
no evil ... for I have backed up system.dat and user.dat.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like the threat of totally annihilating your
operating system to add a little edge to customizing your computer
and the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   So when you go rooting around in the Windows registry, you're
walking about as close to that edge as you can (without having to
reinstall). I was lucky the first time I went stumbling through the
confusing directory tree of HKEYs. I blithely clicked hither and
yon, not a care in the world, not a backup in sight.
</P>
<P>
   I actually messed up the registry enough that I couldn't boot
into Windows and had to use a special feature of Win95, detailed
below, to restore my system.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well, we're all newbies once.
</P>
<P>
   I've since been fiddling in the registry with a little more
awareness, and it's quite a powerful little database. It stores all
the configuration information and settings for the operating
system, whether it's Win 95, 98 or NT.
</P>
<P>
   You can use it to remove those ugly little arrows at the bottom
of shortcut icons, clean out the add/delete programs list in your
control panel or bury dead file types from old programs. You can
also use it to fine-tune Windows to make your hardware run more
smoothly. It came to the rescue when I moved Office 97 onto a new
hard drive and the program suddenly couldn't find its own
templates.
</P>
<P>
   Windows takes some of the thrill out of doing desktop brain
surgery by automatically creating backups of system.dat and
user.dat in files called system.da0 and user.da0 every time your
operating system successfully boots. (That's helpful because
Microsoft doesn't support hacking the registry, and any attempts to
get their tech support to help fix one you've messed up will
probably not yield decent _ if any _ results.)
</P>
<P>
   System.dat and user.dat are hidden files, so open Windows
Explorer and go to file types under ``view'' and change it to
``show all'' if you can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   You can make your own copies in addition to the auto backups (a
good idea). There's also a Microsoft backup program called
cfgback.exe available on some Win95 CDs in the
(backslash)Other(backslash)Misc(backslash)Cfgback directory _ and
the sites listed below _ that makes multiple backups. Now you're
ready to open regedit.exe, which is in the Windows directory.
Regedit is simply a utility that allows you to see the registry
database as a directory tree, similar to the Windows Explorer. It
also allows you to search the registry with relative ease and avoid
printing the registry out _ which can easily run to more than 1,000
pages. Instead, we'll open regedit, and we find the infamous HKEYS:
</P>
<P>
   HKEYUSERS
</P>
<P>
   HKEYLOCALMACHINE
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCLASSESROOT
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCURRENTUSER
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCURRENTCONFIG
</P>
<P>
   HKEYDYNDATA
</P>
<P>
   The first two are the primary branches, with USERS storing the
preferences for the different users, and LOCALMACHINE keeping track
of the hardware configuration and the software file types. The next
three HKEYs are actually places to store information while the
system is in use, with CLASSESROOT being a mirror of the software
settings under HKEYLOCAL
</P>
<P>
   MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Classes. The last one, HKEYDYNDATA, keeps track
of plug-and-play devices and changes as they are added or removed.
</P>
<P>
   The actual keys are stored inside the HKEYs as subdirectories,
sometimes several layers into the directory tree, and appear as
folders holding one or several icons. Each icon represents a data
type and has a value written as either a string of text, binary
data (as a hexadecimal) or dword data (also as hexadecimal).
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean? These values are where you can do
your most stunning _ or devastating _ work on your system. For
instance, when Office 97 somehow lost track of its templates (never
mind that they were sitting right in the Office subdirectory), the
fix was simple and quick. I opened regedit and, after doing a few
searches, I was able to find several values that pointed to the old
hard drive path. Simply changing the drive letter in the
appropriate values made everything run smoothly again.
</P>
<P>
   When my video capture card and NetMeeting weren't getting along,
the fix was even easier. On the card manufacturer's tech support
Web page, I found the answer to my specific situation, which merely
involved finding one key in the registry and changing three values
slightly. Voila! These fixes were mere parlor tricks, though,
compared with what a little reverse engineering on the registry can
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't hurt to familiarize yourself with the procedures
for restoring a backup registry, just in case you get a little too
zealous with your experiments and end up facing the Windows blue
screen of death.

 &HT;    PC World dissects Pentium III performance
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   The first Pentium III microprocessors, which can hit speeds up
to 500 megahertz, are featured in the cover story of the April
issue of PC World. The magazine review said the Pentium III at that
speed can run some business applications 10 times faster than
current state-of-the-art chips. Web applications and games also run
faster with the Pentium III, says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, you can also get a sneak peek at
Office 2000, the ubiquitous business suite from Microsoft. The
magazine says Microsoft has not made any dramatic improvements in
the latest version of Office, due out later this year. It has,
however, tweaked many of the components. Those components include
Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. PC World also says Office
continues to grow in size, now commanding at least 189 megabytes of
hard disk space.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can build a city, fly a fighter and now you can build and
manage an amusement park on your computer. It's part of a new game
called ``Rollercoaster Tycoon.'' In this computer CD game, you
design, build and manage a roller coaster theme park. It's designed
for kids 9 and older. Published by Hasbro Interactive,
``Rollercoaster Tycoon'' is available only for PCs running Windows
95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Another new simulation is the latest addition to the ``Fighter
Squadron'' series from Activision. This one is called ``The
Screamin' Demons over Europe'' and features aerial dogfights from
World War II. The game offers 10 authentic aircraft to choose from.
The ``Fighter Squadron'' series is only for PCs using Windows 95 or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   As a description on Yahoo! put it, ``You'll want to wash you
hands after visiting this Web site.'' That's because it features
the world of infectious diseases. The site is the online version of
an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
It's a history of epidemics. You'll find the site at www.amnh.org

 &HT;    Splurge at buythebest.com
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you in the market for a $2.5 million,
single-engine turboprop but just don't have the time to shop?
</P>
<P>
   A Web site, www.buythebest.com, might be worth checking out. The
site is devoted to the real expensive and mildly practical. Think
of it as Robin Leach meets Sharper Image. It's the type of site
where Bill Gates could find something nice and little for fellow
Microsoft founder and billionaire Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   You can't actually buy a plane from the site. If you are
interested in the Pilatus PC-12, you can fill out a form and a
Pilatus dealer will contact you.
</P>
<P>
   There are more-affordable items, relatively speaking, as well.
An ergonomic chair sells for $1,070. A titanium-frame bike is
peddled for $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site targets the consumer searching for state-of-the-art
stuff. Products include a $580 briefcase, an $85,000 Hummer and a
$12,000 jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   The site features more than 20 products. Included are product
pictures, information, descriptions and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Buythebest.com, the catalog for connoisseurs, is based in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   An online Easter
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site lets you make a virtual pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, just in time for Easter Sunday. The site,
virtualholyland.com, seeks to be a portal for all things Middle
East. The start page offers weather reports for Jerusalem and
Galilee and 24-hour news updates from the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   It has a host of Middle East-themed features, including the
Holycam, a camera focused on Jerusalem's Western Wall; a free
e-mail account, zionmail.com; a scrolling breaking-news ticker; and
Holy Land-themed chat rooms and forums.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets visitors observe a traditional Passover seder, the
meal Jesus ate the night before he died. The site also features a
video tour of Calvary, including the skull-faced hill that some
believe to overlook the site of Jesus' death and the Garden Tomb, a
hand-carved grave said to be where his body lay for three days
between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the site will transmit the radio broadcast of two
Easter services from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The site, launched in December, includes travel tips, a Kid's
Club and an online Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Online arts connection
</P>
<P>
   In its race to be a mass medium like television, the Web already
has the commercial and low-brow departments covered. But it also
will need more culture.
</P>
<P>
   A site at www.culturefinder.com/ hopes to add some. The site
claims arts listings for more than 1,000 cities. Detailed
information is given for larger cities. Atlanta, Dallas, Houston,
Miami and Minneapolis are on that list, which also includes Boston,
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers information about plays, classical music
concerts, opera, visual arts, dance and film.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can search by state or by arts
organization, date or venue. They can also check museum listings
for certain museums. The only museum listing for Georgia is the
High Museum of Art, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add your e-mail address to the free weekly e-mail
newsletter. In its January issue, Yahoo! Internet Life magazine
rated CultureFinder.com the Internet's best cultural directory.

 &HT;    Updated anti-virus program has become a necessity
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I remember years ago writing a column that said
computer virus fears were overblown. I said the chances of getting
hit by a virus were about the same as a meteor hitting you while
driving along Interstate 285.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that advice was true at the time. But nowadays, the
Internet and the computer world are being bombarded regularly by
meteor showers when it comes to viruses and other malicious
programs designed to invade your privacy or destroy information on
your hard disk. The most recent example is ``Melissa,'' a tiny
stealth program that sneaks into your computer as an e-mail
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have read all you want to read about Melissa. She's
been one popular girl. And police in New Jersey arrested David L.
Smith, 30, Thursday night and charged him with being Melissa's
daddy. So I won't spend much time with her other than to tell you
if you still need to know how to defend yourself against that
particular virus, you can find all the information you need online.
One great site is located at www.zdnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   While Melissa is a danger, the really frightening news is the
me-too viruses all that publicity spawned. The creators of viruses
do it partially for the twisted joy of watching all the turmoil
they create. And we've already seen Melissa imitators such as Papa
that invade your computer using a spreadsheet attachment instead of
_ as in the case of Melissa _ a Microsoft Word document. Most
anti-virus software companies have created patches (tiny programs
that update an existing application) that allow their programs to
catch Melissa and Papa. Just check the Web site for your anti-virus
program.
</P>
<P>
   The new viruses are being created so fast that even the best
anti-virus software can't keep up. That's not to say you shouldn't
use anti-virus protection. Nowadays, you're just plain foolish if
you don't. But think of all the people _ including employees of
companies that have excellent security and anti-virus protection _
that suffered from Melissa before it was discovered. In a twisted
way, these folks were the pioneers who suffered the embarrassment
and inconvenience of learning sensitive Word documents of theirs
were being sent around the world by Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no longer good enough to simply rely on anti-virus
software. I'm not being hysterical when I say you are vulnerable to
a virus attack, no matter what you do. But there are some
precautions you can take _ especially in view of the latest fad of
invading the documents and data on your hard disk _ to lessen the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   First, get a good anti-virus program and make sure you update it
regularly. Once a week isn't too frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Next, simply refuse to open e-mail attachments, even if they
come from someone you know. As you'll recall, that's the trick
Melissa introduced, making it seem the e-mail came from someone you
know. If you receive an attachment, don't open it. Up to now _ and
things are changing so fast you can't count on this in the future _
all of these viruses and malevolent programs arrive in an
attachment. Plain old-fashioned e-mail is safe.
</P>
<P>
   If you have documents or e-mail that would be embarrassing or
could be used to invade your bank account or reveal other financial
information, you may want to consider keeping them on a ZIP drive
disk or a floppy disk. This is painful, since the whole idea of a
computer is convenience and storing sensitive documents elsewhere
takes time and is inefficient. But there's no other way I know to
protect this information.
</P>
<P>
   This is all depressing to a fellow like me. I've spent years and
years extolling the virtues of computers and the Internet. And now
I worry that, unless someone comes up with a way to increase
security, it's becoming a risky and even seamy place. I wish I
could offer reassurance. Instead, I offer my sympathy along with a
Web site that offers a free computer check for viruses:
www.mcaffee.com/.

 &HT;    Delicate operation succeeds, but accomplishes nothing
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When last we saw Oklahoma Warner, he was indulging in
a refreshing nap before trying to snatch the Bus of Doom off the
pedestal so swiftly the cave didn't collapse on him.
</P>
<P>
   It was close, folks. Real close.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tuned in last week may remember I was trying to review
a $100 gadget called a Philips USB PC Camera, which uses the new
Universal Serial Bus connection. After a lengthy and tedious
installation project, the camera wouldn't work, presumably because
my computer's BIOS needed updating.
</P>
<P>
   Updating a BIOS is the computer equivalent of brain surgery. One
slip and the old Pentium II is a cabbage. It was not something I
wished to rush into.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions with the new Intel BIOS I downloaded from the
Gateway Web site said to begin by making a startup floppy disk
through the Create Startup tab in the Add/Remove Programs section
of the Control Panel. OK, no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Then it said to copy onto this same disk all the files contained
in the new BIOS. Sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these instructions were purely theoretical. In the
practical world, the files wouldn't all fit on the disk. Using my
trusty 12-foot bullwhip _ being a Lash LaRue fan, I actually owned
one of these as a kid _ I shaved a few seemingly unnecessary
programs like FDISK and DRIVESPACE out of the startup disk section
so all of the BIOS files would fit.
</P>
<P>
   Shut down, insert the disk, start up. A program guided me
through the installation of the flash BIOS, with lots of red text
and exclamation marks to keep my blood pressure from falling too
low.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to open the computer, locate jumper J7B1, and
change it from pins 1-2 to pins 2-3, which puts the computer into a
maintenance mode so one can be sure the proper processor speed is
set.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who have never had the pleasure of fiddling with
these devices will no doubt be clamoring for elucidation here.
Jumpers are, in this case, on the motherboard of the computer. The
motherboard is a very busy place, full of all kinds of little
shapes and thingies. J7B1 is a three-pin setup. Each pin is copper,
about half the thickness of an ordinary paper-clip wire, and
perhaps a quarter of an inch long. Of course, since you are looking
pretty much straight down on them, it doesn't matter how long they
are. The jumper is a plastic affair that slips over two of the pins
to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while to find J7B1, it being dark and me being
semi-blind, but it was at least out in the open. Changing the
jumper is a simple matter if you have a hand the size and
suppleness of my 10-year-old granddaughter. But I have done enough
of these now to know what's going to happen, and to be reasonably
patient with the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   Once the jumper was changed, the computer was rebooted and the
BIOS setup checked. All was fine. The jumper was returned to pins
1-2, the computer booted again, and after a few grumbles and
whimpers it came to life in a reasonably normal fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The camera still won't work. I never really thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   I can well imagine the frustration of the average computer owner
who goes out and lays down $100 for something like this, hoping to
extend the capabilities of his equipment and have some fun. After
$200 worth of aggravation, he's right back where he started _ at
the computer store, getting a refund.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't enjoy tinkering with the insides of a computer
shouldn't feel bad about it. Most things will have a better outcome
than this, but don't go beyond a point where you feel really
uncomfortable. Do what you feel up to doing, and if that doesn't
work, then let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, if I didn't get paid to do this sort of thing, I would
have tossed in the towel without trying to replace the BIOS.
Snatching the Bus of Doom safely off the pedestal was a rush, but
discovering it didn't work as advertised was a bummer. Oh, and in
case you're wondering what happened to those outraged natives I
heard screaming at the mouth of the cave, they turned out to be the
guinea pigs demanding dinner.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please tell me how to get June tickets for a tour of
Buckingham Palace. _Virginia Beddow
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, Buckingham Palace is open to the public only
from Aug. 6 to Oct. 3. Maybe next trip? Buckingham House was
purchased by King George III in 1761 for his wife, Queen Charlotte,
to use as a comfortable home close to St. James' Palace. In fact,
14 of George's 15 children were born there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About two years ago in Iowa, people broke into an animal
shelter and killed a bunch of animals. I want to know the status of
that case. Were the people put in jail? What is the address of the
animal shelter so I can make a donation? _H. Dalton
</P>
<P>
   A: The incident involved Iowa teens who bludgeoned cats with
baseball bats after breaking into the Noah's Ark Foundation
facility. Sgt. Joe Smutz of the Jefferson County sheriff's
department said the four teens were sentenced to one day in jail
for each cat killed and three years' probation in the juvenile
offender program. Smutz says the Iowa Legislature is considering
legislation to change the penalty for such crimes. Contact the
facility by writing Noah's Ark Foundation, P.O. Box 748, Fairfield,
Iowa 52556.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a disturbing telephone call in which I heard,
``This is a collect call from the IRS to confirm your address.'' I
was so shocked I did nothing, and the call was disconnected. Was
this actually the Internal Revenue Service IRS or an outfit using
the initials to sell something? _Frieda R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although the IRS does many things taxpayers find annoying,
calling collect is not one of them. IRS spokesman Kenneth Vargas
says IRS agents are required to give a name and badge number as
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I used my sister-in-law's gas dryer, and there was a pen left
in some clothes. Now there are streaks all over the inside of the
dryer drum. I have used every cleaner I can think of with no luck.
_Donna G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try Maytag consumer information at (800) 688-1120.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent hail storm left our new car with slight damage.
While we have full insurance, I have heard that using dry ice on
dents will cause them to pop out. Does this work? _ Wade W.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can try it and it may work _ more importantly it won't
hurt. Let the sun heat the metal and pick up some dry ice at a
local store (handle carefully). The warm metal may pop back into
shape when the ice contacts it.
</P>

 &HT;    Net sites take aim at computer viruses
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you use the Internet at all, it doesn't take a
psychic to know viruses, especially the ``Melissa'' e-mail virus,
have been on your mind lately.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the viruses you read about these days are spread over
the Internet. So it's only right we use the Net to find ways to
fight them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at what may be the best anti-virus site on the Web,
the federal Energy Department's Computer Incident Advisory
Capability, most commonly known by the initials CIAC. You'll find
this site at ciac.llnl.gov/.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, you'll immediately recognize it as a government
site. It isn't fancy, and most of the information consists of text
files with information about the latest viruses. Last week, for
instance, the latest bulletin on the site discussed Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of features of the site that make it so
valuable. For one thing, you'll be able to understand most of the
information without having a degree in computer science. For
another, most of the text bulletins contain Web links that take you
to other sites with valuable data and information. For example, the
Melissa bulletin has a link that takes you to a Microsoft site
which offers a patch (a tiny program that updates or fixes a
problem in another program) for Word 97 that makes changes so the
word processing program is less vulnerable to Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   The same document provides step-by-step information for making
changes in the options for Word to make it safer when it comes to
viruses such as Melissa that tamper with macros (tiny programs that
automate many tasks).
</P>
<P>
   The Web is actually crammed with anti-virus pages. Some of them
are owned by the publishers of commercial anti-virus software.
Don't look down your nose at these sites just because they're
commercial. You'll find plenty of useful information and _
sometimes _ free demo programs. Since there are so many sites, the
next page is a good one to bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Anti-Virus Web sites and is basically a collection
of links to some of the best places on the Web for virus
information. You'll find this page of links at www
</P>
<P>
   .virusbtn.com/AVLinks
</P>
<P>
   /sites.html. You'll find everything from the expected (the CIAC
site we've already mentioned) to the bizarre, a link to sites you'd
never stumble across such as the Slovak Anti-Virus Centre (CQ) at
ftp.elf.stuba.sk/packages
</P>
<P>
   /pub/pc/.
</P>
<P>
   As you learn more about viruses from visiting some of these
pages, you'll discover that rumors and myths spring up on a regular
basis. The real viruses are bad enough but, if all the
misconceptions about viruses and all the phony virus warnings were
true, the Internet would be virtually useless.

   .com/myths/home.htm, you'll learn some of the legends that
abound in the virus world, including an especially harmful rumor
that circulated on the Web concerning an electronic greeting card
site. The rumor was that a site spread viruses along with the
electronic cards it delivered. That just isn't so, but the buzz
became so pervasive that the site was forced to run a large
disclaimer promising its products were virus-free.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of sites that offer do-it-yourself virus kits and hacking
software. While the information on these sites can be fascinating,
the prudent will avoid visiting these sites and should resist the
temptation to download anything.

 &HT;    Net brings depth to Kosovo issues
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a generation used to wars and international
conflicts that start on Friday and are over by Sunday and broadcast
live or at least in part by CNN or ``Nightline,'' NATO's air
strikes in the Balkan province of Kosovo are bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Iraq, Iran or even the former Soviet Union, the names and
nationalities of the players in the Balkan drama are unfamiliar to
many Americans. Just as TV can bring graphic depictions of war and
its aftermath to people around the world, the Internet can provide
breadth and depth of content impossible to find anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk about community on the Net, but the
international community that has formed around this issue is
something Web surfers should take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of personal feelings about NATO, Kosovo or the
Serbian government, the Web provides the opportunity for an
exchange of views and information that can't be found anywhere
else. There are many sites that can help you understand the
geography and the nature of the conflict, and they are worth
checking out. But after that, why not go a bit deeper and listen to
the voices, American, British, Serbian and Albanian, sharing their
thoughts, feelings and strongly held opinions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Internet is so appropriate now because there is
a general lack of knowledge. The geography is certainly an issue as
well, as well as the nationalities involved,'' says Katherine
Dillon, ABCNews.com's vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com features a special section on its Web site called
``Balkans for Beginners,'' which provides maps, time lines and
other background to help readers understand where the fighting is
and who the participants are.
</P>
<P>
   It's an excellent geography and history lesson and a good
jumping-off point for anyone attempting to understand the conflict.
The Web site is one of the best there is for breaking complicated
news stories down to basics without talking down to or over the
heads of its readers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CNN and MSNBC report large numbers of postings to message
boards from national and international users. CNN has also set up a
special message board for Balkans residents only, but doesn't vouch
for the validity of the posts. ABCNews.com says it has received
more than 13,000 posts on the subject in just over a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional story,'' says Dillon. ``People are
opinionated, and they are angry. Nobody seems to be wishy-washy on
this. We've never seen the flood of reaction. We are amazed how
focused and informed and intelligent these boards are.''
</P>
<P>
   British Broadcasting Co. (news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english
</P>
<P>
   /specialreport/1998/kosovo/), considered by some to be the
finest news organization in the world, offers an international
perspective on the crisis. A RealAudio clip of the BBC World
Service featuring the BBC's John Humphreys in a heated argument
with Milodrag Popovic, deputy information minister in Belgrade,
winds up in a near shouting match that's nothing like the staid
impartiality of the BBC's World Service radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in tears for the millions of people who have lost
their lives and their homes in Kosovo,'' Humphreys nearly screams,
as Popovic maintains the genocide _ if there is any genocide _
didn't begin until NATO began bombing. ``Why did you call me if you
don't want to listen to me?'' Popovic shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC also offers an interactive guide to the Kosovo crisis at
news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/natointeract/nsinteract.html,
which includes an area called talking points, where users can post
opinions and responses.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC has highlighted two comments that illustrate the
complexity of the situation. A Kosovo Albanian writes: ``NATO, we
were waiting for this day to bomb Serbian terrorists. We love you
Nato.'' From the other side, a Belgrade resident writes: ``NATO
please stop your bombs it is not our fault. We are not Slobodan
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on CNN, one reader wrote to another: ``Again, what
evidence there is seems to dispute your version of events, or at
least your sources' version. What is NOT in dispute are the tens of
thousands of refugees being created in Kosovo by Milosevic and his
henchmen. This forced exodus is a human disaster of epic
proportions not seen since WWII.''
</P>
<P>
   While the BCC and others continue to cover the war and engage
its participants, there is no longer any news from Belgrade radio
station B92 (www.b92.net). The posting on the Web site says the
station was shut down on Good Friday by inspectors, policemen fired
the station's director and a court appointed a new director who
will take over on Monday. The signoff reads: ``The struggle
continues. We shall never surrender. Radio B92, Belgrade, Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The B92 site uses RealAudio to replay the chilling sound of an
air-raid siren that lasts for what seems like hours but is in
reality a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Even from the comfort of your den, in front of your computer
with perhaps the TV or a favorite CD playing in the background, the
Balkan war seems to come right into your living room. And when it
does, it gets harder not to become just a little bit smarter and
just a little bit more interested in events taking place half a
world away.

 &HT;    Backups simplify desktop brain surgery
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yea, though I walk through the valley of Win95, I fear
no evil ... for I have backed up system.dat and user.dat.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like the threat of totally annihilating your
operating system to add a little edge to customizing your computer
and the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   So when you go rooting around in the Windows registry, you're
walking about as close to that edge as you can (without having to
reinstall). I was lucky the first time I went stumbling through the
confusing directory tree of HKEYs. I blithely clicked hither and
yon, not a care in the world, not a backup in sight.
</P>
<P>
   I actually messed up the registry enough that I couldn't boot
into Windows and had to use a special feature of Win95, detailed
below, to restore my system.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well, we're all newbies once.
</P>
<P>
   I've since been fiddling in the registry with a little more
awareness, and it's quite a powerful little database. It stores all
the configuration information and settings for the operating
system, whether it's Win 95, 98 or NT.
</P>
<P>
   You can use it to remove those ugly little arrows at the bottom
of shortcut icons, clean out the add/delete programs list in your
control panel or bury dead file types from old programs. You can
also use it to fine-tune Windows to make your hardware run more
smoothly. It came to the rescue when I moved Office 97 onto a new
hard drive and the program suddenly couldn't find its own
templates.
</P>
<P>
   Windows takes some of the thrill out of doing desktop brain
surgery by automatically creating backups of system.dat and
user.dat in files called system.da0 and user.da0 every time your
operating system successfully boots. (That's helpful because
Microsoft doesn't support hacking the registry, and any attempts to
get their tech support to help fix one you've messed up will
probably not yield decent _ if any _ results.)
</P>
<P>
   System.dat and user.dat are hidden files, so open Windows
Explorer and go to file types under ``view'' and change it to
``show all'' if you can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   You can make your own copies in addition to the auto backups (a
good idea). There's also a Microsoft backup program called
cfgback.exe available on some Win95 CDs in the
(backslash)Other(backslash)Misc(backslash)Cfgback directory _ and
the sites listed below _ that makes multiple backups. Now you're
ready to open regedit.exe, which is in the Windows directory.
Regedit is simply a utility that allows you to see the registry
database as a directory tree, similar to the Windows Explorer. It
also allows you to search the registry with relative ease and avoid
printing the registry out _ which can easily run to more than 1,000
pages. Instead, we'll open regedit, and we find the infamous HKEYS:
</P>
<P>
   HKEYUSERS
</P>
<P>
   HKEYLOCALMACHINE
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCLASSESROOT
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCURRENTUSER
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCURRENTCONFIG
</P>
<P>
   HKEYDYNDATA
</P>
<P>
   The first two are the primary branches, with USERS storing the
preferences for the different users, and LOCALMACHINE keeping track
of the hardware configuration and the software file types. The next
three HKEYs are actually places to store information while the
system is in use, with CLASSESROOT being a mirror of the software
settings under HKEYLOCAL
</P>
<P>
   MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Classes. The last one, HKEYDYNDATA, keeps track
of plug-and-play devices and changes as they are added or removed.
</P>
<P>
   The actual keys are stored inside the HKEYs as subdirectories,
sometimes several layers into the directory tree, and appear as
folders holding one or several icons. Each icon represents a data
type and has a value written as either a string of text, binary
data (as a hexadecimal) or dword data (also as hexadecimal).
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean? These values are where you can do
your most stunning _ or devastating _ work on your system. For
instance, when Office 97 somehow lost track of its templates (never
mind that they were sitting right in the Office subdirectory), the
fix was simple and quick. I opened regedit and, after doing a few
searches, I was able to find several values that pointed to the old
hard drive path. Simply changing the drive letter in the
appropriate values made everything run smoothly again.
</P>
<P>
   When my video capture card and NetMeeting weren't getting along,
the fix was even easier. On the card manufacturer's tech support
Web page, I found the answer to my specific situation, which merely
involved finding one key in the registry and changing three values
slightly. Voila! These fixes were mere parlor tricks, though,
compared with what a little reverse engineering on the registry can
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't hurt to familiarize yourself with the procedures
for restoring a backup registry, just in case you get a little too
zealous with your experiments and end up facing the Windows blue
screen of death.

 &HT;    PC World dissects Pentium III performance
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   The first Pentium III microprocessors, which can hit speeds up
to 500 megahertz, are featured in the cover story of the April
issue of PC World. The magazine review said the Pentium III at that
speed can run some business applications 10 times faster than
current state-of-the-art chips. Web applications and games also run
faster with the Pentium III, says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, you can also get a sneak peek at
Office 2000, the ubiquitous business suite from Microsoft. The
magazine says Microsoft has not made any dramatic improvements in
the latest version of Office, due out later this year. It has,
however, tweaked many of the components. Those components include
Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. PC World also says Office
continues to grow in size, now commanding at least 189 megabytes of
hard disk space.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can build a city, fly a fighter and now you can build and
manage an amusement park on your computer. It's part of a new game
called ``Rollercoaster Tycoon.'' In this computer CD game, you
design, build and manage a roller coaster theme park. It's designed
for kids 9 and older. Published by Hasbro Interactive,
``Rollercoaster Tycoon'' is available only for PCs running Windows
95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Another new simulation is the latest addition to the ``Fighter
Squadron'' series from Activision. This one is called ``The
Screamin' Demons over Europe'' and features aerial dogfights from
World War II. The game offers 10 authentic aircraft to choose from.
The ``Fighter Squadron'' series is only for PCs using Windows 95 or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   As a description on Yahoo! put it, ``You'll want to wash you
hands after visiting this Web site.'' That's because it features
the world of infectious diseses. The site is the online version of
an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
It's a history of epidemics. You'll find the site at www.amnh.org

 &HT;    Splurge at buythebest.com
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you in the market for a $2.5 million,
single-engine turboprop but just don't have the time to shop?
</P>
<P>
   A Web site, www.buythebest.com, might be worth checking out. The
site is devoted to the real expensive and mildly practical. Think
of it as Robin Leach meets Sharper Image. It's the type of site
where Bill Gates could find something nice and little for fellow
Microsoft founder and billionaire Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   You can't actually buy a plane from the site. If you are
interested in the Pilatus PC-12, you can fill out a form and a
Pilatus dealer will contact you.
</P>
<P>
   There are more-affordable items, relatively speaking, as well.
An ergonomic chair sells for $1,070. A titanium-frame bike is
peddled for $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site targets the consumer searching for state-of-the-art
stuff. Products include a $580 briefcase, an $85,000 Hummer and a
$12,000 jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   The site features more than 20 products. Included are product
pictures, information, descriptions and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Buythebest.com, the catalog for connoisseurs, is based in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   An online Easter
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site lets you make a virtual pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, just in time for Easter Sunday. The site,
virtualholyland.com, seeks to be a portal for all things Middle
East. The start page offers weather reports for Jerusalem and
Galilee and 24-hour news updates from the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   It has a host of Middle East-themed features, including the
Holycam, a camera focused on Jerusalem's Western Wall; a free
e-mail account, zionmail.com; a scrolling breaking-news ticker; and
Holy Land-themed chat rooms and forums.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets visitors observe a traditional Passover seder, the
meal Jesus ate the night before he died. The site also features a
video tour of Calvary, including the skull-faced hill that some
believe to overlook the site of Jesus' death and the Garden Tomb, a
hand-carved grave said to be where his body lay for three days
between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the site will transmit the radio broadcast of two
Easter services from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The site, launched in December, includes travel tips, a Kid's
Club and an online Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Online arts connection
</P>
<P>
   In its race to be a mass medium like television, the Web already
has the commercial and low-brow departments covered. But it also
will need more culture.
</P>
<P>
   A site at www.culturefinder.com/ hopes to add some. The site
claims arts listings for more than 1,000 cities. Detailed
information is given for larger cities. Atlanta, Dallas, Houston,
Miami and Minneapolis are on that list, which also includes Boston,
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers information about plays, classical music
concerts, opera, visual arts, dance and film.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can search by state or by arts
organization, date or venue. They can also check museum listings
for certain museums. The only museum listing for Georgia is the
High Museum of Art, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add your e-mail address to the free weekly e-mail
newsletter. In its January issue, Yahoo! Internet Life magazine
rated CultureFinder.com the Internet's best cultural directory.

 &HT;    Updated anti-virus program has become a necessity
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I remember years ago writing a column that said
computer virus fears were overblown. I said the chances of getting
hit by a virus were about the same as a meteor hitting you while
driving along Interstate 285.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that advice was true at the time. But nowadays, the
Internet and the computer world are being bombarded regularly by
meteor showers when it comes to viruses and other malicious
programs designed to invade your privacy or destroy information on
your hard disk. The most recent example is ``Melissa,'' a tiny
stealth program that sneaks into your computer as an e-mail
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have read all you want to read about Melissa. She's
been one popular girl. And police in New Jersey arrested David L.
Smith, 30, Thursday night and charged him with being Melissa's
daddy. So I won't spend much time with her other than to tell you
if you still need to know how to defend yourself against that
particular virus, you can find all the information you need online.
One great site is located at www.zdnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   While Melissa is a danger, the really frightening news is the
me-too viruses all that publicity spawned. The creators of viruses
do it partially for the twisted joy of watching all the turmoil
they create. And we've already seen Melissa imitators such as Papa
that invade your computer using a spreadsheet attachment instead of
_ as in the case of Melissa _ a Microsoft Word document. Most
anti-virus software companies have created patches (tiny programs
that update an existing application) that allow their programs to
catch Melissa and Papa. Just check the Web site for your anti-virus
program.
</P>
<P>
   The new viruses are being created so fast that even the best
anti-virus software can't keep up. That's not to say you shouldn't
use anti-virus protection. Nowadays, you're just plain foolish if
you don't. But think of all the people _ including employees of
companies that have excellent security and anti-virus protection _
that suffered from Melissa before it was discovered. In a twisted
way, these folks were the pioneers who suffered the embarrassment
and inconvenience of learning sensitive Word documents of theirs
were being sent around the world by Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no longer good enough to simply rely on anti-virus
software. I'm not being hysterical when I say you are vulnerable to
a virus attack, no matter what you do. But there are some
precautions you can take _ especially in view of the latest fad of
invading the documents and data on your hard disk _ to lessen the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   First, get a good anti-virus program and make sure you update it
regularly. Once a week isn't too frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Next, simply refuse to open e-mail attachments, even if they
come from someone you know. As you'll recall, that's the trick
Melissa introduced, making it seem the e-mail came from someone you
know. If you receive an attachment, don't open it. Up to now _ and
things are changing so fast you can't count on this in the future _
all of these viruses and malevolent programs arrive in an
attachment. Plain old-fashioned e-mail is safe.
</P>
<P>
   If you have documents or e-mail that would be embarrassing or
could be used to invade your bank account or reveal other financial
information, you may want to consider keeping them on a ZIP drive
disk or a floppy disk. This is painful, since the whole idea of a
computer is convenience and storing sensitive documents elsewhere
takes time and is inefficient. But there's no other way I know to
protect this information.
</P>
<P>
   This is all depressing to a fellow like me. I've spent years and
years extolling the virtues of computers and the Internet. And now
I worry that, unless someone comes up with a way to increase
security, it's becoming a risky and even seamy place. I wish I
could offer reassurance. Instead, I offer my sympathy along with a
Web site that offers a free computer check for viruses:
www.mcaffee.com/.

 &HT;    Delicate operation succeeds, but accomplishes nothing
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When last we saw Oklahoma Warner, he was indulging in
a refreshing nap before trying to snatch the Bus of Doom off the
pedestal so swiftly the cave didn't collapse on him.
</P>
<P>
   It was close, folks. Real close.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tuned in last week may remember I was trying to review
a $100 gadget called a Philips USB PC Camera, which uses the new
Universal Serial Bus connection. After a lengthy and tedious
installation project, the camera wouldn't work, presumably because
my computer's BIOS needed updating.
</P>
<P>
   Updating a BIOS is the computer equivalent of brain surgery. One
slip and the old Pentium II is a cabbage. It was not something I
wished to rush into.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions with the new Intel BIOS I downloaded from the
Gateway Web site said to begin by making a startup floppy disk
through the Create Startup tab in the Add/Remove Programs section
of the Control Panel. OK, no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Then it said to copy onto this same disk all the files contained
in the new BIOS. Sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these instructions were purely theoretical. In the
practical world, the files wouldn't all fit on the disk. Using my
trusty 12-foot bullwhip _ being a Lash LaRue fan, I actually owned
one of these as a kid _ I shaved a few seemingly unnecessary
programs like FDISK and DRIVESPACE out of the startup disk section
so all of the BIOS files would fit.
</P>
<P>
   Shut down, insert the disk, start up. A program guided me
through the installation of the flash BIOS, with lots of red text
and exclamation marks to keep my blood pressure from falling too
low.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to open the computer, locate jumper J7B1, and
change it from pins 1-2 to pins 2-3, which puts the computer into a
maintenance mode so one can be sure the proper processor speed is
set.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who have never had the pleasure of fiddling with
these devices will no doubt be clamoring for elucidation here.
Jumpers are, in this case, on the motherboard of the computer. The
motherboard is a very busy place, full of all kinds of little
shapes and thingies. J7B1 is a three-pin setup. Each pin is copper,
about half the thickness of an ordinary paper-clip wire, and
perhaps a quarter of an inch long. Of course, since you are looking
pretty much straight down on them, it doesn't matter how long they
are. The jumper is a plastic affair that slips over two of the pins
to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while to find J7B1, it being dark and me being
semi-blind, but it was at least out in the open. Changing the
jumper is a simple matter if you have a hand the size and
suppleness of my 10-year-old granddaughter. But I have done enough
of these now to know what's going to happen, and to be reasonably
patient with the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   Once the jumper was changed, the computer was rebooted and the
BIOS setup checked. All was fine. The jumper was returned to pins
1-2, the computer booted again, and after a few grumbles and
whimpers it came to life in a reasonably normal fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The camera still won't work. I never really thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   I can well imagine the frustration of the average computer owner
who goes out and lays down $100 for something like this, hoping to
extend the capabilities of his equipment and have some fun. After
$200 worth of aggravation, he's right back where he started _ at
the computer store, getting a refund.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't enjoy tinkering with the insides of a computer
shouldn't feel bad about it. Most things will have a better outcome
than this, but don't go beyond a point where you feel really
uncomfortable. Do what you feel up to doing, and if that doesn't
work, then let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, if I didn't get paid to do this sort of thing, I would
have tossed in the towel without trying to replace the BIOS.
Snatching the Bus of Doom safely off the pedestal was a rush, but
discovering it didn't work as advertised was a bummer. Oh, and in
case you're wondering what happened to those outraged natives I
heard screaming at the mouth of the cave, they turned out to be the
guinea pigs demanding dinner.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please tell me how to get June tickets for a tour of
Buckingham Palace. _Virginia Beddow
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, Buckingham Palace is open to the public only
from Aug. 6 to Oct. 3. Maybe next trip? Buckingham House was
purchased by King George III in 1761 for his wife, Queen Charlotte,
to use as a comfortable home close to St. James' Palace. In fact,
14 of George's 15 children were born there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About two years ago in Iowa, people broke into an animal
shelter and killed a bunch of animals. I want to know the status of
that case. Were the people put in jail? What is the address of the
animal shelter so I can make a donation? _H. Dalton
</P>
<P>
   A: The incident involved Iowa teens who bludgeoned cats with
baseball bats after breaking into the Noah's Ark Foundation
facility. Sgt. Joe Smutz of the Jefferson County sheriff's
department said the four teens were sentenced to one day in jail
for each cat killed and three years' probation in the juvenile
offender program. Smutz says the Iowa Legislature is considering
legislation to change the penalty for such crimes. Contact the
facility by writing Noah's Ark Foundation, P.O. Box 748, Fairfield,
Iowa 52556.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a disturbing telephone call in which I heard,
``This is a collect call from the IRS to confirm your address.'' I
was so shocked I did nothing, and the call was disconnected. Was
this actually the Internal Revenue Service IRS or an outfit using
the initials to sell something? _Frieda R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although the IRS does many things taxpayers find annoying,
calling collect is not one of them. IRS spokesman Kenneth Vargas
says IRS agents are required to give a name and badge number as
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I used my sister-in-law's gas dryer, and there was a pen left
in some clothes. Now there are streaks all over the inside of the
dryer drum. I have used every cleaner I can think of with no luck.
_Donna G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try Maytag consumer information at (800) 688-1120.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent hail storm left our new car with slight damage.
While we have full insurance, I have heard that using dry ice on
dents will cause them to pop out. Does this work? _ Wade W.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can try it and it may work _ more importantly it won't
hurt. Let the sun heat the metal and pick up some dry ice at a
local store (handle carefully). The warm metal may pop back into
shape when the ice contacts it.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com

 &UR; THE FORCE IS WITH SAMUEL L. JACKSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE) &QL; 
 &UR; Includes color slide and B&AMP;W photo of Samuel L. Jackson. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN SPELLING &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Samuel L. Jackson has been a star. Now, at last, he's
a star warrior.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong sci-fi fan and an admirer of director/producer George
Lucas, Jackson makes a cameo appearance in ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel opens nationwide on
May 19, and it stars Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson
as Kenobi's mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; and Natalie Portman as the young
Queen Amidala. Jackson, whose sci-fi credits include ``Jurassic
Park'' (1993) and ``Sphere'' (1998), is cast as Mace Windu, a Jedi
Master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' says Jackson over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York City. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars'
movie. So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to
work with) I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Jackson's interest got back to Lucas, who invited the
actor to meet with him at his Skywalker Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``George said, `I've seen some of your work, and you're very
good, but you could wind up yelling, `Look out! Go this way! Run
that way!' I said, `I don't care.' Sure enough, he found something
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas handed Jackson the Windu character _ and a mere five pages
of script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to act with Yoda (Frank Oz), and I shot my scenes out in
England (at Leavesden Studios),'' Jackson says. ``I have no idea
what happens before my character shows up, and I have no idea what
happens after my character is gone. I had my pages and that was it.
Nobody gave me a whole script.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was so low-key,'' he adds. ``To know the incredible
pressure that's around the film, to know that it's his baby and
that he hadn't directed in 20 years, and to see him so calm was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a busy actor, Jackson counts ``The Phantom Menace'' as
but one of many projects on his dance card. The Oscar-nominated
star of ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) will soon be seen in the drama
``The Red Violin'' and the sci-fi/action thriller ``Deep Blue
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated for summer release, ``Deep Blue Sea'' reunites Jackson
with Renny Harlin, who directed him in ``The Long Kiss Goodnight''
(1996). The story centers on a group of scientists who breed
smarter, speedier and nastier sharks, then must deal with the
consequences when the genetically enhanced creatures threaten to
escape their high-tech confines.
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring with Jackson are Saffron Burrows, Michael Rapaport,
Deborah Unger, Wayne Knight (another ``Jurassic Park'' veteran),
rapper-actor LL Cool J and Stellan Skarsgard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be an intriguing film,'' Jackson says. ``People are
already starting to call it `Jurassic Shark,' and that sounds about
right.''
</P>
<P>
   When not acting, Jackson spends time pursuing his other
endeavors of choice, which include relaxing with his wife, actress
LaTanya Richardson, and daughter, Zoe, at their home in Los
Angeles; golfing until he can swing no more; and voraciously
reading scripts and novels that he can potentially option and
produce as films.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Jackson can't help but get caught up in the
``Star Wars'' fever sweeping the globe. He felt it on the ``Phantom
Menace'' set, and he feels it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open a
case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star Wars''
on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine lightsabers,
and he'd say, `Choose yours.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be there, hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take THAT
one.' That was very, very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did my one little bit, so it's going to be new and
exciting for me to see the movie,'' he says. ``I can't wait to see
it all put together.'' &QL;

 &UR; THE FORCE IS WITH SAMUEL L. JACKSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE) &QL; 
 &UR; Includes color slide and B&AMP;W photo of Samuel L. Jackson. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN SPELLING &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   For years, Samuel L. Jackson has been a star. Now, at last, he's
a star warrior.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong sci-fi fan and an admirer of director/producer George
Lucas, Jackson makes a cameo appearance in ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel opens nationwide on
May 19, and it stars Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson
as Kenobi's mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; and Natalie Portman as the young
Queen Amidala. Jackson, whose sci-fi credits include ``Jurassic
Park'' (1993) and ``Sphere'' (1998), is cast as Mace Windu, a Jedi
Master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' says Jackson over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York City. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars'
movie. So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to
work with) I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Jackson's interest got back to Lucas, who invited the
actor to meet with him at his Skywalker Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``George said, `I've seen some of your work, and you're very
good, but you could wind up yelling, `Look out! Go this way! Run
that way!' I said, `I don't care.' Sure enough, he found something
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas handed Jackson the Windu character _ and a mere five pages
of script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to act with Yoda (Frank Oz), and I shot my scenes out in
England (at Leavesden Studios),'' Jackson says. ``I have no idea
what happens before my character shows up, and I have no idea what
happens after my character is gone. I had my pages and that was it.
Nobody gave me a whole script.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was so low-key,'' he adds. ``To know the incredible
pressure that's around the film, to know that it's his baby and
that he hadn't directed in 20 years, and to see him so calm was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a busy actor, Jackson counts ``The Phantom Menace'' as
but one of many projects on his dance card. The Oscar-nominated
star of ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) will soon be seen in the drama
``The Red Violin'' and the sci-fi/action thriller ``Deep Blue
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated for summer release, ``Deep Blue Sea'' reunites Jackson
with Renny Harlin, who directed him in ``The Long Kiss Goodnight''
(1996). The story centers on a group of scientists who breed
smarter, speedier and nastier sharks, then must deal with the
consequences when the genetically enhanced creatures threaten to
escape their high-tech confines.
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring with Jackson are Saffron Burrows, Michael Rapaport,
Deborah Unger, Wayne Knight (another ``Jurassic Park'' veteran),
rapper-actor LL Cool J and Stellan Skarsgard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be an intriguing film,'' Jackson says. ``People are
already starting to call it `Jurassic Shark,' and that sounds about
right.''
</P>
<P>
   When not acting, Jackson spends time pursuing his other
endeavors of choice, which include relaxing with his wife, actress
LaTanya Richardson, and daughter, Zoe, at their home in Los
Angeles; golfing until he can swing no more; and voraciously
reading scripts and novels that he can potentially option and
produce as films.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Jackson can't help but get caught up in the
``Star Wars'' fever sweeping the globe. He felt it on the ``Phantom
Menace'' set, and he feels it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open a
case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star Wars''
on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine lightsabers,
and he'd say, `Choose yours.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be there, hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take THAT
one.' That was very, very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did my one little bit, so it's going to be new and
exciting for me to see the movie,'' he says. ``I can't wait to see
it all put together.'' &QL;

D-BACKS ACE JOHNSON SHARES APPROACH TO GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since signing a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the
Diamondbacks on Dec. 1, left-hander Randy Johnson has been in the
Arizona spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who starts against the Los Angeles Dodgers in today's
season opener, recently met with Don Ketchum, The Republic's
Diamondbacks beat reporter, to discuss his thoughts about the
upcoming season, people's perceptions of him and how he sees
himself. &QL; 
: Now that the season opener is almost here, what are your thoughts
about that game? You've pitched in a lot of big games _ how does
this compare, given the significance of the new team and the
high-profile nature of your path to get here? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: Obviously, I'll be extremely excited about opening day. I'm
sure there will be a lot of focus on that game between Kevin
(Brown) and myself. I'll probably be even more excited when I get
to pitch for the first time at Bank One Ballpark for my home fans.
I've never gotten to pitch at BOB yet. I was there with Houston and
Seattle but never got the opportunity to pitch there. But I am
looking forward to the season, helping the team get off to a good
start. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Any more impetus placed on the first game because you're going
to be relied upon perhaps more than anyone? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: Sure. Yeah. But I don't think the situation is like in Seattle
and Houston, where I was relied upon more than I would be here. I
mean, I still have my job to do and will look at it in the same
way, going about my business as I did in Seattle. But I don't think
there's going to be as much emphasis on, ``When is Randy
pitching?'' or, ``We need Randy to pitch today.'' There won't be
that kind of situation because our pitching here is so deep. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: That, in turn, helps you to pitch more relaxed? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: A great deal. When I was in Seattle, there was a reason why I
pitched every big game. I was the No. 1 guy, but there weren't a
whole lot of other people over there who had been in the same
situation as me with the experience of being able to go out and
pitch a big game like that. That won't be the same case here, with
Andy (Benes) here and Todd (Stottlemyre) here, and I think the
sleeper in my book would be Omar Daal. I feel he is going to have a
terrific year. There will be a lot of pressure taken off him by
myself and Andy and Todd. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What is game day like for you? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: The day before, if it's the same team we've played the night
before, I've been watching the game, watching the hitters. Assuming
what players I'm going to face. Watching videotapes of my
mechanics, making sure that everything is all ready. I've prepared
myself mentally and physically. I've been in the training room,
doing anything I need to do. I've been in the weight room doing all
my exercises. Getting scouting reports. Now it's a matter of going
out there. I'm pretty high-strung on the day that I pitch. Very
focused. I have tunnel vision, and I don't like to be . . . I like
to be pretty much in my own little world. But I'm not the only one
like that on the day that I perform. You're extremely focused. I
get to play baseball only once every five days, and so it's, ah . .
. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Almost like five days of energy crammed into one? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: Exactly. Well, I pitched yesterday. Now I'm starting to get
ready for five days from now. There's a lot of stuff that builds up
in between those starts. A lot of excitement and a lot of
anticipation. When I go out there and pitch, I have a chance to
release a lot of that. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Gregg Olson, the Diamondbacks' closer, keeps a computer log and
charts. Do you go to that extent? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: No. I get a scouting report about the day that I pitched before
against that team, so when I face that team again later in the
year, I can go back and get a scouting report on what they did,
what they hit, and that's my only record. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Can you sometimes clutter yourself too much with that type of
thing? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: Yeah. When you're gifted with a good fastball. It's not like
I'm going to try to go out there and fool anybody. If I go out
there against a guy who's a good fastball hitter, well, I'm not
going to throw him a handful of change-ups now. He hits my
fastball, he hits my fastball. There's lots of people who have.
It's just a matter of what I do after that. A guy who's got a base
hit _ can I get a double-play ball now and eliminate a big inning? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: How would you describe yourself as a pitcher? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: First and foremost, I like to think I'm just as competitive as
the next person. I don't like to lose. Very high-strung, very
intense and very focused on the day that I pitch. I go out there
with every intention of winning. I have no desire to get a
no-decision or a loss. My job is to keep the other team at bay
until we can score some runs. And then, when we have scored runs
and I'm still out there pitching, it's kind of a take-no-prisoners
mentality _ as the game gets deeper and deeper, continuing to turn
it up a notch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: You get more intense as you go along? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: Sure. Especially if it's a close game. I kind of like to think
I have a killer instinct late in the game, where I don't want the
other team to feel like they have a chance to come back. I turn it
up a notch, trying to eliminate any possibility of a big inning.
The only way to do that is showing the other team that you're not
going to crack. I've been able to do that a lot, but sometimes the
other team has gotten the best of me. They've got a job to do, too,
but that's my makeup on the day that I pitch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Do you consider yourself the best pitcher in baseball, or is
that for others to decide? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: That's for others to judge, yeah. The other question I can't
answer is if I'm intimidating. How can I answer how the other
person feels? Those are two questions I get asked a lot, but two
questions I can't answer. I feel I've worked hard to get where I'm
at. I had a lot of roadblocks early on with my mechanics, my
height. It took me a long time to get where I'm at. I've had to
work extremely hard like anyone else, maybe even more so, because
of my height, dealing with my mechanics. And it's paid off. But now
I work just as hard, if not harder, than I did early on, because
now it's a matter of maintaining and always trying to stay a step
above everybody else. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Do you think a lot of people don't realize how much work goes
into it? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: I know any athlete has had to work at what he has done. A good
hitter who has perfected hitting, like a Tony Gwynn or a Rod Carew,
you'd probably find them after practice hitting off a tee, or
soft-toss or whatever. He's perfecting his trade. Myself, early on,
coming up, I was out in the instructional league for four years,
fielding ground balls, whatever. When everybody was gone, I was out
there for another hour working with my pitching coach. Those were
the things that, as time went on, I benefited from because I was
learning coordination, learning how to field my position, and I was
learning how to pitch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: People obviously know a lot about Randy Johnson, the pitcher.
What about Randy Johnson, the person? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: I have three beautiful kids, a beautiful wife, and when I'm at
home, I enjoy being at home. I enjoy my family being with me on the
road. I enjoy going out and playing golf with the guys (teammates),
being competitive. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: If you could tell the fans something about yourself that they
don't know, what would it be? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: I don't think too many people really care that I play the
drums. I'm not really musically inclined, but I enjoy music and
playing the drums. It's one thing . . . that when I try to learn
something, I try to be good at it, much like pitching or basketball
or anything I've ever done. Like hitting right now. Hitting is
something I haven't done in 10 years. But I'm doing it so I can try
to be good at it. I have to be good at it because it's my job. I
enjoy being a photographer and taking pictures. I got good enough
to where I had an art exhibit, and I sold some of my work. When I
do something, I try to be good at it. I want to put 110 percent
into it. That's the way I was raised. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: You seem to be a guy who enjoys your time away from the
spotlight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: Exactly. That's why I got a little bent out of shape when a
reporter came to my house. Just because for six months out of the
year, I realize that when I come to the ballpark, sign autographs,
do interviews, giving my time to people is my job. The first person
who says that I should be able to do the same things at my house is
wrong. Because that's my solitude. That's where I go to get away
from baseball. I enjoy my privacy with my family away from the
ballpark. It's my time to give them 110 percent like I give 110
percent to my teammates and baseball when I'm at the field.
Baseball is very time-consuming. I'm at the ballpark more than I'm
at home. So the last thing I want to do is interview at my house.
There've been lots of people who have wanted to do interviews at my
house. ``Sports'' ``Illustrated.''`` USA Today.'' People have
wanted to walk around my house. Roy Firestone wanted to do one of
those sit-down things. I don't do stuff like that at my house. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Do you feel you've fit into this clubhouse so far, getting
comfortable with your teammates? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: I'm not a real outgoing person. People have said that, and
that's fine. People have said I'm pretty moody. Some people have
said I'm a loner. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. But I
don't feel like I'm like that. I feel that my moodiness comes from
my competitiveness. People who have judged me have never walked in
my feet, to know what it's like to be expected to win every fifth
day. It's one thing to go and show up on the day that you pitch,
but it's another to be actually expected to win. I expect to win
when I go out there. Lou (Piniella, Seattle Mariners manager)
called me last year a little moody. I didn't think it was an insult
or anything, but there's a reason for that. That's my way of
preparing for my next start. I'm not going to go up and initiate a
conversation, as opposed to maybe someone coming up to me. I can
talk to you now, now that you've started something. I can talk for
the rest of the day. But I'm not going to go up to you. I'm not the
big, mean guy that I portray on the day that I pitch, on the other
four days. I may have a lot of things on my mind during the season
_ my kids, my wife or my next start _ but so does everybody.
Everybody goes about it a little differently. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Have you ever thought about what you might do once you leave the
game? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: Well, when I'm done with this contract (four years with an
option for a fifth), I'll be 40 years old. My 4-year-old daughter
will be 8 years old, my soon-to-be-3-year-old son will be 7, and my
10-month-old girl will be almost 5 years old. I will have had my
career. If I feel the four years is done, and I can't be
competitive anymore and I've seen signs of that, then I will be at
home every day with my family. I will be interacting with them and
being a part of what they want to do. And I'll try to do that these
next four years. But the amount of quality time you can give your
children, say one of your kids' plays or graduation or birthday
party . . . some of those things actually happen during the season.
So I miss a lot. A lot of us miss a lot. We sacrifice, and our
families sacrifice. And so when I'm done with my career, I will try
to be there for everything that I possibly can. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: So you'll be done with the game altogether? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: You never know. Maybe I'll have the desire to coach my son's or
daughter's Little League team. It all depends on what avenues, what
doors, open up for me. If I have some success here like I did in
Seattle, then maybe the door would open to possibly be a coach, if
that was what they (Diamondbacks) were willing to allow me to do.
Or if that's what I even want to do. Because I'm not a very
outgoing person. I'm not a real teacher. I've been taught more than
I've been able to teach. I've been taught by Nolan Ryan and Tom
House, and I've tutored myself by reading and analyzing _ most of
us do. I feel I've been able to teach a little bit, but I don't
feel like . . . if someone wants to come up to me today, right now,
and say, ``Well, how did you turn the corner on your success?'' I
would teach them, and I would tell them if they were willing to
learn. I feel funny going up to someone who's at the major league
level and hasn't asked for my advice to try to give them my advice,
unless they want it. Any time I've ever wanted help, I've gone out
to get it by initiating it. If one of these guys wants my help, I'm
willing to help him. Like Brian Anderson is a left-handed pitcher .
. . I could probably be of benefit to him. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: A lot of pitchers who began their careers as starters _ Dennis
Eckersley comes to mind _ ended their careers as closers. How would
you feel about that? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: The scenario has come up, right before I signed this contract.
``To prolong your career, would you want to be a closer?'' Well, I
can't answer that question because I have four years ahead of me of
_ hopefully _ successful starting. Once again, I would have to see
how I'd feel at the time. Between now and the next four years, I
will have a lot more innings pitched in me. I've relieved a couple
of times. It was fun, but at the time I knew it was a temporary
thing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Who is the toughest hitter you've ever faced? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: There's been a lot of them. There's been probably a lot of
hitters who have had success against me that I don't realize. Maybe
I've only faced them a few times, and the few times that I have
faced them, they're batting a thousand off me, you know, maybe two
triples and a home run . . . I can't rattle off their names . . .
But I can't tell you I've had a lot of success against, either. So
it works both ways. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Now that you've seen and been around this team, what do you
think its chances are for success? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A:: This team looks even better now . . . inside, I know I made the
right decision coming to a team I feel is going to be competitive.
It's just me talking, but now we have to go out and do it. A lot of
people are saying that I'm going to be sitting home in October. A
lot of people said that I sacrificed by coming here. Well, I feel I
have a little bit of knowledge in the game, and I feel we have a
complete lineup from top to bottom. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- When Michael Dell addressed the International
World Congress on Information Technology last June, he wowed the
crowd with this statistic: Dell Computer Corp. was doing $5 million
a day in Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, the figure has shot up to $14 million daily
-- and it's still growing. Today, the company Michael Dell founded
generates 25 percent of its revenue from online sales. By the end
of 2000, Dell wants that figure to hit 50 percent. ``The Internet
is turbocharging the way we do business,'' he crowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell isn't simply putting up a Web site and hoping surfers
will click on it. Instead, the company is integrating the Internet
into every aspect of its business. For example, the company has
launched a pilot project to build Web pages for its 30 top
suppliers. These links eventually will allow suppliers to
``virtually'' view Dell's manufacturing lines-- so they will know
when supplies are needed. Already the company has used technology
to reduce its inventory from 30 days worth to six days.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this isn't sexiest stuff on the Web. Online
retailers such as Amazon.com and eBay are making a bigger splash
and grabbing more headlines. But the Internet has touched off an
online earthquake across nearly every industry. The result is that
electronic commerce is reshaping American business: Supply chains
are shifting. Businesses are shuffling resources to keep pace with
the online revolution. New players are emerging overnight to
threaten traditional ones such as distributors and middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clear: You're going to need to conduct business
and reach your customers electronically,'' says Daniel L. Manack,
senior vice president and general manager at the Atlanta-based
Harbinger Corp., an e-commerce software and service company with
$135 million in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, e-commerce between businesses accounts for 84 percent of
all Internet transactions. And that figure is expected to climb to
92 percent of Internet commerce by 2003. Forrester Research Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass., projects business-to-business online commerce
will hit $1.3 trillion in 2003-- or 9 percent of U.S. business
trade. That dwarfs the estimated $108 billion in goods and services
businesses will sell to consumers in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, businesses needed to provide a good quality
product at a good price and deliver it on time,'' says Steven R.
Bell, an analyst with Forrester Research who wrote the report.
``Now executives need to look at every step in the business cycle
before the retailer sells the product to the consumer. This is what
is moving to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the computer and electronics industry is
leading the way. This year, the industry is expected to conduct
$50.4 billion worth of domestic business on the Web, or about 46
percent of all business-to-business trade.
</P>
<P>
   That's followed by utilities, which will exchange $15.4 billion
of goods and services over the Internet, or about 14 percent of all
business trade. Electric utilities are trading electricity online
as well as automating billing and service for commercial clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deregulation of the utility industry has been the catalyst
behind this,'' says Ronald Lynde, senior information analyst for
the Washington-based Edison Electric Institute. That's because
utilities now must trade information and electricity amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A key way businesses are using e-commerce is by revamping and
automating communications within traditional supply chains. For
example, the Automotive Industry Action Group, a non-profit trade
group in Southfield, Mich., for 1,500 auto manufacturers and
suppliers, recently launched its AutoChain Online Web site. The
site tracks which North American suppliers are able to conduct
business electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's auto giants want to save money by reducing
inefficiencies caused by a complex web of communications between
manufacturers and suppliers. Today, it takes as long as four weeks
for information to trickle from manufacturers to suppliers. A 1996
study found North American auto industry could save $1 billion
annually, or $71 per car, if it moved communications online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also is forcing companies to shift resources to
online endeavors. A company that has embraced this challenge:
United Parcel Service, the $24.8-billion-a-year global package
delivery company headquartered in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the company has pumped an estimated $1
billion annually into information technology. Today, UPS relies on
a handful of key e-commerce functions. For example, customers
connect directly to UPS's mainframe computer to manage orders,
payables and receivables. An online tracking systems enables each
customer to ship and track 100 packages a day. And a high-tech
delivery service lets companies send electronic documents that are
validated, digitally signed, verified and tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications of electronic commerce are forcing all of us
out of our comfort zones, `` UPS Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer James P. Kelly told business leaders in a January speech.
``It requires radical changes in our thinking and a retooling of
our business models.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Internet is creating new types of companies
called ``infomediaries'' that use technology to bring buyers and
sellers together online.
</P>
<P>
   Two paper executives, Clay Maloney and Hilton Plein, founded the
PaperExchange.com in June. The Boston-based company maintains a web
site that enables paper suppliers and buyers from 40 countries to
negotiate for products ranging from container board to writing
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes money by taking a 3 percent commission on any
deal struck on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the startup has about 30 employees. Its online
membership has quadrupled in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such new competitors are making traditional distributors and
middlemen nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people out there that are trying to
figure out what their role in this new economy is going to be,''
says Manack, of Harbinger.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Oliver, a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen
Graduate School of Management, says the companies that will thrive
in the Internet age will be those that embrace change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question anymore that you need to be on the
Internet,'' says Oliver. ``The companies that win will be the ones
that get there first and do the most... Some others may find
themselves out of business.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- When Michael Dell addressed the International
World Congress on Information Technology last June, he wowed the
crowd with this statistic: Dell Computer Corp. was doing $5 million
a day in Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, the figure has shot up to $14 million daily
-- and it's still growing. Today, the company Michael Dell founded
generates 25 percent of its revenue from online sales. By the end
of 2000, Dell wants that figure to hit 50 percent. ``The Internet
is turbocharging the way we do business,'' he crowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell isn't simply putting up a Web site and hoping surfers
will click on it. Instead, the company is integrating the Internet
into every aspect of its business. For example, the company has
launched a pilot project to build Web pages for its 30 top
suppliers. These links eventually will allow suppliers to
``virtually'' view Dell's manufacturing lines-- so they will know
when supplies are needed. Already the company has used technology
to reduce its inventory from 30 days worth to six days.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this isn't sexiest stuff on the Web. Online
retailers such as Amazon.com and eBay are making a bigger splash
and grabbing more headlines. But the Internet has touched off an
online earthquake across nearly every industry. The result is that
electronic commerce is reshaping American business: Supply chains
are shifting. Businesses are shuffling resources to keep pace with
the online revolution. New players are emerging overnight to
threaten traditional ones such as distributors and middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clear: You're going to need to conduct business
and reach your customers electronically,'' says Daniel L. Manack,
senior vice president and general manager at the Atlanta-based
Harbinger Corp., an e-commerce software and service company with
$135 million in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, e-commerce between businesses accounts for 84 percent of
all Internet transactions. And that figure is expected to climb to
92 percent of Internet commerce by 2003. Forrester Research Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass., projects business-to-business online commerce
will hit $1.3 trillion in 2003-- or 9 percent of U.S. business
trade. That dwarfs the estimated $108 billion in goods and services
businesses will sell to consumers in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, businesses needed to provide a good quality
product at a good price and deliver it on time,'' says Steven R.
Bell, an analyst with Forrester Research who wrote the report.
``Now executives need to look at every step in the business cycle
before the retailer sells the product to the consumer. This is what
is moving to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the computer and electronics industry is
leading the way. This year, the industry is expected to conduct
$50.4 billion worth of domestic business on the Web, or about 46
percent of all business-to-business trade.
</P>
<P>
   That's followed by utilities, which will exchange $15.4 billion
of goods and services over the Internet, or about 14 percent of all
business trade. Electric utilities are trading electricity online
as well as automating billing and service for commercial clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deregulation of the utility industry has been the catalyst
behind this,'' says Ronald Lynde, senior information analyst for
the Washington-based Edison Electric Institute. That's because
utilities now must trade information and electricity amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A key way businesses are using e-commerce is by revamping and
automating communications within traditional supply chains. For
example, the Automotive Industry Action Group, a non-profit trade
group in Southfield, Mich., for 1,500 auto manufacturers and
suppliers, recently launched its AutoChain Online Web site. The
site tracks which North American suppliers are able to conduct
business electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's auto giants want to save money by reducing
inefficiencies caused by a complex web of communications between
manufacturers and suppliers. Today, it takes as long as four weeks
for information to trickle from manufacturers to suppliers. A 1996
study found North American auto industry could save $1 billion
annually, or $71 per car, if it moved communications online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also is forcing companies to shift resources to
online endeavors. A company that has embraced this challenge:
United Parcel Service, the $24.8-billion-a-year global package
delivery company headquartered in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the company has pumped an estimated $1
billion annually into information technology. Today, UPS relies on
a handful of key e-commerce functions. For example, customers
connect directly to UPS's mainframe computer to manage orders,
payables and receivables. An online tracking systems enables each
customer to ship and track 100 packages a day. And a high-tech
delivery service lets companies send electronic documents that are
validated, digitally signed, verified and tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications of electronic commerce are forcing all of us
out of our comfort zones, `` UPS Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer James P. Kelly told business leaders in a January speech.
``It requires radical changes in our thinking and a retooling of
our business models.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Internet is creating new types of companies
called ``infomediaries'' that use technology to bring buyers and
sellers together online.
</P>
<P>
   Two paper executives, Clay Maloney and Hilton Plein, founded the
PaperExchange.com in June. The Boston-based company maintains a web
site that enables paper suppliers and buyers from 40 countries to
negotiate for products ranging from container board to writing
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes money by taking a 3 percent commission on any
deal struck on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the startup has about 30 employees. Its online
membership has quadrupled in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such new competitors are making traditional distributors and
middlemen nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people out there that are trying to
figure out what their role in this new economy is going to be,''
says Manack, of Harbinger.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Oliver, a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen
Graduate School of Management, says the companies that will thrive
in the Internet age will be those that embrace change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question anymore that you need to be on the
Internet,'' says Oliver. ``The companies that win will be the ones
that get there first and do the most... Some others may find
themselves out of business.''

<P>
   A Fourth Amendment case before the U.S. Supreme Court has caused
a rancorous debate among First Amendment advocates. The question
argued before the court on March 24, asked: Do law enforcement
agents violate the Fourth Amendment when they allow members of the
news media to accompany them on searches?
</P>
<P>
   Some First Amendment advocates say no _ that the news media has
a right to accompany police on searches of homes where there is
probable cause to suspect criminal activity has taken place and to
record the arrest of suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The Fourth Amendment, if anything, strongly implies the
home is a sanctuary of privacy: ``The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,
and the persons or things to be seized.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase an English adage credited to William Pitt, Earl of
Chatham (1708-1778): The home is a castle, and not even the King of
England can cross the threshold without invitation. When the Fourth
Amendment was created by the Founding Fathers, it was to stop the
kind of abuses carried out by the king's henchmen in the colonies
when they went house-to-house breaking down doors and searching for
seditious material.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Amendment allows law enforcement officials to enter
private property and homes in order to conduct a search or a
seizure only after a warrant has been signed by a judge _ unless
the police are in active pursuit of a criminal suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Code expands the Fourth Amendment so that it allows
officers of the law to bring along a third party who is acting ``in
aid of'' law enforcement _ an informant to identify a suspect, a
translator if necessary, someone who can identify stolen goods. In
other words, the amendment only allows government agents to enter a
private home. It was meant to protect our privacy. The media has no
constitutional right to ``ride-along'' into our homes with police
on raids.
</P>
<P>
   Fox network's ``Cops'' violates the privacy rights of all those
who are in their homes when police execute warrants and the
program's film crews follow police into homes. But the two cases,
consolidated and argued before the high court, did not involve the
Fox program.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hanlon vs. Berger case, agents of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service were issued a search warrant to look for evidence
of killing protected wildlife on Paul Berger's ranch in Montana.
Unknown to the federal magistrate who signed the warrant, USFWS
agents had made an agreement with Cable News Network to film the
search. One of the agents actually carried a hidden microphone that
transmitted all conversations to the CNN technical crew. The
Bergers were not informed of the hidden microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers filed suit against the USFWS, claiming the federal
agency had violated their constitutional rights by allowing CNN to
be involved in the search. A jury acquitted Berger of all charges,
except for the misuse of a pesticide, a misdemeanor. CNN aired a
portion of the film footage of the raid in its story concerning the
protection of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In the accompanying case, Wilson vs. Layne, U.S. marshals and a
local sheriff department attempted to execute an outstanding arrest
warrant against Dominic Jerome Wilson. Before dawn, a Washington
Post reporter and photographer accompanied the officers to the
fugitive's last known address, the home of his parents in
Rockville, Md. Charles Wilson was dressed only in his underwear and
his wife, Geraldine, was wearing a sheer nightgown when the
officers, reporter and photographer entered their home. The
reporter took notes; the photographer took pictures. The fugitive
son was not at his parents' home. The photographs were not
published. But the Wilsons sued the federal and state law
enforcement agents, asserting their Fourth Amendment rights had
been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the law enforcement officials in these cases argue
that allowing the media to accompany officers helps ensure accurate
news coverage. The 24 news organizations, who filed briefs siding
with law enforcement, argued that such ride-alongs fulfill the
media's role as a watchdog. It is naive to think that a reporter
accompanying law enforcement officials is going to be a witness to
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from the New York Times, the Associated Press, the
Houston Chronicle and the Hearst Newspapers who covered the oral
argument at the Supreme Court were in agreement that at least six
justices showed their skepticism about the rationale law
enforcement officials gave for inviting along the media when
executing warrants. And, indeed, they should have.
</P>
<P>
   If police can invite a reporter along, why not a relative? Why
not a neighbor? The U.S. Supreme Court has never granted the media
greater First Amendment rights than any citizen. So why not invite
a friend to peer into the privacy of someone's home when a warrant
is served?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the friend can publish what he or she sees on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a line must be drawn. And the front door of our homes
is the proper and precise place to draw that line. Privacy is
essential to all human beings, to all families. The sense that your
home is your castle, no matter how humble, allows us to live more
fully, more intimately, more securely, in sum, more humanly.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment cannot trump the legitimate expectations of
privacy we all have when we shut the front door against the world.
Expect the high court to reinforce that great principle.

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every year April 15 rears its ugly head, and I'm never ready.
You would think, since for years the IRS has celebrated this date
as its annual tax festival, that I would be prepared. You would be
wrong. Luckily, I know I am not alone. That's clear from the
monumental increase in Valium and aspirin consumption at this time
of year.
 &HT;    I begin thinking about filing taxes at the beginning of the year
when the tax forms supplant Christmas catalogs in the mailbox. Of
course, the forms are thrown on a pile on the desk with the feeling
that there's plenty of time. The due date looms someplace far off
down a misty path.
 &HT;    In February, public service announcements emphasize filing
early. There is talk about electronic filing. Mailers arrive
touting TurboTax and other software of the same ilk. W-2s and 1099s
keep arriving in the mail. You look at them, idly speculating on
why so much is taken out each year. For a moment there is a twinge
of recognition of an urgent task. But the feeling soon passes.
 &HT;    March is a lovely month. Spring is coming. You begin to think
about getting out and buying some new clothes. You think about that
CD player you want, that, in fact, you certainly deserve (you
WORKED for it, after all). You throw on your coat and head out to
the nearest electronics emporium. The tax forms by this time have
fallen into a pile under the desk.
 &HT;    On April 1, you have the feeling of impending trouble. You know
it's not your allergies (that's usually a May-June ritual). By
April 10 reality dawns: It's tax time.
 &HT;    Usually this epiphany comes about in one of two ways: A
co-worker sidles over to you and, with a barely contained smirk,
informs you that not only did she file her taxes January 1, but she
also already got back a big, fat refund that was immediately
invested in Electro-Silico Intercom International stock that
already has brought in a tidy profit of at least $15,000 (and
counting).
 &HT;    The second way? Tripping over a pile of tax forms leaking out
from under your desk.
 &HT;    No matter how the news gets through, what ensues is total,
unremitting PANIC. Where are those receipts? Why didn't I get those
W-2s? Papers start flying. Drawers are emptied out. Chaos reigns.
It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    This year, I have vowed to take steps to help ease tax time
trauma. In the spirit of good fellowship, I now offer them to you:
 &HT;    1. Make up file folders that you keep in one drawer in your
desk, clearly labeled with the tax year, with specified
subcategories (e.g., charitable contributions, medical expenses,
stocks, dividends, etc.). Whenever a critical piece of paper starts
floating around, catch it and put it into the relevant file. Now go
out and play.
 &HT;    2. Put all tax information forms into one folder.
 &HT;    3. During the year make sure all records, on paper or computer,
are kept up-to-date (this means your checkbook, too). All bank
statements should also be put into a separate file. (How does it
feel to actually behave like a grownup?)
 &HT;    4. If you use a tax preparer to do the real work of processing
your taxes, contact him or her in advance and talk over what will
be needed, and when you will have to deliver it. Keep a record of
what you are turning over and make copies of forms for your files.
 &HT;    5. If you live your life through your computer, right about the
time you're breaking open the holiday fudge is the time to put in
the order for the federal and state software you'll need for
completing your taxes. All forms are included in the software,
which then frees up one paper file that you can use for all those
long-winded Christmas letters you mean to answer but never do.
 &HT;    6. If electronic filing appeals to you, make sure you understand
all the instructions, since it can be a bit tricky. If you don't
understand it, you can call the IRS for further information.
 &HT;    7. Circle April 15 on your calendar and on that day get up, get
out and go directly to the post office. After mailing your tax
return, don't forget to stop off for the mandatory chocolate
truffles _ you earned them!
 &HT;    Now you are free to take the time to think about more important
things, like solving mysteries of the universe such as why cereal
boxes have to be ``allowed to settle'' so they're only
three-quarters full when you buy them, and why taking one bite of
dinner instantaneously triggers at least 17 telephone sales
solicitations.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Spring in America is a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand,
springtime means gardens and baseball and hours of extra daylight.
On the other hand, just as the weather turns fair and we yearn to
get out of the house, it's time for the annual downer: filing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in history are as hated as taxes. Across cultures and
classes and entire millennia, people have feared them, resented
them and hunted for ways not to pay them. But no matter how
fiercely resented, they don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ben Franklin's dictum _ ``in this world, nothing is
certain but death and taxes'' _ has been true since the earliest
dawn of recorded time.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are at least 5,000 years old. In fact, one of the major
reasons that the Sumerians _ the world's first great civilization,
and the inventors of writing _ developed writing at all was because
priests and kings wished to keep better track of mandatory tax
payments to temple and throne. (It was also the Sumerians who
invented history's first tax receipt _ a clay tablet, carefully
scratched _ in anticipation, perhaps, of history's first tax
audit.)
</P>
<P>
   As civilization spread through the ancient world, so too did
taxes, sometimes by tithing (voluntary and not), sometimes by
excise duties, and sometimes _ the grimmest times _ by imposing
slave labor. Direct taxes also were often invoked, although with
caveats: While directly taxing a Roman citizen was considered
insulting, it was all right to tax the province (which is why, in
Luke 2:1, a pre-tax census is taking place).
</P>
<P>
   Taxation in medieval Europe was fairly hit-and-miss, with formal
taxes tending to be imposed only during crises. An example was the
so-called ``Saladin tithe,'' imposed to raise money for France and
England to overthrow the sultan Saladin during the Third Crusade;
once the crusade petered out, so did the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval Europe marks the very last time taxes were not too
terribly taxing. From the 15th century on, as governments grew
larger and more expensive, taxes became ongoing, and the need for
collection more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the attempt to expand collections in the colonies
sparked resentment, then revolution. While taxes alone did not
cause the American Revolution, they certainly kickstarted the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists despised England's power to tax them, less because
of the revenue loss (actually fairly light) than because the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act reminded the colonists, each time they paid,
how unfree they were.
</P>
<P>
   With taxation so touchy a topic, the Founders were, not
surprisingly, rather vague on the subject when framing the
Constitution, content to allow this hot potato to cool off in the
hands of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal income tax appeared in America during the
Civil War. The North imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $600,
reaching 5 percent for incomes above $10,000 (predictably, these
rates later rose). One interesting provision of Civil War taxes was
that taxpayers' names were routinely published in the local paper,
along with amount paid. This created an excruciating dilemma:
Obviously, the less tax you paid, the less money out of your pocket
_ but then, the less good your finances looked in the eyes of your
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the war was in progress, there was little griping about
the income tax; there was plenty afterwards, though, especially in
the Northeast, where most of the nation's power and wealth resided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, East Coast congressmen tossed it out and replaced it
with tariffs on products which just happened to be manufactured in
their states. These tariffs was bitterly resented in the west _
``the west'' being anywhere west of the Alleghenies _ where
manufacturing was minimal and incomes in general far too low to
have to pay much income tax anyway. Soon the stage was set was an
east-west battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax became law; two years later, the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This ruling galvanized
sectional feeling, the pro-tariff east howling that the west's
continued enthusiasm for an income tax betrayed ``communistic
leanings,'' and the pro-income tax west howling back how the
country was being taken over by its 4,000 known millionaires and
their ``whorish lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A move arose, supported by Democrats, Populists and progressive
Republicans, for a third income tax _ this one's constitutional
legality to be guaranteed by means of an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over an income tax amendment became, very swiftly,
a hot political issue. Those opposed to the tax (Teddy Roosevelt's
``malefactors of great wealth'') took the position _ sound
familiar? _ that taxes were unfair because they punished success
and rewarded failure.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of income tax (``the idle, the lazy, the
shiftless,'' according to their opponents) argued _ also familiarly
_ that wealth in America was becoming too concentrated, and taxes
would help to level the moneybags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, an amendment _ No. 16 _ was ratified by the necessary
36 states. Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with a $3,000
($4,000 for married couples) exemption. With personal income in
1913 averaging $621, the 16th Amendment clearly was something not
meant to apply to most people _ only the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   This situation didn't last. In 1913, less than 5 percent of the
population filed tax returns; by 1919, this number had nearly
doubled; by the end of World War II, close to half the American
public was filing. And it's never been that low since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 160 million tax returns will be filed.
What's more, the whole rigmarole of taxation _ 1040s, W-2s, lO99s _
has become so common and shared an experience that complaining
about it, once thought highly uncouth, is now a conversational
icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, like springtime, have become accepted as part of the
natural order _ even if, at best, it's the most grudging acceptance
humanly possible.

 By MARK ALBRECHT AND THOMAS RAY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is given three years to collect the tax before
you can file Chapter 7. However, if your financial profile is too
strong and tax liens are attached to your assets, then the taxes
may not be dismissible.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative route is Chapter 13, which enables you to pay
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems, it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every year April 15 rears its ugly head, and I'm never ready.
You would think, since for years the IRS has celebrated this date
as its annual tax festival, that I would be prepared. You would be
wrong. Luckily, I know I am not alone. That's clear from the
monumental increase in Valium and aspirin consumption at this time
of year.
 &HT;    I begin thinking about filing taxes at the beginning of the year
when the tax forms supplant Christmas catalogs in the mailbox. Of
course, the forms are thrown on a pile on the desk with the feeling
that there's plenty of time. The due date looms someplace far off
down a misty path.
 &HT;    In February, public service announcements emphasize filing
early. There is talk about electronic filing. Mailers arrive
touting TurboTax and other software of the same ilk. W-2s and 1099s
keep arriving in the mail. You look at them, idly speculating on
why so much is taken out each year. For a moment there is a twinge
of recognition of an urgent task. But the feeling soon passes.
 &HT;    March is a lovely month. Spring is coming. You begin to think
about getting out and buying some new clothes. You think about that
CD player you want, that, in fact, you certainly deserve (you
WORKED for it, after all). You throw on your coat and head out to
the nearest electronics emporium. The tax forms by this time have
fallen into a pile under the desk.
 &HT;    On April 1, you have the feeling of impending trouble. You know
it's not your allergies (that's usually a May-June ritual). By
April 10 reality dawns: It's tax time.
 &HT;    Usually this epiphany comes about in one of two ways: A
co-worker sidles over to you and, with a barely contained smirk,
informs you that not only did she file her taxes January 1, but she
also already got back a big, fat refund that was immediately
invested in Electro-Silico Intercom International stock that
already has brought in a tidy profit of at least $15,000 (and
counting).
 &HT;    The second way? Tripping over a pile of tax forms leaking out
from under your desk.
 &HT;    No matter how the news gets through, what ensues is total,
unremitting PANIC. Where are those receipts? Why didn't I get those
W-2s? Papers start flying. Drawers are emptied out. Chaos reigns.
It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    This year, I have vowed to take steps to help ease tax time
trauma. In the spirit of good fellowship, I now offer them to you:
 &HT;    1. Make up file folders that you keep in one drawer in your
desk, clearly labeled with the tax year, with specified
subcategories (e.g., charitable contributions, medical expenses,
stocks, dividends, etc.). Whenever a critical piece of paper starts
floating around, catch it and put it into the relevant file. Now go
out and play.
 &HT;    2. Put all tax information forms into one folder.
 &HT;    3. During the year make sure all records, on paper or computer,
are kept up-to-date (this means your checkbook, too). All bank
statements should also be put into a separate file. (How does it
feel to actually behave like a grownup?)
 &HT;    4. If you use a tax preparer to do the real work of processing
your taxes, contact him or her in advance and talk over what will
be needed, and when you will have to deliver it. Keep a record of
what you are turning over and make copies of forms for your files.
 &HT;    5. If you live your life through your computer, right about the
time you're breaking open the holiday fudge is the time to put in
the order for the federal and state software you'll need for
completing your taxes. All forms are included in the software,
which then frees up one paper file that you can use for all those
long-winded Christmas letters you mean to answer but never do.
 &HT;    6. If electronic filing appeals to you, make sure you understand
all the instructions, since it can be a bit tricky. If you don't
understand it, you can call the IRS for further information.
 &HT;    7. Circle April 15 on your calendar and on that day get up, get
out and go directly to the post office. After mailing your tax
return, don't forget to stop off for the mandatory chocolate
truffles _ you earned them!
 &HT;    Now you are free to take the time to think about more important
things, like solving mysteries of the universe such as why cereal
boxes have to be ``allowed to settle'' so they're only
three-quarters full when you buy them, and why taking one bite of
dinner instantaneously triggers at least 17 telephone sales
solicitations.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Spring in America is a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand,
springtime means gardens and baseball and hours of extra daylight.
On the other hand, just as the weather turns fair and we yearn to
get out of the house, it's time for the annual downer: filing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in history are as hated as taxes. Across cultures and
classes and entire millennia, people have feared them, resented
them and hunted for ways not to pay them. But no matter how
fiercely resented, they don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ben Franklin's dictum _ ``in this world, nothing is
certain but death and taxes'' _ has been true since the earliest
dawn of recorded time.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are at least 5,000 years old. In fact, one of the major
reasons that the Sumerians _ the world's first great civilization,
and the inventors of writing _ developed writing at all was because
priests and kings wished to keep better track of mandatory tax
payments to temple and throne. (It was also the Sumerians who
invented history's first tax receipt _ a clay tablet, carefully
scratched _ in anticipation, perhaps, of history's first tax
audit.)
</P>
<P>
   As civilization spread through the ancient world, so too did
taxes, sometimes by tithing (voluntary and not), sometimes by
excise duties, and sometimes _ the grimmest times _ by imposing
slave labor. Direct taxes also were often invoked, although with
caveats: While directly taxing a Roman citizen was considered
insulting, it was all right to tax the province (which is why, in
Luke 2:1, a pre-tax census is taking place).
</P>
<P>
   Taxation in medieval Europe was fairly hit-and-miss, with formal
taxes tending to be imposed only during crises. An example was the
so-called ``Saladin tithe,'' imposed to raise money for France and
England to overthrow the sultan Saladin during the Third Crusade;
once the crusade petered out, so did the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval Europe marks the very last time taxes were not too
terribly taxing. From the 15th century on, as governments grew
larger and more expensive, taxes became ongoing, and the need for
collection more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the attempt to expand collections in the colonies
sparked resentment, then revolution. While taxes alone did not
cause the American Revolution, they certainly kickstarted the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists despised England's power to tax them, less because
of the revenue loss (actually fairly light) than because the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act reminded the colonists, each time they paid,
how unfree they were.
</P>
<P>
   With taxation so touchy a topic, the Founders were, not
surprisingly, rather vague on the subject when framing the
Constitution, content to allow this hot potato to cool off in the
hands of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal income tax appeared in America during the
Civil War. The North imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $600,
reaching 5 percent for incomes above $10,000 (predictably, these
rates later rose). One interesting provision of Civil War taxes was
that taxpayers' names were routinely published in the local paper,
along with amount paid. This created an excruciating dilemma:
Obviously, the less tax you paid, the less money out of your pocket
_ but then, the less good your finances looked in the eyes of your
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the war was in progress, there was little griping about
the income tax; there was plenty afterwards, though, especially in
the Northeast, where most of the nation's power and wealth resided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, East Coast congressmen tossed it out and replaced it
with tariffs on products which just happened to be manufactured in
their states. These tariffs was bitterly resented in the west _
``the west'' being anywhere west of the Alleghenies _ where
manufacturing was minimal and incomes in general far too low to
have to pay much income tax anyway. Soon the stage was set was an
east-west battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax became law; two years later, the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This ruling galvanized
sectional feeling, the pro-tariff east howling that the west's
continued enthusiasm for an income tax betrayed ``communistic
leanings,'' and the pro-income tax west howling back how the
country was being taken over by its 4,000 known millionaires and
their ``whorish lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A move arose, supported by Democrats, Populists and progressive
Republicans, for a third income tax _ this one's constitutional
legality to be guaranteed by means of an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over an income tax amendment became, very swiftly,
a hot political issue. Those opposed to the tax (Teddy Roosevelt's
``malefactors of great wealth'') took the position _ sound
familiar? _ that taxes were unfair because they punished success
and rewarded failure.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of income tax (``the idle, the lazy, the
shiftless,'' according to their opponents) argued _ also familiarly
_ that wealth in America was becoming too concentrated, and taxes
would help to level the moneybags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, an amendment _ No. 16 _ was ratified by the necessary
36 states. Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with a $3,000
($4,000 for married couples) exemption. With personal income in
1913 averaging $621, the 16th Amendment clearly was something not
meant to apply to most people _ only the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   This situation didn't last. In 1913, less than 5 percent of the
population filed tax returns; by 1919, this number had nearly
doubled; by the end of World War II, close to half the American
public was filing. And it's never been that low since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 160 million tax returns will be filed.
What's more, the whole rigmarole of taxation _ 1040s, W-2s, lO99s _
has become so common and shared an experience that complaining
about it, once thought highly uncouth, is now a conversational
icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, like springtime, have become accepted as part of the
natural order _ even if, at best, it's the most grudging acceptance
humanly possible.

 By MARK ALBRECHT AND THOMAS RAY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is given three years to collect the tax before
you can file Chapter 7. However, if your financial profile is too
strong and tax liens are attached to your assets, then the taxes
may not be dismissible.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative route is Chapter 13, which enables you to pay
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems, it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

   The slime that coats water pipes could be a haven for bacteria
that cause stomach ulcers and gastric cancer, according to
researchers at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
   Helicobacter pylori has been implicated in a wide variety of
gastrointestinal diseases, from stomach inflammation to ulcers and
even cancer. In developed countries, half of people over 50 years
old carry the bacterium in their guts, and in developing countries
an even larger proportion of people are affected. Several animals
may harbor the microorganism, but so far no one has found a
reservoir in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Reid and his colleagues in Scotland thought that H.
pylori might thrive in biofilms. These form when microorganisms
colonize surfaces such as the insides of water pipes, often
surrounding themselves with a sticky protective film. ``Biofilms
occur naturally in all water distribution systems,'' Reid says.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers grew a biofilm inside stainless steel pipes in
the laboratory and inoculated it with H. pylori. Even after
unchlorinated water was flushed through the pipes for 192 hours, H.
pylori still infested the biofilm. The team's findings will be
published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere there is a biofilm, there is a potential haven for
Helicobacter pylori,'' Reid says. This is particularly likely in
unchlorinated private wells and water supplies in developing
countries. Although most public supplies in developed countries are
chlorinated, Reid believes the bacteria could still survive inside
the biofilm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chlorine is only going to attack the upper layers,'' he says.
``By the time those are destroyed, the chlorine is gone.'' As the
biofilm builds up, Reid says that bacteria may be washed away a few
at a time or occasionally released as large clumps.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Severn Trent, one of the largest suppliers of
drinking water in Britain, says there are no studies that show H.
pylori in treated water, so it is not included in routine water
testing. ``If a study showed it in treated water, we would want to
investigate further,'' says the spokesman. &QL;

   Rain is not what it used to be. A new study reveals that much of
the precipitation in Europe contains such high levels of dissolved
pesticides that it would be illegal to supply it as drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in Switzerland have found that rain is laced with toxic
levels of atrazine, alachlor and other commonly used crop sprays.
``Drinking water standards are regularly exceeded in rain,'' says
Stephan Mller, a chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute for
Environmental Science and Technology in Dbendorf. The chemicals
appear to have evaporated from fields and become part of the
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Both the European Union and Switzerland have set a limit of 100
nanograms for any particular pesticide in a liter of drinking
water. But, especially in the first minutes of a heavy storm, rain
can contain much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published by Mller and his colleague Thomas
Bucheli in Analytical Chemistry this summer, one sample of
rainwater contained almost 4000 nanograms per liter of
2,4-dinitrophenol, a widely used pesticide. Previously, the authors
had shown that in rain samples taken from 41 storms, nine contained
more than 100 nanograms of atrazine per liter, one of them around
900 nanograms.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, the highest concentrations of pesticides
turned up in the first rain after a long dry spell, particularly
when local fields had recently been sprayed. Until now, scientists
had assumed that the pesticides only infiltrated groundwater
directly from fields.
</P>
<P>
   Mller warns that the growing practice of using rainwater that
falls onto roofs to recharge underground water may be adding to the
danger. This water often contains dissolved herbicides that had
been added to roofing materials, such as bitumen sheets, to prevent
vegetation growing. He suggests that the first flush of rains
should be diverted into sewers to minimize the pollution of
drinking water, which is not usually treated to remove these
herbicides and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Swedish researchers have linked pesticides to one of
the most rapidly increasing cancers in the Western world.
NonHodgkin's lymphoma, which has risen by 73 percent in the United
States since 1973, is probably caused by several commonly used crop
sprays, say the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Lennart Hardell of Orebro Medical Centre and Mikael Eriksson of
Lund University Hospital found Swedish sufferers of the disease
were 2.7 times more likely to have been exposed to MCPA, a widely
used weedkiller, than healthy people (Cancer, vol. 85 p. 1353).
</P>
<P>
   MCPA, which is used on grain crops, is sold as Target by the
Swiss firm Novartis. In addition, patients were 3.7 times more
likely to have been exposed to a range of fungicides, an
association not previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   The patients were also 2.3 times more likely to have had contact
with glyphosate, the most commonly used herbicide in Sweden. Use of
this chemical, sold as Round-Up by the U.S. firm Monsanto, is
expected to rocket with the introduction of crops, such as
Roundup-Ready soy beans, that are genetically modified to resist
glyphosate. The researchers suggest that the chemicals have
suppressed the patients' immunity, allowing viruses such as
Epstein-Barr to trigger cancer. &QL;

   Strawberries could soon become tastier thanks to the discovery
of the genes which govern flavor formation and make strawberries
red. Details of the genetic discovery were presented in Britain
last month at a conference on achieving quality improvements in
fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Manning of Horticulture Research International in
Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, which hosted the conference, says that
he and his colleagues have identified genes which govern the
sweetness, tartness and smell of strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taste is a balance between sweetness and astringency,'' says
Manning, adding that odors also have a big impact on taste.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with these discoveries, Manning and his colleagues hope to
develop superior strawberries that taste sweeter and richer as well
as smelling more appetizing. And given the current furor over the
genetic modification of food crops, the team wants to achieve these
results through traditional methods of plant breeding, guided by
molecular markers which show which varieties have the key flavor
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility might be to transfer the flavor and odor
genes into microorganisms, which would be added to processed foods
as flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's team has discovered a protein that delivers sugar into
fruit cells from the phloem, the tissue that circulates nutrients
to all parts of the plant. Called a sucrose transporter, the
protein dumps sucrose sugar in vacuoles, large chambers within
plant cells.
</P>
<P>
   The protein sits astride the cell membrane and allows more sugar
in as the fruit ripens. ``The whole basis of fruit ripening is to
make it tasty enough to ensure seed dispersal,'' says Manning.
``But if the gene which makes the protein were overexpressed, we
could raise the amount of sucrose coming into the fruit, which
would result in a sweeter strawberry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's team has also discovered as many as six families of
genes which play a part in removing the sharp taste of unripe
strawberries, turning them red at the same time. The genes produce
enzymes which convert polyphenolics, which taste sharp, into
anthocyanins, which give ripe strawberries their red color.
</P>
<P>
   Manning says that all fruits produce sharp-tasting phenolic
compounds to discourage consumption before the seeds in the fruit
are ready for dispersal. ``It's a keep-off signal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the team's findings is the identification of genes
crucial to the manufacture of volatile substances that give
strawberries their rich smell. ``There are at least 280 different
compounds involved in the aroma,'' Manning says. These have a big
impact on the overall taste.
</P>
<P>
   One gene manufactures an enzyme called an acyltransferase, which
makes sweet-smelling ester compounds by combining alcohols with
acids. Another makes O-methyltransferase, which may help to
manufacture eugenol, a sweet aromatic substance given off by wild
strawberries. &QL;

 &UR; THE FORCE IS WITH SAMUEL L. JACKSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE) &QL; 
 &UR; Includes color slide and B&AMP;W photo of Samuel L. Jackson. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN SPELLING &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   For years, Samuel L. Jackson has been a star. Now, at last, he's
a star warrior.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong sci-fi fan and an admirer of director/producer George
Lucas, Jackson makes a cameo appearance in ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel opens nationwide on
May 19, and it stars Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson
as Kenobi's mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; and Natalie Portman as the young
Queen Amidala. Jackson, whose sci-fi credits include ``Jurassic
Park'' (1993) and ``Sphere'' (1998), is cast as Mace Windu, a Jedi
Master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' says Jackson over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York City. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars'
movie. So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to
work with) I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Jackson's interest got back to Lucas, who invited the
actor to meet with him at his Skywalker Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``George said, `I've seen some of your work, and you're very
good, but you could wind up yelling, `Look out! Go this way! Run
that way!' I said, `I don't care.' Sure enough, he found something
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas handed Jackson the Windu character _ and a mere five pages
of script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to act with Yoda (Frank Oz), and I shot my scenes out in
England (at Leavesden Studios),'' Jackson says. ``I have no idea
what happens before my character shows up, and I have no idea what
happens after my character is gone. I had my pages and that was it.
Nobody gave me a whole script.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was so low-key,'' he adds. ``To know the incredible
pressure that's around the film, to know that it's his baby and
that he hadn't directed in 20 years, and to see him so calm was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a busy actor, Jackson counts ``The Phantom Menace'' as
but one of many projects on his dance card. The Oscar-nominated
star of ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) will soon be seen in the drama
``The Red Violin'' and the sci-fi/action thriller ``Deep Blue
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated for summer release, ``Deep Blue Sea'' reunites Jackson
with Renny Harlin, who directed him in ``The Long Kiss Goodnight''
(1996). The story centers on a group of scientists who breed
smarter, speedier and nastier sharks, then must deal with the
consequences when the genetically enhanced creatures threaten to
escape their high-tech confines.
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring with Jackson are Saffron Burrows, Michael Rapaport,
Deborah Unger, Wayne Knight (another ``Jurassic Park'' veteran),
rapper-actor LL Cool J and Stellan Skarsgard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be an intriguing film,'' Jackson says. ``People are
already starting to call it `Jurassic Shark,' and that sounds about
right.''
</P>
<P>
   When not acting, Jackson spends time pursuing his other
endeavors of choice, which include relaxing with his wife, actress
LaTanya Richardson, and daughter, Zoe, at their home in Los
Angeles; golfing until he can swing no more; and voraciously
reading scripts and novels that he can potentially option and
produce as films.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Jackson can't help but get caught up in the
``Star Wars'' fever sweeping the globe. He felt it on the ``Phantom
Menace'' set, and he feels it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open a
case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star Wars''
on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine lightsabers,
and he'd say, `Choose yours.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be there, hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take THAT
one.' That was very, very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did my one little bit, so it's going to be new and
exciting for me to see the movie,'' he says. ``I can't wait to see
it all put together.'' &QL;

<P>
   For years, Samuel L. Jackson has been a star. Now, at last, he's
a star warrior.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong sci-fi fan and an admirer of director/producer George
Lucas, Jackson makes a cameo appearance in ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel opens nationwide on
May 19, and it stars Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson
as Kenobi's mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; and Natalie Portman as the young
Queen Amidala. Jackson, whose sci-fi credits include ``Jurassic
Park'' (1993) and ``Sphere'' (1998), is cast as Mace Windu, a Jedi
Master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' says Jackson over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York City. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars'
movie. So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to
work with) I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Jackson's interest got back to Lucas, who invited the
actor to meet with him at his Skywalker Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``George said, `I've seen some of your work, and you're very
good, but you could wind up yelling, `Look out! Go this way! Run
that way!' I said, `I don't care.' Sure enough, he found something
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas handed Jackson the Windu character _ and a mere five pages
of script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to act with Yoda (Frank Oz), and I shot my scenes out in
England (at Leavesden Studios),'' Jackson says. ``I have no idea
what happens before my character shows up, and I have no idea what
happens after my character is gone. I had my pages and that was it.
Nobody gave me a whole script.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was so low-key,'' he adds. ``To know the incredible
pressure that's around the film, to know that it's his baby and
that he hadn't directed in 20 years, and to see him so calm was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a busy actor, Jackson counts ``The Phantom Menace'' as
but one of many projects on his dance card. The Oscar-nominated
star of ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) will soon be seen in the drama
``The Red Violin'' and the sci-fi/action thriller ``Deep Blue
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated for summer release, ``Deep Blue Sea'' reunites Jackson
with Renny Harlin, who directed him in ``The Long Kiss Goodnight''
(1996). The story centers on a group of scientists who breed
smarter, speedier and nastier sharks, then must deal with the
consequences when the genetically enhanced creatures threaten to
escape their high-tech confines.
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring with Jackson are Saffron Burrows, Michael Rapaport,
Deborah Unger, Wayne Knight (another ``Jurassic Park'' veteran),
rapper-actor LL Cool J and Stellan Skarsgard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be an intriguing film,'' Jackson says. ``People are
already starting to call it `Jurassic Shark,' and that sounds about
right.''
</P>
<P>
   When not acting, Jackson spends time pursuing his other
endeavors of choice, which include relaxing with his wife, actress
LaTanya Richardson, and daughter, Zoe, at their home in Los
Angeles; golfing until he can swing no more; and voraciously
reading scripts and novels that he can potentially option and
produce as films.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Jackson can't help but get caught up in the
``Star Wars'' fever sweeping the globe. He felt it on the ``Phantom
Menace'' set, and he feels it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open a
case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star Wars''
on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine lightsabers,
and he'd say, `Choose yours.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be there, hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take THAT
one.' That was very, very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did my one little bit, so it's going to be new and
exciting for me to see the movie,'' he says. ``I can't wait to see
it all put together.'' &QL;

   Nuclear fusion on a tabletop is now possible. Physicists have
unveiled a reactor that uses a small laser to fuse atoms. While it
won't solve the world's energy problems, it will make it possible
to study fusion for a tiny fraction of the usual cost.
</P>
<P>
   The fusion process is hard to start. Atomic nuclei repel each
other, and it takes a lot of energy to force them to fuse. In the
past, physicists have overcome this repulsion by using the energy
of massive lasers costing hundreds of millions of dollars, or even
more expensive options-uncontrolled nuclear fission or reactors
using superhot gas confined within magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California have triggered fusion with a small laser costing less
than $1 million. Each infrared laser pulse has less energy than a
Christmas tree light emits in a second. But because the laser pulse
lasts just 35 femtoseconds (35 times 10-15 seconds), its energy is
highly concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Ditmire and his colleagues injected deuterium gas into a
vacuum, in which the atoms clustered together. Then they fired the
laser at the deuterium clusters. When a laser pulse struck the
clusters, the heat made them explode. Many of the deuterium nuclei
hit others with enough speed to make them fuse, creating helium and
neutrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked to see if we were producing fusion neutrons _ lo and
behold, we were,'' Ditmire said. The fusion reaction also released
energy, but only 10 millionths of the energy consumed by the laser.
``This is not, in the present guise, a path to fusion energy
production,'' Ditmire admits. ``But it may potentially lead to a
compact neutron source.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady, cheap stream of neutrons could be slammed into
materials to test their susceptibility to damage by energetic
particles in space, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Schmidt, a nuclear physicist at the Commission for Atomic
Energy in Gif-sur-Yvette, France, agrees. But he thinks the best
reason to celebrate is that fusion reactions can now be studied
without expensive equipment. ``You don't need $1.2 billion to
produce fusion.''  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   For years, Samuel L. Jackson has been a star. Now, at last, he's
a star warrior.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong sci-fi fan and an admirer of director/producer George
Lucas, Jackson makes a cameo appearance in ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel opens nationwide on
May 19, and it stars Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson
as Kenobi's mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; and Natalie Portman as the young
Queen Amidala. Jackson, whose sci-fi credits include ``Jurassic
Park'' (1993) and ``Sphere'' (1998), is cast as Mace Windu, a Jedi
Master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' says Jackson over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York City. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars'
movie. So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to
work with) I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Jackson's interest got back to Lucas, who invited the
actor to meet with him at his Skywalker Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``George said, `I've seen some of your work, and you're very
good, but you could wind up yelling, `Look out! Go this way! Run
that way!' I said, `I don't care.' Sure enough, he found something
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas handed Jackson the Windu character _ and a mere five pages
of script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to act with Yoda (Frank Oz), and I shot my scenes out in
England (at Leavesden Studios),'' Jackson says. ``I have no idea
what happens before my character shows up, and I have no idea what
happens after my character is gone. I had my pages and that was it.
Nobody gave me a whole script.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was so low-key,'' he adds. ``To know the incredible
pressure that's around the film, to know that it's his baby and
that he hadn't directed in 20 years, and to see him so calm was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a busy actor, Jackson counts ``The Phantom Menace'' as
but one of many projects on his dance card. The Oscar-nominated
star of ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) will soon be seen in the drama
``The Red Violin'' and the sci-fi/action thriller ``Deep Blue
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated for summer release, ``Deep Blue Sea'' reunites Jackson
with Renny Harlin, who directed him in ``The Long Kiss Goodnight''
(1996). The story centers on a group of scientists who breed
smarter, speedier and nastier sharks, then must deal with the
consequences when the genetically enhanced creatures threaten to
escape their high-tech confines.
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring with Jackson are Saffron Burrows, Michael Rapaport,
Deborah Unger, Wayne Knight (another ``Jurassic Park'' veteran),
rapper-actor LL Cool J and Stellan Skarsgard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be an intriguing film,'' Jackson says. ``People are
already starting to call it `Jurassic Shark,' and that sounds about
right.''
</P>
<P>
   When not acting, Jackson spends time pursuing his other
endeavors of choice, which include relaxing with his wife, actress
LaTanya Richardson, and daughter, Zoe, at their home in Los
Angeles; golfing until he can swing no more; and voraciously
reading scripts and novels that he can potentially option and
produce as films.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Jackson can't help but get caught up in the
``Star Wars'' fever sweeping the globe. He felt it on the ``Phantom
Menace'' set, and he feels it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open a
case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star Wars''
on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine lightsabers,
and he'd say, `Choose yours.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be there, hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take THAT
one.' That was very, very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did my one little bit, so it's going to be new and
exciting for me to see the movie,'' he says. ``I can't wait to see
it all put together.'' &QL;

SHEPARD NAMED PRESIDENT OF HEARST'S KING FEATURES SYNDICATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ T.R. ``Rocky'' Shepard III has been named president
of King Features Syndicate, the world's largest distributor of
comics and editorial features to newspapers worldwide and a leader
in merchandise licensing.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, effective April 1, was announced Monday by
Raymond E. Joslin, group head of Hearst Entertainment &AMP; Syndication
and vice president of The Hearst Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky is ideally suited for this very important role at King
Features,'' said Joslin. ``He is a seasoned executive in
management, marketing and sales, including directing national sales
forces and selling creative properties across media platforms. He
is exceptionally skilled and will be an asset to the Hearst
Entertainment &AMP; Syndication Group.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard has been with The Hearst Corporation since 1978. He most
recently was senior vice president, advertising sales of Hearst New
Media &AMP; Technology's HomeArts.com (now a part of the Women.com
Networks), where he was responsible for sales and marketing for the
largest women's content site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard previously held vice president/publisher positions in
Hearst Magazines at both Country Living and Redbook. Prior to those
posts, he served as advertising director at Good Housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard is succeeding Lawrence T. Olsen. During Olsen's 16 years
at King Features, the company attracted new talent, like ``Baby
Blues'' and ``Zits''; refocused product licensing to turn Betty
Boop into a merchandising star; rapidly developed Reed Brennan
Media Associates' electronic pagination business; and was
reorganized to put it on solid financial footing for the future.
Having accomplished his personal goals, Olsen has decided to pursue
new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Features is fortunate to have been able to benefit from
Larry Olsen's many contributions,'' said Joslin. ``During his eight
years as general manager and the past two as president, King has
reinforced its position as the world's leading syndication company.
We wish Larry the best in his new career choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Joslin also announced that Keith A. McCloat has been appointed
vice president, business manager of King Features Syndicate.
McCloat previously was the company's vice president, resident
controller. He has held several posts in finance and accounting
since joining King Features in 1979, including assistant resident
controller, manager of accounting, accounts receivable section
supervisor, and general ledger bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   King Features Syndicate, which includes its North America
Syndicate and Cowles Syndicate affiliates, distributes some 180
features to nearly 5,000 newspapers around the globe. The company's
many popular comic properties include ``Blondie,'' ``Beetle
Bailey,'' ``The Family Circus,'' ``Hagar the Horrible,''
``Popeye,'' ``Zits,'' ``Hi and Lois,'' ``Dennis the Menace,''
``Mutts,'' ``Baby Blues,'' and ``Sally Forth.''
</P>
<P>
   King Features distributes newspaper columns by such well-known
figures as Heloise, Dan Rather, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, Marianne Means, and Arthur Frommer. The company
licenses its comic-character trademarks to more than 1,000 quality
manufacturers, advertisers and promotional partners worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   King Features Syndicate is part of Hearst Entertainment &AMP;
Syndication, the operating group of The Hearst Corporation that
also oversees the Company's television programming production and
distribution activities, and cable network partnerships.

DREYFUS: THE MOTHER OF ALL GOVERNMENT COVER-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Emile Zola was a novelist, journalist,
playwright, critic, and the unlikely hero of the Dreyfus Affair _
the 19th century mother of all government cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   While these days the Dreyfus Affair is little remembered, its
distinguishing motifs _ lies in high places for high-minded
reasons, media circus trials, hate-filled demagoguery _ are all too
familiar. And the affair's two great lessons _ that people of
conscience must always stand up to defend what is right, and that
official lying is always a dicey business _ are as relevant now as
they were a century ago, when scandal gutted a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The affair itself began in 1895, when Alfred Dreyfus, the only
Jew on the French general staff, was found guilty of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus' conviction was based on one piece of evidence: a list
of military secrets, found in a wastepaper basket at the German
Embassy in Paris. Although some experts _ and Dreyfus himself _
insisted the handwriting wasn't his, the argument ``What can you
expect of a traitor and a Jew?'' made a guilty verdict inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus was sent off to perish on Devil's Island.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, something most disturbing surfaced: a new
list of stolen military secrets, found in the same trash can, and
in the same handwriting. A secret inquiry easily _ and conclusively
_ matched the handwriting to Maj. Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy.
Dreyfus clearly had been framed.
</P>
<P>
   But then ... nothing happened. The army, taking the position
that protecting its honor was more important than rendering
justice, refused to admit its mistake. Instead, it forged
documents, threatened witnesses, gathered perjured depositions, and
told Esterhazy _ the real traitor _ that the Army and the War
Ministry would protect him if he kept his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Like all conspiracies, this one both stank and leaked. Soon
rumors of something official and evil spread; France split into
camps, Dreyfusard and anti-Dreyfusard. Frightened that so much
attention might blow its conspiracy sky-high, the government made a
bold public announcement: to prove it had nothing to hide, it would
court-martial Esterhazy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the court-marital was fixed. After two days of
meaningless testimony, Esterhazy's judges deliberated for three
whole minutes, then declared him innocent. The Dreyfusards were
stunned. It was then _ Jan. 13, 1898 _ that Zola spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   That he did so is quite remarkable, for Zola, until the affair,
had not been especially civic-minded; he'd been too busy becoming _
and then remaining _ an extremely successful writer. He produced
his first best-seller when he was 37; he was awarded the Legion of
Honor at 53. (A testimony to his popularity was the fact that _ in
those pre-cinema days _ his novels routinely were made into highly
commercial plays.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, Zola was at the zenith of his career. He had a lot to
lose, and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   But he went ahead. On the front page of a Paris newspaper, under
the headline ``J'Accuse'' (``I accuse'') Zola lashed out at every
government and military official involved in the cover-up. He
charged them by name with outrage after outrage: falsifying
evidence, lying to the press, Jew-baiting and _ worst of all _
condemning an innocent man and acquitting a guilty one, all in the
name of honor and national defense. He ended by daring the
government to sue him for libel.
</P>
<P>
   The government, cornered, did sue, and won, driving Zola into
exile. A year later, he returned to France, where the
administration _ forced to react to the growing pressure exerted by
``J'Accuse!'' _ retried Dreyfus, again found him guilty, then
issued a general amnesty forgiving everyone: Zola, the generals,
Dreyfus himself. Zola returned to his novel writing. He died two
years later of carbon monoxide poisoning _ possibly murdered, which
some feared, and quite a few others hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Had Zola not put his career on the line, Dreyfus, however
innocent, would have died on Devil's Island _ an impressive
reminder (acknowledged by Dreyfus himself) of just how important it
is that people stand up, no matter the cost, and demand justice, no
matter for whom.
</P>
<P>
   And the affair is itself an impressive reminder that government
lies and official cover-ups, however high-minded the reason _
French national honor, U.S. strategic interests, the dubious
reputation of sitting presidents _ ultimately harm precisely those
institutions which the lies and the cover-ups hope to save.

</P>
<P>
   Can you believe those Serbs over in Kosovo? Killing and
torturing people who look just like them because of something that
happened in 1389?
</P>
<P>
   What's the matter with those people? Do they thrive on bloodshed
and violence? It makes you wonder sometimes if they're actually
human.

<P>
   ``I am part and parcel of the whole and cannot find God apart
from the rest of humanity.'' _ Mahatma Gandhi
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise _ the peace talks in Northern Ireland have
stalled. One side has demanded the other first turn over its
weapons. Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   Those people have been fighting each other for hundreds of
years. ``The Troubles'' is their way of life. They instinctively
objectify one another. They'll never have peace. They don't really
want it.

deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot
drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out
hate; only love can do that.'' _ Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   How about those Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda? Life isn't hard
enough for those people? They're not poor enough, they don't have
enough famines, floods and droughts? No, one side has to hack the
other side to death with machetes. They must be nuts.
</P>
<P>
   At least they aren't cannibalizing one another, which is what
those people in Indonesia are doing. What in heaven's name could
possess them? To eat another person _ not because you're starving
but as a political statement _ you'd have to convince yourself they
weren't even human.

special laws passed just for them? Why in the world should they be
allowed to get married, let alone adopt children?
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that those people are the way they are, but then
they have to advertise it. No wonder they get beat up. They make

boycotts of Disney. Those people are sick, sick, sick.

too fast.
</P>

   Nobody uses turn signals, but everybody sure uses their horn.
</P>

   They're like animals behind the wheel, those people. They act

   Everybody's a smartass.

   Then there are ``the homeless.'' Those people live like pigs.

   They sleep on the sidewalk, pee in public, throw trash on the
ground and do nothing all day but beg for money. Why should anybody

INFANT BAY TRAIL COULD GROW UP NICELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to building trails, Jane Gomery
has learned the First Commandment of the public over and over
again: ``Don't tell me about the labor pains, just show me the
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a baby is being born, the Bay Trail, but the extended
labor is making this project along the San Francisco Bay both
prolonged and painful. Gomery, associate engineer for Burlingame's
Department of Public Works, has been one of the insiders trying to
ease the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bay Trail consists of a patchwork quilt of small
completed sections, the five miles of trail along the Burlingame
shore is a testimonial to what could be possible elsewhere in the
trail's planned route around San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   It runs roughly from the city limits of Millbrae on south
through Burlingame, and then hooks up with Coyote Point Regional
Park in San Mateo. It is an ideal trail for walking, jogging and
family-style easy biking, as well as for sightseeing across the
South Bay, watching the jets land at the nearby airport, bird
watching and shore fishing.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Bay Trail so difficult to complete is that there
is no single entity charged with building and maintaining it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every respective city government ringing the Bay is
responsible for its own section,'' Gomery said. The Bay
Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) has the overall
authority for the right of way, but there is no time line, work
schedule or master budget to get the trail completed.
</P>
<P>
   With so many different governments involved, it has made for a
management nightmare. For instance, the Bay Trail on the Peninsula
dies at the south end of the San Francisco Airport.
</P>
<P>
   However, BCDC has arranged for an access route as part of the
airport renovation. This presents a ton of problems, both
engineering and political, with several agencies involved, to reach
completion.
</P>
<P>
   But in Burlingame, the emerging trail has had far fewer
problems, best represented on the section from ``Hotel Row'' in
Burlingame on south to Coyote Point.
</P>
<P>
   (To reach it, take the Broadway exit from U.S. 101 and park at
one of the small parking areas along Airport Boulevard, or at the
lots for a hotel, such as Embassy Suites or Marriott _ by contract,
recreation parking must be provided at the hotel lots.)
</P>
<P>
   Because these hotels are popular for those at conferences and
business trips, heading out on the nearby Bay Trail has become an
attractive adventure for visitors and their No. 1 orientation to
Bay Area outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   From here, it is a great stroll, hike or bike ride, heading
south toward Coyote Point. The first thing you will notice is the
dramatic expanse of the South Bay; up close, it is much bigger that
most envision, particularly at high tide. But even at low tide,
when miles of mud flats are exposed, there is a sense of great
magnitude, yet a place which nearly everybody takes for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing that comes to mind is the procession of jets
landing at the airport. When the wind is blowing out of the north,
the jets will make their approach from the south, and from the Bay
Trail here, you can watch the jets make their descents and
touchdowns over a precision guidance landing system that extends
out over the water. At twilight, the blinking lights create
reflected radiance across the water.
</P>
<P>
   As you head south, you leave the jets behind, and in turn, start
seeing a variety of marine birds. Egrets, coots, sandpipers are
residents of wetland habitat here, and other migrants, such as
avocets in the past week, also make regular appearances.
</P>
<P>
   This trips makes a great family bike ride because the route is
flat and it extends far enough south to provide a decent round
trip, 10 miles. The destination, Coyote Point, is also a fun place
to explore, especially for youngsters, watching boats come and go
from the marina and launch ramps, and also with good fishing for
jacksmelt and perch.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Trail in Burlingame also is one of the best shoreline
access points for fishing in the South Bay. In the past two weeks,
for instance, huge bat rays have migrated to the South Bay, and on
high tides at night, often emerge from the main channel of the
South Bay to bottom forage within casting range of Hotel Row. Using
squid for bait at high tides at night, I have caught many bat rays,
known for their huge wings, sharp stinger, and long, thin tail, but
never the big one.
</P>

COMPANY MARKETS ELECTRICITY THROUGH INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Internet has become a marketplace for
clothing, books, software and countless other consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Now a California company is selling electrical service over the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany-based company, utility.com, is trying to carve a
niche for itself in California's $20 billion electricity market,
which was opened to competition a year ago so customers could have
a wider choice of energy providers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers don't actually receive electricity over their phone
lines. Rather, it markets, offers sign-up and billing through the
Internet, matching customers with power sources offering the lowest
rates. Those energy suppliers then transport electricity over power
grids, which are owned and operated by utilities such as the
Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Chris King, chief executive of the company, said that on
average, his customers can save about 10 percent each month over
what they would pay to traditional electricity providers.
</P>
<P>
   King said utility.com offered better discounts than other energy
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, residential customers have been able to save only
about 1 percent on (electricity) bills after switching suppliers,''
he said, referring to data from the state Public Utilities
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com can offer lower rates for two reasons. First, King
said, the company doesn't have high administrative costs since its
services are automated on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a call center or have to process bills on
paper,'' King said. ``We use the Internet for all our customer
services, which includes signing up for the service and bill
payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com customers receive their bills by electronic mail.
They also choose the date they get billed.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, King said the company used special meters and
thermostats to track the exact time of day customers use power.
</P>
<P>
   This is important, he said, for creating precise bills since
electricity rates fluctuate during the day and are separated into
peak and off-peak prices.
</P>
<P>
   King said traditional utilities don't have these technologies,
so they estimate bill charges using an averaged rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the meters and thermostats that utility.com uses aren't free
to customers. The company charges $3.99 per month for them.
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com wouldn't disclose the number of customers it has,
but the company expects to have at least 50,000 by the end of the
year. The company also plans to start selling electricity to
customers in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Rhode Island this
summer. By next year, utility.com also hopes to be doing business
in Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were skeptical about utility.com's chances because one
year after deregulation, few California customers have left the
traditional utilities.
</P>
<P>
   According to PUC data, only about 1 percent of the state's 10
million customers have switched to another energy provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation is happening slowly in California,'' said Abhi
Chaki, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a technology research
firm in New York. ``It's a combination of customer inertia and the
fact that electricity usage doesn't touch people in the same way
that, say, telephone service does.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaki said customers physically have to dial a phone, and this
makes them aware of the service. By contrast, he said, electric
service is less tangible.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Chaki said electric competition could ignite in
the future. ``Two years from now we might see more competition and
switching,'' he said.

VARIABLE-ANNUITY MUTUAL FUNDS ATTRACTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 47, single and am concerned about ways to invest for my
retirement. I have contributed the maximum $2,000 a year to my IRA
account for the last 17 years, all of it invested in stock mutual
funds, and of course I am very happy with the results. I've also
managed in the past few years to put aside another $4,000 per year,
with the account now at $30,000 and all of it in money market
accounts. What is the best vehicle for this kind of retirement
savings? Would mutual funds be the answer? I won't be needing this
money for at least 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   R.W., Cathedral City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds to me as if you're a good candidate for a variable
annuity invested in mutual funds. These accounts are very similar
to mutual fund investments, with one huge advantage and several
small disadvantages. The big advantage is that you can take
after-tax money such as your $30,000 and put it in a variable
annuity account where the taxes will be deferred until it is
withdrawn in your retirement years. When it is withdrawn in
retirement, only the portion of the balance that represents the
internal growth is taxed. The amount representing your initial
contribution of after-tax dollars is treated as a non-taxable
return of your capital. That's the advantage, and in view of the
fact that the account would grow to $125,317 if your investment
earned an average 10 percent annual returns over 15 years, it's
indeed a big one -- you'd have deferred taxes on $95,317 of income.
</P>
<P>
   The major disadvantages of variable annuities are twofold. The
first is that the expenses for variable annuity accounts are higher
than for traditional mutual funds. This is because these accounts
all carry some form of (FL)insurance,(FR) typically a guarantee
that after a set number of years, the account value will at least
equal the amount of your initial contribution, or the insurer will
make up the difference. Such (FL)insurance(FR) is critical, because
that's the element that allows you to claim the tax deferral.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the cost of the insurance tends to reduce the
investment returns by about one half of one percent when compared
to investments in traditional mutual funds with similar objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The second disadvantage is that when you put money in variable
annuity accounts, you will probably face penalties if you withdraw
it prematurely; these penalties can be levied either by the
government as tax penalties or by the company which offers the
product. It's important to read the prospectus for a variable
annuity carefully, because this instrument is much more complex
than a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   If none of this has frightened you away, you'll find that most
major mutual fund companies offer variable annuity accounts, with
investment pools that very closely mirror most of their major
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you do make that move, you'll find that most of your
retirement savings will be in tax-deferred accounts. To get a
better mix, why not switch ongoing IRA contributions to Roth IRA
accounts, with the goal of having some of your retirement money in
accounts on which the taxes have already been paid, thus balancing
the heavier amount of money which has been tax deferred.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am contemplating selling my house, which is valued at
roughly $180,000. If I decide to do so, I will rent for a period of
six months to a year, after which I'll likely purchase or build a
new home. What would be a good investment vehicle for my money?
While I am renting, my housing costs will be reduced by about $600
a month. Thus I'll be able to save an additional $3,600 to $7,200
during the period while I'm renting. Where would you suggest I put
that money?
</P>
<P>
   S.S., Stoughton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, most people don't tend to think of it as much of an
(FL)investment,(FR) but to my thinking the best vehicle for you
here is a money market mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Your investment time frame will be so short that you'd face
heavy risk even if you went with a conservative investment such as
bond funds. With such an investment, a rise in interest rates could
drive the value of your principal down sufficiently that you'd end
up with very little return -- and possibly even a loss. Stock
funds, of course, present still bigger risks. So I suggest you do
what a banker would do in such a situation -- balance the duration
of your asset (the savings) with that of the liability (the
requirement to have cash on hand in six to 12 months). If you were
more certain about when you'd need the cash, you might do a little
better with a sequence of CDs -- but that move would give you less
flexibility in timing the purchase of your new home.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $600 a month that you'll save during the period when
you're between houses, the appropriate investment depends on the
eventual purpose of the money. If you think of it as money which
will eventually go toward the new home, I'd invest it the same way
-- in that money market fund. But if you view this simply as a
short-term windfall and you want to treat it as long-term savings,
if you qualify for one why not use some of it to establish a Roth
IRA, adding an additional element to your retirement savings (which
I have edited out of your letter)? Since you have a number of
retirement savings accounts, I'd suggest that you use this to add
some real zip to the retirement portfolio -- buying shares in
Fidelity Select Health Care fund. If these savings amount to more
than what you can put into a Roth IRA I'd just add the extra money
to your existing taxable Fidelity mutual fund accounts.

   Q. We will be selling our home and relocating to another state.
We are 48 and 50 years old and have a 10-year-old child. We have no
debt, and are currently in the 28 percent tax bracket. We are
adequately funded for retirement. We will have about $440,000 cash
proceeds from the sale of our home. We plan to buy another house,
but one costing less than that $440,000. We expect to live in that
home about 10 years. How do you suggest we pay for our new home
purchase? Should we finance it to the maximum? Should it be a
15-year or 30-year mortgage? How would you advise us to invest the
balance of the money to maximize our return?
</P>
<P>
   R. H., San Diego,
</P>
<P>
   A. Boy, what an opportunity -- if there's one thing that's nicer
than burning that old mortgage document in your own fireplace, it's
not having a mortgage to burn. Despite low mortgage rates and
despite the loss of the tax advantages that come with a mortgage on
your principal residence, I don't hesitate to suggest you use
whatever cash it takes to buy your new home, investing only
whatever money remains from your $440,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for a target investment for whatever remains, that would
depend on when you think you might need it. For example, if you're
likely to need all or some of it in about seven years when that
10-year-old begins college, I'd suggest a conservative bond
portfolio -- perhaps a combination of a short-term corporate bond
fund and a solid GNMA fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking that you'll only be in the new house for a
decade because you'll be retiring at that point and will then need
the money, I'd suggest a proven balanced fund, such as Fidelity
Puritan which divides its investments between the stock and bond
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Only if you have no specific purpose for this money and expect
that it will remain invested for many years, would I suggest that
it go into the stock market. And even then I'd invest it
cautiously, at least for the near term. In a case like this, you
might consider Vanguard Windsor II, Fidelity Value, or any other
proven value-oriented large-cap stock fund.

HOLOCAUST MEMORIES LINGER IN `SECOND HAND SMOKE' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SECOND HAND SMOKE 
By Thane Rosenbaum 
St. Martin's Press, 320 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much that as a family they were strange, or that
from the beginning they had been estranged _ although both of these
things were true. It was that they were damaged. Irreversibly
ruined. The Katz family of Miami Beach came assembled that way,
without manuals or operating instructions or reassuring warranties.
Everything was already broken. Nothing worked right. Nothing ever
would.''
</P>
<P>
   With these attention-must-be-paid opening lines, Thane
Rosenbaum's ``Second Hand Smoke'' immediately reveals itself as an
expansive, challenging novel unconcerned about overreaching
self-importance. And for the most part, Rosenbaum's muscle-flexing
ambitions aren't necessarily a bad thing. A first-time novelist, he
writes with energy and urgency, as if everything on his mind must
be said, and said at once.
</P>
<P>
   Even its title is a clever slight-of-hand. In common parlance,
second-hand smoke refers to cigarette fumes, which can exact
devastating consequences on those who inhale them. The smoke
Rosenbaum often mentions comes from the more distant fires of the
Holocaust. The thick, death-filled haze of crematoriums wafts and
lingers through the decades, continuing to invade and choke the
life from its survivors, and especially their children.
</P>
<P>
   It is this heirloom of infinite horror that weighs on Duncan
Katz. He is the son of Mila and Herschel ``Yankee'' Katz, who
survived Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. He was born many years and
miles away from his parents' tribulations, but they remain for him
as present and indelible as a birthmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``What his parents gave him he couldn't pass off on someone
else,'' Rosenbaum writes. ``He couldn't even explain or understand
what it was that he had. Splintered, disembodied memories that once
belonged to them were now his alone, as though their two lives
couldn't exhaust the outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   That outrage percolates in his tough-as-nails mother, Mila. Once
she could find happiness banging out Gershwin tunes by ear on a
piano. By the time of Duncan's birth, though, she was so hardened
by her imprisonment that she declared music lessons were ``for
sissies.'' She wouldn't even allow her son a toy piano.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she enrolled him in martial arts and kickboxing
classes, goading him to finish off his opponents. By age 9, he was
a black belt, and in Mila's eyes, ready to defend against the
bullies, the persecutors, the ``pogromists in training.'' Mila
would often tell Duncan, who grows to become a Nazi-hunting lawyer,
``You must avenge our deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum, a child of Holocaust survivors, understands well the
paranoia of people like Mila, whose trust in humanity eroded during
the dark years when friends and neighbors turned against her.
Duncan is ever-suspicious, raised to trust no one. His mother even
had a code word _ ``Keller'' _ to shut down any conversation where
she felt her son had divulged too much, even if he was just telling
a friend where his father was.
</P>
<P>
   These early passages are especially vivid, deftly portraying a
Jewish community less than a decade removed from the Shoah trying
to re-create itself in 1950s Miami Beach. It's a colorful, singular
world where the local deli is a hang-out for Jewish goodfellas;
where the mohel, who performs circumcisions, is also a bookie named
Morty; and where Duncan's godfather, Larry Breitbart, really is a
Godfather, and a one-time compatriot of gangster Meyer Lansky.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is equally confident in detailing how a parent's best
intentions can ruin a child. While Mila instills in Duncan
preparation for any atrocity, she's incapable of loving him for
fear that she will lose him. Having experienced so much loss, she
shuns attachments, even to her own son. Duncan grows to be a
wounded man, left incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum's footing is less certain as Duncan loses his job
because of his overzealous pursuit of a suspected Nazi, and his
wife, fed up with his Holocaust obsessions, skips out with their
young daughter. Then there's a twist involving a long-held secret
Duncan discovers after his mother's death. Neither the revelation _
which leads to Poland and a journey into Birkenau camp _ nor the
sticky emotional conclusion is as poignant as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what most distinguishes ``Second Hand Smoke'' are
Rosenbaum's own observations about the lasting stain of the
Holocaust. Through the book, he hovers above the story like an
all-knowing narrator from a Thornton Wilder play. Yet frustration
and tension are ever-present in his comments, as if he is trying to
unravel a particularly vexing equation, but knows there is no
soloution. What he finds is the unsettling reality that the more he
_ and we _ discover about the Holocaust, the less we can comprehend
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When would the world learn,'' Rosenbaum writes, ``that the
mystery of madness and atrocity would never be learned in books _
or even museums _ because the questions themselves are unknowable,
and the answers, even more so?''
</P>

HOW HEMINGWAY HAS FARED IN THE MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood's love for Ernest Hemingway may have been unrequited,
but love him it did. Only two of his novels haven't been filmed. A
screen version of one of them, ``The Garden of Eden,'' is in
production. As for the other, ``Across the River and Into the
Trees,'' John Huston wrote a screenplay he long dreamed of
directing.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has loved Hemingway so much it's not only made movies
from his works but also remade them. There have been three versions
of ``To Have and Have Not'' (Howard Hawks's 1944 classic; six years
later, ``The Breaking Point,'' starring John Garfield; and, in
1958, ``The Gun Runners,'' starring Audie Murphy), two of ``A
Farewell to Arms'' (1932 and 1957), two of the short story ``My Old
Man'' (1950 and 1979), and two of the short story ``The Killers''
(1946 and 1964).
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Killers'' was Hemingway's favorite among films made
from his works. He owned a print and would run it for guests at his
home in Cuba. Only the first 10 minutes come from the Hemingway
story; the remaining 93 spin out a noir tale of betrayal and
misogyny cleverly plotted by Anthony Veiller and superbly directed
by Robert Siodmak. It's also notable for being Burt Lancaster's
screen debut. The only things notable about the 1964 version are
Lee Marvin, in one of the title roles, at his most matter-of-factly
malevolent and Ronald Reagan, in his last film appearance, playing
a villain (slapping around Angie Dickinson, no less) for the only
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's financial favorite was ``For Whom the Bell Tolls''
(1943): Paramount paid $150,000 for it, a then-record price for the
rights to a literary property. The studio spared no expense on the
production, and even on video the Technicolor looks ravishing.
Unfortunately, the locations look more like Lake Tahoe (much of the
picture was shot in the Sierra Nevada mountains) than anywhere
Iberian. Nor do director Sam Wood and screenwriter Dudley Nichols
spare any effort removing all ideological references from the
script. Someone not knowing any better could get the idea the
Spanish Civil War was being fought over a dress code. Loyalists
Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper look fabulous (even by movie-star
standards) in, respectively, jeans and leather jacket, while the
Fascists stand out with the comic-operetta ugliness of their
helmets and hats.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, as Maria, gives one of her most luminous performances.
Cooper, as Robert Jordan, is at his most sturdily Gary Cooperish.
Katina Paxinou won a best supporting actress Oscar for her
scenery-chewing as Pilar, but the great supporting turn is Akim
Tamiroff's Pablo. His bellowing voice and wolfish beard cannot
conceal how the ravages of war have left him emotionally dying _
and morally dead. Bergman's Maria, Cooper's Jordan, or especially
Paxinou's Pilar might have wandered in from any number of other
movies (none of Pilar's would have been any good). Only Hemingway
could have created the wreckage of a man that Tamiroff plays.
</P>
<P>
   The one adaptation Hemingway had any hopes for was ``The Old Man
and the Sea'' (1958). After plumping for Vittorio De Sica as
director (a startlingly acute choice coming from someone who
professed to have no regard for the movies), he agreed to assist
Fred Zinnemann, the director of ``High Noon'' and ``From Here to
Eternity,'' with preproduction. After Zinnemann was replaced by
John Sturges, Hemingway disowned the final product (though Mary
Hemingway, his wife, makes a cameo appearance in a crowd shot).
``No picture with a . . . rubber fish ever made a dime!'' he
declared. One can only speculate as to how Hemingway would have
responded to ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that ``Jaws'' helped get ``Islands in the Stream''
(1977) made. The former's record-breaking grosses led to a
mini-vogue for nautical pictures (``The Deep,'' ``Voyage of the
Damned''). The one thing to recommend it is George C. Scott, who
looks quite Hemingway-esque, with his puffed-up chest and snowy
beard, as Thomas Hudson. This is the sort of intuitively right
casting all too rare in Hemingway screen adaptations. For example,
Gregory Peck is not the first name that comes to mind as a
Hemingway type, yet he starred in both ``The Macomber Affair''
(1947), a version of ``The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,''
and ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952). Apparently, Hemingway
didn't think much of the casting either: He fell asleep while
watching ``Macomber.'' Presumably, he would have made a point not
to do that watching Ava Gardner as Lady Brett Ashley in ``The Sun
Also Rises'' (1957): He and she were friends. Gardner had acquitted
herself respectably as a femme very fatale in the first
``Killers.'' But even if she'd been a better actress, it's hard to
imagine her bringing much plausibility to playing an aristocratic
Englishwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Even more questionable than Peck and Gardner are Richard Beymer,
best known for his Tony in the movie version of ``West Side
Story,'' playing Nick Adams in ``Hemingway's Adventures of a Young
Man'' (1962), which cobbles together a number of early short
stories; and Rock Hudson as Frederic Henry in the 1957 version of
``A Farewell to Arms.'' Thirty-five minutes into a specially
arranged screening of the latter, Hemingway walked out.
</P>
<P>
   The 1932 ``Farewell'' is a different proposition. True, Helen
Hayes's winsomeness as Catherine Barkley verges on the toxic. And
the filmmakers' disregard for the novel is indicated by the fact
they filmed an ending in which Catherine lives (they finally
decided to stick with the original). Even so, it's a surprisingly
good film. Adolphe Menjou's trademark brilliantine sleaze is ideal
for Major Rinaldi, and there's a stunning montage depicting the
retreat from Caporetto that's pre-Code Hollywood filmmaking at its
most exciting. Of course, the sequence really doesn't have much to
do with the book, but that raises an important point: The Hemingway
movies that have succeeded best generally don't have all that much
to do with what Hemingway wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing demonstrates this better than Hawks's ``To Have and Have
Not.'' Lauren Bacall makes one of the most famous debuts in
Hollywood history. She and Humphrey Bogart create one of the
screen's great love matches. Throw in a supporting cast with the
likes of Walter Brennan, Marcel Dalio, and Hoagy Carmichael, and
you have one of the most entertaining films of the Studio Age. ``I
can make a movie out of the worst thing you ever wrote,'' Hawks
told Hemingway. So he did, but only by throwing out everything from
the novel except its title, the hero's name (Harry Morgan), and his
occupation (charter-boat captain).
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's love of Hemingway extends to his person as well as
his works. Alas, he's fared no better as character than
inspiration. In ``The Moderns'' (1988), it's Hemingway during his
Paris years. Kevin J. O'Connor plays him as a sententious macho
blowhard, a comic foil given to muttering possible titles for ``A
Moveable Feast'' (``A traveling picnic?'' ``A portable banquet?'').
Bad as O'Connor's Hemingway is, it's preferable to Chris
O'Donnell's in ``In Love and War'' (1996), which tells the story of
Hemingway's love affair with nurse Agnes von Kurowsky while
recuperating from war wounds in Italy in 1918. For winsomeness,
O'Donnell rivals Hayes in ``A Farewell to Arms,'' and Sandra
Bullock, as von Kurowsky, makes two.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest movie portrayal of Hemingway takes place in Robert
Altman's ``The Long Goodbye'' (1973), adapted from Raymond
Chandler's novel. The author in question is named Roger Wade, but
there's no doubt who inspires the characterization. Magnificently
played by Sterling Hayden (who once auditioned for the part of
Robert Jordan in ``For Whom the Bell Tolls''), Wade has a
patriarchal beard, drinks too much, and alternates between violent
rage and crushing depression. Instead of putting a shotgun to his
head, he walks into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Wade's death is all the more memorable and moving for being
played so undramatically: He simply leaves the frame. The single
most impressive thing about Hemingway's style is the impression it
gives of absolute control. What that control masks, though, is an
equally absolute terror of the loss of control. Watching Wade
surrender himself to the surf, we get some small, awful sense of
the price that style exacted.

DEBT-LADEN CARDHOLDERS GO FROM PARIAHS TO PRIZED PROSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as Scott M. dodged ``customer service representatives'' who
telephoned more often than his mother in pursuit of $40,000 in
credit-card debt, congratulatory offers for easy money continued to
roll in.
</P>
<P>
   With one hand, card issuers prodded the unemployed 30-year-old
musician to pay up. With the other, they continued to push
additional cards with hefty interest rates and catchy names like
``Aspire Visa'' and ``Future Card.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they don't really make the offers until you get
late'' with payments, said Scott, a South Boston resident.
</P>
<P>
   Prolific debt hasn't kept Scott and others like him from
becoming the latest darlings of a credit industry that now reaps
some of its biggest profits from those already in over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The new willingness to lend to those who a decade ago wouldn't
have survived an initial credit check comes as more customers have
begun paying their credit-card balances off each month _ thereby
denying lenders the interest rate charges that have traditionally
been their bread and butter. While $3,500 in credit-card purchases
earns a creditor between $30 and $35 in transaction fees, it can
generate between $300 and $350 in revenue from interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have changed, that's the thing that has become most
unsettling,'' said Robert B. McKinley, president of CardWeb.Com, a
Maryland firm that tracks the credit-card industry. ``Your best
credit risks are paying their balances off in full.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley estimated that between 29 percent and 43 percent of all
card holders, many of them baby boomers and professionals, no
longer carry a monthly balance. Credit-card firms have perversely
dubbed them ``deadbeats,'' and in some cases have slapped annual
fees on those who refuse to revolve their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Enter those who are willing to pay, and pay dearly, for the
privilege of putting it on plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Have a history of shirking your bills? You may not qualify for a
card that carries a competitive interest rate, but Aspire Visa will
issue you one for 27 percent a year and stiff late charges.
Recipients are automatically enrolled in a fee-based ``credit
protection plan,'' tacked onto their monthly balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the prevailing philosophy was get your
credit cards in the hands of the most credit-worthy individuals,''
said Norm Magnuson, vice president of marketing for Associated
Credit Bureaus, which provides financial data to the nation's
credit-reporting agencies. Now, he said, ``the question put to
lenders is, `How do I find my niche so I can make money off of it?'
''
</P>
<P>
   High-debt homeowners, whose names home equity lenders regularly
purchase from credit bureaus, are another coveted market. More than
half of the $268 billion in home equity loans originated in 1997
were ``subprime,'' meaning they were obtained by consumers with
less-than-perfect credit, according to the National Home Equity
Mortgage Association. That can be anything from a few late payments
on a credit card to a bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors ``don't necessarily look at your ability to repay,
they just look at the equity in your house as the primary
determinant for eligibility,'' said John Roddy, a Boston bankruptcy
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And while a Federal Reserve study found that almost half of the
home-equity loans taken out last year were used to reduce debt,
economists say many consumers appear to be loading up their credit
cards within months of wiping away previous obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation to lend to people like Scott runs all the way
from Waltham to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of growth _ the longest peacetime expansion in
US history _ Americans are spending more, owing more, and saving
virtually nothing. Last month, consumers spent 0.2 percent more
than they took in, while credit-card debt, which accounts for over
40 percent of all nonmortgage debt, climbed to $574 billion in
January.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the buying binge: Bankruptcies last year hit 1.4
million, a record, even as interest rates, inflation, and
unemployment grazed record lows.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in bankruptcy filings prompted the credit-card
industry, which sent out more than 3 billion offers last year, to
lobby Congress for new laws that would make it harder to declare
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card debt _ bundled and securitized _ has become one of
the hottest investments on Wall Street, a staple of pension funds
and mutual fund portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the highest-performing credit-card company stocks are
those of subprime lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the fastest growing credit-card issuers in this market
are Capital One Financial Corp. of Virginia, whose 1998 earnings
rose to $275.2 million from $189.4 million in 1997; and the $6.05
billion Providian Financial Corp. of California, the nation's
biggest issuer of credit cards backed by deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Providian charges its extra fees _ such as a $49 one-time
processing charge for its unsecured 23.9 percent Visa Classic _ in
an effort to insulate itself from losses if consumers default,
according to Ellen Richey, Providian's executive vice president.
Many, she said, are willing to pay more if it means a chance to
rebuild their credit. ``Try to rent a car without a card,'' Richey
said. ``If you are not getting a credit card, you really have
trouble going through life.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers with troublesome credit there is also the Visa
Future Card, touted by another firm to those who make at least
$10,000 a year and have, among other things, not been bankrupt or
unemployed in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These customers are already at the end of their rope to begin
with,'' McKinley said. ``You are just handing them more rope.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts it is those in the middle and bottom of the
economic spectrum who flock to Consumer Credit Counseling Service
of Mass. for relief. The average amount of nonmortgage debt
reported by the 12,529 people who received counseling last year
from CCCS was $23,755. Their average income: $32,480.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that years ago, one of the biggest complaints I
heard when credit was tight from young people and people with
credit problems was that they weren't given an opportunity to
either establish credit or reestablish credit,'' said Mel Stiller,
executive director of CCC, which is underwritten by credit-card
companies. ``Now it's come full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, an expert on
bankruptcy, worries that low- and middle-income debtors are using
credit cards to make up for reductions in real wages. She fears
that when the economy turns, so too will the fortunes of many
families now coasting on credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans have taken on more and more credit-card debt,
their capacity to weather the things that go wrong has declined,''
Warren said. ``Smaller and smaller bumps in the road cause them to
trip and they can't get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's too early to sound the alarm, because
credit-card delinquencies remain relatively stable, and an
increasing number of lenders have fine-tuned their ability to
determine who will ultimately pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you have some devil here handing you the keys to
hell, because if you don't pay, he loses too,'' said Richard
Kopcke, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to folks like Scott when the nation's economic
engine _ stoked by large gains on Wall Street that have spurred
consumer confidence and spending _ starts to drag?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking for the economy's Achilles' heel, you've
hit upon it,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional
Financial Associates, a Philadelphia-area firm that analyzes data
for banks and investors. ``This is the economy's most significant
weak spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Warren was more bleak in her prediction: ``We are
dancing,'' she warned, ``even further out on a cliff.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- Jennifer Huntington, president of the Appalachian
Mountain Club, recalls that before she could join the club she had
to get signatures from two members willing to sponsor her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot more democratic now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The operative word for the venerable outdoor organization that
Huntington joined in the early 1970s was ``clubby.'' It wasn't all
that far removed from the gentlemen's clubs that many of its
original members also belonged to when they founded the AMC in
1876. The earliest members were hiking enthusiasts affiliated with
Harvard and the precursor of MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Boston-based AMC actively seeks new members and
aggressively markets both itself and the land it seeks to protect:
the mountains, forests, and hiking trails of the northeastern
United States. Joining the club now can be done with just a click
on its Web site: http://www.outdoors.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years the AMC has nearly tripled its
membership'' to 82,000, says Huntington, who became president two
years ago. ``And it's the member volunteers who are the backbone of
the club. They run the chapters, maintain the trails, and make
things happen.'' The presidency is an unpaid position. Huntington
is, in effect, the head volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Born in India, Huntington, 57, grew up in England and came to
this country in 1963. A Newton resident, she is a former principal
of Watertown High School. ``I came onto the board of trustees when
the club was reenergizing itself and trying to attract new and
younger members and to become more diverse,'' she says. ``Now we're
searching for ways to conserve land for future recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its outreach efforts, however, the AMC _ based in an
elegant bow-front brick mansion on Beacon Hill's Joy Street _ still
has an elitist image in some quarters. There is confusion in the
minds of many as to just what it is the club does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common misperception about the Appalachian Mountain
Club is that we run the Appalachian Trail, and we don't,'' says
Andrew J. Falender, executive director. The club is responsible for
only 350 miles of the 2,200 mile-long trail, though its members do
maintain 1,400 miles of other hiking trails in Massachusetts,
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``flatlander from Indiana'' but an ardent hiker
and mountain climber, Falender has been the club's salaried
director since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking isn't complicated, but making life easier and trails
smoother for hikers can be. The AMC operates more than 50 huts,
lodges, and other shelters in the Northeast and has an annual
operating budget of $13 million. ``We annually provide over 100,000
overnight stays,'' Falender says, ``serve more than 200,000 meals
and run around 500 workshops.'' The club also publishes its own
maps and guidebooks, and puts out AMC Outdoors, a monthly magazine,
as well as Appalachia, a biannual journal.
</P>
<P>
   America's oldest mountaineering club, the AMC was founded the
same year the telephone was invented, and was itself an innovation,
at least for Americans. At the time, recreational hiking was
popular in Europe but not in the United States, where most people
still regarded the wilderness as something to be conquered and
exploited rather than savored and saved.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the club focused its energies on developing a trail
system in the White Mountains and building huts along it to shelter
hikers. The eight ``high huts,'' spaced a day's hike apart and
operated under special-use permits from the US Forest Service,
gradually became synonymous with the AMC, as well as icons of
back-country New England.
</P>
<P>
   Most huts date from around the turn of the century, but each has
its own character, traditions, food specialties (hardy meals are a
high-hut tradition) and lore. The hut at Carter Notch, for
instance, is reputed to be haunted by the spirit of a man who
managed the entire hut system in the 1920s _ and liked Carter best
of all.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the high huts _ and the AMC _ declined in the
decades immediately after World War II as young postwar parents
concentrated on raising their children. Then in 1961, US Supreme
Court justice William O. Douglas, an outdoorsman, hiked the
high-hut system and wrote a lyrical account for National
Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, many baby boom kids were old enough to scale
mountains, and parents who read the article said: ``Why didn't
somebody tell us about this before?'' It soon became difficult to
get a bunk in the high huts in midsummer without a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the baby boomers's turn to hike with their children and
grandchildren, and the AMC is experiencing another surge of
interest. According to Falender, club membership has soared from
the 32,000 of 1990 to the 82,000 of today. (Annual membership fees
are $40 for individuals, $65 for families.) The club has 12
chapters. The Greater Boston chapter has nearly a quarter of the
total club membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lodging reservations for this summer are up 10 percent over
last year, and we got a record number of new members last month,''
says Falender, 54, who can readily relate to the new generation of
hikers: One office wall is covered with photos of his 12-year-old
son and 10-year-old daughter hiking along AMC trails.
</P>
<P>
   The high huts have probably never been more in demand than they
are now. So it came as a shock to the AMC leadership several years
ago when a normally routine application to renew the hut permits
for another 30 years met with fierce and well-organized opposition
from White Mountains residents. ``They called us a bunch of tree
huggers from Boston'' says Huntington. ``It was a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the anger directed at the club was in reaction to the
AMC's intervention in the permit-renewal process of several paper
company dams on the Androscoggin River. Restricting dam use, it was
claimed, would result in a serious loss of jobs in an area already
suffering high unemployment. The AMC was also accused of noise
pollution from frequent helicopter flights to bring supplies to the
huts, of overcharging to stay in them, and of using its educational
programs to influence young people on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the club withdrew from the Androscoggin dam permit
dispute. It also agreed to reduce the number of helicopter flights
into the mountains and to have its educational materials reviewed.
``We have to be more sensitive to the economic concerns of northern
communities,'' admits Falender. ``That's something we haven't been
very good about in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-service fees for the huts, up to $62 a night (including two
full meals) for non-member adults and $39 for their children, were
not reduced. However, the age limit for a child was raised from 12
to 15, and the club has made one high hut, Carter Notch, a
self-service facility where guests cook their own food and pay a
maximum of $16 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The huts generate a good deal of money, Falender acknowledges,
but he says it's still not enough to cover the cost of operating
them. ``We estimate that for every dollar taken in the club spends
close to $1.50,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service recently recommended renewing the hut
permits. The recommendation is subject to review but is expected to
be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dam-permit issue, Falender says, the AMC will
continue to push for worthy conservation causes _ such as
protection of the Northeast's 26 million acres of forest. ``Our
membership has made it clear,'' he says, ``that's what they want
their club to do.''

OUR MOTHERS, OURSELVES, GOOD AND BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend had her nose surgically reshaped because it reminded
her of her mother. Every time she looked in the mirror, there was
her mother's nose.
</P>
<P>
   My friend had a particularly difficult relationship with her
late mother, so her decision to remake her nose is understandable.
She's spent years trying to undo the damage her mother did, trying
to forgive her. The nose change is a symbol of how far she's come,
and how far she's prepared to go not to become her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you get along with your mother you can fear turning into
her. Sometimes I catch myself behaving like my mother, doing
something that drives me crazy when she does it, and drives me even
crazier when I do it. I find myself saying: Oh no, I'm turning into
my mother.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this fear is a dread of aging, an unwilligness to accept
the inevitable. My mother is old, I'm getting older, and as I age
I'm becoming more like her. As the man says in that clever ad about
negative body image: I have my mother's thighs, I have to learn to
accept it. But I can't accept it. I have to fight it, even though I
know it's a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with my thighs is easy compared to trying to change some
of the habits and quirks I seem to have inherited from her. It
occurs to me that one reason I fear turning into my mother is that
I dwell too much on the things I don't like about her. Maybe if I
try to think more about her positive qualities I'll want to become
more like her.
</P>
<P>
   My mother has a lively mind and a good sense of humor. She's
generous. She's resilient. She has a passion for certain things
that I envy. Now that she's in her 80s much of that passion
revolves around playing the lottery, but if that's what she wants
to do, who am I to say she shouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   I have been reading Anne Lamott's new book, ``Traveling Mercies:
Some Thoughts on Faith.'' She has a wonderfully frank chapter about
her relationship with her mother. She's torn between loving her
mother and being frustrated and annoyed that she's become old and
needy.
</P>
<P>
   LaMott's mother is a strong woman. She was a lawyer at a time
when few women were admitted to law school. She was divorced. She
raised two children. Now she's old. LaMott admits she's having a
difficult time accepting the change in her mother, the new
docility, ``the need of an elderly woman for people to see that she
is a very good girl.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMott writes, ``She used to wear a mask of makeup, so she
didn't always seem as vulnererable as she does now. The makeup
seemed to hold her together somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Now her mother always seems to have lipstick on her teeth. This
irritates LaMott because, she writes, ``It tells the whole world, I
tried, I missed, I have no idea it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   I can undertand how this might drive LaMott crazy, but viewed in
another way, that lipstick, however misapplied, is a sign that her
mother is still strong, that she hasn't given up on life.
</P>
<P>
   For years I tried to change things about my mother. I finally
came to realize that no one can change anyone else. My mother is a
separate person with her own ways, her own dreams. I can't make her
happy by trying to change her. I never could. I have to honor her
individuality. I'm the one who has to change.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about all this makes me happy I don't have an
ungrateful daughter like me telling me how to run my life,
browbeating me to exercise more, dress differently, clean the
house, eat this, don't eat that, save my money, spend my money. I
have to try harder not to be that kind of a daughter, for my
mother's sake, and for my own.

FREE VOICE-MAIL SERVICE AIMED AT YOUNG ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For teenagers and young adults who want to be liberated from
their parents' phone lines, a California company is offering a free
voice-mail service this month that they think is one step toward
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The service is called EchoBuzz, and it requires users to listen
to three to 10 seconds of advertising before using the voice-mail
program. The service is being aggressively marketed in the Los
Angeles area for now, but anyone in the country of any age can sign
up and receive an activated password for use this month.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Ung, chief executive officer of Blue Diamond Software,
which provides the EchoBuzz service, said the user dials a
toll-free 800 phone number, then enters a membership number and
password. After hearing the ads, the user can send and retrieve
messages. Anyone can deliver a message to a member, as long as the
user has the 800 number and the receiver's membership number.
</P>
<P>
   To sign up, users fill out a brief questionnaire at the
company's Web site (http://www.echobuzz.com). The company promises
confidentiality with the information it obtains, which includes the
member's name, address, gender, age, and e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Although anyone can sign up, company officials acknowledge their
marketing and advertising is geared to the 15- to 19-year-old crowd
with a growing need for independence from their parents. The Web
page is tailored to teens, and after signing up they get a thank
you e-mail with a note emphasizing their ability to have a more
independent life with this service.
</P>
<P>
   ``EchoBuzz is ideal for teens that want to stay connected and
maintain their privacy without having their own phone lines,'' Ung
said. ``The service also benefits parents who get tired of taking
telephone messages for their busy, hard-to-reach teenagers.''
</P>
<P>
   A touch-tone phone is not needed for this service. EchoBuzz has
speech-recognition technology that allows the service to be used
hands-free.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said different regions of the country will be
activated at different times. If a particular region does not have
enough subscribers, there might be a delay in the start-up date.
All parts of the country are expected to be activated by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   EchoBuzz members will be able to send, retrieve, forward, save,
and reply to messages, as well as set up a group distribution list.
For example, if soccer practice is rescheduled, one message can be
broadcast to the entire soccer team distribution list as long as
everyone on the team is a member.
</P>
<P>
   The voice-mail service has some similarities to a program
unveiled three months ago by a Maryland company, BroadPoint
Communications. It offers free long-distance phone calls for anyone
willing to listen to advertisements first. BroadPoint's Freeway
service can be used after signing up through its Web site at
http://www.broadpoint.com.
</P>
<P>
   BroadPoint, which is unrelated to the EchoBuzz voice-mail
venture, has more than 80 advertisers, including Blockbuster,
Rolex, and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Ung said he could not disclose what advertisers are part of his
free voice-mail service, but he said they include well-known
soft-drink, fast-food, music, and entertainment companies. The
advertisements offered will be tailored to gender and age group.
</P>
<P>
   Said spokeswoman Kimberly Goolsby, ``A guy won't get a feminine
hygiene ad.''

   Potential snags with offer

</P>
<P>
   We've gotten several complaints about pantyhose promotions that
promise a free sample, but then end up billing you for extra pairs
you never wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This year we got a postcard offering us a free pair of Silkies
pantyhose in the color and size of our choice. The words ``Free
Sample'' are featured prominently on the postcard. Only on the back
does the fine print read that, after sending you a free sample, the
company will automatically send you shipments of four pairs every
month for $3.58 a pair, plus shipping and handling. They will bill
you for all of these monthly shipments, unless you write them and
tell them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they also mention that you can return any pantyhose
you don't like, but keep in mind that you'll pay for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   When we called the Hoisery Corp. of Philadelphia asking about
their Silkies promotion, they responded by faxing us a copy of
their ``offer terms'' that say you can cancel at any time. Their
promotion is probably legal, because they do disclose in the
original postcard that you are entering into a potential long-term
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is many consumers don't realize this until they are
left with many unwanted pantyhose. This kind of ``free offer'' with
strings attached is common in the magazine and CD promotional world
as well. If you want a truly free pair of pantyhose, you should
send a ``cancel order'' postcard as soon as you get the free pair.
</P>
<P>
   In testing their no-obligation promise, we accepted a free pair
of Silkies in January. When it arrived, we instantly sent a
postcard canceling future shipments. We haven't heard from them
since.

DIRECTOR SAM WEISMAN PAYS ATTENTION TO DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Director Sam Weisman looks like a poker player
holding a pat hand. He's got a pair of aces _ Steve Martin and
Goldie Hawn _ with a John Cleese kicker in ``The Out-of-Towners,''
a reinterpretation of Arthur Hiller's odd 1970 movie that starred
Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. Weisman, who took over the troubled
``George of the Jungle'' for Disney and transformed it into a hit,
has taken over the reins of this production. Paramount is hoping to
strike the same comedy gold as Disney. Weisman's smiling. Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   It's last April in Manhattan, and the production has
commandeered the penultimate floor in a skyscraper located in the
financial district in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Hawn portray a couple from Ohio whose son has just
left for college. On top of that, and unbeknownst to her, he has
just lost his job at a local advertising agency. In the scene
they're shooting today, Martin's arriving for a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   While Weisman hunches over a monitor, Martin, dressed in a dull
gray suit, stands off to the side, alone, with his arms folded
across his chest. He looks a bit like a monk on the verge of an
anxiety attack. Hawn is having her hair fluffed by an assistant
while another brushes makeup across her forehead. She's smiling.
Without giving too much away, the scene involves a reluctant Martin
being coaxed out of the elevator by a sympathetic Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   Cinematographer John Bailey, who started out as a cameraman on
Terrence Malick's ``Days of Heaven'' (1978) and recently was the
director of photography on the Oscar-winning ``As Good As It
Gets,'' discusses the lighting problems presented by the
floor-to-ceiling windows. Bailey wants the windows' eagle's-nest
view of lower Manhattan, but he needs to blend the light so the
background doesn't wash out the foregroud. Because, in this case
particularly, Martin and Hawn _ the foreground _ are carrying the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman, with script supervisor Joanie Blum on one side and
screenwriter Marc Lawrence on the other, observes the set through a
video monitor that feeds him the same image gathered by the 35mm
cameras. That image is all that concerns him because that's what
eventually will appear on the screen. Everything else is
irrelevant. He also knows that he's the movie's first audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about Sam is that he doesn't mind breaking the
cardinal rule of directing,'' says John Cleese, who plays a crucial
supporting role as a cross-dressing New York hotel proprietor. ``He
laughs in the middle of takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese, who also played a key role in ``George of the Jungle,''
has high hopes for the film. ``I think it's a very funny movie in a
classic tradition. And Steve and Goldie are marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as electricians snake thick cables along the floor
and the overhead lights begin to raise the temperature in the
Continental Club setting, Martin lurks on the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence tells Weisman that he saw a great a cappella group
performing on the street and he's invited them to come back later
in the afternoon for an audition. Weisman, who sees the film as a
romantic valentine to New York, is looking for upbeat, authentic
music to reinforce the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ready?'' asks Weisman of Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another minute,'' says Bailey, as he carefully measures the
light with a meter that seems glued to his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn stands at attention, afraid to move for fear that she'll
disturb the work of the makeup staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' says Bailey. ``Ready. Do you want to get a
run-through?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Weisman, as he readjusts his headset. ``Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin gingerly walks to his position inside the elevator. The
doors close. But not all the way. That 1/2-inch slit won't do.
</P>
<P>
   It takes two technicians a few minutes to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing on the closing of the doors is important,'' says
Weisman, ``because it punctuates a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawn stands in front of the elevator. The doors open.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Martin is animated. His face grimaces in that chronic
comic way and his body comes alive. It's as if someone plugged him
in. He externalizes the inner anxiety of the job interview by
turning his legs into a rubbery mess and resists Hawn's pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Henry, it's OK,'' says Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   Martin shrivels up.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was that?'' asks Weisman of Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go again,'' replies Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is repeated several more times until everyone seems
satisfied. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Editing in Massachusetts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, in an editing room located a few doors from
the Allston Car Wash in Boston, Weisman is sitting with editor Kent
Beyda, staring at the sequence on a monitor. Beyda, using Avid
Technology's film composer, on which all the takes are computerized
and editing is done digitally, is searching for one particular take
that Weisman recalls.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's Weisman doing editing one of Paramount's major
releases in a rehabbed garage?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I live here,'' he says. ``And I'm going to finish the
edit on the Cape, where I'll be with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when his son, Daniel, 16, was admitted to Milton
Academy, the family wanted to be close so they moved from Beverly
Hills to Brookline, Mass. His daughter, Meg, 12, attends the Park
School, and his wife, actress Constance McCashin of ``Knots
Landing'' fame, is working toward her master's degree in social
work at Simmons College. They like it here.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman concentrates on the screen like a chess master planning
his next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one where the timing on the door is perfect,'' says
Weisman, who explains that the difference between a laugh and a dud
is sometimes just a fraction of a second. ``You have to cut at
precisely the right place or the joke is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see that the shoot hasn't been easy for Weisman. He
took the troubled film over when it was still in pre-production and
the previous director left. It's similar to what occurred on
``George of the Jungle.'' And Weisman is also itching to do some
films that he generates himself _ particularly one involving the
Cape Cod Baseball League.
</P>
<P>
   Beyda finds the take. On the monitor, Martin reluctantly steps
out of the elevator and the door shuts decisively behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one,'' says Weisman. He looks pleased. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A screening in Watch City &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the evening after the Monday night premiere in
Hollywood, Weisman invited some of his friends, colleagues, and
students to a private screening of ``The Out-of-Towners'' at the
Embassy Cinema in Waltham. Later, at the nearby Watch City Brewery,
they all helped him celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to see everyone here and let them know what I
do,'' says Weisman, who's teaching a class on acting this semester
at his alma mater, Brandeis University, class of 1973. He looks
happy, even though the critics' verdicts would not be known until
after the film's nationwide release three days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it goes,'' says Weisman. ``I think Steve and
Goldie and John did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns his attention to his friends and neighbors, an
out-of-towner who's found his town.

CANADIAN DEBORAH COX MAKES AN UNLIKELY R&AMP;B STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two pairs of Gucci shoes are on a table next to
Deborah Cox, as she sits in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite, awaiting
a dinner party. The plush suite and the expensive shoes signal that
Cox may be on her way to diva status, but that image evaporates
once this Toronto-bred singer _ the first Canadian R &AMP; B artist
ever to reach stardom _ begins to reveal her true personality.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, 25, has refined tastes _ and shares the same record label
(Arista Records) as diva queen Whitney Houston _ but please don't
use the D word around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not,'' Cox says firmly, but not rudely, to the diva
question. ``I'm really a settled, down-to-earth person. I treat
people the way I like to be treated, and that's just with respect.
I've always been very down-to-earth and not fazed by the music
business, or by what other people do. I just walk my own path.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk her own path?
</P>
<P>
   A better word is ``running,'' for that's been the pace of Cox's
career in the last several months. She just made history with the
longest-running No. 1 R &AMP; B hit of all time _ 14 weeks at the top
with ``Nobody's Supposed to Be Here,'' an impassioned, gospel-edged
tune about a rejuvenated romance. The song also hit No. 2 on the
pop charts _ and was kept from No. 1 only by the R. Kelly/Celine
Dion duet during Christmas, ``I'm Your Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Celine, coincidentally, have played pivotal roles in
her life. Kelly is taking her out as his opening act on a tour that
stops at the FleetCenter May 7, and Dion once gave Cox a job as her
backup singer.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, if you can't tell by now, is going places. She has a
lustrous presence _ and a talent that makes her second and current
album, ``One Wish,'' one of the most spectacular examples of pop/R
&AMP; B singing this side of Houston and Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deborah is a natural,'' says Arista president Clive Davis, who
has advised numerous hit singers in his tenure. ``She's got soul,
beauty, and a roaring, powerful voice. The time for her is right
now, and she is breaking as America's newest star.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has a vested commercial interest in Cox, but he's also
taking an abiding personal interest. ``He just wants me to have the
best,'' says Cox. ``It's kind of like a parent _ and Clive has
really been that for me. A lot of times I'll see myself a certain
way, but Clive, because he's been in the business for so long and
has groomed superstars, knows the right steps to take. So I take a
back seat and just sit back and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's real parents were both Guyanese. Her mother remarried and
her stepdad was Canadian. Cox grew up in the suburban town of
Scarborough and attended the Claude Watson School for the Arts in
Toronto. But her vocal influences are mostly non-Canadian: ``Gladys
Knight, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Bob Marley, and Aretha
Franklin,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An R &AMP; B rarity
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Cox was surrounded by many forms of music, but had
to hunt to find R &AMP; B. ``In Toronto, I didn't hear a lot of R &AMP;
B,'' she adds. ``There aren't any R &AMP; B stations in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, she learned from her parents' records.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first dose of black music. I heard jazz, reggae,
and R &AMP; B from my parents' records,'' she says. ``I also went to a
Catholic primary school and during those years from grade two to
grade eight, I did talent shows and joined local bands. I started
signing with bands when I was 12 and singing commercial jingles
when I was 14. That gave me a lot of experience learning about the
studio and about the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of bumps and bruises along the way,'' she
adds. ``When I was 15, I went to a performing-arts high school. It
was during that time that I met a songwriter/producer, Lascelles
Stephens, and the two of us wrote songs and put our ideas on tape
and sent them to different record companies. Then in 1993, I got
the attention of Clive Davis. . . . I moved to LA in 1994 and put
out my first album in 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   To make it from Canada, and especially as an R &AMP; B singer, Cox
has been up against steep odds, but she never doubted herself. When
she spoke recently at a Grammy in the Schools seminar before a
bunch of high school students, she had some straight-from-the-gut
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much told them that to be in this business, you've
got to have heart. You've got to love to do it because there's
going to be a lot of hard work where you're not going to get paid.
And if you're in it for the money, then get out of the business.
Don't even think about being involved. You've got to educate
yourself. And you've got to be able to be flexible if you want to
be an artist, because not every time is your vision what the record
company's vision is. So I've learned to compromise and I've learned
to work with the record company in that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gospel influence
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also learned to appreciate gospel music, which has
influenced her dramatic, push-the-boundary voice. ``Like I said, in
Toronto the culture is different, so I didn't grow up singing in
Baptist churches. But I did audition for a play called `Mom, I Want
to Sing,' which was a gospel-based play. And that's where I started
to study a lot of different (gospel) singers. I studied Yolanda
Adams _ she's an incredible vocalist _ and BeBe and CeCe Winans.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox co-writes half of her material _ she and Stephens co-wrote
the optimistic ``I Won't Give Up'' and ``Love Is on the Way'' on
her recent CD _ but she also used outside contributions from
heavyweight tunesmiths such as Diane Warren and Montel Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The latter co-wrote the record-setting ``Nobody's Supposed to Be
Here.'' As Cox says, ``We did a dance remix of it, and it has spent
10 weeks at No. 2 on Hot 100 singles charts. So the song, as urban
as it originally sounded, the dance version has taken it to a whole
other level and a whole other audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences had better get used to that, because Cox plans to
stick around awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about longevity,'' Cox says. ``I want to be an artist
who, 10 years from now, won't be a has-been. And part of that
longevity is singing really great songs. That's always been our
main goal and focus. Every album we put together, it's about the
song. And that's what's going to give you the longevity.''

GROWING NUMBERS IN EUROPE BELIEVE ENEMY IS AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND TOULA VLAHOU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A new menace is stalking Europe, threatening to plunge
the entire continent into a devastating war. Its leaders espouse
the geopolitical ideas of Nazism and the tactics of Hitler. And for
damning proof of its existence, all one need do is look at what is
happening in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   What is the name of this evil? If you guessed ``ethnic
cleansing,'' guess again. Try ``America.''
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the increasingly popular view shared by
people in a wide swath of the planet stretching from Russia's
Pacific coast to the Balkans, where NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia have set off a virulent anti-American backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The US-led alliance portrays its airstrikes as an effort to
prevent Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from carrying out a
policy of repression and ethnic cleansing, or forced expulsion, of
Albanians from the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But at Friday's antiwar concert attended by some 60,000 people
in Salonica, Greece, the United States was the bad guy: President
Clinton was compared in posters to Hitler; NATO was spelled out as
``Nazi American Terrorist Organization''; and posters warned of ``a
new Vietnam'' in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   These were the same slogans at protests in Moscow last week,
where a masked gunman tried to fire a rocket at the US Embassy and
where an Alexander the Great impersonator fired an arrow at the
American ambassador's residence. The same sentiments were evident
in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, on Cyprus, and in
Slovakia, where American embassies have been pelted with eggs,
paint, and debris in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest explanation for the anti-US mood in these places is
that many people in these countries sympathize with the Serbs
because they share the Christian Orthodox faith. That certainly
plays a role.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger issue is that what the West perceives as ``pax
Americana,'' a time of peace and prosperity guaranteed by a
responsible American superpower intent on spreading the wealth,
people in parts of Eastern Europe seem to view as an effort at US
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the Balkans fought against the Nazis. Now we have to
face an attack by the Americans,'' said Costantis Tripos, 42, a
farmer who cultivates American sweet corn, during an all-night
candlelight vigil in front of the American embassy in central
Athens. ``The first American government was fighting for freedom.
Now the Americans aren't fighting for freedom anymore. They try to
dominate the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this feeling is strongest where the bombs are falling
in Belgrade. There, Serbs who waved American and European Union
flags during pro-democracy protests against President Slobodan
Milosevic two years ago are now singing patriotic Serb songs,
waving Serbia's tricolor, and _ driving home the sense of betrayal
_ trashing the Belgrade McDonald's and the American embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Serbia, the countries where the protests have been
strongest are important to America in different ways. Greece, a
NATO member, provides vital logistical support to the allied
operations; equipment and supplies pass through Salonica, and in
the event of a ground assault, so would NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, a candidate to join NATO, provides the alliance's
troops with a foothold close to the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia, which this decade has enjoyed an unprecedented
partnership with NATO after a 50-year standoff, has been the West's
most important post-Cold-War success story until the recent chill
in relations.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, even the most liberal media refer to ``the NATO
aggression,'' and even the most staid officials, such as Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, use Cold-War-style hyperbole to denounce the
alliance's ``barbarism.'' The negative feeling has spread
throughout the country: A Siberian movie theater refuses to show
American movies and replaces them with Yugoslav ones; Mormon
missionaries from the United States are banned from the Pacific
port of Vladivostok; a St. Petersburg institute director orders
four visiting US professors off his premises.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, many Russians embraced
the West, and America in particular. But disillusionment about
America has been growing in Russia as the country's economic crisis
deepens despite US political and financial support for the
Kremlin's so-called market reforms. Although Russia's corrupt
leadership and endless political battles are probably more
responsible for the country's problems than anything the United
States did, the perception here is that America failed Russia.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they expected an anti-American backlash
in Russia, but they may not have expected it to run so deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the United States was going to teach us to be a
part of the civilized world, and help us become a wealthy
democracy,'' said Vladimir Levin, a Moscow businessman. ``But all
America wanted was for us to be weak and dependent, so it could
sell us its cheap goods and exploit our resources. And now we have
America bombing Yugoslavia as a result, and we have to wonder if
they will bomb us next. They would have never done that if we still
were the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, tensions have been growing since last Sunday's
riot outside the US Embassy. The growing Slav backlash there is
directed at the large influx of ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo,
and threatens to spread the hostilities _ another problem NATO and
the United States may not have considered thoroughly enough before
deciding to station troops there.
</P>
<P>
   And when the US ambassador to Athens, Nicholas Burns, held
several meetings with Greek Foreign Ministry officials asking for
support for the NATO campaign, it caused a furor in the country's
parliament, where the American envoy's diplomacy was denounced as
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Burns comes and goes from the ministries like they were
his home,'' said Communist Party deputy Dimitris Costopoulos during
a heated exchange in parliament this past week.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the politicians who are questioning the
motives behind NATO's military attack. ``One the eve of the 21st
century, I'm distressed that we can't find another solution to the
problem,'' said Tallye Maroulis of Tampa, who now lives in Greece.
``I believe in America, and I am heartbroken that my country would
behave in such a way.''

PERSISTENCE AND PRUDENT FORCE CAN WORK IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A solid line connects several fresh dots on the
smoldering Balkan landscape, including:
</P>
<P>
   --The apparent ``emptying'' of Kosovo's capital of Pristina and
other population centers of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   --The massing of huge numbers of refugees on the borders of
Macedonia and Albania, without food and shelter, due to the
inability of those countries to transport them further or otherwise
care for them.
</P>
<P>
   --The periodic shelling by Serb forces of Albanian territory.
</P>
<P>
   --The rapidly increasing pressure from Belgrade on the
autonomous (and reform-minded) province of Montenegro, including
the replacement of its occupying army command with at least eight
senior officers known to be stooges of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That solid line goes by the name of aggression. For years, Serb
violence and atrocities in Kosovo have been assumed prospectively
to be doubly awful _ not only for the immense suffering of the
Kosovars it would produce, but also for the spread of the disease
further into the volatile region that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as NATO's air campaign steadily if belatedly escalates, it
should be apparent how proper those assumptions were and why the
military response is imperative, for both moral and regional
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This is a punch that was telegraphed not merely in the context
of the past year's bestiality by Milosevic, but when his criminal
behavior began in earnest years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the West froze in the face of the initial wave
of mass murder in Croatia and Bosnia, President Bush drew the line
at Kosovo during his final month in office. In a letter to
Belgrade, he warned that violent suppression of Kosovo would
produce US air attacks on Serb forces doing the dirty work and on
Serbia itself. That was in December of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was significant. Milosevic had just been reelected in
a largely rigged procedure, defeating American businessman Milan
Panic, who was then serving as the Yugoslav premier but was ousted
shortly thereafter. The handwriting was on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acted for a reason as valid today as then, except now we
can see it with our own eyes: Kosovo is the territory through which
chaos will spread south and west with catastrophic human and
security consequences; it cannot be isolated by isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   And the following year _ even as he began a three-year tussle
with allies and public opinion over the horror in Bosnia _
President Clinton reaffirmed the Bush pledge and helped arrange
through the United Nations for trip-wire troops to be placed in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   At the time and since then, Clinton has been both supported in
his response to Milosevic's aggression and vigorously urged to do
more by several prominent Republicans, even in the face of their
party's increasing isolationism. Bob Dole is the best-known, but I
recently ran across a 6-year-old essay by Senator Orrin Hatch in
which he has urged that forces also be pre-positioned in Kosovo.
His description of the Milosevic way is as chillingly accurate now
as it was then:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight one war at a time. Destabilize neighbors by arming
nationalists among its Serbian minority. Back those guerrillas with
supplies and the forces of the former Yugoslav army and air force.
Exploit peace talks as a cover for ethnic cleansing and to ward off
any Western military response. Consent to a peace plan in order to
consolidate gains once key Serbian objectives have been achieved.
Having done this, Serbs move to the next target.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is not Kosovo, but the fact since then has been that
persistence and the prudent use of force have made an enormous
difference. And will in the present circumstances. The NATO
campaign against Milosevic has barely begun. It is escalating daily
and spreading throughout Kosovo. Currently, the only real limits
are weather, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of hindsight, it's clear from military and policy
officials that there were hopes that the Serbs might take a
symbolic airstrike or two and use them as political cover to
consent to last month's Rambouillet agreement. Those hopes
influenced the initial character of the strikes. It's also clear
that Clinton had tons of advance warning that Milosevic would not
stop his murderous campaign and might accelerate its pace, and that
initially airstrikes could not stop the horror on the ground. That
did not prevent unanimity here and within NATO to begin the
military response.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's miscalculation has been much more severe, namely
that NATO's and America's will to persevere could be broken. The
reverse is occurring, and Milosevic can no longer even count on a
continued taboo against the use of ground troops in combat against
him.
</P>
<P>
   For those who were listening carefully, Clinton said last Friday
only that there is a ``good possibility'' our objective can be met
with air power alone. And he pointedly noted that the air campaign
would be necessary either on its own or as prelude to the insertion
of troops.
</P>
<P>
   As Milosevic knows by now, the scheduled rotation of one of the
First Infantry Division's brigades from Germany to Kuwait was
halted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Democracies can be maddeningly slow to act, but it should be
increasingly clear that the response to the worst aggression in
Europe since the Nazis is not going to be perfunctory _ fittingly.

BOMBS UNIFY AN ETHNIC GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUCE, Yugoslavia _ The slogan painted on a boulder outside this
highland village reads ``Unity Saves Serbs,'' but Svedlana
Pavecevic, a 32-year-old lawyer, is dismayed by the bellicose
nationalism that is rallying so many Serbs in the face of Western
air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs have become devils to the world,'' she said. ``When this
is all over, we will have to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavecevic, five months pregnant, fled to her sister's home here
from Belgrade last week as NATO bomb attacks intensified and she
became terrified for the life growing in her womb. ``We could feel
the blasts on our backs, and we wondered, `How could it come to
this in the Europe of 1999?' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Serbs, especially the young and educated, she despises
the regime of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, whom she regards
as a thug and dictator.
</P>
<P>
   She also believes that the NATO attacks are at least as morally
repugnant as any violence inflicted on Albanians in Kosovo. ``A
wrong done in Kosovo does not make right a bomb on a Yugoslav city
where also innocent people are living,'' she said. ``My baby will
be born into a war because of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added: ``In the depths of night, a few Serbs have
to wonder, `What is bringing the world's fury down upon us? Will
the bad name given Serbs follow us for years and years, even
centuries?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The first yellow forsythia are blooming in Kuce, and sheep
browse peacefully on the steep rock-strewn slopes. This Montenegrin
Serb enclave seems a world away from the chaos enveloping
Yugoslavia. No smart missiles are zeroing in on the sturdy stone
houses or the village's sole cafe. No long columns of desperate
refugees are arriving to prick the local conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's anger at Yugoslavia is uppermost in the minds of
every one of Kuce's few hundred inhabitants. Scratch any Serb these
days, and you will find an ouraged patriot quick to denounce the
airstrikes. Beneath the bluster and defiance, however, you will
find some Serbs deeply anguished by their new status as
international pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much evil blood pulses through the veins of the Balkans,''
said Radoca Milic, 64. ''Some of it is our own, although nobody
wants to admit this. We are so quick to cry out against the wrongs
done to us, and so blind to the evil we do.''
</P>
<P>
   In that, many Serbs and their Montenegrin cousins seem
frighteningly similar to the ``good Germans'' of the Hitler era,
almost willfully ignorant of the horrors being perpetuated in their
name.
</P>
<P>
   Not so many miles from here, terrorized ethnic Albanians are
hemorrhaging from Kosovo province, driven from their homes by
paramilitary goons operating under the banner of Serb nationalism,
and with the blessings of the Milosevic government in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few Serbs even concede a tragedy is unfurling in
their beloved homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers are crying, any human ear can hear them,'' said Milic.
``We have to admit that we have brought the world down on us
because we have too often turned our eyes away.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a distinctly minority view, one increasingly seen as
almost subversive in Yugoslavia as even Milosevic-hating liberals
feel a patriotic duty to close ranks against the United States and
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I cannot accept that Serbs are committing
atrocities in Kosovo,'' said Nenad Jegdic, an electrical engineer
who in the past has joined protests against Milosevic, but who now
feels all Yugoslavs have no choice but to support the government.
``We are mostly decent, hard-working people who wish no one any
harm. How does Mr. Clinton expect to solve a problem by blowing up
bridges and buildings in Belgrade? It is the Americans who are war
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   During the early days of the allied air campaign, Montenegro TV
broadcast CNN images of refugees streaming from their ruined cities
in Kosovo. But the republic has since bowed to pressure from
Belgrade to censor Western news accounts. Serbs in the rest of
Yugoslavia have been exposed to nothing but Belgrade's efficent
propaganda machine for years.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most pro-Western Serbs scoff at the suggestion that
massive atrocities are occurring in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it is impossible,'' said farmer Sretan Bulatocic, 69.
``Serbs do not kill people except in self-defense. Maybe some bad
Serb has done some bad things, just like some bad Albanians have
done some bad things. But how can you label our whole society? To
call us guilty as a people is crazy and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still ruins in this village of houses destroyed by
German troops in World War II in retaliation for attacks by Serb
resistance fighters, who were among the most ferocious anti-Nazis
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was shot dead by Germans when I was 4,'' said
Rudamila Bulatovic, Sreten's wife. ``Now we wonder whether we will
be shot dead by Americans. It is the fate of Serbs to be
misunderstood.''

TAKING A REVEALING LOOK AT BREAST CANCER

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAUDIA STERNBACH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   APTOS, Calif. _ It's not that it's an unattractive photograph.
Not at all. It's actually quite beautiful. Stark. In black and
white, the image is somber, yet hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Under other circumstances I would appreciate its artistic form
and admire the talent of the photographer. I wouldn't be the least
bit uncomfortable gazing on the image of the totally naked breast.
I think the woman who posed, who stood bravely in front of the
camera, her breast lighted by the sun, should be applauded. And
envied.
</P>
<P>
   This looks like a picture at a gallery exhibit. Or one from a
book on nudes. But the first time I saw it was when I opened my
mail. A package had arrived from my publisher. This was to be my
book cover.
</P>
<P>
   I liked how my name looked on the cover. Spelled correctly. Just
above the woman's underarm. I liked how the title, ``Now Breathe,''
was laid out in two different type fonts.
</P>
<P>
   But the naked breast. The sunlit nipple. Oh my.
</P>
<P>
   Kira, my 13-year-old daughter, panicked first. ``What if people
think it's you?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't thought of that. Taking a second look at the image, I
realized that wouldn't be so bad. Whoever had posed was much better
built than I. But that didn't cut it with Kira. Kids at school
might see the book. They might think I had posed. It could ruin her
life. (At 13 it is sometimes hard to see the whole picture.
Difficult to get a glimpse of the whole world when your vision is
obstructed by the capital letters, ME, ME, ME.) When Michael came
home I showed the cover to him. ``Wow'' was his response. ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good wow, or bad wow?'' I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just `Wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to imagine this book sitting on my parents' coffee
table, next to the candy dish full of M&AMP;M's. I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   I pictured my father-in-law showing it off to his poker buddies.
</P>
<P>
   That was really a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Becky, when she saw it, mentioned the South. And the
Bible Belt. Perhaps this cover wasn't quite lady-like enough for
that neck of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned the publishers to express my concerns. They are lovely
people. They want the book to be successful. They love the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Love the cover. They also own the book. They were kind but firm
_ in a lovely way.
</P>
<P>
   I let a couple of days go by. I left the picture on my desk and
every now and then would take a peek. It is a book about having
breast cancer, so putting a breast on the cover made sense. But I
had pictured something different. Flowers maybe. Or Half Dome in
Yosemite. The roller coaster down at the boardwalk. (There's a good
metaphor.) I asked my well-published friend Anne how often she has
gotten to choose her cover art. Never, she told me. She offered to
coordinate a benefit for me. A ``buy-back-the-book'' benefit. She
would gather some friends and they would all do readings. They
would sell tickets. A fine plan. If I wanted to buy back the book.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Becky said she thought it might be a good cover
design. It made a statement. And my friend Christy told me she
couldn't think of anything more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   I passed by my desk and looked at the photo again. I was
starting to warm to it.
</P>
<P>
   A few days went by and Kira asked me what I was going to do
about the cover. I asked her how she felt about it. Did it still
bother her? Apparently, the shock had worn off. She shrugged her
shoulders. ``Whatever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   High praise.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who she is _ this woman in the photograph. But I
have begun to feel as though I somehow owe it to her to let her
live on the cover of this book. She was brave to pose for the
camera. She is quite a beauty and the picture of health.
</P>
<P>
   For years we kept cancer in the closet. We only whispered the
word behind closed doors. We have come a long way. So what better
image for a book about breast cancer? What could be more honest?
More truthful? And after being diagnosed with cancer, there is no
time for anything but the truth.

CHRIS O'DONNELL ISN'T ROBIN ANY MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of Chris O'Donnell in a scene from
``Cookie's Fortune.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chris O'Donnell won't be slipping into his Robin tights again
anytime soon. And, truth to tell, that's not a bad thing.
 &HT;    ``Ever since my wife found out we were going to have a baby,
it's been `Goodbye, healthy food!' and `I want steak, I want
potatoes,''' he says, patting a stomach which does indeed display a
slight paunch. ``The other night, I said, `Shoot, I'm the one who's
getting fat here.'
 &HT;    ``I'm not sure those tights from my superhero days would fit
anymore.''
 &HT;    O'Donnell breaks into a laugh, disrupting breakfast on a cool
spring morning at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. Yes, he can joke
about ``Batman and Robin'' (1997), the much-hyped turkey that _ at
least according to rumor _ almost cost him his career.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get a job,'' O'Donnell moans, emitting a fake sob,
and then laughs again.
 &HT;    Actually, he says, his two-year hiatus from the screen was
intentional. Largely it was to give him time to get married and
adjust to life as half of a couple, but it also involved getting
away from Hollywood for awhile and, perhaps, giving audiences a
break as well.
 &HT;    ``You also get to the point where I think people get sick of
seeing your face onscreen,'' O'Donnell says. ``I knew it was time
to disappear for a little while.''
 &HT;    Now he's back, with a full slate of projects including, most
notably, Robert Altman's ``Cookie's Fortune,'' opening April 9 in
New York and subsequently around the country, and ``The Bachelor,''
a romantic comedy that's due in September and represents his debut
as a producer.
 &HT;    It's been a while since O'Donnell was around, but he still comes
across as Hollywood's biggest boy scout. While their peers were
gilding the Tinseltown party circuit, he and his wife _ Caroline, a
kindergarten teacher _ were living the quiet life in Chicago. His
biggest extravagance was the reported purchase of a $1,000 bed from
this very hotel.
 &HT;    And, yes, teen-age girls are still flinging themselves at this
reluctant sex symbol and, yes, he still says he isn't interested.
 &HT;    ``To me, the relationship I have with my wife has so much more
value than just a fling here and there,'' he says with a shrug. ``I
guess it all comes down to what you believe in. My morals are part
religion and part the way I was brought up, which was with
values.''
 &HT;    That isn't to say that he can't turn up the heat onscreen.
``Cookie's Fortune'' casts him as Jason Brown, a dimwit Mississippi
cop in love with the town rebel (Liv Tyler). When her aunt Cookie
(Patricia Neal) is found dead, it's up to O'Donnell's character to
investigate what Cookie's nieces (Glenn Close and Julianne Moore)
insist is a murder.
 &HT;    Along the way O'Donnell has several steamy scenes with Tyler.
Steamy, at least, from an audience point of view.
 &HT;    ``It was funny,'' the actor says, ``because when we did our
first makeout scene, they said `Cut,' and I pulled back and looked
at Liv. She was just red everywhere on her face. I was like, `Good
God! What did I do to this girl?''
 &HT;    Actually, all he did was to forget to shave, not realizing that
Tyler has extremely sensitive skin.
 &HT;    O'Donnell sighs.
 &HT;    ``The crew was looking at me like, `You brute!'''
 &HT;    It was the chance to work with Altman that sold him on getting
back to work, O'Donnell adds.
 &HT;    ``It was kind of like a no-brainer,'' the actor says. ``Robert
Altman calls, and I was like, `OK, I'll do it.'
 &HT;    ``Then you say, `Oh, what's the role?'''
 &HT;    Despite box-office flops with ``In Love and War'' (1997) and
``The Chamber'' (1997), O'Donnell was still on Hollywood's hot list
when he virtually disappeared from sight.
 &HT;    Not everybody could turn down multimillion-dollar paychecks,
especially with a wife and family to think about. And indeed,
O'Donnell admits that he was tempted.
 &HT;    ``It was tough,'' he concedes. ``But you know what? I was
looking at my friends who were living a 9-to-5 life, and I envied
them. I wanted to come home in the afternoon, read the paper, eat
dinner and watch TV. I didn't want the craziness of Hollywood.''
 &HT;    It was a natural reaction from a young man who has been famous
ever since a spur-of-the-moment response to a Chicago newspaper
advertisement turned into a featured role in ``Men Don't Leave''
(1990) and made the Boston College business major a star.
 &HT;    ``Being famous so young is tough,'' the 29-year-old says. ``For
instance, I've been doing interviews since I was 18 years old. I've
been asked my life philosophy more times than I can count. I want
to scream, `I'm 18 years old, I haven't figured anything out!'
 &HT;    ``I'll read my old interviews and think, `Are you for real?'''
 &HT;    After ``Men Don't Leave'' (1990), O'Donnell found himself on a
fast train to stardom, appearing in such hits as ``Fried Green
Tomatoes'' (1991), ``School Ties'' (1992) and ``The Three
Musketeers'' (1993).
 &HT;    Along the way, however, he misplaced his privacy. A few years
ago he was in a fender-bender in Chicago, the actor recalls, and
the investigating officer wanted an autograph for his kid.
 &HT;    ``It's worse in L.A.,'' he adds. ``I got attacked at the Ivy,
coming out of lunch in the middle of the day. It was this group of
kids across the street with video cameras.
 &HT;    ``I started to think, there's videotapes all over the world of
me doing random dumb things and in bad free T-shirts,'' he says
with a rueful smile. ``Now I get up and think, `Do I want this
orange shirt preserved forever on someone's tape? What should I
wear for historical purposes?'''
 &HT;    Nowadays he's wearing two hats, as star and producer of ``The
Bachelor,'' a remake of Buster Keaton's 1925 silent-film classic
``Seven Chances'' that casts him as a man given 24 hours to get
married or lose his inheritance.
 &HT;    ``The best scene is when I'm running down the streets of San
Francisco being chased by 1,000 women in bridal gowns,'' O'Donnell
says. ``Depending on your perspective, that's either heaven or
hell. Since I'm married, I guess it's hellish.''
 &HT;    And no, if you were wondering, he wouldn't mind another chance
to play Robin, either.
 &HT;    ``I don't think they're going to do another `Batman' with me,''
he says. ``If they do another movie, they'll wait a couple of years
and then completely reinvent it with new actors.''
 &HT;    For the first time all morning, he sounds a little depressed.
 &HT;    ``I would do another Batman,'' he says. ``I enjoy doing them.
But it's not anything on a priority list.''
 &HT;    Topping that list is jetting east to start setting up a nursery
at his family's Chicago home, where he is to be found when he's not
at his new production office in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Oh, yes, and about that bed: Actually there were two of them,
and if they're a sign of Hollywood decadence, O'Donnell can live
with it.
 &HT;    ``I did buy two beds from the Four Seasons Hotel in Los
Angeles,'' he admits. ``One for our house in Chicago and the other
for our place in L.A. I had to buy the beds, because they were the
most comfortable ones I've ever slept in.''
 &HT;    And, yes, the total cost ran to $1,000 per bed.
 &HT;    ``Hey, I think a regular, nice, king-sized bed is $800,''
O'Donnell says defensively. ``It's not like I went nuts or
anything.''

 Includes a color slide of the singing group 'N Sync. 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He's a winner, but he isn't going to Disney World.
 &HT;    Justin Timberlake is actually in Orlando, Fla., for a couple of
days. But the Orlando native has better things to do than hang with
Mickey _ such as rehearsing with his band, the phenomenally popular
'N Sync.
 &HT;    ``So I'm really just in Orlando, not at home,'' says Timberlake,
who at 18 is the youngest of the five 'N Syncers.
 &HT;    The band works hard, and that work has been paying off. In
barely a year the group's two albums _ a self-titled debut album
and the ``Home For Christmas'' holiday album _ have sold more than
7 million copies, fueled by frothy hits such as ``I Want You
Back,'' ``Tearin' Up My Heart'' and ``God Must Have Spent a Little
More Time on You.''
 &HT;    That's made 'N Sync pop's hottest boy outfit of the moment,
eclipsing _ at least for now _ fellow Orlandoites the Backstreet
Boys and Hanson. Their only competition is provided by Britney
Spears, an old friend since her days co-starring with Timberlake
and 22-year-old bandmate Joshua ``J.C.'' Chasez on the Disney
Channel's ``The Mickey Mouse Club.''
 &HT;    ``It's become so flattering,'' says 27-year-old Chris
Kirkpatrick, 'N Sync's founder and oldest member _ as well as its
most recognizable, thanks to his colorful, braided hairdo.
 &HT;    ``We always have to keep each other in check,'' Kirkpatrick
says. ``We'll all go into one room or something and laugh and go
`Can you believe this is happening?' It's like a dream to us, just
to be walking in the airport or something and have someone say
`Hey! It's 'N Sync!'''
 &HT;    Not that the group's fans stop with shouts. Timberlake's
favorite fan memory is of one girl at an airport in Europe who
tried to get to the band by jumping onto a luggage-conveyor belt.
 &HT;    ``Of course she didn't make it through,'' he says with a laugh.
``Her disguise wasn't that good.''
 &HT;    But, he adds, the fans generally aren't that inventive.
 &HT;    ``They're usually grabbing at your clothes and ripping them off
and things like that,'' Timberlake says. ``I think the girls are
just _ they're real sweethearts, and it's just funny to see how
they try to get to you.''
 &HT;    Sometimes that's inopportune, however. Kirkpatrick recalls a
particular night in an Orlando bar, when he was chatting with a
young woman he had been dancing with. Six other girls spotted him
from across the club and came screaming over to where the couple
was standing.
 &HT;    ``They all started doing the `I Want You Back' dance, and then
they started going `Here's my phone number' and stuff like that,''
he says. ``And I'm going, `Oh, no ... '
 &HT;    ``That kind of blew it with that girl. She was like, `I'm going
to get a drink. I'll be right back.' And I never saw her again.''
 &HT;    Kirkpatrick isn't complaining, though. Stardom at this level was
only a dream when the Pittsburgh-area native moved to Orlando nine
years ago to live with his father and study music at a couple of
area colleges. He also worked at Universal Studios, where he met
Timberlake and future bandmate Joey Fatone, now 22.
 &HT;    While Timberlake and Fatone went the Disney route, Kirkpatrick
was forming his own bands. He even turned down an invitation to be
a Backstreet Boy after singing in a school choir with that group's
Howie Dorough.
 &HT;    ``He came in and said `We're having auditions for the Backstreet
Boys,''' Kirkpatrick recalls. ``I already had my own group, and my
heart was with them. I'm a very loyal person.''
 &HT;    That group eventually broke up, and in 1995 Kirkpatrick called
Timberlake and Fatone, who by then were free agents after the
cancellation of ``The Mickey Mouse Club,'' about his next project.
Timberlake brought Chasez with him, and 19-year-old bass singer
Lance ``Lantsen'' Bass was recommended by Timberlake's vocal coach.
 &HT;    The quintet, which takes its name from the last letter of the
first name or nickname of each band member, gradually put its sound
together, with assistance from ``Mickey Mouse Club'' music director
Robin Wiley, who arranged a version of the Beatles' ``We Can Work
it Out,'' as well as four original songs. Meanwhile Timberlake's
mom steered the fledgling group's business operations, as well as
housing Kirkpatrick and Chasez.
 &HT;    The group also benefited from the tutelage of Orlando-based
starmakers Louis J. Pearlman and Johnny Wright, although they're
currently in litigation over finances with the former.
 &HT;    In their early days, Timberlake says, the band weren't quite
sure what they were doing.
 &HT;    ``We were just really singing together,'' he says, ``anything we
could do a cappella, from Boyz II Men to old '50s groups.''
 &HT;    But early on, all five group members knew they were onto
something special.
 &HT;    ``There really is a chemistry involved,'' says Kirkpatrick, who
despite his wild image serves as 'N Sync's ``big brother.'' ``A lot
of us knew each other before the group ... and it's just amazing
that we've been together for about three years and we've never had
a fight.
 &HT;    ``We've all had music as a goal,'' he adds, ``and we're five
brothers experiencing music and life together. It's something that
you can't describe. You just have to experience it.''
 &HT;    And it's been quite an experience, including not only
chart-busting record sales but also an appearance in Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade _ sharing a float with a bunch of enormous,
dancing M&AMP;Ms _ and a gig opening for Janet Jackson. The group's
third album is currently in the works, with a tour headlining
stadium shows set for summer 1999.
 &HT;    The challenge, they acknowledge, will be maintaining this level
of fame in a sector of the music business known more for quick _
and temporary _ success stories than for long-term careers.
 &HT;    But Timberlake insists that 'N Sync isn't destined for the
bubble-gum-rock scrap heap.
 &HT;    ``Anybody who really groups us that way has only seen our
faces,'' Timberlake says. ``And I can see how it might throw them
off at first, just because of the way it looks. But when people see
our stage show and hear our music, they recognize the difference.
We're always thinking ahead _ we always want to move to that next
step.''
 &HT;    ``I know the five of us are going to stay true to the music,''
Kirkpatrick adds. ``We're happy with the teen idolness, getting in
the teenybopper magazines, having the girls go crazy at the shows.
But, like all good books, it must come to an end _ we understand
that. I can only say that in five years' time, I can tell you that
'N Sync will be together, whether or not we're superstars.
 &HT;    ``I would rather be a member of this group than the Beatles, the
Rolling Stones, any of those other groups, because these are my
friends,'' he says. ``'N Sync isn't even a group to us anymore _
it's a way of life. It's our being.''

 Includes a color slide of Melissa Joan Hart with Beth Broderick,
Caroline Rhea and Jo Ann Worley in a scene from ``Sabrina, the
Teenage Witch.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about black cats, bats and bubbling cauldrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina, The Teenage Witch'' is the sunniest show about the
black arts ever, thanks to Melissa Joan Hart, the high-spirited
young actress who provides a dependably upbeat tone to the show's
supernatural goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   Whether floundering with her latest boyfriend or conspiring with
the show's oddly animatronic feline, Salem _ Hart swears it's ``a
drunken rabbit with a hairpiece'' _ she serves as the popular
anchor to ABC's Friday family programming.
</P>
<P>
   Recently we sat down with Hart _ as well as Beth Broderick and
Caroline Rhea, who play her aunts Hilda and Zelda _ for some
Mexican food on the show's school-cafeteria set, along with a chat
about almost anything concerning the show, from learning lines to
facing fans and even Hart's attractive bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's first starring experience was with the cable series
``Clarissa Explains It All,'' which is still airing in reruns. In
retrospect, she says, it's remarkable that she made it through
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my high-school days,'' the actress says. ``I was
kind of young to have that much responsibility. I wouldn't
recommend it to any teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come down on people my age for playing teen-agers,''
the 22-year-old actress adds, ``but I think it's so much better to
have older people playing teen-agers than to have teen-agers
playing teen-agers and missing out on things like high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhea laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw `Clarissa' last summer,'' she says, ``I couldn't
believe what a little baby she was. My nephew, who is 4, is
obsessed and loves Melissa, whom he calls `Bobrina.' He also loves
`Larissa,' but refuses to accept that it's the same person.''
</P>
<P>
   Her eccentric role doesn't win her that kind of passionate
devotion, Rhea adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through customs in Canada at Christmas, and I had
tons of presents,'' she recalls. ``I walked to customs, and the guy
goes, `Don't worry, I recognize you, you're that girl from TV.' And
I go, `Oh, well, thanks.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he says, ``You're on `3rd Rock from the Sun.'''
</P>
<P>
   All three women laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go, ``OK,''' Rhea concludes. ``Alien, witch _ close enough.
I'm not paying duty, that's the bottom line!''
</P>
<P>
   While Rhea has been talking, Hart has been flipping through
publicity photos for the show. She stops, her brow furrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have my hands on my butt,'' she says, looking again
at the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a magnet, honey,'' Broderick adds, earning another
round of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched Melissa evolve from little girl to sexy mama,''
Rhea says cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sexy mama,''' Hart grouses good-naturedly. ``Thanks.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want to be called, then?'' Broderick asks.
</P>
<P>
   Hart stops and thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sexy mama's' fine with me,'' she says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tortures us that she's growing up,'' Broderick says with a
smile, ``because we all want to give her advice and she doesn't
want to take it. Completely, exactly like the show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it a lot, though,'' Hart says defensively. ``I ask for
it a lot. These women, they know what they're doing. I'll ask
mainly about boys. Boys, career, anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about boys,'' Rhea says, ``and Beth knows about men.''
</P>
<P>
   The two older women laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys are slightly less irritating,'' Rhea says, ``and their
skin is better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men come in handy,'' Broderick adds. ``No. 1, they eat my
food. No. 2, they move heavy things.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Rhea and Broderick are united in their praise
for Hart's professionalism and talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the most unbelievable, uncanny ability to memorize
dialogue,'' Rhea says, ``like no one I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' Hart says, clearly pleased. ``A lot of it comes from
`Clarissa,' which I did for four years. There was tons of dialogue
in that. I had monologues, two-page monologues, three times a show.
So it's easier for me to memorize scene by scene here, because I
have a few lines per scene.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Broderick's turn to discuss Hart, and she pauses
thoughtfully before speaking: ``I really, really, really think she
has ... great hair!''
</P>
<P>
   Again the three women laugh, hard enough to have trouble eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now give us compliments,'' Rhea demands.
</P>
<P>
   Hart shrugs, perfectly willing to cooperate. It's Rhea's turn
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, she knows everything about astrology and can
tell you anything about a boy,'' the young actress says. ``She
knows all this boy information, for some reason. It's unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can't give herself advice, though.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, that was the compliment?'' Rhea snorts. ``Now to
your Auntie Beth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth, too, is great at men,'' Hart says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, she says, ``The two of them are like sisters to
me, and have taught me so much. Beth is very into old-school
training techniques, so she keeps me professional, she keeps me in
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, because they get along so well, but they're both
very opposite, kind of like yin and yang.''
</P>
<P>
   The three may play witches on television, but they don't believe
in magic themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made this tostada disappear,'' Broderick offers helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make career opportunities disappear with my big mouth,''
Rhea adds. ``But you know what men constantly ask me? This is the
only thing that drives me crazy: I'll be in line somewhere and
they'll say, `Why don't you make the line move faster? If you have
magic, why are you even in line?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get, `Can you make my wife disappear?''' Hart says.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick snorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's nice,'' she says sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Hart says. ``It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   All three get bags and bags of fan mail, they report.
Surprisingly, however _ given the show's genesis in a children's
comic book _ they rarely hear from young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is all from adults,'' Broderick says. ``Mostly men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is virtually 90 percent from men,'' Rhea agrees.
``Apparently, only three little girls watch this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get a couple of girls,'' Broderick says, ``and I try to
answer them when I get them. I get girls that say, `Aunt Zelda,
you're the only one who'll understand _ my mom works all the time
and I have this problem and I think you can understand me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get those, I do write back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhea laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get `Dear Aunt Hilda, I'm crazy, too,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all gotten the bikini catalogues,'' Broderick adds,
provoking laughter from all three.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pick your favorite bikini and fill in your size and I will
send it to you,''' Rhea says in a humorous voice. ```And then
please have yourself photographed in it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Fat Chance ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Of all their viewers, the three women agree that it's the
children, and especially little girls, that they're the happiest to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get little girls, little boys, college kids,'' Hart says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is meaningful to kids, and I think it does have a
great message,'' Broderick says. ``I mean, I wish when I was a kid
that I'd been watching a show where women were so clever and so
forthright and powerful. I love the way Sabrina deals with boys, I
love the equality in her relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have that when I was a kid,'' she says. ``We didn't
have people like that to look at.''

 Includes a color slide of Tony Goldwyn with Anna Paquin on the set
of ``A Walk in the Clouds.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Tony Goldwyn knows more about Hollywood history _ which his
family has had a lot to do with _ than about Jewish-American
history.
 &HT;    But that hasn't stopped the actor, best known as Patrick
Swayze's lethally conniving friend in ``Ghost'' (1990), from
producing and directing ``A Walk on the Moon,'' a drama about the
coming of age of the very Jewish Kantrowitz family in 1969 that
will open across the country throughout April.
 &HT;    ``I'd never even heard of the Concord,'' Goldwyn says of the
fabled, now-shuttered Catskills summer getaway. ``My grandfather
was Jewish, but I grew up in Los Angeles in a completely
nonreligious household. The Jewish experience was really not a part
of my upbringing, yet I completely identified with this world when
I read the script.
 &HT;    ``I just figured that, if something moves me deeply, it will
move others, too.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn, a boyish-looking 38-year-old who's relaxed and
confident during a conversation at a Manhattan hotel, unearthed
Pamela Gray's script while seeking material to act in and produce.
 &HT;    ``I felt the need to broaden my horizons as actor,'' says
Goldwyn _ who might be a born producer, given that he's the son of
movie producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and grandson of the late,
legendary Hollywood impresario Sam Goldwyn. ``Developing my own
projects seemed like a smart way to go.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn worked closely with Gray to hone the script, originally
called ``The Blouse Man,'' through several drafts. The project
reached a turning point, however, when Goldwyn's director of choice
dropped out, spurring an unexpected discovery in the novice
producer.
 &HT;    ``At that point I realized I wasn't comfortable giving it to
someone else,'' he recalls. ``It became very obvious to me that the
only solution was to step up and do it myself.
 &HT;    ``I hadn't had a desire to direct, really at all, until I'd
gotten into the story development,'' he adds. ``Very shortly after
that, Dustin Hoffman dropped down from the sky as our producer, and
I found myself directing a movie.''
 &HT;    The film stars Diane Lane as Pearl Kantrowitz, a married woman
who, on summer vacation, falls into an illicit affair with a
free-spirited blouse salesman (Viggo Mortensen). The affair rocks
the worlds of her loving-but-dull husband (Liev Schreiber), their
two children (Bobby Boriello and Anna Paquin) and her knowing
mother-in-law (Tovah Feldshuh).
 &HT;    The emotional fireworks take place against a backdrop of
Woodstock and the Vietnam War, with the first moon landing looming
ominously _ and metaphorically _ in the background.
 &HT;    ``Taking the enormous risk of being true to yourself is a
courageous and dangerous thing to do,'' Goldwyn says. ``It can be
painful.
 &HT;    ``If you wake up one day and think, `How did I get here? Is my
life what I dreamt it would be when I was young?' and the answer is
`no' or `not quite,' then you have to determine if you can do
anything about it or if you are powerless,'' he adds. ``If you
determine that you're not powerless, what are the consequences of
change?
 &HT;    ``That's what the film explores,'' the novice director says.
``That's an impulse I identified with. Sometimes you need to break
all the rules, burn down the house and start over.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn grins.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I could relate,'' he says. ``Directing may seem like my
shot at breaking free, but my decision to be an actor was a very
big deal.
 &HT;    ``People not in the business may think film, as a whole, is the
family business, but that's not the case at all,'' he explains.
``Acting in a family of producers was an anarchic decision. And I
didn't even do that in the traditional way. I didn't go to L.A. and
do the inside thing _ I went to New York and into theater, because
I knew that's how I could authenticate my career for myself.''
 &HT;    Though over the last decade he's established himself as an
actor, Goldwyn freely admits to some doubts about his directorial
debut.
 &HT;    ``I figured I could fail, but that it would be worth giving
something I care about my best shot,'' he says. ``What's the worst
that could happen? I fall on my face.
 &HT;    ``As an actor I'd worked with a number of first-time
directors,'' he adds. ``From that I knew the recipe for success as
a director was surrounding yourself with people who really know
what they're doing, trusting them and not pretending to know what
you don't know.
 &HT;    ``I hired good people and leaned on them, and I also had Dustin
around as this creative eye who was watching my back.''
 &HT;    But no matter how good a support team he or she may have, it's
to the director that everyone turns for the answers to the thousand
questions that arise every day on the set.
 &HT;    ``I surprised myself,'' he says. ``I had the answers. It shocked
me, but it all felt very natural.
 &HT;    ``I think I had a whole set of skills that are suited to the job
of directing that I didn't realize I had,'' he adds. ``I had
managerial skills, and was able to make decisions fast.
 &HT;    ``Making decisions is the hardest aspect,'' Goldwyn says. ``You
have all of these choices and options that you could easily agonize
over, but you learn to trust your instincts.
 &HT;    ``And I found that process fun.''
 &HT;    If that sounds like a man who's planning to keep directing, it
should. But that doesn't mean he's giving up acting. Goldwyn will
be seen soon in the independent films ``Trouble in the Corner'' and
``The Lesser Evil,'' both completed before he became involved with
``Moon,'' and will be heard as the voice of the title character in
Disney's ``Tarzan,'' due in June.
 &HT;    Still, Goldwyn's new love is getting most of his attention.
 &HT;    ``I love acting, but directing seems to be taking a front seat
right now,'' he says. ``It's so time-consuming that I haven't had
time to act in a movie in two years. Last year I did a play (``The
Dying Gaul''), but to devote the necessary time to `Moon' I had to
drop out of three movies I really wanted to do, including one with
Oliver Stone.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn plans to spend the summer at home in New Haven, Conn.,
with his wife, production designer Jane Musky, and their two young
daughters. Even there, however, he'll be working with the writers
of two studio films, family dramas that he hopes to direct.
 &HT;    He's come quite a ways from his yuppie-scum days in ``Ghost,'' a
film which he's now more comfortable with.
 &HT;    ``Because of `Moon,' I think I've escaped `Ghost' in at least
one way,'' he says. ``I'm less concerned about perceptions of me as
an actor.
 &HT;    ``Every day when I go down the street, people say, `Hey!
Ghost!''' he explains. ``As an actor, that was getting a little
claustrophobic and limiting.
 &HT;    ``I know I'm blessed to have something like that,'' he adds.
``Every actor wants to be recognized. But I'm more comfortable with
`Ghost' now that I've diversified what I do.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn smiles.
 &HT;    ``I'm in a whole new chapter, because I feel I've reinvented
myself,'' he says. ``Directing opens up my career. It's a
tremendously gratifying job _ I feel that I'm using a much fuller
part of myself, and have a chance to achieve my potential in a way
I don't think I ever would have as an actor.''

`ROCKET BOY, WE HAVE A PROBLEM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with a Pringles &UR;  &LR; potato chip can. It ended with a kid
getting slapped down for trying to reach for the stars and for his
father's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Like the current movie ``October Sky'' and the best-selling book
on which it is based, ``Rocket Boys,'' this is a story about a
young boy who became fascinated with the idea of building his own
model rockets. And like the book and movie, it is also about a boy
and his father trying to get closer.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the real-life 1950s tale of Homer Hickam, the West
Virginia kid who overcame small-town prejudices and went on to a
career as a rocket scientist with NASA, this one seems to involve a
modern-day ``zero tolerance'' school policy run amok, and a child
being punished for what was little more than an attempt at
creativity and father-son communication.
</P>
<P>
   David Silverstein is 13, and was a seventh-grader at Desert Sky
Middle School in Glendale, Ariz., where his family just moved last
fall from Chicago. Several weeks ago, his parents saw ``October
Sky'' and David's father Edward Silverstein was deeply moved by it
_ and especially its portrayal of the conflict and resolution in
the relationship between Hickam and his father. He told his son
about the movie, and kept talking about it for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The following Monday, David Silverstein decided to act on the
message. Never having experimented with rockets, he didn't know
that working model rocket kits can be bought easily at hobby
stores, so, like Hickam, he tried to build one from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   He used a potato-chip can for the rocket's body, attached some
Band-aids to the bottom (to light it with), and stuffed it with
some newspaper, three matches, and some model airplane paint for
fuel. He planned to try to launch the rocket from a vacant lot
after school, so he left it in his locker during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently on a tip from another student, the school's assistant
principal Robert Haley opened the locker and found the crude
missile _ which, according to rocket scientists including Hickam
himself, was a guaranteed fizzle. The rocket was taken to the
principal's office and disassembled. And then the police bomb squad
was called.
</P>
<P>
   David Silverstein was apologetic, admitting he made a dumb
mistake by bringing the device to school. But the school still
suspended him for 10 days. At a later school district hearing, that
suspension was extended to the remainder of the school year.
David's father, with help from a lawyer affiliated with the ACLU,
has filed for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The school, according to local reports, said he was lucky: The
device, considered inflammable because of the paint inside, fell
under rules governing ``destructive devices, dangerous instruments,
simulated weapons, deadly weapons.'' But if they had invoked the
district's ``zero-tolerance'' program by classifying it as a
firearm, he would have been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Sky principal Janet Altersitz said: ``I'm not at liberty
to discuss it. I have to think of the privacy of the kid.'' But,
she suggested, ``there is a whole other side'' to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There always is,'' agreed Hickam, in an interview. ``But I
think they're missing the other side. This is not a rocket story,
this is a father-son story, and I think they could really help out
if they would just calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Silverstein said that ``there have been a lot of
conflicting comments from the school.'' But the bottom line, he
said, is that David has never been in trouble, never had detention,
and even the assistant principal told him that when he first saw
who the rocket belonged to he was surprised that it was David.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers who handled the case said David was truthful
and cooperative, Silverstein said. ``He believes he just made an
error in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the paint could have caught fire, Hickam said,
``but then, so could his schoolbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have pointed out that, contrary to the letter of the
school rules, other students bring matches and butane lighters to
school, so they can smoke cigarettes outside. None have been
suspended for this technical infraction, though the flammability
and explosive potential of a butane lighter is far greater than
that of the paint in the Pringles rocket.
</P>
<P>
   David told his father he misses school, even though some kids
his age might welcome the semester of home-schooling he will now
receive. And he wishes the attention would just go away (all the
local television stations, and a few national programs, have asked
for interviews, though so far his parents have declined all such
requests, cooperating only with local newspapers and the Globe.
They did not consent to having his photo taken).
</P>
<P>
   But not all the attention has been bad. Hickam called the boy,
saying that ``the least I could do was talk to the young man and
encourage him and buck him up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   And then some space enthusiasts in Washington heard his story,
and decided to do even more. An organization called Space
Adventures will be sponsoring a July Fourth weekend program on
rocketry in the Washington area, culminating in the construction of
model rockets that will be launched from the grounds of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space
Flight Center. The Silversteins, father and son, have been invited
to attend, all expenses paid. They have accepted, though the father
says his son was initially reluctant, fearing the public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Space Adventures spokesman Robert Pearlman said that the group
felt it was important to encourage the boy's interest and not let
the school win out in stifling his efforts. After the initial
suspension, Pearlman said, David at first had told his father ``I'm
just not going to do it anymore, I'm going to give up.'' The action
of the school, Pearlman said, ``just sends the wrong message.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a sad case of a missed opportunity, Hickam believes.
``I know they don't want to lose face, but this would be an
opportunity for some education to take place. They could have said
`let's have a rocket science class.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A nearby school, in fact, does have an amateur rocketry group
which builds model rockets, and, according to local newspaper
reports, even launches them from school grounds. Local enthusiasts
probably would have been willing to come out, Hickam suggested, to
``show them how to do safe rocketry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickam thinks the bottom line is simple. ``Boys will be boys,
kids will be kids, and sometimes when you have inflexible rules you
just get inflexible results.'' In his own school days, he said,
``the principal would just jerk a knot in you if you did something
wrong. And then it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he suggested, ``everybody just needs to lighten
up.''

CHRIS O'DONNELL ISN'T ROBIN ANY MORE

 Includes a color slide of Chris O'Donnell in a scene from
``Cookie's Fortune.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chris O'Donnell won't be slipping into his Robin tights again
anytime soon. And, truth to tell, that's not a bad thing.
 &HT;    ``Ever since my wife found out we were going to have a baby,
it's been `Goodbye, healthy food!' and `I want steak, I want
potatoes,''' he says, patting a stomach which does indeed display a
slight paunch. ``The other night, I said, `Shoot, I'm the one who's
getting fat here.'
 &HT;    ``I'm not sure those tights from my superhero days would fit
anymore.''
 &HT;    O'Donnell breaks into a laugh, disrupting breakfast on a cool
spring morning at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. Yes, he can joke
about ``Batman and Robin'' (1997), the much-hyped turkey that _ at
least according to rumor _ almost cost him his career.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get a job,'' O'Donnell moans, emitting a fake sob,
and then laughs again.
 &HT;    Actually, he says, his two-year hiatus from the screen was
intentional. Largely it was to give him time to get married and
adjust to life as half of a couple, but it also involved getting
away from Hollywood for awhile and, perhaps, giving audiences a
break as well.
 &HT;    ``You also get to the point where I think people get sick of
seeing your face onscreen,'' O'Donnell says. ``I knew it was time
to disappear for a little while.''
 &HT;    Now he's back, with a full slate of projects including, most
notably, Robert Altman's ``Cookie's Fortune,'' opening April 9 in
New York and subsequently around the country, and ``The Bachelor,''
a romantic comedy that's due in September and represents his debut
as a producer.
 &HT;    It's been a while since O'Donnell was around, but he still comes
across as Hollywood's biggest boy scout. While their peers were
gilding the Tinseltown party circuit, he and his wife _ Caroline, a
kindergarten teacher _ were living the quiet life in Chicago. His
biggest extravagance was the reported purchase of a $1,000 bed from
this very hotel.
 &HT;    And, yes, teen-age girls are still flinging themselves at this
reluctant sex symbol and, yes, he still says he isn't interested.
 &HT;    ``To me, the relationship I have with my wife has so much more
value than just a fling here and there,'' he says with a shrug. ``I
guess it all comes down to what you believe in. My morals are part
religion and part the way I was brought up, which was with
values.''
 &HT;    That isn't to say that he can't turn up the heat onscreen.
``Cookie's Fortune'' casts him as Jason Brown, a dimwit Mississippi
cop in love with the town rebel (Liv Tyler). When her aunt Cookie
(Patricia Neal) is found dead, it's up to O'Donnell's character to
investigate what Cookie's nieces (Glenn Close and Julianne Moore)
insist is a murder.
 &HT;    Along the way O'Donnell has several steamy scenes with Tyler.
Steamy, at least, from an audience point of view.
 &HT;    ``It was funny,'' the actor says, ``because when we did our
first makeout scene, they said `Cut,' and I pulled back and looked
at Liv. She was just red everywhere on her face. I was like, `Good
God! What did I do to this girl?''
 &HT;    Actually, all he did was to forget to shave, not realizing that
Tyler has extremely sensitive skin.
 &HT;    O'Donnell sighs.
 &HT;    ``The crew was looking at me like, `You brute!'''
 &HT;    It was the chance to work with Altman that sold him on getting
back to work, O'Donnell adds.
 &HT;    ``It was kind of like a no-brainer,'' the actor says. ``Robert
Altman calls, and I was like, `OK, I'll do it.'
 &HT;    ``Then you say, `Oh, what's the role?'''
 &HT;    Despite box-office flops with ``In Love and War'' (1997) and
``The Chamber'' (1997), O'Donnell was still on Hollywood's hot list
when he virtually disappeared from sight.
 &HT;    Not everybody could turn down multimillion-dollar paychecks,
especially with a wife and family to think about. And indeed,
O'Donnell admits that he was tempted.
 &HT;    ``It was tough,'' he concedes. ``But you know what? I was
looking at my friends who were living a 9-to-5 life, and I envied
them. I wanted to come home in the afternoon, read the paper, eat
dinner and watch TV. I didn't want the craziness of Hollywood.''
 &HT;    It was a natural reaction from a young man who has been famous
ever since a spur-of-the-moment response to a Chicago newspaper
advertisement turned into a featured role in ``Men Don't Leave''
(1990) and made the Boston College business major a star.
 &HT;    ``Being famous so young is tough,'' the 29-year-old says. ``For
instance, I've been doing interviews since I was 18 years old. I've
been asked my life philosophy more times than I can count. I want
to scream, `I'm 18 years old, I haven't figured anything out!'
 &HT;    ``I'll read my old interviews and think, `Are you for real?'''
 &HT;    After ``Men Don't Leave'' (1990), O'Donnell found himself on a
fast train to stardom, appearing in such hits as ``Fried Green
Tomatoes'' (1991), ``School Ties'' (1992) and ``The Three
Musketeers'' (1993).
 &HT;    Along the way, however, he misplaced his privacy. A few years
ago he was in a fender-bender in Chicago, the actor recalls, and
the investigating officer wanted an autograph for his kid.
 &HT;    ``It's worse in L.A.,'' he adds. ``I got attacked at the Ivy,
coming out of lunch in the middle of the day. It was this group of
kids across the street with video cameras.
 &HT;    ``I started to think, there's videotapes all over the world of
me doing random dumb things and in bad free T-shirts,'' he says
with a rueful smile. ``Now I get up and think, `Do I want this
orange shirt preserved forever on someone's tape? What should I
wear for historical purposes?'''
 &HT;    Nowadays he's wearing two hats, as star and producer of ``The
Bachelor,'' a remake of Buster Keaton's 1925 silent-film classic
``Seven Chances'' that casts him as a man given 24 hours to get
married or lose his inheritance.
 &HT;    ``The best scene is when I'm running down the streets of San
Francisco being chased by 1,000 women in bridal gowns,'' O'Donnell
says. ``Depending on your perspective, that's either heaven or
hell. Since I'm married, I guess it's hellish.''
 &HT;    And no, if you were wondering, he wouldn't mind another chance
to play Robin, either.
 &HT;    ``I don't think they're going to do another `Batman' with me,''
he says. ``If they do another movie, they'll wait a couple of years
and then completely reinvent it with new actors.''
 &HT;    For the first time all morning, he sounds a little depressed.
 &HT;    ``I would do another Batman,'' he says. ``I enjoy doing them.
But it's not anything on a priority list.''
 &HT;    Topping that list is jetting east to start setting up a nursery
at his family's Chicago home, where he is to be found when he's not
at his new production office in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Oh, yes, and about that bed: Actually there were two of them,
and if they're a sign of Hollywood decadence, O'Donnell can live
with it.
 &HT;    ``I did buy two beds from the Four Seasons Hotel in Los
Angeles,'' he admits. ``One for our house in Chicago and the other
for our place in L.A. I had to buy the beds, because they were the
most comfortable ones I've ever slept in.''
 &HT;    And, yes, the total cost ran to $1,000 per bed.
 &HT;    ``Hey, I think a regular, nice, king-sized bed is $800,''
O'Donnell says defensively. ``It's not like I went nuts or
anything.''

 Includes a color slide of the singing group 'N Sync. 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He's a winner, but he isn't going to Disney World.
 &HT;    Justin Timberlake is actually in Orlando, Fla., for a couple of
days. But the Orlando native has better things to do than hang with
Mickey _ such as rehearsing with his band, the phenomenally popular
'N Sync.
 &HT;    ``So I'm really just in Orlando, not at home,'' says Timberlake,
who at 18 is the youngest of the five 'N Syncers.
 &HT;    The band works hard, and that work has been paying off. In
barely a year the group's two albums _ a self-titled debut album
and the ``Home For Christmas'' holiday album _ have sold more than
7 million copies, fueled by frothy hits such as ``I Want You
Back,'' ``Tearin' Up My Heart'' and ``God Must Have Spent a Little
More Time on You.''
 &HT;    That's made 'N Sync pop's hottest boy outfit of the moment,
eclipsing _ at least for now _ fellow Orlandoites the Backstreet
Boys and Hanson. Their only competition is provided by Britney
Spears, an old friend since her days co-starring with Timberlake
and 22-year-old bandmate Joshua ``J.C.'' Chasez on the Disney
Channel's ``The Mickey Mouse Club.''
 &HT;    ``It's become so flattering,'' says 27-year-old Chris
Kirkpatrick, 'N Sync's founder and oldest member _ as well as its
most recognizable, thanks to his colorful, braided hairdo.
 &HT;    ``We always have to keep each other in check,'' Kirkpatrick
says. ``We'll all go into one room or something and laugh and go
`Can you believe this is happening?' It's like a dream to us, just
to be walking in the airport or something and have someone say
`Hey! It's 'N Sync!'''
 &HT;    Not that the group's fans stop with shouts. Timberlake's
favorite fan memory is of one girl at an airport in Europe who
tried to get to the band by jumping onto a luggage-conveyor belt.
 &HT;    ``Of course she didn't make it through,'' he says with a laugh.
``Her disguise wasn't that good.''
 &HT;    But, he adds, the fans generally aren't that inventive.
 &HT;    ``They're usually grabbing at your clothes and ripping them off
and things like that,'' Timberlake says. ``I think the girls are
just _ they're real sweethearts, and it's just funny to see how
they try to get to you.''
 &HT;    Sometimes that's inopportune, however. Kirkpatrick recalls a
particular night in an Orlando bar, when he was chatting with a
young woman he had been dancing with. Six other girls spotted him
from across the club and came screaming over to where the couple
was standing.
 &HT;    ``They all started doing the `I Want You Back' dance, and then
they started going `Here's my phone number' and stuff like that,''
he says. ``And I'm going, `Oh, no ... '
 &HT;    ``That kind of blew it with that girl. She was like, `I'm going
to get a drink. I'll be right back.' And I never saw her again.''
 &HT;    Kirkpatrick isn't complaining, though. Stardom at this level was
only a dream when the Pittsburgh-area native moved to Orlando nine
years ago to live with his father and study music at a couple of
area colleges. He also worked at Universal Studios, where he met
Timberlake and future bandmate Joey Fatone, now 22.
 &HT;    While Timberlake and Fatone went the Disney route, Kirkpatrick
was forming his own bands. He even turned down an invitation to be
a Backstreet Boy after singing in a school choir with that group's
Howie Dorough.
 &HT;    ``He came in and said `We're having auditions for the Backstreet
Boys,''' Kirkpatrick recalls. ``I already had my own group, and my
heart was with them. I'm a very loyal person.''
 &HT;    That group eventually broke up, and in 1995 Kirkpatrick called
Timberlake and Fatone, who by then were free agents after the
cancellation of ``The Mickey Mouse Club,'' about his next project.
Timberlake brought Chasez with him, and 19-year-old bass singer
Lance ``Lantsen'' Bass was recommended by Timberlake's vocal coach.
 &HT;    The quintet, which takes its name from the last letter of the
first name or nickname of each band member, gradually put its sound
together, with assistance from ``Mickey Mouse Club'' music director
Robin Wiley, who arranged a version of the Beatles' ``We Can Work
it Out,'' as well as four original songs. Meanwhile Timberlake's
mom steered the fledgling group's business operations, as well as
housing Kirkpatrick and Chasez.
 &HT;    The group also benefited from the tutelage of Orlando-based
starmakers Louis J. Pearlman and Johnny Wright, although they're
currently in litigation over finances with the former.
 &HT;    In their early days, Timberlake says, the band weren't quite
sure what they were doing.
 &HT;    ``We were just really singing together,'' he says, ``anything we
could do a cappella, from Boyz II Men to old '50s groups.''
 &HT;    But early on, all five group members knew they were onto
something special.
 &HT;    ``There really is a chemistry involved,'' says Kirkpatrick, who
despite his wild image serves as 'N Sync's ``big brother.'' ``A lot
of us knew each other before the group ... and it's just amazing
that we've been together for about three years and we've never had
a fight.
 &HT;    ``We've all had music as a goal,'' he adds, ``and we're five
brothers experiencing music and life together. It's something that
you can't describe. You just have to experience it.''
 &HT;    And it's been quite an experience, including not only
chart-busting record sales but also an appearance in Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade _ sharing a float with a bunch of enormous,
dancing M&AMP;Ms _ and a gig opening for Janet Jackson. The group's
third album is currently in the works, with a tour headlining
stadium shows set for summer 1999.
 &HT;    The challenge, they acknowledge, will be maintaining this level
of fame in a sector of the music business known more for quick _
and temporary _ success stories than for long-term careers.
 &HT;    But Timberlake insists that 'N Sync isn't destined for the
bubble-gum-rock scrap heap.
 &HT;    ``Anybody who really groups us that way has only seen our
faces,'' Timberlake says. ``And I can see how it might throw them
off at first, just because of the way it looks. But when people see
our stage show and hear our music, they recognize the difference.
We're always thinking ahead _ we always want to move to that next
step.''
 &HT;    ``I know the five of us are going to stay true to the music,''
Kirkpatrick adds. ``We're happy with the teen idolness, getting in
the teenybopper magazines, having the girls go crazy at the shows.
But, like all good books, it must come to an end _ we understand
that. I can only say that in five years' time, I can tell you that
'N Sync will be together, whether or not we're superstars.
 &HT;    ``I would rather be a member of this group than the Beatles, the
Rolling Stones, any of those other groups, because these are my
friends,'' he says. ``'N Sync isn't even a group to us anymore _
it's a way of life. It's our being.''

 Includes a color slide of Melissa Joan Hart with Beth Broderick,
Caroline Rhea and Jo Ann Worley in a scene from ``Sabrina, the
Teenage Witch.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about black cats, bats and bubbling cauldrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina, The Teenage Witch'' is the sunniest show about the
black arts ever, thanks to Melissa Joan Hart, the high-spirited
young actress who provides a dependably upbeat tone to the show's
supernatural goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   Whether floundering with her latest boyfriend or conspiring with
the show's oddly animatronic feline, Salem _ Hart swears it's ``a
drunken rabbit with a hairpiece'' _ she serves as the popular
anchor to ABC's Friday family programming.
</P>
<P>
   Recently we sat down with Hart _ as well as Beth Broderick and
Caroline Rhea, who play her aunts Hilda and Zelda _ for some
Mexican food on the show's school-cafeteria set, along with a chat
about almost anything concerning the show, from learning lines to
facing fans and even Hart's attractive bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's first starring experience was with the cable series
``Clarissa Explains It All,'' which is still airing in reruns. In
retrospect, she says, it's remarkable that she made it through
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my high-school days,'' the actress says. ``I was
kind of young to have that much responsibility. I wouldn't
recommend it to any teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come down on people my age for playing teen-agers,''
the 22-year-old actress adds, ``but I think it's so much better to
have older people playing teen-agers than to have teen-agers
playing teen-agers and missing out on things like high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhea laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw `Clarissa' last summer,'' she says, ``I couldn't
believe what a little baby she was. My nephew, who is 4, is
obsessed and loves Melissa, whom he calls `Bobrina.' He also loves
`Larissa,' but refuses to accept that it's the same person.''
</P>
<P>
   Her eccentric role doesn't win her that kind of passionate
devotion, Rhea adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through customs in Canada at Christmas, and I had
tons of presents,'' she recalls. ``I walked to customs, and the guy
goes, `Don't worry, I recognize you, you're that girl from TV.' And
I go, `Oh, well, thanks.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he says, ``You're on `3rd Rock from the Sun.'''
</P>
<P>
   All three women laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go, ``OK,''' Rhea concludes. ``Alien, witch _ close enough.
I'm not paying duty, that's the bottom line!''
</P>
<P>
   While Rhea has been talking, Hart has been flipping through
publicity photos for the show. She stops, her brow furrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have my hands on my butt,'' she says, looking again
at the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a magnet, honey,'' Broderick adds, earning another
round of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched Melissa evolve from little girl to sexy mama,''
Rhea says cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sexy mama,''' Hart grouses good-naturedly. ``Thanks.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want to be called, then?'' Broderick asks.
</P>
<P>
   Hart stops and thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sexy mama's' fine with me,'' she says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tortures us that she's growing up,'' Broderick says with a
smile, ``because we all want to give her advice and she doesn't
want to take it. Completely, exactly like the show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it a lot, though,'' Hart says defensively. ``I ask for
it a lot. These women, they know what they're doing. I'll ask
mainly about boys. Boys, career, anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about boys,'' Rhea says, ``and Beth knows about men.''
</P>
<P>
   The two older women laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys are slightly less irritating,'' Rhea says, ``and their
skin is better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men come in handy,'' Broderick adds. ``No. 1, they eat my
food. No. 2, they move heavy things.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Rhea and Broderick are united in their praise
for Hart's professionalism and talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the most unbelievable, uncanny ability to memorize
dialogue,'' Rhea says, ``like no one I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' Hart says, clearly pleased. ``A lot of it comes from
`Clarissa,' which I did for four years. There was tons of dialogue
in that. I had monologues, two-page monologues, three times a show.
So it's easier for me to memorize scene by scene here, because I
have a few lines per scene.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Broderick's turn to discuss Hart, and she pauses
thoughtfully before speaking: ``I really, really, really think she
has ... great hair!''
</P>
<P>
   Again the three women laugh, hard enough to have trouble eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now give us compliments,'' Rhea demands.
</P>
<P>
   Hart shrugs, perfectly willing to cooperate. It's Rhea's turn
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, she knows everything about astrology and can
tell you anything about a boy,'' the young actress says. ``She
knows all this boy information, for some reason. It's unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can't give herself advice, though.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, that was the compliment?'' Rhea snorts. ``Now to
your Auntie Beth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth, too, is great at men,'' Hart says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, she says, ``The two of them are like sisters to
me, and have taught me so much. Beth is very into old-school
training techniques, so she keeps me professional, she keeps me in
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, because they get along so well, but they're both
very opposite, kind of like yin and yang.''
</P>
<P>
   The three may play witches on television, but they don't believe
in magic themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made this tostada disappear,'' Broderick offers helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make career opportunities disappear with my big mouth,''
Rhea adds. ``But you know what men constantly ask me? This is the
only thing that drives me crazy: I'll be in line somewhere and
they'll say, `Why don't you make the line move faster? If you have
magic, why are you even in line?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get, `Can you make my wife disappear?''' Hart says.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick snorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's nice,'' she says sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Hart says. ``It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   All three get bags and bags of fan mail, they report.
Surprisingly, however _ given the show's genesis in a children's
comic book _ they rarely hear from young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is all from adults,'' Broderick says. ``Mostly men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is virtually 90 percent from men,'' Rhea agrees.
``Apparently, only three little girls watch this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get a couple of girls,'' Broderick says, ``and I try to
answer them when I get them. I get girls that say, `Aunt Zelda,
you're the only one who'll understand _ my mom works all the time
and I have this problem and I think you can understand me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get those, I do write back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhea laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get `Dear Aunt Hilda, I'm crazy, too,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all gotten the bikini catalogues,'' Broderick adds,
provoking laughter from all three.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pick your favorite bikini and fill in your size and I will
send it to you,''' Rhea says in a humorous voice. ```And then
please have yourself photographed in it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Fat Chance ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Of all their viewers, the three women agree that it's the
children, and especially little girls, that they're the happiest to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get little girls, little boys, college kids,'' Hart says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is meaningful to kids, and I think it does have a
great message,'' Broderick says. ``I mean, I wish when I was a kid
that I'd been watching a show where women were so clever and so
forthright and powerful. I love the way Sabrina deals with boys, I
love the equality in her relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have that when I was a kid,'' she says. ``We didn't
have people like that to look at.''

 Includes a color slide of Tony Goldwyn with Anna Paquin on the set
of ``A Walk in the Clouds.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Tony Goldwyn knows more about Hollywood history _ which his
family has had a lot to do with _ than about Jewish-American
history.
 &HT;    But that hasn't stopped the actor, best known as Patrick
Swayze's lethally conniving friend in ``Ghost'' (1990), from
producing and directing ``A Walk on the Moon,'' a drama about the
coming of age of the very Jewish Kantrowitz family in 1969 that
will open across the country throughout April.
 &HT;    ``I'd never even heard of the Concord,'' Goldwyn says of the
fabled, now-shuttered Catskills summer getaway. ``My grandfather
was Jewish, but I grew up in Los Angeles in a completely
nonreligious household. The Jewish experience was really not a part
of my upbringing, yet I completely identified with this world when
I read the script.
 &HT;    ``I just figured that, if something moves me deeply, it will
move others, too.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn, a boyish-looking 38-year-old who's relaxed and
confident during a conversation at a Manhattan hotel, unearthed
Pamela Gray's script while seeking material to act in and produce.
 &HT;    ``I felt the need to broaden my horizons as actor,'' says
Goldwyn _ who might be a born producer, given that he's the son of
movie producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and grandson of the late,
legendary Hollywood impresario Sam Goldwyn. ``Developing my own
projects seemed like a smart way to go.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn worked closely with Gray to hone the script, originally
called ``The Blouse Man,'' through several drafts. The project
reached a turning point, however, when Goldwyn's director of choice
dropped out, spurring an unexpected discovery in the novice
producer.
 &HT;    ``At that point I realized I wasn't comfortable giving it to
someone else,'' he recalls. ``It became very obvious to me that the
only solution was to step up and do it myself.
 &HT;    ``I hadn't had a desire to direct, really at all, until I'd
gotten into the story development,'' he adds. ``Very shortly after
that, Dustin Hoffman dropped down from the sky as our producer, and
I found myself directing a movie.''
 &HT;    The film stars Diane Lane as Pearl Kantrowitz, a married woman
who, on summer vacation, falls into an illicit affair with a
free-spirited blouse salesman (Viggo Mortensen). The affair rocks
the worlds of her loving-but-dull husband (Liev Schreiber), their
two children (Bobby Boriello and Anna Paquin) and her knowing
mother-in-law (Tovah Feldshuh).
 &HT;    The emotional fireworks take place against a backdrop of
Woodstock and the Vietnam War, with the first moon landing looming
ominously _ and metaphorically _ in the background.
 &HT;    ``Taking the enormous risk of being true to yourself is a
courageous and dangerous thing to do,'' Goldwyn says. ``It can be
painful.
 &HT;    ``If you wake up one day and think, `How did I get here? Is my
life what I dreamt it would be when I was young?' and the answer is
`no' or `not quite,' then you have to determine if you can do
anything about it or if you are powerless,'' he adds. ``If you
determine that you're not powerless, what are the consequences of
change?
 &HT;    ``That's what the film explores,'' the novice director says.
``That's an impulse I identified with. Sometimes you need to break
all the rules, burn down the house and start over.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn grins.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I could relate,'' he says. ``Directing may seem like my
shot at breaking free, but my decision to be an actor was a very
big deal.
 &HT;    ``People not in the business may think film, as a whole, is the
family business, but that's not the case at all,'' he explains.
``Acting in a family of producers was an anarchic decision. And I
didn't even do that in the traditional way. I didn't go to L.A. and
do the inside thing _ I went to New York and into theater, because
I knew that's how I could authenticate my career for myself.''
 &HT;    Though over the last decade he's established himself as an
actor, Goldwyn freely admits to some doubts about his directorial
debut.
 &HT;    ``I figured I could fail, but that it would be worth giving
something I care about my best shot,'' he says. ``What's the worst
that could happen? I fall on my face.
 &HT;    ``As an actor I'd worked with a number of first-time
directors,'' he adds. ``From that I knew the recipe for success as
a director was surrounding yourself with people who really know
what they're doing, trusting them and not pretending to know what
you don't know.
 &HT;    ``I hired good people and leaned on them, and I also had Dustin
around as this creative eye who was watching my back.''
 &HT;    But no matter how good a support team he or she may have, it's
to the director that everyone turns for the answers to the thousand
questions that arise every day on the set.
 &HT;    ``I surprised myself,'' he says. ``I had the answers. It shocked
me, but it all felt very natural.
 &HT;    ``I think I had a whole set of skills that are suited to the job
of directing that I didn't realize I had,'' he adds. ``I had
managerial skills, and was able to make decisions fast.
 &HT;    ``Making decisions is the hardest aspect,'' Goldwyn says. ``You
have all of these choices and options that you could easily agonize
over, but you learn to trust your instincts.
 &HT;    ``And I found that process fun.''
 &HT;    If that sounds like a man who's planning to keep directing, it
should. But that doesn't mean he's giving up acting. Goldwyn will
be seen soon in the independent films ``Trouble in the Corner'' and
``The Lesser Evil,'' both completed before he became involved with
``Moon,'' and will be heard as the voice of the title character in
Disney's ``Tarzan,'' due in June.
 &HT;    Still, Goldwyn's new love is getting most of his attention.
 &HT;    ``I love acting, but directing seems to be taking a front seat
right now,'' he says. ``It's so time-consuming that I haven't had
time to act in a movie in two years. Last year I did a play (``The
Dying Gaul''), but to devote the necessary time to `Moon' I had to
drop out of three movies I really wanted to do, including one with
Oliver Stone.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn plans to spend the summer at home in New Haven, Conn.,
with his wife, production designer Jane Musky, and their two young
daughters. Even there, however, he'll be working with the writers
of two studio films, family dramas that he hopes to direct.
 &HT;    He's come quite a ways from his yuppie-scum days in ``Ghost,'' a
film which he's now more comfortable with.
 &HT;    ``Because of `Moon,' I think I've escaped `Ghost' in at least
one way,'' he says. ``I'm less concerned about perceptions of me as
an actor.
 &HT;    ``Every day when I go down the street, people say, `Hey!
Ghost!''' he explains. ``As an actor, that was getting a little
claustrophobic and limiting.
 &HT;    ``I know I'm blessed to have something like that,'' he adds.
``Every actor wants to be recognized. But I'm more comfortable with
`Ghost' now that I've diversified what I do.''
 &HT;    Goldwyn smiles.
 &HT;    ``I'm in a whole new chapter, because I feel I've reinvented
myself,'' he says. ``Directing opens up my career. It's a
tremendously gratifying job _ I feel that I'm using a much fuller
part of myself, and have a chance to achieve my potential in a way
I don't think I ever would have as an actor.''

SAY WHAT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cleverest response to Vice President Al Gore's odd claim
that when he was in Congress he ``took the initiative in creating
the Internet'' came from his predecessor as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore created the Internet,'' Dan Quayle cracked, ``I
invented spell-check.''
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know that Quayle has a quick and self-deprecating
sense of humor, don't blame yourself: It's a side of the man the
media have never taken much notice of, perhaps because they have
been so keen to portray him as a nitwit. Don't blame yourself,
either, if you didn't know that Gore's Internet howler was just the
latest in a long line of Gore gaffes. That, too, is something the
media have never taken much notice of _ perhaps because it would
conflict with their template of the Veep as a careful and judicious
intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   No politician is immune to uttering the occasional blooper.
Gaffes typically result from engaging the mouth before putting the
brain in gear. But sometimes they confirm what voters (or
journalists) already suspected. When George Romney said his views
on Vietnam had changed because he'd ``had the greatest brainwashing
that anybody can get,'' it solidified a perception that his grasp
of world affairs was weak. Bob Dole's 1988 New Hampshire snarl _
``Tell him to stop lying about my record'' _ reinforced his
reputation for surliness.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffes can also be revelations. When Michael Dukakis urged Iowa
farmers to diversify into Belgian endive, everyone realized how
little he understood about American agriculture. Ted Kennedy's
mush-mouthed answer to Roger Mudd's ``Why do you want to be
president?'' illuminated the intellectual emptiness of his White
House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the best gaffes are just _ funny. Quayle telling that kid
that he needed an `e' at the end of `potato' was hilarious. George
Bush's assaults on the English language were pure comedy. (Bush at
a Head Start center in 1992: ``And let me say in conclusion, thanks
for the kids. I learned an awful lot about bathtub toys _ about how
to work the telephone. One guy knows _ several of them know their
own phone numbers _ preparation to go to the dentist. A lot of
things I'd forgotten. So it's been a good day.'')
</P>
<P>
   Which returns us to Gore. The world's most riveting speaker he
is not. He is given to ``stiff-necked condescension,'' in the apt
phrase of Bob Zelnick, the ABC newsman turned biographer (``Gore: A
Political Life''). When the vice president's oratory is memorable,
it is usually for its invective. In one vile speech last year, he
lumped critics of affirmative action with the racists who murdered
James Byrd in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes almost as a relief to discover that even stiff,
buttoned-down Al Gore can periodically stick his foot in it. ``Took
the initiative in creating the Internet?'' That would be funny all
by itself, since the earliest incarnation of the Internet, the
ARPAnet, was first conceptualized in 1966, when Gore was 18. But
even funnier is that just last September, according to an AP story,
Gore told a steelworker that ``he, too, has trouble turning on a
computer, let alone using one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Father of the Internet, it transpires, has committed any
number of verbal flubs. The watchdogs at the Media Research Center
(www.mrc.org) sifted through the record and came up with a dozen
examples. Some nuggets:
</P>
<P>
   --En route to Washington for their inauguration in January 1993,
Gore and Bill Clinton toured Monticello. Pausing before some
sculpted busts, Gore asked, ``Who are these people?'' The curator,
The New York Times deadpanned, ``helpfully identified the
unfamiliar faces'': George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1994, Gore told a Milwaukee audience that their city's
ethnic diversity shows that America ``can be e pluribus unum. Out
of one, many.'' the national motto actually means the opposite: Out
of many, one.
</P>
<P>
   --Gore claimed in 1997 that he was the inspiration for Oliver
Barrett IV, the preppy protagonist in ``Love Story.'' That came as
news to Erich Segal, the book's author.
</P>
<P>
   --``That Michael Jackson is unbelievable, isn't he?'' Gore asked
Chicago Bulls fans in January 1998. Presumably he meant Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   --At a Hollywood party, Gore told rock star Courtney Love, ``I'm
a really big fan.'' Love promptly snapped back, ``Yeah, right, name
a song, Al.'' He couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Gore gaffe is funny, of course. There was nothing
comical about deriding Oliver North's supporters as ``the extreme
right wing, the extra-chromosome right wing.'' (An extra chromosome
is what causes Down syndrome.) And it wasn't amusing _ just
hypocritical _ when the same Gore who had boasted on the campaign
trail about having been a tobacco farmer exploited his sister's
death from lung cancer at the 1996 Chicago convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Gore, his every gaffe and blunder hasn't been
endlessly rehashed. As Quayle's experience shows, nobody's
reputation can survive that kind of piling-on. It would be well if
between now and November 2000, no candidate's goofs and rhetorical
stumbles were used as an excuse for cruel mockery and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle jabs are OK, though. Did I mention that Al Gore, the man
who invented the Internet, is the only candidate for president who
doesn't have a campaign Web site?

VIEWED FROM JET COCKPITS, BOMBING STRATEGY IS FRUSTRATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ As the sun set behind the foothills of
the Italian Alps, US fighter jets thundered off the tarmac here
Sunday for the 12th night of NATO airstrikes against Serbian
forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the men who sit in the cockpits of these sleek warplanes
streaking into the gathering darkness said they understand the
limits of the massive firepower they are unleashing around the
clock inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots of the US Air Force's famed 31st Fighter Wing seemed
frustrated that their hammering of Yugoslav Army positions has done
little to stop President Slobodan Milosevic's expulsion of ethnic
Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo. The pilots, along
with the support teams that surround them, seem convinced that NATO
will inevitably need to send in ground troops to stop Milosevic and
secure peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to execute an air campaign effectively so as to
allow ground troops to go in, in a contained way. We have to limit
their risk on the ground. But I think ultimately they will have to
go in to enforce the peace on the ground. It's the only way,'' said
a US Air Force captain who pilots an F-15E of the 494th Fighter
Squadron. He spoke outside a concrete bunker housing the fighter
jets Sunday as they taxied for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting over the roar of the engines, the 33-year-old captain,
who comes from Brooklyn and is known by his call name ``Chili,''
said it was ``very difficult'' to watch television images of tens
of thousands of refugees streaming out of Kosovo every day after
finishing a night of heavy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I don't let it get to me,'' he said. ``I can't. We have to
keep our pace, our focus, and our patience.'' (Air base officials
allowed pilots to be interviewed only on condition that their full
names not be published.)
</P>
<P>
   The same sentiments were echoed across the base Sunday, from
outside the chapel where Easter Sunday services were held to inside
the mess tent, where a holiday meal of baked ham and sweet potatoes
was served.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need ground troops. You can't do it from the air. History
proves that,'' said Senior Airman George Tharpe, 25, of the 555th
Fighter Squadron of the 31st Fighter Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The 31st has seen its history, fighting in crucial battles in
Europe and North Africa in World War II. It also saw intense action
during the 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   A US Marine major and pilot of EA-6B attack jets, known as
``Prowlers,'' brings his history of fighting in the Persian Gulf
War. He agreed that air power without the use of ground troops
would ultimately be futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``To claim control, you have to use air and ground forces in
combination,'' he said, shoveling down dinner as pilots on ``alert
status,'' like himself, braced for another evening of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old major, who goes by the call name ``Cookie,''
described the mission of his attack aircraft as ``taking the eyes
away from the enemy,'' knocking out radar installations and jamming
air waves to prevent antiaircraft guns from locking onto other NATO
jets.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Persian Gulf War, he said, there seems to be no
overall strategy in the Yugoslav conflict. ``We'd like to see an
endgame, and right now we don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, citing Sun Tzu's ancient Chinese military strategy work
``The Art of War,'' a book which he said he keeps with him, he
added, ``You have to know what your mission is and what you want to
accomplish. If you don't, you will never succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The airmen said it was difficult to see a seemingly endless
stream of refugees pouring out of Kosovo despite their bombing
raids. Sometimes, they said, it seemed that Milosevic was winning
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Oliveiro, 39, a superintendent of the services unit on the
base, said, ``There's a lot of frustration because the troops feel
they can't see the impact they're having. You know, you hear the
refugees calling for help and wonder what the mission you just flew
is doing to help them. That wears on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Matthew Borg, 26, of the 31st Fighter Wing, agreed:
``You see the planes launching with one eye, and then you see CNN
showing the refugees continuing to be pushed out with the other. I
think it serves to intensify our focus on what we're doing, but it
definitely puts a strain on a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in northern Italy's lush green-brown patchwork of fields and
freshly plowed farmland, the sprawling base tries to provide ways
to deal with that strain.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of buildings called the ``morale center'' houses a
state-of-the-art workout facility and a bank of computers for
sending e-mail to loved ones, as well as phones that allow
servicemen and women to communicate easily with families back home.
One booth provides video teleconferencing so airmen and their
families can see each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the base has 2,000 personnel and 150 aircraft
stationed there. It is the size of a small American town, with a
nine-hole golf course, three baseball diamonds, a television news
station, two radio stations, and a daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A tent city has been built to house the several hundred added
personnel who have come from other European bases to assist in the
operation. There, amid the smoke of barbecues grilling hot dogs and
the blaring sound of rap music, the troops Sunday were debating
their mission.
</P>
<P>
   At a ``hooch,'' or makeshift pub set up in one of the tents, a
group of airmen were drinking Miller High Life, eating pork rinks,
and voicing their opinions on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone agrees you need ground troops, but I say, let
Europe handle it. This is their back yard. Why should we risk
American lives?'' asked a master sergeant from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But a staff sergeant from Tennessee replied, ``I think they
should just let us do it. We are the policemen of the world, and
that comes with risks. But the point is to stop playing the
political games and let us get our job done. Let us just do it.''

PERSISTENCE AND PRUDENT FORCE CAN WORK IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A solid line connects several fresh dots on the
smoldering Balkan landscape, including:
</P>
<P>
   --The apparent ``emptying'' of Kosovo's capital of Pristina and
other population centers of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   --The massing of huge numbers of refugees on the borders of
Macedonia and Albania, without food and shelter, due to the
inability of those countries to transport them further or otherwise
care for them.
</P>
<P>
   --The periodic shelling by Serb forces of Albanian territory.
</P>
<P>
   --The rapidly increasing pressure from Belgrade on the
autonomous (and reform-minded) province of Montenegro, including
the replacement of its occupying army command with at least eight
senior officers known to be stooges of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That solid line goes by the name of aggression. For years, Serb
violence and atrocities in Kosovo have been assumed prospectively
to be doubly awful _ not only for the immense suffering of the
Kosovars it would produce, but also for the spread of the disease
further into the volatile region that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as NATO's air campaign steadily if belatedly escalates, it
should be apparent how proper those assumptions were and why the
military response is imperative, for both moral and regional
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This is a punch that was telegraphed not merely in the context
of the past year's bestiality by Milosevic, but when his criminal
behavior began in earnest years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the West froze in the face of the initial wave
of mass murder in Croatia and Bosnia, President Bush drew the line
at Kosovo during his final month in office. In a letter to
Belgrade, he warned that violent suppression of Kosovo would
produce US air attacks on Serb forces doing the dirty work and on
Serbia itself. That was in December of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was significant. Milosevic had just been reelected in
a largely rigged procedure, defeating American businessman Milan
Panic, who was then serving as the Yugoslav premier but was ousted
shortly thereafter. The handwriting was on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acted for a reason as valid today as then, except now we
can see it with our own eyes: Kosovo is the territory through which
chaos will spread south and west with catastrophic human and
security consequences; it cannot be isolated by isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   And the following year _ even as he began a three-year tussle
with allies and public opinion over the horror in Bosnia _
President Clinton reaffirmed the Bush pledge and helped arrange
through the United Nations for trip-wire troops to be placed in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   At the time and since then, Clinton has been both supported in
his response to Milosevic's aggression and vigorously urged to do
more by several prominent Republicans, even in the face of their
party's increasing isolationism. Bob Dole is the best-known, but I
recently ran across a 6-year-old essay by Senator Orrin Hatch in
which he has urged that forces also be pre-positioned in Kosovo.
His description of the Milosevic way is as chillingly accurate now
as it was then:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight one war at a time. Destabilize neighbors by arming
nationalists among its Serbian minority. Back those guerrillas with
supplies and the forces of the former Yugoslav army and air force.
Exploit peace talks as a cover for ethnic cleansing and to ward off
any Western military response. Consent to a peace plan in order to
consolidate gains once key Serbian objectives have been achieved.
Having done this, Serbs move to the next target.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is not Kosovo, but the fact since then has been that
persistence and the prudent use of force have made an enormous
difference. And will in the present circumstances. The NATO
campaign against Milosevic has barely begun. It is escalating daily
and spreading throughout Kosovo. Currently, the only real limits
are weather, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of hindsight, it's clear from military and policy
officials that there were hopes that the Serbs might take a
symbolic airstrike or two and use them as political cover to
consent to last month's Rambouillet agreement. Those hopes
influenced the initial character of the strikes. It's also clear
that Clinton had tons of advance warning that Milosevic would not
stop his murderous campaign and might accelerate its pace, and that
initially airstrikes could not stop the horror on the ground. That
did not prevent unanimity here and within NATO to begin the
military response.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's miscalculation has been much more severe, namely
that NATO's and America's will to persevere could be broken. The
reverse is occurring, and Milosevic can no longer even count on a
continued taboo against the use of ground troops in combat against
him.
</P>
<P>
   For those who were listening carefully, Clinton said last Friday
only that there is a ``good possibility'' our objective can be met
with air power alone. And he pointedly noted that the air campaign
would be necessary either on its own or as prelude to the insertion
of troops.
</P>
<P>
   As Milosevic knows by now, the scheduled rotation of one of the
First Infantry Division's brigades from Germany to Kuwait was
halted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Democracies can be maddeningly slow to act, but it should be
increasingly clear that the response to the worst aggression in
Europe since the Nazis is not going to be perfunctory _ fittingly.

FREE VOICE-MAIL SERVICE AIMED AT YOUNG ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For teenagers and young adults who want to be liberated from
their parents' phone lines, a California company is offering a free
voice-mail service this month that they think is one step toward
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The service is called EchoBuzz, and it requires users to listen
to three to 10 seconds of advertising before using the voice-mail
program. The service is being aggressively marketed in the Los
Angeles area for now, but anyone in the country of any age can sign
up and receive an activated password for use this month.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Ung, chief executive officer of Blue Diamond Software,
which provides the EchoBuzz service, said the user dials a
toll-free 800 phone number, then enters a membership number and
password. After hearing the ads, the user can send and retrieve
messages. Anyone can deliver a message to a member, as long as the
user has the 800 number and the receiver's membership number.
</P>
<P>
   To sign up, users fill out a brief questionnaire at the
company's Web site (http://www.echobuzz.com). The company promises
confidentiality with the information it obtains, which includes the
member's name, address, gender, age, and e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Although anyone can sign up, company officials acknowledge their
marketing and advertising is geared to the 15- to 19-year-old crowd
with a growing need for independence from their parents. The Web
page is tailored to teens, and after signing up they get a thank
you e-mail with a note emphasizing their ability to have a more
independent life with this service.
</P>
<P>
   ``EchoBuzz is ideal for teens that want to stay connected and
maintain their privacy without having their own phone lines,'' Ung
said. ``The service also benefits parents who get tired of taking
telephone messages for their busy, hard-to-reach teenagers.''
</P>
<P>
   A touch-tone phone is not needed for this service. EchoBuzz has
speech-recognition technology that allows the service to be used
hands-free.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said different regions of the country will be
activated at different times. If a particular region does not have
enough subscribers, there might be a delay in the start-up date.
All parts of the country are expected to be activated by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   EchoBuzz members will be able to send, retrieve, forward, save,
and reply to messages, as well as set up a group distribution list.
For example, if soccer practice is rescheduled, one message can be
broadcast to the entire soccer team distribution list as long as
everyone on the team is a member.
</P>
<P>
   The voice-mail service has some similarities to a program
unveiled three months ago by a Maryland company, BroadPoint
Communications. It offers free long-distance phone calls for anyone
willing to listen to advertisements first. BroadPoint's Freeway
service can be used after signing up through its Web site at
http://www.broadpoint.com.
</P>
<P>
   BroadPoint, which is unrelated to the EchoBuzz voice-mail
venture, has more than 80 advertisers, including Blockbuster,
Rolex, and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Ung said he could not disclose what advertisers are part of his
free voice-mail service, but he said they include well-known
soft-drink, fast-food, music, and entertainment companies. The
advertisements offered will be tailored to gender and age group.
</P>
<P>
   Said spokeswoman Kimberly Goolsby, ``A guy won't get a feminine
hygiene ad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Potential snags with offer
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We've gotten several complaints about pantyhose promotions that
promise a free sample, but then end up billing you for extra pairs
you never wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This year we got a postcard offering us a free pair of Silkies
pantyhose in the color and size of our choice. The words ``Free
Sample'' are featured prominently on the postcard. Only on the back
does the fine print read that, after sending you a free sample, the
company will automatically send you shipments of four pairs every
month for $3.58 a pair, plus shipping and handling. They will bill
you for all of these monthly shipments, unless you write them and
tell them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they also mention that you can return any pantyhose
you don't like, but keep in mind that you'll pay for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   When we called the Hoisery Corp. of Philadelphia asking about
their Silkies promotion, they responded by faxing us a copy of
their ``offer terms'' that say you can cancel at any time. Their
promotion is probably legal, because they do disclose in the
original postcard that you are entering into a potential long-term
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is many consumers don't realize this until they are
left with many unwanted pantyhose. This kind of ``free offer'' with
strings attached is common in the magazine and CD promotional world
as well. If you want a truly free pair of pantyhose, you should
send a ``cancel order'' postcard as soon as you get the free pair.
</P>
<P>
   In testing their no-obligation promise, we accepted a free pair
of Silkies in January. When it arrived, we instantly sent a
postcard canceling future shipments. We haven't heard from them
since.

`SERB AT HEART,' BUT US NATIVE IS TORN BY WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REZEVICI, Yugoslavia _ Caught between Serbia and the US Sixth
Fleet, Marko Taylor, a genial 38-year-old builder from Baton Rouge,
La., may bebe one of the last ordinary Americans living in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombs pound Belgrade and other areas, and anonymous Serb
nationalists telephone death threats against Taylor's family, he's
wondering if it just might be time to head for surroundings that
are more congenial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd expected to live my life here,'' he said sadly, standing
atop the nearly completed three-unit apartment building into which
he has poured all of his energy and most of his savings since
moving two years ago to this scenic village perched on a bluff high
above the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it looks like this place is set to become America's next
Vietnam, not the kind of place I'm comfortable keeping my family,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been told to leave Yugoslavia by the US State
Department. Aside from a dozen of so journalists covering the
crisis from within Yugoslavia, diplomats believe Taylor may be
among the last American citizens stubbornly hanging on. That's a
precarious position, given the deepening anger at the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was born in Alabama and raised in Louisiana. But his
mother is Serbian, and he inherited a love of the language, the
culture, and the Orthodox Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I'm a Serb at heart,'' said Taylor, who speaks with
a soft Southern drawl. ``But I suppose I could have picked a better
time to discover my roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Taylor married a Serb woman _ Milena, 25, a
former fashion model from Belgrade. With their infant son,
Dimitrje, they settled in Rezevici in 1997, after Milena earned her
master's degree from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made a decision I didn't want my boy growing up in the
States. It's a culture so totally overwhelmed by mass marketing,
drugs, sex and violence,'' he said, adding with a laugh:
``Obviously, I'm come to just the right place to escape violence.
Talk about out of the frying pan . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He and Milena acquired a 300-year-old stone house that had been
damaged by an earthquake. They toiled 105 days to rebuild it into a
breezy, spacious home, with an apartment downstairs for his
parents, who joined him after his father retired from a veterinary
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Marko Taylor also cleared several acres below the house where he
planted potatoes, cabbage, peppers, onions, and cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no harvest. ``We've been getting phoned death
threats, the level of anti-American hatred just about doubles with
every smart missile slamming into a bridge or a power plant. I'd
chosen to live among these people, but I'm the enemy now,'' he
said. ``There's just too much risk for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is a builder, not a politician, and follows the war only
on CNN and other news broadcasts he receives by satellite
television. He said he feels trapped in a war between the two
countries he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take the American out of me, but neither can you
take the Serb,'' he said. ``It's a part of who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as profoundly disturbed by TV images of
ethnic Albanians made homeless by Serb paramilitary thugs, backed
by the military of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shock to see this being carried out in a country that
by any other measure is civilized. These are just horrific acts,''
he said. ``But I don't think the US fully understands what it's
getting into, and I can't help but feel there still might have been
some diplomatic solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he believes, Yugoslav civilians will suffer most
from the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hitting power plants, we're hitting fuel depots,'' he
said. ``Come winter, there's going to be a big dying here, and this
time, it will be Serbs who will be victims.''

CONGRESS PONDERS ITS PLACE IN KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Richard G. Lugar says the United States is
in danger of ``losing the war in Kosovo.'' Senator Robert
Torricelli says the campaign is ``never likely to succeed.''
Senator Tim Hutchinson says the ``normal rallying around the
President during a military action never really happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite a growing congressional chorus of complaints about
US military efforts in Yugoslavia, the Capitol hallways are
virtually deserted. There are no congressional hearings on NATO
airstrikes. No debates on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there calls for Congress to return from its two-week
recess for an emergency wartime session. And as elected officials
take to the airwaves to express their various concerns, shaking
their fists on television and in newspaper op-ed columns, their
absence here seems to reflect an increasing congressional identity
crisis when it comes to waging war.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1941 has Congress declared war, and never has Congress
invoked the War Powers Resolution of 1973, instituted to limit the
authority of the president following the quagmire in Vietnam. From
Korea to the conflict in Kosovo, in fact, Congress has never set
the course for military action by challenging the president,
despite numerous interventions abroad and countless hearings and
debates back home.
</P>
<P>
   While there are plenty who say that is the way it should be _
with the president and Congress presenting a united front during
wartime _ there are some who question whether elected officials
have washed their hands too much, abdicating responsibility if
something goes wrong in a foreign conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complexity of the Balkan campaign, both houses of
Congress debated it for a total of 13 hours. Then, once airstrikes
were nearly under way, members of Congress passed a resolution to
support the NATO campaign, a resolution to endorse peacekeeping
troops, and a resolution saying they support the military. Then
they left for Easter break.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has done ``very little, and I don't understand it,''
said Representative Bill Goodling, a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president gets us involved. Then as a Congress, you have
to say, `Well, we now have to support our troops,' '' said
Goodling, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who plans to introduce
legislation to block any funding for US ground troops in Kosovo.
``It's tough to get ahead of his moves. That's what scares me
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The inherent wartime tension between Congress and the president
is as old as the nation, purposely written into the Constitution to
keep both branches in check. Congress is supposed to declare war;
the president, as commander in chief, is supposed to send troops
marching into battle.
</P>
<P>
   But the nature of modern-day conflicts has muddied the
definition of war, and the War Powers Resolution has done little to
bolster the role of Congress in controlling when and where US
troops engage in combat, members and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1973 resolution, the president has 48 hours to notify
Congress after dispatching soldiers into a dangerous conflict.
Congress then has 60 days _ plus a possible 30 extra days if
demanded by the president _ to specifically authorize the use of
troops. Without that authorization, or an outright declaration of
war, US troops are supposed to be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, members of Congress and analysts said, withdrawals
never occur because the War Powers Resolution is never formally
triggered by the president or Congress. Congress _ wanting neither
to embarrass the president with what is essentially a veto, nor to
increase its own liability in case of a tragic outcome _ is left to
influence the process in less formal ways, such as public criticism
or private meetings with the military and administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old story: You have a lot of them screaming
about how stupid it is, about what bad policy it is, but how in the
end they have to support the troops,'' said Gordon Silverstein,
author of ``Imbalance of Powers,'' an analysis of foreign policy
and the Constitution. ``In the end, if this is a total disaster,
Congress can say, `I told you so.' And if it's a great success,
they can say, `of course Congress was supportive of the troops.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There have been signs that the struggle for congressional
control is growing. Before the current recess, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott introduced legislation that would have blocked
funding for troops in Yugoslavia _ a tack Congress has not taken
since 1993, when it cut off funding for the mission in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Representative Tom Campbell, a Republican from
California, wrote a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert
requesting a trigger of the War Powers Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   And throughout the break, congressional leaders have been in
contact with the administration. Republican Senator John W. Warner
of Virginia, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has
held twice-weekly briefings on Capitol Hill with military leaders.
Democratic Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut flew to
Brussels to meet with NATO officials. And Hutchinson, a Republican
from Arkansas, was pushing Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen to
allow legislators to visit the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of how much muscle Congress should flex will
probably not take center stage until both houses reconvene,
particularly as the push for US ground troops grows. When that
issue comes to the fore, said Campbell aide Suhail Khan, President
Clinton would be wise to ``invest members of Congress in the
decision, so that if and when we have bodybags, they go back to
individual districts . . . to explain it to constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If members just put up their hands and say, `I don't know, the
president is doing this,' '' he said, ``that doesn't make for good
policy.''

ACROSS THE BORDER, APPARENT MASSACRE COULD BE OBSERVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRUMA, Albania _ The day, eerily enough, started with death.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men in the tiny Kosovo village of Goden were at the
home of a friend, Bajram Morina, whom they had buried four days
earlier. In a customary Muslim wake, 20 men of the hamlet, which
had only 200 residents in all, gathered at 7 a.m. every day,
drinking coffee and talking about their deceased friend, who had
lived his entire 75 years in Goden. The women in the village were
home, making breakfast of bread, cheese, and milk for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The hillside village consisted of only 20 stone houses, each
with a red-tiled roof. Everyone knew one another, and the passing
of one of Goden's elders was a somber event.
</P>
<P>
   But at about 9 a.m., the solemnity was violently broken,
according to the accounts of about 20 villagers interviewed here
after fleeing Kosovo. And almost uniquely among the tales of
atrocities told by Kosovar Albanians, much of their story has been
corroborated by an independent observer who was watching the
village from across the nearby Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Serb soldiers, the villagers said, stormed into their houses,
brandishing 12-inch knives and machine guns and ordering everyone
to get out. They wore green camouflage army uniforms, and a few
wore yellow bandannas.
</P>
<P>
   Women, children, and a few men not at the wake were herded into
the street. Some were forced to stand in a waist-deep hole. Around
them, they could see their homes start to burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard them call on the other forces to kill us in the
hole,'' said Sabrinje Osmanaj, 50, as she recounted the terror of
that Thursday morning. Children cried, screaming for their parents.
Frantic women worried what had become of their husbands and
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threatened us, saying, `The order is to execute you all,'
'' said Rokmane Ferraj.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the village, which has but a single road,
35-year-old Drita Osmanaj was preparing breakfast when eight
children who had been playing in the courtyard raced into the
kitchen, screaming that ``the Serbs were coming into the village,''
she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the Serb soldiers were in her house, demanding
that she and the children get out. ``We didn't even have time to
get our shoes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marched to the center of the village, Drita Osmanaj saw her
husband, Zumer, standing in one of two lines of 10 men each. She
couldn't make eye contact with him, but she saw he was pale.
</P>
<P>
   From the corner of her eye, Drita watched as the Serbs lined up
the men along the wall of a house owned by a farmer named Hamez
Osmanaj, another member of the village's dominant Osmanaj clan. The
house was in flames.
</P>
<P>
   The 20, including Hamez, two teachers, and the director of the
town's only school, were forced to kneel with the hands behind
their heads, facing armed Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were crying, but the Serbs said, `Why are you looking at
the men? Just keep moving,' '' recalled Drita Osmanaj, who is now
staying with a family in Kruma.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the village was forcibly gathered into a group and
taken to a clearing on the outskirts of town. ``The whole village
was there, and we could see the whole village in flames,'' said a
tearful Fane Osmanaj, 45.
</P>
<P>
   The men were never seen again, the Goden villagers said. The
villagers heard shots, dozens of them said, but no screams. They
were too far away to see or hear the fate of their menfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the slightest idea if they are alive, dead, or
massacred,'' said Ferraj, sitting in a bare room with no furniture
other than mattresses on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many of the reported atrocities, the attack on
Goden had an independent witness, although at a distance. As an
observer for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, Owen O'Sullivan was looking down on Goden from his
observation post on the Albanian side of the border that Thursday,
the morning after the first wave of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   From the hilltop vantage point, ``I saw the cleansing myself,''
said O'Sullivan, a former commandant in the Irish military. He saw
the women and children being forcibly marched toward a schoolyard.
He saw 20 men being marched in a line. He saw the women and
children being taken to another part of town, and then the 20 men
were taken out of his view.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the shots: ``a sustained burst of gunfire, followed by
a silence,'' O'Sullivan said. Finally, O'Sullivan heard
staccato-like, single shots, ``as if they were finishing them
off,'' the OSCE observer said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan then saw some Serb soldiers pull away from the
village in trucks, which held no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the 174 women, children, and a few men of Goden were on
their way to the Albanian border, driven along by Serb soldiers. It
is only 2 miles from the village, but it took the villagers, some
wearing only slippers, hours to walk the only mountain road that
was not mined. They reached the border late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After they left their homes and began walking to a clearing on
the way, the Serbs stole the women's jewelry and taunted the
travelers. ``We told them we want to stay here, in Kosovo,'' said
Fane Osmanaj. ``But they said, `There is no place for you here. For
years, you have been asking to join your brothers in Albania. Go _
because this is Serb land, not Albanian land,' '' Fane Osmanaj
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At the mountaintop border pass, Serb soldiers took their last
verbal shot: ``They told us, `Turn your heads back once again and
see Kosovo, because you are never going to see it again,' '' Drita
Osmanaj said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Goden is typical of the tales told by refugees
fleeing Kosovo. And the international community, like O'Sullivan,
has watched helplessly from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Because foreign observers and journalists have been largely kept
out of Kosovo and central Serbia, the forced exodus and terrorizing
of Albanians can usually only be chronicled after the fact, through
the stories of the surviving victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tale of horror,'' O'Sullivan said. ``The consistency of
the stories is such that it would be impossible to invent them. The
only thing that changes is the time they were forced to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 174 villagers from Goden, the episode is as baffling as
it was terrifying. All of the residents interviewed insisted no
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army lived in their village.
</P>
<P>
   People were born, schooled, married, farmed, and died within a
small region of a few villages. The population ranged from a
2-month-old boy to Morina, who had just died at age 75. A few went
abroad to earn money to send home. But for most, life was simple
and relatively isolated from the increasingly violent politics of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never even seen a KLA soldier,'' said Ferraj, though she
said she occasionally heard the echo of gunfire from battles
between Serbs and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Some villagers speculated that the Serbs made a brutal error,
mistaking the Muslim wake for a meeting of KLA rebels. A
representative with the Dutch-based war crimes tribunal
investigating Balkan atrocities says he is probing several
incidents in Kosovo, including the possible massacre in Goden.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all the 174 can do is wait, and hope they can return
someday to a village that may no longer exist. And underlying their
misery is dread, the fear that 20 men of the village will never be
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid that the Serbs executed them, and they are in
God's hands,'' said 19-year-old Myrvete Osmanaj.

SPRING FORWARD, THEN FALL ASLEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're feeling extra sleepy this morning, join the club.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling should be no surprise, according to several
specialists on sleep. The whole week after the change to daylight
saving time is a period when our internal clocks are so out of
whack, everything from body temperature, coordination, sensitivity
to light, and the ability to perform mundane tasks is affected.
</P>
<P>
   Just traveling in a car will be riskier than on a typical
morning _ a frightening thought.
</P>
<P>
   Research in England, Canada, California, and elsewhere has shown
a consistent pattern. During the week after clocks spring ahead,
the rate of traffic accidents increases. A study in Canada, for
example, showed a 7 percent increase in deaths from auto accidents
during the week after the time shift.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side comes in the fall, when the clocks are set back
and everybody gets an extra hour to sleep. Then, the research
shows, accident rates go down.
</P>
<P>
   The best strategy for coping? Well, consider the obvious: Take a
nap. Says Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, president of Circadian Technologies
in Cambridge, Mass., former professor at Harvard Medical School,
and author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting a Good
Night's Sleep'': You don't want to go into the week
sleep-deprived.'' Ideally, going to bed up to an hour earlier than
usual should help start the week off right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Americans now are sleeping at least one to two
hours too little,'' said James Maas, professor of psychology at
Cornell University and author of ``Power Sleep.'' When that chronic
shortfall is compounded by an additional hour of deprivation
because of the annual clock change, Maas said in an interview,
``mood is affected. People are more stressed and irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Add that to a lowering of reaction times and coordination that
also typically result from insufficient sleep, and you have a
recipe for an unpleasant and risky morning commute this week, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem people will have waking up comes from the
sudden shift in lighting. Those who have welcomed being able to
wake in daylight for the last several weeks may suddenly find
themselves getting up in the dark again, and feeling drowsier as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light is the main synchronizer of the body clock,'' explained
Dr. David Avery, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral
science at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a
specialist on sleep. ``In the absence of light, our body clocks
tend to drift clockwise to later times.'' In other words, you're
going to feel sleepier later, and want to sleep longer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that can help reset the internal clock, he said, is
exposing yourself to morning daylight. ``Outdoor light, even on a
cloudy day, is 10 times brighter than most indoor lighting,'' Avery
said. ``So try to get outside as soon as possible in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Many physiological changes accompany the daily rhythm of our
internal clocks, Avery said, including a cycle in body temperature
that reaches a minimum in the early morning hours, typically
between 3 and 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid disrupting that cycle, it is important not to sleep in
a room that is too warm, several specialists emphasized. Ideally,
the bedroom temperature at night should be cooler than normal
daytime room temperatures. ``It's important for the body to cool
down before going to sleep,'' said Avery.
</P>
<P>
   But the temperature cycle can get thrown off. ``In the winter,
many of us are at our temperature minimum at 6 a.m. It feels like
the middle of the night, and physiologically it is the middle of
the night. In the spring, that minimum gets pushed
counterclockwise, and we're able to wake up more refreshed,'' Avery
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the dreaded time change. ``With the change, all of a
sudden we're waking up in the dark again, and waking up closer to
our temperature minimum. It feels more like the middle of the
night. It's like a mini-jet lag, like we're flying one time zone
eastward.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is affected in the same way, of course. Some
people's natural daily cycle tends to be shorter than 24 hours, so
they have a tendency to drift toward earlier sleeping and waking
times. For them, the time shift may actually feel beneficial, Avery
said. The difference, he said, usually corresponds to whether
people think of themselves as ``morning people'' or ``night
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the majority, the adjustment to the time shift will
bring drowsiness, and people should plan accordingly. Moore-Ede
stressed that individual differences are great, and that to some
extent plans for adjusting should be tailored to the individual.
But there are some general guidelines that apply:
</P>
<P>
   --Take naps. A nap can help to prevent you from starting off the
day with an added sleep deficit. But don't sleep too long: 20
minutes is considered ideal; any longer than that will propel you
into deep sleep and you will tend to wake up groggy, and have a
harder time getting to sleep at night. And afternoon naps during
the week, if possible, will help maintain a rested state and keep
you more productive.
</P>
<P>
   --Go to bed early. Ideally, getting to sleep an hour earlier
than usual (according to clock time) will keep your body on its
normal cycle, and help you ease into the shifted time.
</P>
<P>
   --Lay off the nightcaps. Alcohol is known to interfere with
normal sleep cycles, so especially during a period of transition,
such as the change to daylight saving time or a trip to a different
time zone, it is important to go easy on the drinking.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the most important news: All these measures will not
only help you make it through this week, they could also help you
to live longer. ``Healthy sleep is the most important determinant
of lifespan,'' said Maas. A large-scale ``meta-analysis'' that
looked at thousands of separate medical studies found that getting
enough sleep is more important than diet, exercise, or any other
factor in increasing people's longevity, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``The Matrix'' Eye-popping special effects do battle with
a dumb, dense script. The technowizardry, which owes as much to
Japanese anime and Hong Kong action ballets as to the
morphmeisters, carries the film past the kind of story that, when
you unravel it, makes you say, ``This is it?'' Keanu Reeves is OK
as humanity's unwitting savior from super-intelligent machines.
Carrie-Anne Moss adds more than her share of black-leather-clad zap
as his acrobatic guide. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``The Out-of-Towners'' Frantic yet mostly tired remake of the
1970 Neil Simon farce about a couple from Ohio chewed up by big bad
New York until they learn to behave like New Yorkers and fight
back. Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn play the couple this time
around, in a film that never quite meshes her warmth and his
technique. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``10 Things I Hate About You'' Surprisingly witty and
refreshing transfer of Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew'' to
an American high school. It works because there's no taming and no
shrew. Julie Stiles's Kate is a smart maverick with an icepick
tongue. Heath Ledger's cool loner Petruchio never tries to muscle
her, but wins her with sensitivity and a Gene Kelly dance routine.
(PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FL) !!! ``A Walk on the Moon'' Handsomely crafted directorial
debut by actor Tony Goldwyn, who delivers a well-acted period
piece, circa 1969. It revolves around the convergence of Woodstock,
the Apollo moonwalk, and Diane Lane's Jewish housewife and mother
on vacation in the Catskills, haunted by the thought that life may
be passing her by. She's susceptible to the low-key advances of
Viggo Mortensen's traveling man. Nice work, too, from Anna Paquin
as her teenage daughter embarking on her own summer of discovery.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the world's first war ``to stop genocidal violence'' merely
promoting it? It has certainly looked that way this week.
</P>
<P>
   After only four days of NATO's air attacks, the number of
Kosovars driven from their homes had risen to half a million, over
a quarter of the population; hundreds, perhaps thousands, had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   These were the people NATO had intervened to save. The war
seemed to have gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The final judgment on NATO's action may turn out to be quite
different, but only if events take a turn for the better, and do so
pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was working its way through the early items on its
order of business _ attacking air defenses, military bases,
communications centers and so on _ the Serb forces in Kosovo were
rounding up ethnic Albanians, driving families from their homes,
removing identity cards from fleeing refugees, and segregating men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   These are the familiar actions of ethnic-cleansers and, even
more sinisterly, of those about to embark on systematic slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that has taken place, and if so on what scale, is still
unknown, but the signs are ominous. Five of the Kosovars' leaders
are said to have been summarily executed, and tales of killing
abound.
</P>
<P>
   And though by midweek NATO was hoping that its air attacks were
at last frustrating the Kosovars' Serb tormentors, no one was
suggesting that the torment had ceased.
</P>
<P>
   If it goes on much longer, Kosovo threatens to become a
depopulated charnel house.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope of preventing that lies with a change of attitude
on the part of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president. An
opportunity presented itself on Tuesday with the arrival in his
capital, Belgrade, of a party of Russian peacemakers led by Yevgeny
Primakov, the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a feather in the Russians' cap if they could
persuade Milosevic to come to terms, and the West would be happy to
let them take the credit. But Russia, though it is a long-standing
friend of the Serbs, failed to get them to make enough concessions
to avert this crisis, and it seems to have been no more successful
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many another despot, Milosevic probably prefers to preside
over a heap of rubble than not to preside at all. And so far
defiance appears to have brought him only popularity among his own
people. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bombing, it is true, tends to strengthen the resolve of those
who are bombed before it starts to sap their morale, and perhaps
the Serb populace may yet turn against their president.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, too, he may in time decide that his country has put up
a plucky enough resistance to the brutal NATO onslaught, and will
gracefully give up the troublesome _ probably now indeed
ungovernable _ province of Kosovo, just as he has given up so many
other parts of the original Yugoslavia he once aspired to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, after all, has built his career by teaching the Serbs
that they should revel in martyrdom and defeat: the trouncing he
dwells on most was that delivered by the Ottomans in Kosovo 610
years ago, paving the way for their five centuries of subjugation
by Muslims. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So good riddance now to the Muslim Kosovars? Or rather to those
of them who might still be alive. If that thought is not to haunt
NATO's strategists, they must move faster than their plan for a
measured, weeks-long campaign once allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim must be to take control of Kosovo, or most of it, as
quickly as possible and then to run it as a protectorate, in
effect, until its Albanians are safe from slaughter by the Serbs
and its far fewer Serbs are safe from retribution by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees will then be able to return home, relieving neighboring
countries of a burden that increasingly threatens their stability.
</P>
<P>
   All this will be even harder to achieve from the air alone than
the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovars' guerrillas were an effective force, they might
do the necessary fighting on the ground, much as Croat soldiers did
during NATO's bombardment of the Bosnian Serbs in 1995. But the
Kosovars have yet to show they are a potent soldiery and, if they
should get the upper hand, NATO might find it hard to stop them
butchering the Serb minority _ and then declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   The West insists it does not want that. It does not want to
break up Yugoslavia, it says. It just wants an end to genocidal
violence. That means it wants neither side to win: not an easy
objective to achieve, especially when the use of ground troops has
been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   If words have to be swallowed in order to get NATO out of its
fix, these look like the ones to dispense with.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, NATO has only 12,000 troops in next-door
Macedonia, and the Serbs have 40,000 in Kosovo, or did before the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would need about 150,000 men to be assured of a decisive
victory. And even then it would not be a bloodless one: there would
be plenty of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   There would also, no doubt, be plenty of voices warning of
mission creep and Vietnam-like quagmires. Several NATO countries
might back out; in varying measures, Greece, Italy and the Czech
Republic are already dubious.
</P>
<P>
   The main objection, however, lies not in the prospect of
casualties but in the fact that it would take time to ready this
force _ time in which Milosevic could continue his butchery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO may now have to accept that, without soldiers on the
ground, it may not be able to get the Serbs out of Kosovo at all.
For that reason, it should be preparing to send troops in.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the West was not wrong in principle to intervene:
whatever the legal position, it was right to say, after every
effort had been made to reach a negotiated settlement, that it
could not tolerate the continued brutalities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The killings and ethnic cleansing of the past week are not the
work of the West; they are the work of Serbs, and they would surely
have taken place, albeit at a more leisurely pace, had NATO not
intervened, just as they were taking place before.
</P>
<P>
   The West's error was to will the end but not the means. Now it
must find the means.
</P>
<P>
   Failure will not just ensure a continuation of the brutality in
Kosovo; it will ensure that despots everywhere take heart. NATO is
not serious, they will say. It has no stomach for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   When the fate of innocent Kosovars is in the balance that is bad
enough. When western national interests are at stake, it will be
grave indeed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the world's first war ``to stop genocidal violence'' merely
promoting it? It has certainly looked that way this week.
</P>
<P>
   After only four days of NATO's air attacks, the number of
Kosovars driven from their homes had risen to half a million, over
a quarter of the population; hundreds, perhaps thousands, had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   These were the people NATO had intervened to save. The war
seemed to have gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The final judgment on NATO's action may turn out to be quite
different, but only if events take a turn for the better, and do so
pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was working its way through the early items on its
order of business _ attacking air defenses, military bases,
communications centers and so on _ the Serb forces in Kosovo were
rounding up ethnic Albanians, driving families from their homes,
removing identity cards from fleeing refugees, and segregating men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   These are the familiar actions of ethnic-cleansers and, even
more sinisterly, of those about to embark on systematic slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that has taken place, and if so on what scale, is still
unknown, but the signs are ominous. Five of the Kosovars' leaders
are said to have been summarily executed, and tales of killing
abound.
</P>
<P>
   And though by midweek NATO was hoping that its air attacks were
at last frustrating the Kosovars' Serb tormentors, no one was
suggesting that the torment had ceased.
</P>
<P>
   If it goes on much longer, Kosovo threatens to become a
depopulated charnel house.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope of preventing that lies with a change of attitude
on the part of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president. An
opportunity presented itself on Tuesday with the arrival in his
capital, Belgrade, of a party of Russian peacemakers led by Yevgeny
Primakov, the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a feather in the Russians' cap if they could
persuade Milosevic to come to terms, and the West would be happy to
let them take the credit. But Russia, though it is a long-standing
friend of the Serbs, failed to get them to make enough concessions
to avert this crisis, and it seems to have been no more successful
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many another despot, Milosevic probably prefers to preside
over a heap of rubble than not to preside at all. And so far
defiance appears to have brought him only popularity among his own
people. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bombing, it is true, tends to strengthen the resolve of those
who are bombed before it starts to sap their morale, and perhaps
the Serb populace may yet turn against their president.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, too, he may in time decide that his country has put up
a plucky enough resistance to the brutal NATO onslaught, and will
gracefully give up the troublesome _ probably now indeed
ungovernable _ province of Kosovo, just as he has given up so many
other parts of the original Yugoslavia he once aspired to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, after all, has built his career by teaching the Serbs
that they should revel in martyrdom and defeat: the trouncing he
dwells on most was that delivered by the Ottomans in Kosovo 610
years ago, paving the way for their five centuries of subjugation
by Muslims. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So good riddance now to the Muslim Kosovars? Or rather to those
of them who might still be alive. If that thought is not to haunt
NATO's strategists, they must move faster than their plan for a
measured, weeks-long campaign once allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim must be to take control of Kosovo, or most of it, as
quickly as possible and then to run it as a protectorate, in
effect, until its Albanians are safe from slaughter by the Serbs
and its far fewer Serbs are safe from retribution by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees will then be able to return home, relieving neighboring
countries of a burden that increasingly threatens their stability.
</P>
<P>
   All this will be even harder to achieve from the air alone than
the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovars' guerrillas were an effective force, they might
do the necessary fighting on the ground, much as Croat soldiers did
during NATO's bombardment of the Bosnian Serbs in 1995. But the
Kosovars have yet to show they are a potent soldiery and, if they
should get the upper hand, NATO might find it hard to stop them
butchering the Serb minority _ and then declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   The West insists it does not want that. It does not want to
break up Yugoslavia, it says. It just wants an end to genocidal
violence. That means it wants neither side to win: not an easy
objective to achieve, especially when the use of ground troops has
been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   If words have to be swallowed in order to get NATO out of its
fix, these look like the ones to dispense with.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, NATO has only 12,000 troops in next-door
Macedonia, and the Serbs have 40,000 in Kosovo, or did before the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would need about 150,000 men to be assured of a decisive
victory. And even then it would not be a bloodless one: there would
be plenty of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   There would also, no doubt, be plenty of voices warning of
mission creep and Vietnam-like quagmires. Several NATO countries
might back out; in varying measures, Greece, Italy and the Czech
Republic are already dubious.
</P>
<P>
   The main objection, however, lies not in the prospect of
casualties but in the fact that it would take time to ready this
force _ time in which Milosevic could continue his butchery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO may now have to accept that, without soldiers on the
ground, it may not be able to get the Serbs out of Kosovo at all.
For that reason, it should be preparing to send troops in.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the West was not wrong in principle to intervene:
whatever the legal position, it was right to say, after every
effort had been made to reach a negotiated settlement, that it
could not tolerate the continued brutalities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The killings and ethnic cleansing of the past week are not the
work of the West; they are the work of Serbs, and they would surely
have taken place, albeit at a more leisurely pace, had NATO not
intervened, just as they were taking place before.
</P>
<P>
   The West's error was to will the end but not the means. Now it
must find the means.
</P>
<P>
   Failure will not just ensure a continuation of the brutality in
Kosovo; it will ensure that despots everywhere take heart. NATO is
not serious, they will say. It has no stomach for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   When the fate of innocent Kosovars is in the balance that is bad
enough. When western national interests are at stake, it will be
grave indeed. &QL;

<P>
   The rest of the world does not usually take its lead from
America in social policy, but over the past few years droves of
delegations have turned up in New York City to find out how The Big
Apple has managed to bring down the murder rate from 2,200 in 1992
to 600 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero-tolerance policing'' was the answer they carried back and
spread around the world until it became the conventional wisdom
espoused by conservative and liberal politicians alike.
</P>
<P>
   At his party conference last year, Britain's prime minister,
Tony Blair, pledged to adopt it; Australia's John Howard is also a
believer.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after a horrible murder, New Yorkers are wondering
whether it is really the best way to keep the streets safe.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago New York City police burst into the foyer of an
apartment building in pursuit of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African,
shot 41 bullets at him and hit him 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Al Sharpton started a protest movement against the
killing, which has now taken on a respectable, middle-class life of
its own. For the past two weeks, hundreds have been courting arrest
every day outside the headquarters of the New York Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who is anybody in the black community or the
civil-liberties movement is there. Those arrested include David
Dinkins, the former mayor of New York, Kweisi Mfume, president of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP), Carl McCall, the state comptroller and New York's highest
elected black official, and, from the inevitable Hollywood
contingent, Susan Sarandon.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the killing that people object to. Diallo's death
is seen as the inevitable result of the new policing methods, which
have led to the increasing harassment of young black men. The
connection may be indirect. But politically it is powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of zero-tolerance policing came from an academic,
James Q. Wilson, who holds that allowing small crimes to pass
unpunished will encourage contempt for the law in larger matters: a
city in which people urinate in the streets will also be one in
which people rob each other.
</P>
<P>
   The police, he maintains, have lost control of the streets in
many cities. They need to reclaim it. New York City's mayor,
Rudolph Giuliani, and the former police commissioner, William
Bratton, leapt on these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, zero-tolerance policing in New York has mostly been
the job of the Street Crimes Unit. Under Bratton, it tripled in
size.
</P>
<P>
   Its officers began to search people, pretty much at random and
often with little cause, on the streets, in housing projects and in
apartment blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of arrests to searches is some measure of this: over
the past two years, the Street Crime Unit's records show that its
officers searched 45,000 people and arrested 9,500. But according
to the state attorney-general, Eliot Spitzer, police underreport
their searches, and the real number is probably five or ten times
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Young black men, in other words, are constantly frisked. This
practice was once familiar in Britain, where enthusiastic use of
the ``sus'' law led directly to the Brixton riots in London in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, though, a little habitual harassment is a small price to
pay for so many saved lives? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, there is much argument about the extent to which
these amazing figures can be attributed to zero-tolerance policing.
Evidence from other cities does not always support its proponents.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, for instance, has seen similar falls in its murder rate,
yet it rejected zero-tolerance policing in favor of close
coordination between the police, probation officers and black
leaders, and an effort to get guns off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the price paid has not been evenly shared. Blacks
have paid it, whites have not. New York's blacks are angry now, and
America does not need to stoke its racial fires.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has apparently seen the danger. He has belatedly met a
group of the protest leaders to discuss their demands. He has also
announced that the number of black and Latino officers in the
Street Crime Unit will be increased.
</P>
<P>
   As practiced in New York, zero-tolerance policing has gone too
far. New Yorkers fear that abandoning it will mean a return to the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   They should remember, though, that there are other ways of
keeping down the murder rate that are less costly in terms of race
relations and the good name of the police.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of that spectrum stands gun control. After all,
countries where gun ownership is tightly controlled do not tend to
have American murder levels.
</P>
<P>
   The number of murders in the whole of Britain _ 780 in 1997 _ is
only slightly higher than in newly peaceful New York City. &QL;

A PRAYER FOR THE DYING 
By Stewart O'Nan. Henry Holt. 
195 pp. $22. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether in spite or because of his protean talents, Stewart
O'Nan has cheekily announced from time to time that he would rather
be known as a horror writer than as a literary one. This
provocative statement offers a sly salute to the scary guys he
reveres (Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King), but it also suggests the
central position in O'Nan's fiction of his own version of the
uncertainty principle. The things we most believe in can turn on a
dime; war may be hell, but so are cruelty and betrayal and a
blighted conscience _ the wounds visited on a soldier and his
family in its aftermath. A sunny day in an O'Nan story is not to be
trusted: It could well be masking an apocalyptic fire, or offering
one last piece of beauty before the siege.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of these qualities (suspenseful timing, spooky ambience,
revelatory metaphor) has recently resulted in a little cross-genre
I'll call highbrow terror, enjoying a crest in publishing these
days with works such as Ian McEwan's ``Enduring Love'' and William
Trevor's ``Felicia's Journey.'' In ``A Prayer for the Dying,''
which feels intentionally elliptical, O'Nan takes his already noir
sensibility and turns it up a notch. He has created a spare,
ominous portrait of a small Wisconsin town in the years after the
Civil War, and the result is as subtle and insistent as an autumnal
twilight. But it's summer in the town of Friendship when the novel
opens: full of cool ponds and sweet voices of children and the play
of light upon the fields. Sublime, in other words, which must mean
something horrid has already made it across the county line.
</P>
<P>
   O'Nan credits Michael Lesy's cult classic ``Wisconsin Death
Trip'' with inspiring this story, which also owes a nod to Albert
Camus's ``The Plague'': As the young protagonist, Jacob Hansen,
makes his way through his daily rounds in Friendship as sheriff,
undertaker, and preacher, he runs into a series of unexplained
deaths. A tramp moving through town, a former soldier still
wandering six years after the war, is found dead in the woods. A
woman is delirious in a meadow, crying out for Jesus; in two days
she'll be dead. Jacob has to go out to the elderly Sullivan
sisters' place and shoot their mare, who is wild-eyed and foaming
at the mouth with blood. Intent upon giving hope to the living even
as he buries their dead, Jacob is also half the town's public
health department _ the other half is old Doc Guterson, who quickly
realizes that what he's seeing is an epidemic of diphtheria.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prayer for the Dying'' covers two infinite weeks in that
terrible summer, when Jacob and Doc must decide if and how to
quarantine the town, tend to the terminally ill, isolate the
still-contagious bodies. Doc has already sent his wife out of town;
Jacob has instead tried to keep his beloved Marta and their new
daughter, Amelia, at home in isolation. Every new cough is a
terror; every new terror must be swallowed, lest it cause a panic.
The morning church bells tally up the losses by ringing out the
ages of the dead, who get younger with each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the bells will eventually toll for thee, which
brings us to a tricky problem with ``A Prayer for the Dying.'' The
novel is recited, with laconic gravitas, entirely in the second
person, that second person being Jacob. ``The two of you sit there
a minute in the cool room, pondering what this means to Friendship.
Your thoughts refuse to connect, run together like the cicadas
outside, screaming in the trees.'' Leaving aside the possibility
that Jay McInerney's ``Bright Lights, Big City'' may have tainted
forever the notion of writing an entire novel with the ubiquitous
``you,'' this is a deeply disconcerting point of view, at least
initially. I assume that its use here is meant to ensure a kind of
forced intimacy in the face of horror _ Jacob as Everyman, his
failings and fears and moral choices ones that You, too, Universal
Reader, might have made when those bells tolled for thee. It's
surprising to me that this device works even some of the time,
given that it's a fairly contrived effort to merge Jacob's
consciousness with ours. But the story at the heart of the novel
still manages to be stronger than this misconceived narrative
viewpoint, and one eventually reads past it to the saga of a town
in agony.
</P>
<P>
   What O'Nan does splendidly in ``A Prayer for the Dying'' is
flesh out his story with compelling historical accuracy without
ever showing his hand. The mortician's craft, the near-futile
efforts to quarantine a town, the ways in which the medical
paradigm of the 1870s dealt with an air-borne bacteria _ these are
elements central to Friendship's tragedy and yet they appear with
seamless delicacy. Much of what Jacob knows and loves about his
life and community will be challenged or destroyed, and the ways he
chooses to meet this adversary _ his tools of faith and
pathological denial and perseverance _ will form the moral core of
this awful, elegiac story. ``Crazy Jacob the Undertaker,'' the town
boys call him, and while some of that scorn is leveled at any man
who takes care of the dead, it also speaks to Jacob's
eccentricities: his talking gently to the bodies he prepares for
burial, his praying to a God he's only half-heartedly sure of, his
own private troubles he brought home from the war. Those hardships,
while instructive, were scant protection from the enemies he fights
now: an epidemic, a wildfire to the north, a town panicking under
the threat of both.
</P>
<P>
   A minor caveat: It's best to read this brief and gripping novel
without knowing too much about it first, because much of its power
derives from the ink stain of unknown terror at its margins. O'Nan
indulges in a few moments of Revelations overkill _ a fire in the
lake, a flock of sparrows plunging from the sky _ but he largely
allows understatement to be his chilling guide. The terse,
hand-painted signs that Jacob posts outside of Friendship read,
simply, ``Town Sick.'' That's plenty frightening enough, and it
doesn't need a metaphor to drive home the message.
</P>
<P>
   After fear comes its leaden reality, of course, and if Jacob has
learned anything in his brief years upon this earth, ``it's that
hope is easier to get rid of than sorrow.'' ``A Prayer for the
Dying'' is heavy with that grim truth, even as it delivers to us a
man who, through madness and the halls of grief, tried to do the
best he could.

   ``Why can't a woman be more like a man?'' mused Henry Higgins in
``My Fair Lady.'' His wish is coming true.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of decades, women have gained much ground
in the battle between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, many have the right to equal pay; at school, girls
are now getting better grades than boys; and in most rich economies
women are taking the lion's share of the new jobs, while
traditional jobs for the boys in heavy industries disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Finance used to be a man's world, about which women were told
not to worry their pretty little heads. But according to a study by
two American economists, women are better investors than men,
earning a higher average return on their money.
</P>
<P>
   Even male sports are no longer safe, with ladies' football teams
and female boxers. And experts predict that women could soon
outperform men in long-distance swimming and the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end?
</P>
<P>
   With a further indignity, that's where (though for whom is less
clear).
</P>
<P>
   One area where men have always had a huge advantage over women
is in the call of nature: women, unlike men, have to endure long
queues outside the ``ladies' room.''
</P>
<P>
   But equality is emerging here, too. Thanks to a Dutch invention,
a women's urinal is now on sale. The so-called ``Lady P'' is
designed to speed the flow and cut those queues.
</P>
<P>
   Men will surely not take this sitting down. Understandably, the
poor things feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Britain's Equal Opportunities Commission has
received more complaints from men than women. And as male
executives supposedly feel downtrodden by female rivals, several
British firms are setting up male-only self-help groups to give men
the confidence to assert themselves in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Another study published this week suggests that the more a woman
earns relative to her partner, the greater the risk of a family
breaking up, whereas higher male earnings increase the chances of
its survival.
</P>
<P>
   If so, an economist might conclude that equality for women has
gone too far, creating ``negative externalities.'' But then most
economists are men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, things haven't proceeded quite as far as these
anecdotes suggest: women still earn less than men in comparable
work and have a small share of top jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In America, only two of the chief executives of Fortune 500
companies are women, and only 11 percent of company directors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, men (your female commentary writer feels obliged
to point out) do seem worried. It is a puzzle. But men are
essentially irrational.
</P>
<P>
   The rational answer would surely be for men to seek new, equal
rights themselves. For example, in many countries conscription
applies only to men, and maternity leave mainly to women. Many
women have to make the agonizing choice between work and children:
men would love to face such a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Men are also discriminated against in pension schemes: they face
the same contribution rates as women even though they die earlier.
And the next time someone shouts ``women and children first,'' ask
why.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of solutions. Women take time off with the
excuse of ``women's problems'' so men must be allowed to recover
from hangovers and other ``men's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightclubs often have free ladies' nights, so men should have
free lads' nights. And once inside they should demand that women
buy their fair share of drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But most important of all, men should immediately claim equal
rights to do the cleaning, the ironing, the cooking and the diaper
changing. It's simply not fair that women monopolize all those
jobs. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a lot of blather about how the Internet interfaces with
democracy, but some things make it all seem real. www.scorecard.org
is as real as hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   This website, set up a year ago by the Environmental Defense
Fund, turns the modern data deluge into a jet hose pointed at
polluters. It allows anybody with a modem to find out who is
emitting what into his neighborhood, and to protest instantly.
</P>
<P>
   An old lopsidedness in democracy _ big business and big
government are better informed than individuals, so win most of the
big arguments _ is suddenly corrected.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that executives and bureaucrats could assure
small-fry citizens that problems had been analyzed, scientists
consulted, safeguards put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now citizens no longer need to accept those assurances
helplessly. They can log on to the Internet and check them, with a
few clicks of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard combines a vast reservoir of scientific data with
software that makes it accessible to the layman-activist. When you
arrive at the website, you can slot in your zip code and get a list
of the top ten polluters in your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the worst offender, and you get a draft letter, which
you are free to edit, asking why the culprit has failed to bring
down its emissions as much as other local firms. Click on the send
button, and the letter flies down a fax line to the plant's
manager.
</P>
<P>
   You can also e-mail the Environmental Protection Agency in
Washington, or make contact with fellow greens in your
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A cover headline in Chemical Week magazine captured the
industry's anxious early response to this. ``The Internet Bomb,''
it read.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking neighborhood polluters is only a fraction of what
Scorecard offers. You can rank offenders by industry, or by type of
pollution: Scorecard will generate league tables of carcinogen
producers, animal-waste dumpers, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   If you are suing a big drug company, you can trawl for damning
data to leak to the press.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put pressure on your governor to clean up the
environment, you can call up a league table ranking states
according to green indices: if he protests that he has done all he
can to cut pollution, you can point out that others have done more.
</P>
<P>
   David Roe, one of Scorecard's principal creators, preaches the
gospel of democratizing information.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s and early 1980s, he remembers, environmental
legislation floundered: the 1970 Clean Air Act, for example, was
meant to result in emissions standards being set for 200 toxic
chemicals, but after more than a decade only six had been regulated
in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, environmentalists switched their campaigning efforts
in a new direction. Rather than call on government to curb
pollution, they called for disclosure of emissions data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 they won this battle: a federal reporting requirement
was enacted, and California passed a ballot initiative that Roe had
drafted, requiring another layer of disclosure from state firms.
</P>
<P>
   The results are striking. By 1996 emissions of chemicals covered
in the legislation had fallen by 72 percent in California and by 45
percent in America as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how far Scorecard will increase this impact.
Many expect big changes. Greens in other countries are impressed by
Scorecard: Britain's Friends of the Earth has just launched its own
website copying it, and a plan is in the works to export the idea
to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Activists in other fields put faith in the idea of instant
Internet disclosure: a new ballot initiative in California, for
example, would require political candidates to report campaign
donations over the Internet within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the lobbyists who schmooze in Congress know that
they face a new source of competition. People all over the country
are e-mailing their representatives, often pressing them to take
positions inimical to those of the lobbyists' corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the significance of Scorecard is uncertain. The website
attracts a huge amount of traffic _ around ten times more than the
Environmental Protection Agency's competing site. But quite what
people are doing with this data is mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard's creators reckon that, in peak months last year, the
site's users sent about 1,000 protest faxes to polluters. That is a
pinprick. Besides, even if the number of protests multiplied, their
effect on policy would remain murky, thanks to the political
equivalent of Newton's third law.
</P>
<P>
   For every action in American democracy, an equal and opposite
reaction can usually be expected. In the case of green e-mail, the
reaction will probably come in several versions.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations will devise routine responses: they will program
their computers to recognize protesting faxes, and to send back
stock replies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corporations will hire consultants to generate
artificial grass-roots e-mail in support of their own positions, to
balance out the e-mail that congressmen receive from green
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Pestered from all sides, congressmen will have difficulty
distinguishing between genuine grass-roots indignation and the
astro-turf protests paid for by polluters. As a result, they will
stop worrying about the contents of their e-mail bags.
</P>
<P>
   Something like this has already befallen traditional letter
writing, and this suggests a disturbing theory about Scorecard's
eventual impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, letters to congressmen were relatively
rare, and so they were taken seriously, just as e-mail is today.
But by the 1970s professionally orchestrated letter-writing
campaigns began to undermine the letter-writers' impact.
</P>
<P>
   The slicker the letter-writers grew, the more congressmen were
inclined to dismiss their work as artificial.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, politicians grew increasingly cynical about people
seeking to influence them one way or the other: if they wanted to
know what their constituents were thinking, they called in the
pollsters and ignored their mail bags.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ironic indeed if the Internet revolution, celebrated
now as a catalyst for reinvigorated citizen participation, were
likewise confounded: if websites like Scorecard merely ended up
enhancing the power of professional consultants and their opinion
polls. &QL;

democracy, but some things make it all seem real. www.scorecard.org
is as real as hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   This website, set up a year ago by the Environmental Defense
Fund, turns the modern data deluge into a jet hose pointed at
polluters. It allows anybody with a modem to find out who is
emitting what into his neighborhood, and to protest instantly.
</P>
<P>
   An old lopsidedness in democracy _ big business and big
government are better informed than individuals, so win most of the
big arguments _ is suddenly corrected.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that executives and bureaucrats could assure
small-fry citizens that problems had been analyzed, scientists
consulted, safeguards put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now citizens no longer need to accept those assurances
helplessly. They can log on to the Internet and check them, with a
few clicks of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard combines a vast reservoir of scientific data with
software that makes it accessible to the layman-activist. When you
arrive at the website, you can slot in your zip code and get a list
of the top ten polluters in your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the worst offender, and you get a draft letter, which
you are free to edit, asking why the culprit has failed to bring
down its emissions as much as other local firms. Click on the send
button, and the letter flies down a fax line to the plant's
manager.
</P>
<P>
   You can also e-mail the Environmental Protection Agency in
Washington, or make contact with fellow greens in your
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A cover headline in Chemical Week magazine captured the
industry's anxious early response to this. ``The Internet Bomb,''
it read.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking neighborhood polluters is only a fraction of what
Scorecard offers. You can rank offenders by industry, or by type of
pollution: Scorecard will generate league tables of carcinogen
producers, animal-waste dumpers, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   If you are suing a big drug company, you can trawl for damning
data to leak to the press.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put pressure on your governor to clean up the
environment, you can call up a league table ranking states
according to green indices: if he protests that he has done all he
can to cut pollution, you can point out that others have done more.
</P>
<P>
   David Roe, one of Scorecard's principal creators, preaches the
gospel of democratizing information.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s and early 1980s, he remembers, environmental
legislation floundered: the 1970 Clean Air Act, for example, was
meant to result in emissions standards being set for 200 toxic
chemicals, but after more than a decade only six had been regulated
in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, environmentalists switched their campaigning efforts
in a new direction. Rather than call on government to curb
pollution, they called for disclosure of emissions data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 they won this battle: a federal reporting requirement
was enacted, and California passed a ballot initiative that Roe had
drafted, requiring another layer of disclosure from state firms.
</P>
<P>
   The results are striking. By 1996 emissions of chemicals covered
in the legislation had fallen by 72 percent in California and by 45
percent in America as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how far Scorecard will increase this impact.
Many expect big changes. Greens in other countries are impressed by
Scorecard: Britain's Friends of the Earth has just launched its own
website copying it, and a plan is in the works to export the idea
to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Activists in other fields put faith in the idea of instant
Internet disclosure: a new ballot initiative in California, for
example, would require political candidates to report campaign
donations over the Internet within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the lobbyists who schmooze in Congress know that
they face a new source of competition. People all over the country
are e-mailing their representatives, often pressing them to take
positions inimical to those of the lobbyists' corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the significance of Scorecard is uncertain. The website
attracts a huge amount of traffic _ around ten times more than the
Environmental Protection Agency's competing site. But quite what
people are doing with this data is mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard's creators reckon that, in peak months last year, the
site's users sent about 1,000 protest faxes to polluters. That is a
pinprick. Besides, even if the number of protests multiplied, their
effect on policy would remain murky, thanks to the political
equivalent of Newton's third law.
</P>
<P>
   For every action in American democracy, an equal and opposite
reaction can usually be expected. In the case of green e-mail, the
reaction will probably come in several versions.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations will devise routine responses: they will program
their computers to recognize protesting faxes, and to send back
stock replies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corporations will hire consultants to generate
artificial grass-roots e-mail in support of their own positions, to
balance out the e-mail that congressmen receive from green
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Pestered from all sides, congressmen will have difficulty
distinguishing between genuine grass-roots indignation and the
astro-turf protests paid for by polluters. As a result, they will
stop worrying about the contents of their e-mail bags.
</P>
<P>
   Something like this has already befallen traditional letter
writing, and this suggests a disturbing theory about Scorecard's
eventual impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, letters to congressmen were relatively
rare, and so they were taken seriously, just as e-mail is today.
But by the 1970s professionally orchestrated letter-writing
campaigns began to undermine the letter-writers' impact.
</P>
<P>
   The slicker the letter-writers grew, the more congressmen were
inclined to dismiss their work as artificial.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, politicians grew increasingly cynical about people
seeking to influence them one way or the other: if they wanted to
know what their constituents were thinking, they called in the
pollsters and ignored their mail bags.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ironic indeed if the Internet revolution, celebrated
now as a catalyst for reinvigorated citizen participation, were
likewise confounded: if websites like Scorecard merely ended up
enhancing the power of professional consultants and their opinion
polls. &QL;

   TOKYO _ The news of Renault's deal with Nissan was managed in a
very Japanese way.
</P>
<P>
   It dribbled out in bits and pieces, so that when Renault's
chairman, Louis Schweitzer, arrived last week to sign the deal to
take a $5.4 billion, 36.8 percent stake in the distressed Japanese
car maker, everything had been said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Renault's arrival lacked the drama of a Wall Street
takeover, it still sent a charge of excitement through Japan's
boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, only the wild-eyed were suggesting that Nissan's
backward managers might agree to join with a rival. That the
partner might be a gaijin (foreign) firm was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things are changing in Japan. Last year, Japanese firms were
involved in 908 mergers and acquisitions, 35 percent more than in
1997 and more than double the 1993 figure.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty more so far this year: between Mitsubishi
Chemical and Tokyo Tanabe, a pharmaceuticals firm; between two big
banks, Chuo Trust and Mitsui Trust; and, following Renault's
purchase, between Calsonic and Kansei, two car-parts makers
affiliated with Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cable &AMP; Wireless and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
(NTT), two telecoms giants, were slugging it out for Japan's
International Digital Communications (IDC), the first time a
foreign company has come up against a domestic one in a takeover
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other countries, Japan's merger boomlet hardly
registers. In America last year, 11,400 mergers were announced. Yet
this activity is precisely the reason why Japanese mergers could
now take off.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with foreign rivals, Japanese companies in a surprising
number of industries are now either too small or too dependent on
their home market.
</P>
<P>
   This gap is widest in banking, telecoms and pharmaceuticals,
where mergers among foreign competitors have been the most intense.
</P>
<P>
   NTT has the bulk to compete with anyone _ it is still the
world's biggest telecoms company by sales. But it is woefully short
of foreign business in a globalizing industry, which is why it is
chasing IDC, a small international carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese banks have big foreign operations. But they all
lack size, which determines how much they can spend on technology,
and therefore, increasingly, how competitive they are.
</P>
<P>
   Only one, the ``mighty'' Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, is, in terms
of revenues, among the world's 20 biggest banks: it ranks 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese pharmaceutical companies combine both weaknesses.
Takeda, whose sales make it the biggest of Japan's drug firms,
earns less than a third of the revenues of America's Merck or
Britain's Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, foreign sales in lucrative markets such as America
and Germany account for only 16 percent of Takeda's overall
revenues and 19 percent at rival Sankyo, compared with 41 percent
at American Home Products or 80 percent at SmithKline Beecham, a
British drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Evans of HSBC, a British bank, reckons that this year
there will be more mergers in the pharmaceuticals industry than in
any other.
</P>
<P>
   Now other manufacturers are at it too. The capital-goods
industry is still in reasonable shape, as are consumer-electronics
firms such as Sony and Matsushita, but the car makers look more
wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Small local suppliers are a large part of the problem. As the
biggest car companies try to bolt together global businesses, they
naturally want parts companies that can supply their brakes and air
conditioners worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Japan, parts makers are coming together: America's TRW,
for instance, recently bought Britain's LucasVarity. Except for
Bosch's purchase of a majority stake in Zexel, a Japanese parts
maker, in February, it is not yet happening in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity in Japan could really take off if reforms in the
country come to anything. More deregulation would help this, by
pitching Japanese managers against better-capitalized and more
diversified international rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's ``big bang'' financial deregulation is already doing
just that, with American firms such as GE Capital, Citigroup and
Merrill Lynch buying or building financial businesses in markets
that were once protected.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the liberalization of oil imports in 1996 has
convinced Japan's oil firms that their business is overcrowded.
Last year Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil merged to create Japan's
biggest oil company, with 24 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The government is beginning to remove some of the legal and
regulatory barriers to mergers. The Justice Ministry, for instance,
plans to rewrite Japan's commercial code to oblige minority
shareholders to sell their stakes to an acquiring firm once a
majority agrees to the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, minority shareholders can refuse to sell if they
do not like the deal, which makes it difficult for one company to
buy all of another one. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minority shareholders tend to block mergers if they are paid
with the buyer's shares, because they must immediately pay taxes on
their capital gain. So the finance ministry may now exempt these
shareholders from capital-gains taxes, unless they sell their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   A big remaining obstacle is Japan's network of
cross-shareholdings, which offer companies the protection of
friendly supplier- and banker-owners. Such links are beginning to
loosen; but, with more than 40 percent of shares owned by other
companies, it could take decades to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent developments, however, should speed things up. One is
the restructuring of Japan's banks, the biggest owners of Japanese
companies. Financial distress, or regulatory pressure, may push
them into selling their shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a proposal from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
to solve the underfunding of company pension schemes, which Goldman
Sachs, an investment bank, estimates is an YEN 80 trillion ($670
billion) problem. This would let firms bolster their pension
schemes with shareholdings in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes among shareholders would really start to change if
this were accompanied by rules requiring pension-fund trustees to
manage their investments in the interests of fund members, as
became law in America in the 1970s. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the small problem of the old men who run Japan's
companies. It is they who are most to blame for the rarity of
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the way Japanese boardrooms work seems to
conspire to produce inaction _ the ``face-saving'' avoidance of
painful announcements; the requirement that radical change demands
resignations; the fetishization of consensus-building, which makes
any sort of big decision difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This works not only to prevent mergers, but also to poison those
that do occur if, after merging, there is no change in management
or strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Japan's boardrooms are changing. Forward-thinkers, such
as Sony, Fuji Photo and Toshiba are leading the way by slashing the
size of their boards, shedding advisers and devolving day-to-day
responsibilities to their managers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs points to the lack of change
that has recently disappointed investors involved in three mergers
_ between Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical; between
Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship and Japan Line; and between Chichibu
Cement and Onoda Cement.
</P>
<P>
   That Renault has gone and bought its stake in Nissan without
winning management control of the company should make Schweitzer's
shareholders sweat too. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ The news of Renault's deal with Nissan was managed in a
very Japanese way.
</P>
<P>
   It dribbled out in bits and pieces, so that when Renault's
chairman, Louis Schweitzer, arrived last week to sign the deal to
take a $5.4 billion, 36.8 percent stake in the distressed Japanese
car maker, everything had been said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Renault's arrival lacked the drama of a Wall Street
takeover, it still sent a charge of excitement through Japan's
boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, only the wild-eyed were suggesting that Nissan's
backward managers might agree to join with a rival. That the
partner might be a gaijin (foreign) firm was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things are changing in Japan. Last year, Japanese firms were
involved in 908 mergers and acquisitions, 35 percent more than in
1997 and more than double the 1993 figure.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty more so far this year: between Mitsubishi
Chemical and Tokyo Tanabe, a pharmaceuticals firm; between two big
banks, Chuo Trust and Mitsui Trust; and, following Renault's
purchase, between Calsonic and Kansei, two car-parts makers
affiliated with Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cable &AMP; Wireless and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
(NTT), two telecoms giants, were slugging it out for Japan's
International Digital Communications (IDC), the first time a
foreign company has come up against a domestic one in a takeover
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other countries, Japan's merger boomlet hardly
registers. In America last year, 11,400 mergers were announced. Yet
this activity is precisely the reason why Japanese mergers could
now take off.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with foreign rivals, Japanese companies in a surprising
number of industries are now either too small or too dependent on
their home market.
</P>
<P>
   This gap is widest in banking, telecoms and pharmaceuticals,
where mergers among foreign competitors have been the most intense.
</P>
<P>
   NTT has the bulk to compete with anyone _ it is still the
world's biggest telecoms company by sales. But it is woefully short
of foreign business in a globalizing industry, which is why it is
chasing IDC, a small international carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese banks have big foreign operations. But they all
lack size, which determines how much they can spend on technology,
and therefore, increasingly, how competitive they are.
</P>
<P>
   Only one, the ``mighty'' Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, is, in terms
of revenues, among the world's 20 biggest banks: it ranks 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese pharmaceutical companies combine both weaknesses.
Takeda, whose sales make it the biggest of Japan's drug firms,
earns less than a third of the revenues of America's Merck or
Britain's Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, foreign sales in lucrative markets such as America
and Germany account for only 16 percent of Takeda's overall
revenues and 19 percent at rival Sankyo, compared with 41 percent
at American Home Products or 80 percent at SmithKline Beecham, a
British drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Evans of HSBC, a British bank, reckons that this year
there will be more mergers in the pharmaceuticals industry than in
any other.
</P>
<P>
   Now other manufacturers are at it too. The capital-goods
industry is still in reasonable shape, as are consumer-electronics
firms such as Sony and Matsushita, but the car makers look more
wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Small local suppliers are a large part of the problem. As the
biggest car companies try to bolt together global businesses, they
naturally want parts companies that can supply their brakes and air
conditioners worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Japan, parts makers are coming together: America's TRW,
for instance, recently bought Britain's LucasVarity. Except for
Bosch's purchase of a majority stake in Zexel, a Japanese parts
maker, in February, it is not yet happening in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity in Japan could really take off if reforms in the
country come to anything. More deregulation would help this, by
pitching Japanese managers against better-capitalized and more
diversified international rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's ``big bang'' financial deregulation is already doing
just that, with American firms such as GE Capital, Citigroup and
Merrill Lynch buying or building financial businesses in markets
that were once protected.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the liberalization of oil imports in 1996 has
convinced Japan's oil firms that their business is overcrowded.
Last year Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil merged to create Japan's
biggest oil company, with 24 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The government is beginning to remove some of the legal and
regulatory barriers to mergers. The Justice Ministry, for instance,
plans to rewrite Japan's commercial code to oblige minority
shareholders to sell their stakes to an acquiring firm once a
majority agrees to the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, minority shareholders can refuse to sell if they
do not like the deal, which makes it difficult for one company to
buy all of another one. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minority shareholders tend to block mergers if they are paid
with the buyer's shares, because they must immediately pay taxes on
their capital gain. So the finance ministry may now exempt these
shareholders from capital-gains taxes, unless they sell their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   A big remaining obstacle is Japan's network of
cross-shareholdings, which offer companies the protection of
friendly supplier- and banker-owners. Such links are beginning to
loosen; but, with more than 40 percent of shares owned by other
companies, it could take decades to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent developments, however, should speed things up. One is
the restructuring of Japan's banks, the biggest owners of Japanese
companies. Financial distress, or regulatory pressure, may push
them into selling their shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a proposal from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
to solve the underfunding of company pension schemes, which Goldman
Sachs, an investment bank, estimates is an YEN 80 trillion ($670
billion) problem. This would let firms bolster their pension
schemes with shareholdings in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes among shareholders would really start to change if
this were accompanied by rules requiring pension-fund trustees to
manage their investments in the interests of fund members, as
became law in America in the 1970s. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the small problem of the old men who run Japan's
companies. It is they who are most to blame for the rarity of
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the way Japanese boardrooms work seems to
conspire to produce inaction _ the ``face-saving'' avoidance of
painful announcements; the requirement that radical change demands
resignations; the fetishization of consensus-building, which makes
any sort of big decision difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This works not only to prevent mergers, but also to poison those
that do occur if, after merging, there is no change in management
or strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Japan's boardrooms are changing. Forward-thinkers, such
as Sony, Fuji Photo and Toshiba are leading the way by slashing the
size of their boards, shedding advisers and devolving day-to-day
responsibilities to their managers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs points to the lack of change
that has recently disappointed investors involved in three mergers
_ between Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical; between
Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship and Japan Line; and between Chichibu
Cement and Onoda Cement.
</P>
<P>
   That Renault has gone and bought its stake in Nissan without
winning management control of the company should make Schweitzer's
shareholders sweat too. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates is often compared to John D. Rockefeller, but the
closer parallel might be between Steve Ballmer and John D.
Archbold, the co-pilots of Microsoft now and Standard Oil 100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both got to know the industry titans in their early days,
Archbold as a surrogate son and court jester, Ballmer as a college
housemate and poker buddy.
</P>
<P>
   And both took over daily operations at a time when their company
was fighting a crucial antitrust battle, the first in 1897, the
latter in July last year.
</P>
<P>
   Archbold proved to be exactly the wrong choice to head Standard
Oil. He financed overseas expansion by keeping domestic prices
high, inflaming public opinion and fueling the political pressure
to break the company up.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is about to be put to the same test.
</P>
<P>
   He has just made his first big move as Microsoft's president,
designing the long-awaited restructuring the firm announced on
March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will no longer be organized around products such as
operating systems, but rather around customer groups: IT managers,
wired employees, developers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer hopes this will inspire programmers to write the
software that customers want _ not products dictated by the
mushrooming Microsoft bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that Ballmer would want to undertake such a
reorganization. Before he was promoted, he spent six years as
Microsoft's chief salesman. It was Ballmer and his team who took
the telephone calls from angry customers who complained again and
again about software that is difficult to install, crashes
regularly and has too many unwieldy features.
</P>
<P>
   What is more surprising is that he has been given the chance.
When Ballmer gets excited, it's time to unpack the earplugs.
Dressing down subordinates, he can be heard echoing through the
air-conditioning vents at Microsoft. His maniacal shouting has
already resulted in throat surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's verbal outbursts have also hurt his company's
reputation. Shortly after the Department of Justice began its
latest battle with Microsoft in October 1997, he bellowed at
reporters: ``To heck with (Attorney-General) Janet Reno.'' A few
weeks later at a trade show, he screamed ``What the consumer needs
is more, more, more Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he regrets those comments, and wants to ``stop saying
stupid things.''
</P>
<P>
   But when this big, balding man starts gesticulating wildly to
make a point, one minute a tyrant, the next a little boy, you
wonder whether his efforts to tone himself down can possibly last.
As Gates says, Ballmer ``exudes exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   This huge personality has undoubtedly shaped Microsoft's
corporate culture _ more, some even argue, than Gates himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the company in 1980, after marketing cake mixes at
Procter &AMP; Gamble and dropping out of Stanford University business
school, he has become a sort of rapid intervention force.
</P>
<P>
   Without his relentless salesmanship, the software firm would
have been much less commercially successful. He regularly called up
customers who had chosen competitors' products _ sometimes, it is
said, with dire threats.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly that alone should have disqualified Ballmer from the
top job at Microsoft at a time when it is accused of being a
reckless monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And he is a rum choice to teach superaggressive Microsofties to
play by the rules _ something the antitrust proceedings have shown
they need to learn.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is officially declared a monopoly, an unBallmerish
restraint will become essential. Should the court go further and
order ``structural'' remedies of the kind the Department of Justice
would like _ perhaps including the forced licensing of Windows to
competitors _ Microsoft would have to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a more favorable legal outcome, Ballmer faces
difficult times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer fanciful to suggest that Microsoft's big,
fully-featured computer-operating systems could go the way of IBM's
all-conquering mainframes. This is, in part, its own fault.
</P>
<P>
   To protect and expand its monopoly, it has added ever more
features to Windows, turning it into a hairball of software.
Development of Windows 2000 is already more than two years behind
schedule, because bugs multiply as fast as Microsoft's programmers
can splat them.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the world is no longer going Microsoft's way.
Televisions, telephones, and portable organizers with mini
operating systems threaten the hegemony of the Windows-based PC;
Linux, a rival operating system, is gaining ground; firms are
starting to rent both software and processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Money is moving from software to services, where Microsoft has
little worthwhile experience. It has, for example, invested huge
sums in its consumer websites, and made no money.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer seems to be aware of this weakness, moving his office to
the division that produces online services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft still has time to shift its amazingly lucrative
business, and nobody should underestimate the intelligence and
energy it will bring to bear when it decides it has to.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ballmer is the right person to drive Microsoft over the
bumpy road ahead is another matter. He has the brutality and
insider knowledge to impose painful choices. Yet should Gates
withdraw further from the day-to-day running of the company,
Ballmer may lack the techie credentials necessary to carry
Microsoft's talented engineers into new fields.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest danger, though, is that Ballmer channels his
terrifying dynamism into a fight to the finish for Windows. If he
does, he will go down in history as the Archbold of the digital
age. &QL;

WHAT HOLLYWOOD LEARNED AT PAPA'S KNEE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You ought to go to the movies more,'' a character says in
Ernest Hemingway's short story ``The Killers.'' ``The movies are
fine for a bright boy like you.''
</P>
<P>
   In this, his centenary year, Hemingway shines as a very bright
boy, indeed. On July 21, his 100th birthday, Scribner will release
a previously unpublished novel, ``True at First Light.'' The rights
to it went for a reported $1 million. Next Saturday and Sunday, the
Kennedy Library, which is the repository of Hemingway's papers,
will observe his centennial with a two-day conference boasting a
starry array of participants that includes four Nobel laureates and
seven Pulitzer Prize winners.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to the conference, on Thursday, playwright and
screenwriter David Mamet will introduce a Hemingway double feature
_ ``To Have and Have Not'' and the 1946 version of ``The Killers''
_ at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   For Hemingway, the movies were and were not fine. He happily
accepted the large sums Hollywood offered for screen rights. Yet
beyond what the movies might do for his bankroll, he disdained
them. He never thought much of film as an art form _ or at least
not American film _ and, unlike such contemporaries as William
Faulkner and F. Scott Fitzgerald, he resisted all efforts to lure
him to write for the studios. ``No, I'm top where I am,'' he told
his friend Howard Hawks, the director of ``To Have and Have Not.''
``I don't want to go out to Hollywood. I don't like it. And I
wouldn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last two statements are somewhat suspect. Hemingway liked
Hollywood well enough to befriend not just Hawks but also Gary
Cooper, Ava Gardner, Ingrid Bergman, and Marlene Dietrich. Nor, as
such associations suggest, was he averse to Hollywood's favorite
religion, the cult of celebrity. A larger-than-life image was
something he carefully cultivated and just as carefully traded on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemingway is himself a star,'' David O. Selznick, the producer
of ``Gone With the Wind'' once remarked. ``He has box-office.''
</P>
<P>
   He belongs alongside those men (and, appropriately enough in a
place that felt so attuned to Hemingway, men they all are) whose
artistic influence continues to shape American film. D. W. Griffith
invented the grammar and syntax movies still use three-quarters of
a century later. Hawks, John Ford, and Alfred Hitchcock showed
Hollywood its true calling, the exploration of genre. Elia Kazan,
as director, and Marlon Brando, as demiurge, put in place the
template for screen acting that remains dominant today. And
Hemingway did something nearly as important: He put into literary
practice and legitimized the way American movies present the world.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Great Train Robbery'' to ``The Thin Red Line,''
American film has had a single defining principle: Action is
character. The first person to put that principle on the page, to
validate it and demonstrate the extent of its artistic
possibilities, was Hemingway. Other writers of literary merit _
Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad, Jack London, Rudyard Kipling
_ had written stories predicated on adventure and set in exotic
locales. Not surprisingly, screen adaptations of the work of all
four have been plentiful. It was Hemingway, though, who updated
Descartes's ``I think, therefore I am'' into the far more filmable
``I do, therefore I am.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Action as character
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He made the relation between character and action axiomatic and
seamless. The author who in ``A Farewell to Arms'' assailed
abstractions (``Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or
hallow were obscene'') or who in ``Death in the Afternoon'' and
``Green Hills of Africa'' made action, in the form of fighting a
bull or hunting big game, seem a sacerdotal rite _ this was an
author Hollywood could, and did, thrill to. Other writers of the
time were trying to imitate the movies. The most obvious example is
John Dos Passos in his ``U.S.A.'' trilogy. Hemingway was doing
something different. He was moving in parallel to them and, in so
doing, helped enlarge them.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that his novels and stories provided Hollywood
with such good material (see accompanying story). It was, rather, a
question of attitude toward the portrayal of subject: the belief
that externalities mattered and carried meanings intrinsic as well
as extrinsic. It is a commonplace that Hemingway worshiped
technique. In his fiction, how things get done is as important as
what gets done, or why they they get done, or even who does them.
Far more than, say, gun or war or sex _ each of which Hemingway
also provides _ how is the motion picture camera's favorite
three-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Hollywood, the argument can be made that motion
pictures helped shape Hemingway, too. Even if he largely disdained
movies in later years, he hadn't always felt that way. He told The
New Yorker's Lillian Ross that as a boy he'd gone with his
grandfather to see Griffith's ``The Birth of a Nation'' no fewer
than 30 times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that very fact indicates how limited was the movies' effect
on Hemingway. The style of silent films was so revolutionary _ with
its close-ups and fades, zooms and montages _ that one can easily
overlook how hopelessly anachronistic its substance tended to be.
Nowhere is the disparity clearer than in Griffith's work, where the
formal properties of narrative are so innovative and the narrative
content itself so reactionary.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's art, the critic Hugh Kenner has written, ``was the
art of avoiding subtitles,'' and the arrival of sound coincided
with the arrival of his work in Hollywood (Hemingway first came to
the screen, via an adaptation of ``A Farewell to Arms,'' in 1932).
Sound toughened the movies and also particularized them. Melodrama
and slapstick, the two great modes of silent film, ``speak'' a
universal language. Talkies made the movies idiomatic. British film
became clipped, German film guttural, American film at once urgent
and laconic. In Hollywood, modern, muscular speech _ the gab and
palaver of precinct house and newsroom, of nightclub and union hall
_ replaced the mannered fustian of Victorian theater that had
provided silent film's language of feeling as well as the diction
for intertitles. Sound placed the movies firmly in the 20th
century, and few American writers of the late '20s seemed as up to
the minute as the author of ``In Our Time.''

<P>
   Bill Gates is often compared to John D. Rockefeller, but the
closer parallel might be between Steve Ballmer and John D.
Archbold, the co-pilots of Microsoft now and Standard Oil 100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both got to know the industry titans in their early days,
Archbold as a surrogate son and court jester, Ballmer as a college
housemate and poker buddy.
</P>
<P>
   And both took over daily operations at a time when their company
was fighting a crucial antitrust battle, the first in 1897, the
latter in July last year.
</P>
<P>
   Archbold proved to be exactly the wrong choice to head Standard
Oil. He financed overseas expansion by keeping domestic prices
high, inflaming public opinion and fueling the political pressure
to break the company up.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is about to be put to the same test.
</P>
<P>
   He has just made his first big move as Microsoft's president,
designing the long-awaited restructuring the firm announced on
March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will no longer be organized around products such as
operating systems, but rather around customer groups: IT managers,
wired employees, developers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer hopes this will inspire programmers to write the
software that customers want _ not products dictated by the
mushrooming Microsoft bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that Ballmer would want to undertake such a
reorganization. Before he was promoted, he spent six years as
Microsoft's chief salesman. It was Ballmer and his team who took
the telephone calls from angry customers who complained again and
again about software that is difficult to install, crashes
regularly and has too many unwieldy features.
</P>
<P>
   What is more surprising is that he has been given the chance.
When Ballmer gets excited, it's time to unpack the earplugs.
Dressing down subordinates, he can be heard echoing through the
air-conditioning vents at Microsoft. His maniacal shouting has
already resulted in throat surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's verbal outbursts have also hurt his company's
reputation. Shortly after the Department of Justice began its
latest battle with Microsoft in October 1997, he bellowed at
reporters: ``To heck with (Attorney-General) Janet Reno.'' A few
weeks later at a trade show, he screamed ``What the consumer needs
is more, more, more Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he regrets those comments, and wants to ``stop saying
stupid things.''
</P>
<P>
   But when this big, balding man starts gesticulating wildly to
make a point, one minute a tyrant, the next a little boy, you
wonder whether his efforts to tone himself down can possibly last.
As Gates says, Ballmer ``exudes exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   This huge personality has undoubtedly shaped Microsoft's
corporate culture _ more, some even argue, than Gates himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the company in 1980, after marketing cake mixes at
Procter &AMP; Gamble and dropping out of Stanford University business
school, he has become a sort of rapid intervention force.
</P>
<P>
   Without his relentless salesmanship, the software firm would
have been much less commercially successful. He regularly called up
customers who had chosen competitors' products _ sometimes, it is
said, with dire threats.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly that alone should have disqualified Ballmer from the
top job at Microsoft at a time when it is accused of being a
reckless monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And he is a rum choice to teach superaggressive Microsofties to
play by the rules _ something the antitrust proceedings have shown
they need to learn.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is officially declared a monopoly, an unBallmerish
restraint will become essential. Should the court go further and
order ``structural'' remedies of the kind the Department of Justice
would like _ perhaps including the forced licensing of Windows to
competitors _ Microsoft would have to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a more favorable legal outcome, Ballmer faces
difficult times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer fanciful to suggest that Microsoft's big,
fully-featured computer-operating systems could go the way of IBM's
all-conquering mainframes. This is, in part, its own fault.
</P>
<P>
   To protect and expand its monopoly, it has added ever more
features to Windows, turning it into a hairball of software.
Development of Windows 2000 is already more than two years behind
schedule, because bugs multiply as fast as Microsoft's programmers
can splat them.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the world is no longer going Microsoft's way.
Televisions, telephones, and portable organizers with mini
operating systems threaten the hegemony of the Windows-based PC;
Linux, a rival operating system, is gaining ground; firms are
starting to rent both software and processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Money is moving from software to services, where Microsoft has
little worthwhile experience. It has, for example, invested huge
sums in its consumer websites, and made no money.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer seems to be aware of this weakness, moving his office to
the division that produces online services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft still has time to shift its amazingly lucrative
business, and nobody should underestimate the intelligence and
energy it will bring to bear when it decides it has to.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ballmer is the right person to drive Microsoft over the
bumpy road ahead is another matter. He has the brutality and
insider knowledge to impose painful choices. Yet should Gates
withdraw further from the day-to-day running of the company,
Ballmer may lack the techie credentials necessary to carry
Microsoft's talented engineers into new fields.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest danger, though, is that Ballmer channels his
terrifying dynamism into a fight to the finish for Windows. If he
does, he will go down in history as the Archbold of the digital
age. &QL;

 UNDATED: ... Our Time.''

<P>
   Hawks said he learned about dialogue on the screen from reading
Hemingway. That is no small praise coming from the man who directed
such wonders of the spoken word as ``Bringing Up Baby,'' ``His Girl
Friday,'' and ``The Big Sleep.'' The lessons Hemingway had to teach
Hawks and his fellow filmmakers derived from his singular ability
to combine simplicity, indirection, and the appearance of realism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The art of indirection
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His self-proclaimed goal was le mot juste, the exact right word,
a phrase he took from Flaubert. The most obvious consequence of
such a search was that the resulting prose must needs be stripped
down and precise. This was just what movie people sought in their
own medium: the smallest number of words for the most amount of
action. More than that, though, Hemingway's own dialogue excelled
at indirection, in which a great deal might be said even as very
little is actually spoken. ``Three-cushion'' dialogue Hawks called
it: ``Because you hit over here and over here and go over here to
get the meaning. You don't state it right out.'' That very
waywardness gives dialogue an extra layer of verisimilitude.
Conversations are not equations, after all. But it must remain a
calculated waywardness if dialogue isn't to fall into mere
talkiness.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Hemingway's dialogue is all that realistic. It's
no more realistic than his famously stylized exposition. The point
is that it should seem so natural, and therein lies much of its
genius. So, too, with movie dialogue, which needs to be every bit
as artificial while never seeming at all stagy. The trick is to
keep the artifice from calling attention to itself. This Hemingway
did, and did mesmerizingly, through his offhand rhythms and simply
constructed sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The classic Hemingway hero is a man of feeling concealed within
a man of action: hard and inexpressive on the outside, sensitive or
even wounded within. He fights wars, hunts and fishes, drinks too
much, and (always) goes his own way. Yet he is also usually
introspective, cosmopolitan, worldly-wise.
</P>
<P>
   The Hemingway type provided a model for Hollywood to seize upon
in the creation of its own favorite hero: the tight-lipped
idealist, the hard-headed dreamer, the tough guy nursing a broken
heart. The highest expression of this type was Humphrey Bogart
during the '40s and '50s. Unlike that other great Hollywood type,
the John Wayne hero, who failed to express emotion for the simple
reason he didn't really feel any, the Bogart hero felt emotion, and
felt it deeply, but he held it in almost-constant check. The nature
of the Wayne figure's heroism lay in how many men he might kill in
the course of two hours. The truest measure of the Bogart figure's
heroism was his ability to function, and do so with seeming ease or
even bravado, despite the turmoil he contained within himself. His
every on-screen minute was a demonstration of the Hemingway ideal
of grace under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Bogart persona have come into existence if Hemingway
hadn't been providing prototypes for it throughout the '20s and
'30s? (In a nice instance of life imitating art imitating art,
Hemingway was a great admirer of the actor.) Rick Blaine, in
``Casablanca,'' can be seen as the ultimate Hemingway hero. Like
Nick Adams, of the early short stories, he's rootless. Like Jake
Barnes, in ``The Sun Also Rises,'' he's lived in Paris and must
share the woman he loves. Like Frederic Henry, in ``A Farewell to
Arms,'' he scorns authority (and his friendship with the cynical
Major Rinaldi recalls Rick's with the cynical Captain Renault).
Like Harry Morgan, in ``To Have and Have Not,'' he's smuggled guns.
Like Robert Jordan, in ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' he's an
anti-Fascist who fought in Spain. Like all those characters, he's
no stranger to violence and is most comfortable, if also least
happy, in a society of men without women.
</P>
<P>
   If Kazan and Brando created the template for American movie
acting, then Bogart created the most distinctive template for
American male movie stardom, a masculine ideal that continues both
to inspire and haunt us. Think of Harrison Ford, Gene Hackman, Nick
Nolte, Mel Gibson (in his more sober roles), the Tom Hanks of
``Apollo 13'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.'' They are Rick Blaine's
grandchildren _ and the great-granchildren of Robert Jordan,
Frederic Henry, Nick Adams. All of them can, with every
justification, call Ernest Hemingway ``Papa.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRHAVEN, Mass. _ It was one of the most drastic steps ever
taken to protect fish: 5,000 square miles of the open sea off New
England, including portions of legendary Georges Bank, were
declared off-limits to fishermen after they had nearly wiped out
the cod and other fish that live on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Almost five years later, the fish have started to recover, but
one species has prospered more than the others in the park-like
serenity of the closed areas. Scallops, New England's second most
valuable seafood, have grown so fat and plentiful that some
scallopers risk Coast Guard seizure of their boats to fish in the
forbidden waters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under heavy political pressure from the scallop industry,
fishing regulators are considering letting them back in to the
closed fishing grounds, launching an intense debate about where the
term goals of conservation must yield to the needs of hard-pressed
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every judgment they make is on the side of the fish, the
scallops, which is fine, but we never get a break,'' said Herman
Bruce, owner of the scallop boat Florence, tied up at Fairhaven's
Hathaway Wharf. ``Our frustration is that these stocks are rebuilt
and we should be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and some fishermen fear that the hard won
gains from the 1994 crackdown could unravel if scallopers fish
heavily in closed areas. The weighted metal dredges dragged behind
scallop boats catch not only scallops, but everything in their
path.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific concern is also growing about scalloping's impact on
marine life that has no commercial value but contribute to the
ecology, such as sponges or the homely barndoor skate, which were
driven to near-extinction because it is inadvertently caught in
fishermen's nets.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, critics of the reopening plan say it would set a bad
precedent by rewarding political pressure. The frustrated
scallopers hired a prominent Washington lawyer as well as former US
Representative Gerry Studds to plead their case, and appealed
directly to US Commerce Secretary William Daley, who oversees
fishery management, to consider reopening some scallop grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington politics is a poor substitute for hands-on
science,'' warned Robert H. Russell and Jennifer Atkinson of the
Boston-based environmental group, Conservation Law Foundation, in a
recent letter to the Gloucester Daily Times. ``It seriously
undermines a regional . . . system that is addressing, albeit
slowly, the tragedy of overfishing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the push to reopen Georges Bank also reflects the pain
of solving an overfishing crisis when fishermen are so reluctant to
leave their boats. Despite hard times, New England's scallop fleet
has held steady at around 300 boats even though federal biologists
say 100 or fewer are needed, making them increasingly desperate for
a larger catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been in this business a while, you're locked in,''
explained James Kendall of the regulatory New England Fishery
Management Council. ``It's a way of life. It's not just a
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Georges Bank, an underwater plateau whose
abundance had sustained fishermen for four centuries, showed what
can happen when modern fishermen, equipped with vast nets and
high-tech fish-finding equipment, aren't restrained. By 1994, the
National Marine Fisheries Service warned that cod, a staple of the
region's economy, had reached record low levels, and could only be
saved by reducing fishing to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Fishery Management Council closed three fishing
grounds, including two on Georges Bank, in one of the largest
closures for fish conservation in the world. Since then, the cod
catch on Georges Bank has dropped to levels not seen since the 19th
century, representing a loss of perhaps $90 million a year compared
to the big catches of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, sea scallops weren't part of regulators' worries on
Georges Bank, largely because they were more plentiful in other
areas. But regulators banned them from the closed areas anyway,
because the chain link sledges used in scalloping catch so many
groundfish as a byproduct, called ``bycatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the scallopers, concentrated in the New Bedford-Fairhaven
area, blame fishing restrictions for hard times that have seen the
New England catch fall from 20 million pounds or more each year in
the early 1990s, to less than nine million pounds in 1997. Scallops
in the closed areas alone could offset half the drop, according to
a National Marine Fisheries Service estimate, with scallops valued
at $21.9 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the waterfront looks prosperous enough _ the sky above
Hathaway Wharf bristles with masts and booms from scallop boats
tied up three and four abreast _ appearances are deceiving.
Fishermen say that lenient creditors have allowed them to stay in
business, awaiting better times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't know the resource was there, we would have thrown
in the towel already,'' said Malvin Kvilhaug, owner of three
Fairhaven-based scallop boats.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard times are far from over for scallopers, who could
see the number of days they are allowed to fish reduced from 120
this year to just 50 days in 2000. Biologists at the National
Marine Fisheries Service believe the scallop fleet needs to reduce
fishing by more than 50 percent to prevent scallops from facing the
same fate as the cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a boom and bust fishery . . . They pounce
on'' scallops before they are full grown ``and they catch very
small scallops. They really fritter away the longterm benefits of
stability,'' said Steven Murawski, a biologist at the National
Marine Fisheries Service in Woods Hole.

 FAIRHAVEN, Mass.: ... Woods Hole.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to fishing limits, the Clinton administration wants
to eliminate boats, using $8 million in federal money and $32
million from industry to buy out scores of scallopers.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the tightening regulatory noose, scallopers turned
political last year, forming the Fisheries Survival Fund advocacy
group, hiring lobbyists, making their own video _ and petitioning
Commerce Secretary Daley to reopen part of the Georges Bank closed
area on an emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
   For scientific heft, they turned to Brian Rothschild, a
respected former federal fisheries biologist who now runs the
University of Massachusetts' Center for Marine Science and
Technology in New Bedford. Rothschild worked out a plan with the
National Marine Fisheries Service that would allow scallopers to
dredge closed area 2 to find out how many scallops were there.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen were astonished at what they found, taking pictures of
each other sprawled on mounds of big scallops. Though scientists
are still debating the exact amount of scallops in closed area 2,
staff at the New England Fishery Management Council estimate that
scallopers would catch scallops eight times as fast in the closed
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could sustain next year's whole (scallop) catch in area 2.
That's a big catch,'' said Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   Although Daley declined to reopen closed areas himself, he
called on the New England Fishery Management Council to consider
reopening part of closed area 2 by June. He also called for federal
biologists to study scallop abundance in the other two closed areas
with an eye to additional openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is welcome news for hundreds of fishing families. Their
economic survival depends on access to these closed areas,'' said
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who took Daley to Fall
River in February to talk to scallopers.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of Daley's intervention said it politicized the
already-difficult task of balancing conservation and the economic
needs of fishermen. At a minimum, they said, it forces the New
England Fishery Management Council to make complex decisions with
limited information under intense time pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Paul Howard, executive director of the New England
Fishery Management Council, said his staff is rushing to provide
information on five key issues before the council is scheduled to
vote on reopening closed areas to scallopers at its April 14
meeting in Providence:
</P>
<P>
   --For every pound of scallop meat harvested in the closed area 2
experiment, dredges pulled up two pounds of fish such as yellowtail
flounder, whose plight was one of the reasons the area was closed
in the first place. This bycatch can be limited by keeping
scallopers out of the richest flounder areas, but scientists are
unsure if it could slow the flounder's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   --The effect on scallops from opening area 2 is also unclear. It
could actually help scallop stocks if fishermen concentrate on the
closed areas and allow depleted scallop beds to recover. However,
dozens of inactive scallopers could be tempted by the reopening to
go fishing again, increasing overall scalloping.
</P>
<P>
   --Scientists also don't know enough about life on the seabed to
say what effect more scalloping will have. The recovery of scallops
in the closed areas shows that they can recover, but there are few
studies on the recovery of non-commercial plants and animals or the
effect of dredging on fish spawning areas.
</P>
<P>
   --Re-opening a closed area to scallopers _ but not ground
fishermen _ will be an enforcement headache in part because the
boats look somewhat alike. Howard said that already-inadequate
enforcement efforts would have to be increased.
</P>
<P>
   --Finally, scallopers will have to work around the lobster
fishermen who started placing their traps in closed areas once the
dragging equipment was gone. Otherwise, lobstermen and scallopers
could get into a heated gear conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make one decision without looking at all the other
decisions,'' said Howard. ``It's very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the 17-member council could devise a complicated
re-opening scheme that attempts to balance these concerns, limiting
where the scallopers can go in the closed areas and reducing the
total number of days they can fish in exchange for access to the
rich closed areas.
</P>
<P>
   However, council member and former scalloper Kendall said that
limiting scallopers' fishing rights erodes the whole point of
giving them access to the closed areas: to catch more scallops.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Doug Hopkins, a council member and a lawyer
for the Environmental Defense Fund, said unrestricted access to the
closed area would be even worse, undercutting the broader agenda of
control. At the same meeting where the scallopers' appeal will be
heard, he notes, the council is considering another 22 percent cut
in Georges Bank cod fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Hopkins added, the scallopers may have undercut
their own cause by pressing for the emergency reopening. He said
the council was studying a plan to rotate scallop fishing grounds,
opening closed areas in exchange for closures of others. But the
rotation plan has been eclipsed by the pressure to open up Georges
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's heartbreaking in all this,'' Hopkins said.

FARRAKHAN'S ILLNESS TESTS NATION OF ISLAM PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Louis Farrakhan's health again in question, the Nation of
Islam is being forced to confront the possibility of carrying on
without the charismatic leader who built the organization into a
powerful voice of black pride and alienation.
</P>
<P>
   This is an unsettling prospect, observers say, because there is
no one waiting in the wings who commands anywhere near the respect
and loyalty that Farrakhan does. Nor is there anyone with the kind
of personality to ensure the Nation of Islam retains its high
public profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minister Farrakhan is the Nation of Islam,'' said Arthur J.
Magida, author of ``Prophet of Rage: A Life of Louis Farrakhan and
His Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation relies on his charisma, which is extraordinary, his
organizational skills, and his image as perhaps the most courageous
and defiant black man in the United States,'' Magida said.
``Without him, I believe the Nation might have great problems
recruiting new members or maintaining itself as it is now
structured.''
</P>
<P>
   But some observers also said the Nation of Islam's next leader
probably would not invite controversy the same way Farrakhan does
by targeting Jews and whites. Farrakhan lost the support of many
blacks who might otherwise have found the Nation's message
attractive because of the group's anti-Semitic and racist
statements, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports have presented conflicting pictures of the health
of the 65-year-old Farrakhan. Newsday reported Saturday that his
immune system has shut down in reaction to his treatment for
prostate cancer, which he has been battling for several years, and
that he was in serious condition. But his son-in-law, Leonard
Muhammad, told the Associated Press on Saturday that Farrakhan was
walking around and probably would be out of the hospital in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who visited Farrakhan in the hospital, former Washington
mayor Marion Barry and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, also have said
Farrakhan is not gravely ill.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Nation of Islam leaders are said to be ``shaken and
concerned'' over Farrakhan's health problems, according to an
official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Farrakhan has dominated the Nation of Islam, using
it as a platform to promote his controversial brand of black
nationalism, discipline, and faith.
</P>
<P>
   To many of his followers, Farrakhan is the only truly authentic
African-American voice in America. Even among blacks who say some
of his statements are anti-Semitic and racist, Farrakhan is admired
for organizing the most significant event for blacks in recent
history: the Million Man March in Washington in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farrakhan has really taken the Nation to the highest levels of
attention one could possibly imagine for such an organization,''
said Sulayman S. Nyang, professor of African and Islamic Studies at
Howard University in Washington. ``No one can be sure what will
happen after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan has not established a clear hierarchy of succession,
some observers said, and his absence could trigger a power struggle
between moderates who want to move the organization toward
mainstream Islam and hardliners who brook no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have emerged as potential successors are
Mustapha Farrakhan, the leader's son, who oversees the Fruit of
Islam, the Nation's security force; Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad, one of
Farrakhan's personal physicians and a trusted adviser; and Benjamin
F. Muhammad, the former Benjamin Chavis, who was forced to resign
from the NAACP for improper use of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin F. Muhammad, who leads the Nation of Islam in New York,
is viewed with suspicion by some Farrakhan followers because they
believe he wants the organization to hew to a more orthodox brand
of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much saw the minister's decision to bring Benjamin
Chavis into the Nation as a way of making sure that if or when he
passes from the scene, there could be a group of people who are in
a position to be in leadership,'' said Ronald Walters, director of
the African-American Leadership Program at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be difficult for the Nation of Islam to emerge
from the shadow of the man who revived the organization after it
had been disbanded in 1975 by Imam Warith Deen Mohammad, the son of
the Elijah Muhammad, who had led the Nation since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with 5,000 members in 1979, the Nation of Islam now
says it has as many as 200,000 members. It has mosques in most
major US cities, including Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Walters is more sanguine than others about the group's future
because he believes Farrakhan has built a strong infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's finances are healthy. Its holdings include a
restaurant in Chicago; a popular newspaper, The Final Call; and a
thriving network of local organizations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Minister Farrakhan is not there, I don't think the Nation
is any danger of immediate collapse,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   But his replacement might have a hard time matching Farrakhan's
blending of religion, politics, and culture to create a unique
world view, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream Muslims say the Nation of Islam bears almost no
resemblance to the orthodox Islam practiced by hundreds of millions
of adherents around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The nation believes that Allah, or God, was incarnated in 1930
in Detroit as Fard Muhammad, the founder of the organization, that
whites were created by a disloyal black scientist, and that the
biblical Adam was black.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said there are signs that Farrakhan is trying to make
the Nation of Islam more mainstream in an effort, perhaps, to
broaden its appeal and ensure a prosperous future. For the first
time, the group followed the same fasting calendar as Muslims
worldwide during the last Ramadan, the month-long Islamic holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Muslim calendar is tied to the lunar calendar,
Ramadan begins on a different day each year. But Elijah Muhammad
told his followers to fast in December because the shorter winter
days would make the dawn-to-dusk Ramadan fasts easier.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at a meeting of Nation of Islamic leaders this year,
Farrakhan, according to Magida, said the only texts now valid for
his followers were the Koran and the collected accounts of the
prophet Muhammad's words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear, however, if this means Farrakhan is
supplanting or changing the beliefs he inherited from Elijah
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nation of Islam is certainly in for some interesting and
challenging times,'' Nyang said.

RAYTHEON SUIT SPURS CALL FOR ON-LINE PRIVACY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet service providers such as America Online and Microsoft
Corp. offer strict assurances they will protect the privacy of your
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Unless somebody asks to see it. Then things might change.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the lesson emerging from a lawsuit filed by
Raytheon Co. against 21 workers the defense contractor claims
posted private company information on a message board run by Yahoo
Inc. on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon didn't know any more than the screen-names of the
message posters when it filed the suit in February in Middlesex
(Mass.) Superior Court, seeking damages of more than $25,000 from a
group of defendants it calls ``John Does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo provided at least some basic information, allowing the
Lexington, Mass. defense contractor to gain motions demanding
further discovery from AOL, Microsoft, and others as it tries to
identify the chat-board users. Since then at least two Raytheon
employees have left the company, apparently as a result of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Raytheon says the postings caused ``harm to
its business reputation,'' citing messages in which employees
griped about the company's new chief executive, Daniel Burnham, its
earnings outlook, and controls at a plant in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those targeted by Raytheon deny the charges. Also,
they say, they are upset at Yahoo, the California-based Internet
portal. Yahoo says it was following its guidelines, but a few users
say they expected a heads-up when Raytheon came knocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I'm guilty'' of disclosing trade secrets, said
one former Raytheon employee being sued. ``But I have that feeling
that somebody's after me for something I didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's demands are among the most extensive to date as
companies try to clamp down on chat about them on-line. These cases
_ and Raytheon's in particular _ also point up the differences in
the protections that the nation's largest Internet providers afford
their users.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sore subject among privacy advocates, who want stricter
federal rules to clarify what they call a hodgepodge of practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of these companies have very easy procedures for
lifting the anonymity of their users,'' said David Sobel, general
counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington, D.C., advocacy group. ``It really creates a chilling
effect on people who want to use the Internet in the way they've
become used to using it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent demands for personal data stem from the
growth of forums on the World Wide Web devoted to company news. In
an ongoing suit, for example, Oregon-based Itex Corp. last year
obtained from Yahoo the identities of several users the company
claims made defamatory statements about it.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints about their disclosures put service providers in
a bind, says Jonathan Osder, an attorney at Donahue Gallagher Woods
&AMP; Wood in Oakland., Calif., whose firm represents several Internet
service providers, or ISPs. ``The ISPs are trying on the one hand
to make people be at ease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the other hand, they're saying that if you hit us with
a subpoena, we won't want to be a part of this,'' Osder said.
Fighting disclosures costs money, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for example, promises its members in an on-line
policy statement that ``We do not give out your telephone number,
credit card information, or screen names unless you authorize us to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Click through to the fine print, however, and AOL adds that it
might do so in some cases ``to comply with valid legal process.''
Usually that means giving customers 14 days to file a challenge to
a demand for information, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., whose MSN unit also provides access to the
Internet, says the company also usually notifies customers before
surrendering data to outsiders in civil cases. But the software
giant says nothing in writing. ``We deal with these things on an
individual basis,'' said the spokesman, Tom Pilla.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Raytheon won two motions to seek discovery against
Microsoft and one of its units, Hotmail. Pilla said neither has
received any demands from Raytheon yet.
</P>
<P>
   On its own Website, Yahoo states that: ``Yahoo is committed to
safeguarding your privacy on line.'' But the policy also says: ``As
a general rule, Yahoo will not disclose any of your personally
identifiable information except when we have your permission or
under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith
that the law requires it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   To several of the people being sued by Raytheon, that language
implied Yahoo could have alerted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading their disclosure, it said they would keep this
information confidential,'' said the former Raytheon employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no problem with them (Yahoo) releasing it, if I'm told
beforehand,'' the former employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Yahoo nor Raytheon executives have contacted him
regarding his postings, this person said, adding he learned of the
lawsuit from chat about it on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another person being sued by Raytheon, who uses the screen name
of ``Winstoncar,'' also wanted Yahoo to protect the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like their policy of turning over our names,''
Winstoncar wrote on the chat board on Saturday. ``The message board
states that Raytheon is not connected with it, and we may share
information with others. That's what I did. Bad choice!''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo spokeswoman Diane Hunt said the John Does should have read
the company's policies more carefully. Under those terms, she said,
``We believe that we were already notifying them in advance'' that
the company would answer demands like Raytheon's.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt declined to discuss what information, if any, the company
has passed along. But other people familiar with the matter say
Yahoo turned over much of what it knew about the users. In some
cases that included only e-mail addresses linked to other accounts
on AOL, Microsoft, and others. Now Raytheon is using that data to
demand more specifics from the ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think of it as, just how many doors are you going to
step through?'' said one person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   So far just one of the John Does has publicly identified
himself: Steve MacKenzie, an engineer at Raytheon's Andover
facility who goes by the Yahoo screen name of ``RaytheonVeteran.''
He said he learned of the suit from newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie remains at his job in Andover. He declined to say
whether the company has taken any actions against him. Raytheon
says the suit against ``RaytheonVeteran'' remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Raytheon alleged a message he posted on June 30
constituted ``disclosure of inside financial issues'' because it
described certain changes to the company's profit-sharing plans.
MacKenzie now says that he was only reporting information that was
about to be printed in a company newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In a message on the Yahoo chat board on March 5, MacKenzie
wrote: ``My only regret is that Raytheon never made any attempt to
locate us using conventional means. Bulk e-mail for instance or
perhaps a short blurb in the company newsletter.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said that MacKenzie and
other posters should have known better already, under existing
nondisclosure agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But after newspaper reports of the suit appeared in early March,
Raytheon sent around a general memo that was more specific about
employee use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, ``It's always OK for employees to discuss
the company and its actions, and otherwise to air their thoughts
through the Internet. In these cases, the Internet is just an
electronic extension of the old-fashioned conversation at the water
cooler. However . . . please take extra care not to discuss company
proprietary information. That is never OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon declined to discuss its ongoing probe or whether it has
extended its search for other employees besides the 21 it has
already sued. Citing employee privacy, the company also declined to
comment on whether it has disciplined any. One of the Yahoo users
cited by the company, the one known as Winstoncar, reported on the
message board last week that ``as of today I no longer work for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Raytheon employees say this person and others deserved to
be punished for giving outsiders a look at internal matters. ``To
place the blame on Yahoo demonstrates an inability to accept
personal responsibility for your actions,'' wrote one poster who
uses the moniker ``Gearjammer47.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Yahoo's actions have left the chat-room users
isolated _ the opposite of what they expected when they chose to
express their opinions anonymously. ``The irony is profound,'' said
one Raytheon employee, who often posts chat on the Yahoo message
board but isn't involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raytheon knows who these people are, and their putative
friends don't,'' he said.

A PROMISE TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF LATINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speeding down the sidewalk, my skateboard hit a rock and I fell
down, smack in front of another child walking home from school. Her
hair in cornrows, the girl looked up at me and asked innocently,
``What are you, Spanish?''
</P>
<P>
   I stood there, a girl of 10, in my J. J. Walker ``Kid
Dy-no-mite'' T-shirt, and with shrugged shoulders said, ``I guess
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, in between games of double-Dutch and
ring-o-livio, I wondered who I was, what I was. Growing up during
the ``Black is Beautiful'' '70s, my black girlfriends, Tina,
Valerie, Karen, could see their culture displayed _ even if often
negatively _ on movie screens, TV, and on the radio. But rarely did
I see mine.
</P>
<P>
   Though Latino _ mostly Puerto Rican _ culture percolated
throughout my Harlem neighborhood, it felt like it belonged to the
people of my mother's generation. The mothers on my block played
scratched 33 rpm vinyl recordings of merengue and salsa music.
Outside, Latina mothers would trade ``bochinche'' (gossip) in
Spanish, as their ninas and ninos spoke slang.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the tension between the culture my mom was trying to
instill, and culture I had adopted, created a perpetual tug-of-war.
Mom insisted her three children speak Spanish but we protested. Our
world rolled in English. But I admired our values: religious faith,
a strong work ethic, humility, and most of all, warmth. There is no
English equivalent for a carinoso person. You need several words _
loving, giving, nurturing _ to get at its nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Our culture evolved over thousands of years. It was shaped by
the industrious Incas, Mayans, Aztecs, Tainos, Arawaks, and Caribs;
Spanish colonizers who forced Roman Catholicism and the Spanish
language; and West African slaves whose art, music, cuisine, and
spirituality melded with ours. That mix makes us a people of many
hues, from dark-skinned Latin brothers like Sammy Sosa, to
light-skinned ``mamis'' like Cameron Diaz. Latinos, as a people,
understand diversity in a way that most ethnic groups can't.
</P>
<P>
   But as a kid, a first-generation child of a Puerto Rican mother
and Cuban father, the beauty of the culture escaped me. If it
wasn't on TV, children of my generation figured, it was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   America's fascination with the mambo, with Desi Arnaz, Ricardo
Montalban, and Charo had long fizzled. Freddie Prinze was dead.
America just wasn't feeling us. Because I didn't see Latinos
reflected in pop culture, I subconsciously assumed we were
irrelevant. For most of America, there were only two ethnicities:
black and white. In East Coast cities with growing Latino
populations, we got branded as ``Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   As children we struggled with the label, with trying to fit with
those around us, while our mothers nagged, ``Necesita practicar el
espanol'' (You need to practice Spanish). We responded, ``All
right, moms.'' So we'd speak Spanish at home, not on the basketball
court. We blasted The Ohio Players, Stevie Wonder, and P-Funk on
our radios, not Celia Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   And when emceeing was born in the South Bronx housing projects,
Latinos rapped along. We rebelliously drowned out our parents' Tito
Puente with Grandmaster Flash, Roxanne Shante, and Doug E. Fresh.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until college, when I started taking Latin American
studies, that I began to truly understand the forces that shaped
Latino culture. From the Dominican Republic to Mexico to Colombia
and all countries in between, Latinos have lived a life of constant
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   From that struggle, incredible literature, poetry, and artwork
was born. If poverty and oppression gave us nothing else, it
fostered creativity and the innate sense to nurture what's most
important: family.
</P>
<P>
   Though we as a group remain a silent minority in America, we're
growing quickly. In a generation, we'll be the largest minority
group in a generation. And it's not because we're sneaking across
the border. Our population boom is due mostly to our love of kids.
We don't ascribe to the 2.5-children household that has become
almost a standard.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, as advertisers, casting directors, record executives,
and all the other controllers of American populart culture tap into
Latino culture with greater frequency, children from all other
ethnic groups will be eyeing our style, and will try to emulate us.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit, I can't wait. I'll be a mom by then, and my
children won't have to think twice about who they are. By then,
Latino culture will be reflected everywhere, enriching American
culture with our voices, our spirit _ and with mucho carino.

LOVE, HORROR, AND MERCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO -- In an age when many a novel needs to be
carried by wheelbarrow, the book has a dozen chapters and 218
pages. The prose is spare, and even in translation its effect is
hypnotic. Readers follow the plot in an almost syncopated gait as
the hero wanders from Blumenstrasse to Bahnhofstrasse and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reader'' is now a publishing phenomenon in paperback,
thanks in part to Oprah Winfrey's book club, but thanks also to
Carol Brown Janeway, who translated the novel from German in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   I read the book last year, trying to escape from Bill Clinton's
troubles. But any story based on temptation and betrayal has
Clintonesque lessons. Or maybe not. ``Going there might be
dangerous. But it was obviously impossible for the danger to act
itself out,'' the narrator says. ``That is how I rationalized it
back then, making my desire an entry in a strange moral accounting
and silencing my bad conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``The Reader'' begins when the narrator is an
adolescent, readers might fear garrulous anxiety. But things
happen, and the plot moves swiftly, with apt introspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does everyone feel this way?'' the narrator asks. ``When I was
young, I was perpetually overconfident or insecure. Either I felt
completely useless, unattractive, and worthless, or that I was
pretty much a success, and everything I did was bound to succeed.
When I was confident, I could overcome the hardest challenges. But
all it took was the smallest setback for me to be sure that I was
utterly worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics caught onto this book after readers did. ``The best
novel I read this year,'' Neil Ascherson wrote in the British
Independent, calling it ``an unforgettable short tale about love,
horror, and mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening chapters deal with a stock theme, the sentimental
education of a young man,'' Robert Taylor wrote in The Boston Globe
in 1997, but ``the novel displays both a profound moral reach and a
compelling story, and to the perennial issues of the German past it
brings a fresh, provocative approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust is the most powerful moral story of this century,
and the book's author, Bernard Schlink, symbolizes the second
generation's guilt. Now 54, he is a professor of constitutional law
and the philosophy of law in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers write elegant, precise novels about the human
condition. Other lawyers crank out hefty bestsellers of ``courtroom
drama.'' Schlink's academic specialty is collective guilt, but he
sketches his unforgettable characters meticulously. His plot is as
geometrically detailed as an Albrecht Duerer drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Schlink has encountered criticism that because he is a
second-generation ``good German,'' he seeks ignorance as an alibi.
This philistine approach, reviewing the author and not the work, is
invalid because Schlink's scholarly work not only accepts
collective guilt, but documents it in studies like ``Questions of
Law, Guilt, and Future After the Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   Collective guilt exists today in Serbia as in Germany from 1933
until 1945. Adolf Hitler was democratically elected by an informed
electorate. Historical evidence suggests that ``good Germans'' were
few.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Reader'' is a story, not a tract. Moreover, a good
story is the basis for a successful movie. Will Hollywood make a
movie of ``The Reader''?
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis has read the book and given it to friends.
Since she made ``Halloween'' in 1978, Curtis has been an American
male adolescent fantasy. It's hard to see the daughter of the
former Bernie Schwartz of Brooklyn, aka Tony Curtis, portraying a
character in this story, but Jamie Lee is brave, even if Hollywood
and ``The Reader'' may not be a match.
</P>
<P>
   No movie can ruin a book, and ``The Reader'' will remain
powerful because, as its title suggests, it shows how reading can
conjure up characters and transform them with feelings of love,
memory, and momentous regret.

WHERE DO `EYE CRUSTIES' COME FROM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When we wake up, why do we have crust in our eyes?
</P>
<P>
   S.S., Mattapan, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Eye crusties'' are the leftover protein and fat from tears
that have dried up. Tears have three components: Salty water, which
comes from the tear gland behind the upper outer corner of our eye;
Protein, secreted by the conjuctiva, which is the clear film that
covers the eye; And fat, which comes from ducts in the eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   Tears do lots of jobs. They clean the eye. They fill in tiny
imperfections in the surface of the cornea which needs to be
perfectly smooth for the best vision. They also deliver nutrients
to the cornea, which has to be clear to let light through to the
iris so it has no blood vessels. And of course tears flow at times
of emotion, when we produce more salt water. (It's 0.9 percent
salt) At night, with our eyes closed and protected, we don't make
tears, explains Dr. Edward Murphy of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear
Infirmary. Small amounts of the tear mixture already on the surface
of the eye seep out, and without a fresh supply of liquid from the
tear gland, the fat and protein dry up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does your breath smell so bad when you wake up?
</P>
<P>
   SB and AB, Mattapan, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are always lots of bacteria in our mouth, feeding on
the tiny leftover bits of what we've eaten. Ever hear of plaque,
the stuff all those toothpaste ads promise to get rid of? It's
nothing more than organized colonies of bacteria chowing down on
food bits on your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   When we're awake, some plaque is removed when we chew, talk,
drink, even when we breath. But overnight, when those disturbances
cease, it's party time for the bacterial colonies on your teeth and
they multiply like crazy. Their waste products are acids, which
cause cavities, and gasses, which cause that rude blast of morning
breath.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do we snore?
</P>
<P>
   S.D. Cotuit, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. To bug the person sleeping next to us, of course. Actually,
there are several causes of snoring. All of them create some kind
of restriction in the upper airway. Kids with swollen tonsils or
adenoids snore. People sleeping on their back snore because the
tissues in the neck are pressing down on the windpipe. Overweight
people snore for pretty much the same reason, or because some of
their fat is stored in tissues in the neck. People with colds snore
because they have swollen sinus tissues in the back of their
throat. Drinking alcohol causes snoring by relaxing the muscles in
the throat, which restricts the size of the airway. We snore more
as we age because of the loss of elasticity in on neck tissues,
which sag in on the windpipe. People with misshapen jaws,
larger-than-normal tongues, or on relaxant medications, all tend to
snore.
</P>
<P>
   So if you try to sleep next to an overweight elderly drunk with
a misshapen jaw and a cold who's taking muscle relaxants, bring
industrial strength earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is yawning contagious?
</P>
<P>
   P.H., Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, lets dispel a myth. You don't yawn to take in extra
oxygen. That's been rejected in lab tests, says yawn expert Robert
Provine, Professor of Psychology at the University of Maryland's
Baltimore County campus. He had test subjects breathe air with
extra oxygen. He induced oxygen deprivation in others giving them
air high in carbon dioxide. Neither caused more or less yawning.
</P>
<P>
   Provine says ``we yawn when we're changing states of activity.
Going from sleep to wakefulness, like yawning in the morning. Or
wakefulness to sleep.'' (He says we yawn more in the morning when
we wake up, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Concert pianists will yawn before going out to an important
performance. Olympic athletes yawn before the big event. Embryos
begin yawning eleven weeks after conception.'' He says yawning is
somehow connected to changing levels of body activity, but nobody
understands just what the connection is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably helps stir up the blood and brain chemistry to
facilitate those transitions from one level of activity to
another,'' Provine says.
</P>
<P>
   Yawning is highly contagious, he says. Provine has made test
subjects yawn by letting them read about yawning, by showing them a
yawning face, even just talking about yawning or asking the test
subjects to think about yawning.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Yawning is ancient and autonomic,'' Provine says. ``Maybe
it's to get everyone in the tribe to synchronize their states of
activity, to increase the success of the tribe if everyone's
working together. We really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Every vertebrate species yawns. Fish yawn. Birds yawn.
Alligators yawn. But Provine says it's apparently only contagious
in humans.

FBI USES POWERFUL WEAPON, A GRAND JURY, IN MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ By taking the investigation into the killings of
a California woman and two teen-age girls before a federal grand
jury, the FBI is using one of the most powerful tools it has.
</P>
<P>
   The move extends the FBI's reach, wraps the investigation in
even deeper secrecy and is calculated to prevent the leaks,
procedural and political blunders that made a mess of the JonBenet
Ramsey slaying case in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   With the involvement of a grand jury, prosecutors will be able
to subpoena reluctant witnesses and hard-to-obtain documents to
bolster the physical evidence gathered by investigators from at
least three crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The woman and two children _ Carole Sund, 42, and her
15-year-old daughter, Julie, and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16
_ vanished Feb. 15 from a lodge near the Yosemite National Park.
The incinerated bodies of Carole Sund and Pelosso were found March
19 in the trunk of their burned rental car miles from the lodge.
Julie Sund's body was found on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to build an airtight case,'' said FBI Special
Agent Nick Rossi.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury can compel even the most reluctant witness to
appear before it. Failure to answer its questions brings drastic
consequences, including prison time.
</P>
<P>
   No American is beyond the reach of a federal grand jury.
President Clinton had to testify before a grand jury about his
relations with Monica Lewinsky, testimony that was later turned
over to Congress, which then made it public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand jury's subpoena power is almost unlimited,'' said
San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Brown. ``And there's also the
fact that you're on their turf. The door closes and the prosecutor
is hitting you with questions and you may not know where he's going
... You can't outsmart them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the missing women in California, the FBI is
probably using the grand jury simply because of its power to issue
subpoenas. ``That may be all they're doing,'' said Joseph
Russoniello, a former U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Brenner, dean of the University of Dayton School of Law in
Ohio, said the referral of the Yosemite case at first seemed
unusual, given the extensive physical evidence: the three bodies, a
torched car, several rolls of film and Carole Sund's wallet, plus
other personal effects found near the car and in their motel room.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the case ``sounds like the classic thing the FBI
could handle, your typical Columbo-type investigation,'' said
Brenner, a specialist in federal grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   Federal grand juries have a big advantage over other
investigative agencies: They have the power to subpoena witnesses
from other states, Brenner said. That could be crucial, she said,
if FBI agents have a theory or tips, but cannot persuade key people
to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   There's another practical advantage: The federal grand jury's
extra cloak of secrecy can protect witnesses who fear retribution,
a principal reason grand juries are so heavily used in cases
against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take federal grand jury testimony, it remains secret
and never gets revealed,'' said San Francisco lawyer Jerrold Ladar,
a former chief of criminal prosecutions in the U.S. attorney's
office. In California, grand jury transcripts have to be unsealed
10 days after a suspect is arraigned.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes investigators use grand juries for political cover,
when the public is clamoring for a solution but the investigation
has been bungled or is going nowhere. That seems to be what's
happening in Boulder, Colo., where District Attorney Alex Hunter
gave the JonBenet Ramsey case to a Boulder County grand jury only
last September, nearly two years into the murder investigation of
the young girl.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike investigators in the Ramsey case, the FBI has so far
been able to prevent leaks to the media in the Sund-Pelosso
killings. Investigators have yielded facts sparingly; they have
not, for example, disclosed the cause of Julie Sund's death, or how
they learned the location of her body.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal jurisdiction applies in this case because a federal
crime _ possibly carjacking _ may have been committed on federal
property, Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   That may be another plus to the investigation, said Barry
Portman, a federal defender in San Francisco. ``The advantage of a
federal grand jury is that the feds have great experience'' in such
criminal matters, whereas county investigators often don't, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, because the killings appear to have been committed
off federal property, any prosecution will likely take place in
state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the FBI could wrap up its investigation with the grand
jury and deliver a tidy case to the district attorney in Tuolumne
County on a silver platter, Russoniello said. Turning over the
results of a federal grand jury investigation to a state agency
requires a court order, but ``it's done fairly frequently,'' he
said.

 &HT;    
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NORTH AMERICAN and CANADIAN rights only  
 &HT;     (Thomas L. Friedman is the foreign affairs columnist for The
New York Times. This article is adapted from his book, ``The Lexus
and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization,'' to be published
April 21 by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the winter of 1996, I accompanied Madeleine K. Albright, then
the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on a trip to the war
zones of Africa.
 &HT;    During the last stop, in Rwanda, she asked her staff to pose for
a picture outside her Air Force 737. The group included a
Greek-American, a Czech-American, Jewish Americans, black Americans
and white Americans. There were Air Force crewmen from small towns
and diplomats from Ivy League colleges, and they were all standing
there shoulder to shoulder.
 &HT;    As I watched the Rwandan ground crew curiously watching the
picture-taking, I couldn't help wondering what they were making of
this scene, which represented America at its best: the spirit of
community, the melting pot, the willingness to help faraway
strangers in need and, most important, a concept of citizenship
based on allegiance to an idea rather than to a tribe. As a
picture, it represented everything that Rwanda was not.
 &HT;    And as I stood there, I started to get mad _ not just about the
tragedy in Africa but also about a budget debate that was then
going on in Congress. We have something tremendously special in
America, I thought, but if we want to preserve it, we have to pay
for it and nurture it.
 &HT;    Yet, when I listened to the infamous 1994 class of freshman
Republicans _ and when I hear echoes today, with the likes of the
House majority leader, Dick Armey, boasting that he has traveled
abroad only once _ I heard mean-spirited voices, voices for whom
the American government was some kind of evil enemy. I heard men
and women who insisted that the market alone should rule.
 &HT;    And I heard lawmakers who seemed to believe that America had no
special responsibility for maintaining global institutions and
stabilizing an international system that benefits us more than any
other country.
 &HT;    And as I thought about all this on the tarmac of Kigali airport,
I said to myself: ``Well, my freshman Republican friends, come to
Africa. It's a freshman Republican's paradise.'' Yes sir, nobody in
Liberia pays taxes. There's no gun control in Angola. There's no
welfare as we know it in Burundi and no big government to interfere
with the market in Rwanda.
 &HT;    But a lot of their people sure wish there were. Like the desk
clerk in Luanda, Angola, who looked at me as if I were nuts when I
asked her if it was safe to take a walk three blocks from the
hotel, down the main street of the capital in the middle of the
day.
 &HT;    ``No, no, no,'' she shook her head _ not safe.''
 &HT;    I'll bet she wouldn't mind paying some taxes for 100,000 more
police officers.
 &HT;    And then there was the Liberian radio reporter who demanded to
know why the Marines came to Liberia after the civil war broke out
in 1989, evacuated only the U.S. citizens and then left. ``We all
thought, 'The Marines are coming, we will be saved,''' he said.
``How could they leave?''
 &HT;    Poor guy, his country has no marines to rescue him. I'll bet he
wouldn't mind paying some taxes for a few good men.
 &HT;    Employers don't have to fret about those pesky worker-safety
rules in Angola, let alone services for the handicapped. The 70,000
Angolans who have had limbs blown off by land mines get by just
fine on their own. You can see them limping around the streets of
Luanda in Fellini-esque contortions, hustling for food and using
tree limbs as a substitute for the human variety.
 &HT;    And in Rwanda and Burundi, no one is asked to pay for Head
Start, Medicaid, national service or student-loan programs. Instead
they just have a Darwinian competition for scarce land, energy and
water, with Tutsi and Hutu tribesmen taking turns downsizing one
another to grab more resources for themselves.
 &HT;    Many in Congress are reluctant to go on trips abroad. They think
it looks bad to their constituents. Too bad. They want all the
respect and benefits that come with being an American in today's
world, but without any of the sacrifices and obligations that go
with it. They should come to war-torn Africa and get a real taste
of what happens to countries where there is no sense of community,
no sense that people owe their government anything, no sense that
anyone is responsible for anyone else, and where the rich have to
live behind high walls and tinted windows, while the poor are left
to the tender mercies of the marketplace.
 &HT;    I don't want to live in such a country, or such a world. It is
not only wrong, it will become increasingly dangerous. Designing
ways to avoid that should be at the heart of American domestic and
foreign policy. Unfortunately, neither the Democrats nor the
Republicans are thinking in those terms. They behave as if the
world is now safe for us to be both insular and mindlessly
partisan.
 &HT;    To the extent that there is serious discussion about a shared
national interest, it is about whether we can define a new common
threat _ Iraq, China, Russia _ and not a new common mission. The
``big enemy'' is still the organizing principle of American
internationalism, not the ``big opportunity'' _ let alone ``the big
responsibility.''
 &HT;    America does have a bipartisan national interest to pursue, and
it has an enormous role to play. But we won't begin to fully grasp
that until we understand that we are in a new international system.
For the last 10 years we've been talking about ``the post-Cold War
world.'' We've described the world by what it isn't _ it's not the
Cold War _ because we don't know what it is.
 &HT;    Well, what it is is a new international system called
globalization. Globalization is not just a trend, not just a
phenomenon, not just an economic fad. It is the international
system that has replaced the Cold War system. And like the Cold War
system, globalization has its own rules, logic, structures and
characteristics.
 &HT;    Unlike the Cold War system, which was largely static,
globalization involves the integration of free markets,
nation-states and information technologies to a degree never before
witnessed, in a way that is enabling individuals, corporations and
countries to reach around the world farther, faster, deeper and
cheaper than ever. It is also producing a powerful backlash from
those brutalized or left behind.
 &HT;    If all the threats and opportunities of the Cold War system grew
out of ``division,'' all the threats and opportunities of the
globalization system grow out of ``integration.'' The symbol of the
Cold War system was a wall, which divided everyone. The symbol of
the globalization system is the World Wide Web, which unites
everyone.
 &HT;    In the Cold War we reached for the hot line between the White
House and the Kremlin _ a symbol that we were all divided but at
least someone, the two superpowers, were in charge. In the era of
globalization we reach for the Internet _ a symbol that we are all
connected but nobody is in charge.
 &HT;    If the Cold War had been a sport, it would have been sumo
wrestling, says Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign-affairs expert at
Johns Hopkins University. ``It would be two big fat guys in a ring,
with all sorts of posturing and rituals and stomping of feet, but
actually very little contact until the end of the match, when there
is a brief moment of shoving and the loser gets pushed out of the
ring, but nobody gets killed.''
 &HT;    If globalization were a sport, it would be the 100-yard dash,
over and over and over. And no matter how many times you win, you
have to race again the next day. And if you lose by just a
hundredth of a second it can be as if you lost by an hour.
 &HT;    The driving idea behind globalization is free-market capitalism.
The more you let market forces rule and the more you open your
economy to free trade and competition, the more efficient and
flourishing your economy will be. Globalization means the spread of
free-market capitalism to virtually every country in the world.
 &HT;    The defining document of the Cold War system was the Treaty. The
defining document of the globalization system is the Deal. While
the defining measurement of the Cold War was weight, the defining
measurement of the globalization system is speed _ in commerce,
travel, communication and innovation. The Cold War was about
Einstein's mass-energy equation, E mc2. Globalization is
about Moore's Law, which states that the computing power of silicon
chips will double every 18 months. The Cold War system was built
around nation-states, and it was balanced by two superpowers: the
United States and the Soviet Union. The globalization system is
built around three balances that overlap and affect one another.
One is the traditional balance between states and states. The next
is the balance between states and ``supermarkets'' _ the huge
global stock and bond markets. (The United States can destroy you
by dropping bombs, and the supermarkets can destroy you by
downgrading your bonds.) &HT;    The last is the balance between states and ``super-empowered
individuals.'' Because globalization has brought down the walls
that limited the movement and reach of people, and because it has
simultaneously wired the world into networks, it gives more power
to individuals than ever before to directly influence markets and
nation-states.
 &HT;    For instance, Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire with his
own global network (Jihad Online), declared war on America, and the
Air Force had to launch cruise missiles at him. We launched cruise
missiles at an individual _ as though he were another nation-state.
 &HT;    As the country that benefits most from global economic
integration, we have the responsibility of making sure that this
new system is sustainable. This is particularly important at a time
when the world has been _ and will continue to be _ rocked by
economic crises that can spread rapidly from one continent to
another.
 &HT;    But as the biggest beneficiaries and drivers of globalization,
we are unwittingly putting enormous pressure on the rest of the
world. Americans may think their self-portrait is Grant Wood's
``American Gothic,'' the strait-laced couple, pitchfork in hand,
standing stoically outside the barn. But to the rest of the world,
Americans actually look like some wild, multicolored Andy Warhol
print.
 &HT;    To the rest of the world, American Gothic is actually two
20-something software engineers who come into your country wearing
beads and sandals, with rings in their noses and paint on their
toes. They kick down your front door, overturn everything in the
house, stick a Big Mac in your mouth, fill your kids with ideas you
never had or can't understand, slam a cable box onto your
television, lock in the channel to MTV, plug an Internet connection
into your computer and tell you, ``Download or die.''
 &HT;    We Americans are the apostles of the Fast World, the prophets of
the free market and the high priests of high tech. We want
``enlargement'' of both our values and our Pizza Huts. We want the
world to follow our lead and become democratic and capitalistic,
with a Web site in every pot, a Pepsi on every lip, Microsoft
Windows in every computer and with everyone, everywhere, pumping
their own gas.
 &HT;    No wonder, therefore, that resentment of America is on the rise
globally.
 &HT;    In 1996 I visited Teheran and stayed in the Homa Hotel. The
first thing I noticed was that above the front door in the lobby
were the words ``Down With U.S.A.'' It wasn't a banner. It wasn't
graffiti. It was tiled into the wall. A short time later, I noticed
that Iran's mullahs had begun calling America something other than
the ``Great Satan.'' They had begun calling it ``the capital of
global arrogance.''
 &HT;    The Iranian leadership had grasped the important distinction
between ``global arrogance'' and old-fashioned notions of
imperialism, when one country physically occupies another. Global
arrogance is when your culture and economic clout are so powerful
and widely diffused that you don't need to occupy other people to
influence their lives.
 &HT;    Well, guess what? The Iranians aren't the only ones talking
about America as ``the capital of global arrogance.'' The French,
Germans, Japanese, Indonesians, Indians and Russians also call us
that now.
 &HT;    In most countries, people can no longer distinguish between
American power, American exports, American cultural assaults,
American cultural exports and plain old globalization.
 &HT;    Martin Indyk likes to tell the story of when, as ambassador to
Israel, he was called upon to open the first McDonald's in
Jerusalem. McDonald's gave him a colorful baseball hat to wear,
with the golden arches on it, so he would be properly attired as he
ate the ceremonial first Big Mac in Jerusalem _ with Israel
Television filming every bite for the evening news.
 &HT;    At that moment, an Israeli teen-ager walked up to him, carrying
his own McDonald's hat, which he handed to Indyk with a pen and
asked: ``Are you the ambassador? Can I have your autograph?''
Somewhat sheepishly, Indyk replied: ``Sure. I've never been asked
for my autograph before.''
 &HT;    As the ambassador prepared to sign his name, the Israeli
teen-ager said to him, ``Wow, what's it like to be the ambassador
from McDonald's, going around the world opening McDonald's
restaurants everywhere?''
 &HT;    Indyk looked at the Israeli youth and said, ``No, no. I'm the
American ambassador _ not the ambassador from McDonald's!''
 &HT;    Indyk described what happened next: ``I said to him, 'Does this
mean you don't want my autograph?' And the kid said, 'No, I don't
want your autograph,' and he took his hat back and walked away.''
 &HT;    Oh, well. The trick for America is to lead without being too
overbearing, to be generous without overextending ourselves and to
be tough without engendering too much resentment.
 &HT;    That's no easy trick. But America has had 200 years to invent,
regenerate and calibrate the balances that keep markets free
without their becoming monsters. We have the tools to make a
difference. We have an interest in making a difference. And we have
the responsibility to make a difference.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NORTH AMERICAN and CANADIAN rights only  
 &HT;     (Thomas L. Friedman is the foreign affairs columnist for The
New York Times. This article is adapted from his book, ``The Lexus
and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization,'' to be published
April 21 by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the winter of 1996, I accompanied Madeleine K. Albright, then
the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on a trip to the war
zones of Africa.
 &HT;    During the last stop, in Rwanda, she asked her staff to pose for
a picture outside her Air Force 737. The group included a
Greek-American, a Czech-American, Jewish Americans, black Americans
and white Americans. There were Air Force crewmen from small towns
and diplomats from Ivy League colleges, and they were all standing
there shoulder to shoulder.
 &HT;    As I watched the Rwandan ground crew curiously watching the
picture-taking, I couldn't help wondering what they were making of
this scene, which represented America at its best: the spirit of
community, the melting pot, the willingness to help faraway
strangers in need and, most important, a concept of citizenship
based on allegiance to an idea rather than to a tribe. As a
picture, it represented everything that Rwanda was not.
 &HT;    And as I stood there, I started to get mad _ not just about the
tragedy in Africa but also about a budget debate that was then
going on in Congress. We have something tremendously special in
America, I thought, but if we want to preserve it, we have to pay
for it and nurture it.
 &HT;    Yet, when I listened to the infamous 1994 class of freshman
Republicans _ and when I hear echoes today, with the likes of the
House majority leader, Dick Armey, boasting that he has traveled
abroad only once _ I heard mean-spirited voices, voices for whom
the American government was some kind of evil enemy. I heard men
and women who insisted that the market alone should rule.
 &HT;    And I heard lawmakers who seemed to believe that America had no
special responsibility for maintaining global institutions and
stabilizing an international system that benefits us more than any
other country.
 &HT;    And as I thought about all this on the tarmac of Kigali airport,
I said to myself: ``Well, my freshman Republican friends, come to
Africa. It's a freshman Republican's paradise.'' Yes sir, nobody in
Liberia pays taxes. There's no gun control in Angola. There's no
welfare as we know it in Burundi and no big government to interfere
with the market in Rwanda.
 &HT;    But a lot of their people sure wish there were. Like the desk
clerk in Luanda, Angola, who looked at me as if I were nuts when I
asked her if it was safe to take a walk three blocks from the
hotel, down the main street of the capital in the middle of the
day.
 &HT;    ``No, no, no,'' she shook her head _ not safe.''
 &HT;    I'll bet she wouldn't mind paying some taxes for 100,000 more
police officers.
 &HT;    And then there was the Liberian radio reporter who demanded to
know why the Marines came to Liberia after the civil war broke out
in 1989, evacuated only the U.S. citizens and then left. ``We all
thought, 'The Marines are coming, we will be saved,''' he said.
``How could they leave?''
 &HT;    Poor guy, his country has no marines to rescue him. I'll bet he
wouldn't mind paying some taxes for a few good men.
 &HT;    Employers don't have to fret about those pesky worker-safety
rules in Angola, let alone services for the handicapped. The 70,000
Angolans who have had limbs blown off by land mines get by just
fine on their own. You can see them limping around the streets of
Luanda in Fellini-esque contortions, hustling for food and using
tree limbs as a substitute for the human variety.
 &HT;    And in Rwanda and Burundi, no one is asked to pay for Head
Start, Medicaid, national service or student-loan programs. Instead
they just have a Darwinian competition for scarce land, energy and
water, with Tutsi and Hutu tribesmen taking turns downsizing one
another to grab more resources for themselves.
 &HT;    Many in Congress are reluctant to go on trips abroad. They think
it looks bad to their constituents. Too bad. They want all the
respect and benefits that come with being an American in today's
world, but without any of the sacrifices and obligations that go
with it. They should come to war-torn Africa and get a real taste
of what happens to countries where there is no sense of community,
no sense that people owe their government anything, no sense that
anyone is responsible for anyone else, and where the rich have to
live behind high walls and tinted windows, while the poor are left
to the tender mercies of the marketplace.
 &HT;    I don't want to live in such a country, or such a world. It is
not only wrong, it will become increasingly dangerous. Designing
ways to avoid that should be at the heart of American domestic and
foreign policy. Unfortunately, neither the Democrats nor the
Republicans are thinking in those terms. They behave as if the
world is now safe for us to be both insular and mindlessly
partisan.
 &HT;    To the extent that there is serious discussion about a shared
national interest, it is about whether we can define a new common
threat _ Iraq, China, Russia _ and not a new common mission. The
``big enemy'' is still the organizing principle of American
internationalism, not the ``big opportunity'' _ let alone ``the big
responsibility.''
 &HT;    America does have a bipartisan national interest to pursue, and
it has an enormous role to play. But we won't begin to fully grasp
that until we understand that we are in a new international system.
For the last 10 years we've been talking about ``the post-Cold War

 &HT;    If the Cold War had been a sport, it would have been sumo
wrestling, says Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign-affairs expert at
Johns Hopkins University. ``It would be two big fat guys in a ring,
with all sorts of posturing and rituals and stomping of feet, but
actually very little contact until the end of the match, when there
is a brief moment of shoving and the loser gets pushed out of the
ring, but nobody gets killed.''
 &HT;    If globalization were a sport, it would be the 100-yard dash,
over and over and over. And no matter how many times you win, you

free-market capitalism to virtually every country in the world.
 &HT;    The defining document of the Cold War system was the Treaty. The
defining document of the globalization system is the Deal. While
the defining measurement of the Cold War was weight, the defining
measurement of the globalization system is speed _ in commerce,
travel, communication and innovation. The Cold War was about
Einstein's mass-energy equation, E mc2. Globalization is
about Moore's Law, which states that the computing power of silicon
chips will double every 18 months. The Cold War system was built
around nation-states, and it was balanced by two superpowers: the
United States and the Soviet Union. The globalization system is
built around three balances that overlap and affect one another.
One is the traditional balance between states and states. The next
is the balance between states and ``supermarkets'' _ the huge
global stock and bond markets. (The United States can destroy you
by dropping bombs, and the supermarkets can destroy you by
downgrading your bonds.) &HT;    The last is the balance between states and ``super-empowered

 &HT;    We Americans are the apostles of the Fast World, the prophets of
the free market and the high priests of high tech. We want
``enlargement'' of both our values and our Pizza Huts. We want the

   SCI-WRITING-ORIGINS (Undated) _ When it comes to explaining the
origins of writing, scientists are largely at a loss. But many at a
recent symposium favored a broad explanation of writing's origins
in the visual arts, pictograms of things being transformed into
increasingly abstract symbols for things, names and eventually
words in speech. Their views clashed with a widely held theory that
writing grew out of the pieces of clay that Sumerian accountants
had used to keep track of livestock and stores of grain. Scholars
assembled also conceded that they had no definitive answer to the
question of whether writing was invented only once and spread
elsewhere or arose independently several times in several places,
like Egypt, the Indus valley, China and among the Olmecs and Maya
of Mexico and Central America. By John Noble Wilford. (2200 words)

   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RESEARCH-SECRECY (Undated) _ The strings that often come
with private research money _ the publication delays while patents
and profits are pursued, the proprietary findings _ hold the
pernicious potential to impede the free exchange of information
that speeds scientific progress, experts warned during a conference
on ``Secrecy in Science'' held by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. By Carey Goldberg. (1600 words)
</P>

   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASPERGERS-SYNDROME (Undated) _ Asperger's syndrome, a
condition that is generally considered a less severe form of
autism, remains little known, but the number of diagnoses has
soared since psychiatric authorities formally defined it five years
ago. Recent survey data suggest that under some definitions as many
as 1 in 500 people have the condition, higher than the estimate for
classic autism. By John O'Neil. (1925 words)

   SCI-COMPUTER-MEMORY (Undated) _ Heralding an era that will blend
the speed of the microelectronic world of silicon with the
permanence of the magnetic world of computer disks, a group of
I.B.M. researchers said last week that they had successfully
designed the building blocks of a new kind of computer memory that
could fundamentally alter computer design early in the next
century. Chips based on this new technology, known as tunneling
magnetic junction random access memory, or tmj-ram for short, would
be ultrafast, consume very little power and retain stored data when
a computer was shut down. By John Markoff. (1050 words)

 &HT;    WORKERS DESERVE FACTS ON CASH BALANCE PLANS
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the news business, there isn't anything quite as intriguing
as something that everyone wants to keep secret _ especially when
money is involved.
</P>
<P>
   So, let me shine some light on something benefit consultants and
many companies don't want you to know.
</P>
<P>
   I recently wrote about the advent of cash benefit pension plans,
which, unlike traditional plans, spread company retirement
contributions more evenly throughout an employee's career, saving
companies millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't want you to know that, because some workers,
especially longtime, older employees, end up on the losing end of
the deal if provisions are not made during the conversion from the
old to new plan.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now it seems Congress, too, is getting interested in them,
concerned too many workers are having a fast one pulled on them.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some excerpts of transcripts of an actuarial society
meeting recently released by the Senate Finance Committee, which is
looking into this matter:
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, one consultant from the Aon Consulting group
explained, ``The basic approach here is that we're going to change
the form of their pension plan. Yes, if I have a 1 percent final
average pay plan and I reduce that 1 percent to 0.8 percent,
everybody knows _ you don't have to be an actuary to figure out _
that you just had a benefit cutback. That's kind of obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he continued: ``If you give them something different, it
isn't as obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard for employees to figure out the changes. One
consultant from PricewaterhouseCoopers pointed out at the same
meeting that ``very little comparison can be done between the two
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts have the benefits community in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing makes us look kind of slimy,'' said one
benefits consultant, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sher, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Teaneck,
N.J., said the comments were made at professional meetings and are
jocular in tone. No one realized the comments would wind up in
Congress or in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, he said, don't make the switch to cash balance plans
primarily to hide benefit changes because they could be negative _
that motivation is way down on the list. Mostly they do it for
business reasons or to attract and retain employees or to appeal to
young or mobile workers.
</P>
<P>
   But others aren't buying that. ``How do they sleep at night?''
asked E. Dale Wortham, president of the AFL-CIO in Harris County,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Employees need to know if their pensions have changed so they
can alter their retirement plans, said U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen,
D-Houston. But the laws governing pension plans allow employers to
explain the changes in broad and often deceptive ways.
</P>
<P>
   If employers phrase it the ``right way,'' the losers won't find
out until it's too late, said Bentsen, who is co-sponsoring
legislation to require employers to notify individual employees of
their pension benefits under the old and new plans.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has a long way to go _ it has to get through
committees in both houses and then to the floors _ but it is
picking up bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea, said Wortham. ``Most people don't have an
actuary who lives next door,'' and they can't afford to hire one.
</P>
<P>
   The United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, which converted its
pension plan to a cash balance plan three years ago, hasn't had a
chance to study the proposed Pension Right to Know Act of 1999. But
spokesman Mario Gomez said the agency supports any effort to
provide full disclosure to employees to help them prepare for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Reliant Energy, which switched to cash balance last year, wants
to provide employees with accurate, useful and meaningful
retirement information, said spokeswoman Sandy Fruhman.
</P>
<P>
   But, she argued, some of the information that would have to be
disclosed isn't relevant. For example, the bill would require
Reliant to make pension projections three, five and 10 years after
the conversion, but the company has already agreed to give all
employees who leave the company in the next 10 years the higher
value of either plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reliant also is worried about making long-term projections that
the bill requires because it's hard to know an employee's future
salary or what promotions he'll receive, Fruhman said.

 &HT;    TEXAS' POOR NEED MORE THAN WELFARE REFORM
 &HT;    
 &HT;    COMMENTARY
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's mantra of ``compassionate
conservatism'' is already trite, but it will continue to be
discussed, debated and sometimes ridiculed as the governor's
presidential race continues to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside all the political rhetoric over what Bush's use of
the term may actually mean, most people consider ``compassionate''
a perfectly good, positive and pretty straightforward word.
</P>
<P>
   It came to mind with the release of still another report that in
these days of bustling entrepreneurship and soaring stock averages
millions of Texans are still being left behind, many through no
fault of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is at least as old as government, and those who govern
can do only so much for those who are poor. The debate is always
over how much ``so much'' should be.
</P>
<P>
   The most fashionable political attack on poverty in recent years
_ coming from such disparate sources as President Clinton and
would-be-president Bush _ has been welfare reform. And, thanks in
no small part to a mostly healthy economy, millions of people in
Texas and other states have been moved from the welfare rolls to
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many former welfare recipients are turning their lives around,
prodded by laws forcing them to get jobs or else. For many other
poor people, however, welfare reform alone isn't the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Most poor people in Texas work, according to a new study by the
Center for Public Policy Priorities. For various reasons, usually
an inadequate education, they just don't earn enough money to make
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, there are people out there who are working
but are still poor,'' said Dick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst for
the center, who helped put together the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Public Policy Priorities is a nonpartisan,
nonprofit group that analyzes the effects of public policy on low-
and moderate-income people. It also is an advocacy group that not
only preaches governmental compassion for those in need but also
urges changes in tax, spending and educational policies that would
help more poor people to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Using Census Bureau data from 1995 to 1997, a period during
which welfare reforms were beginning to take effect in Texas, the
report determined that one of every six Texans lived below the
poverty line. That was 16.9 percent of Texans, compared to a
national average of 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate was even higher among Texas children. Some 24
percent of Texas youngsters _ one in every four _ were poor.
</P>
<P>
   The study determined that more than 80 percent of poor families
in Texas with children and almost 60 percent of poor families and
individuals without children had one or more adults who worked
during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty-stricken parents who were employed worked an average of
more than 44 weeks, or more than 10 months, a year in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And, the study concluded, more than 70 percent of poor families
with children get most of their income from wages, while only 11
percent relied on welfare for most of their income.
</P>
<P>
   Lavine readily acknowledged that government alone cannot improve
these people's lives. Many are struggling because of rapid
technological changes in the workplace, and others blew their
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But there are things _ aside from welfare reform _ that the
state can do to improve the prospects of many of its disadvantaged
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   One is improved health care. People cannot work or learn very
well if they're chronically sick.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with $1.8 billion in early proceeds from the state's
settlement with tobacco companies, lawmakers will make some
improvements in this critical area, including an expansion of a
health insurance program for children of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Not so promising are efforts to increase the state minimum wage
from $3.35 an hour to $5.15 an hour (the federal level) and expand
unemployment insurance to cover part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature won't change the regressive nature of the state
tax system, which hits poor people the hardest, proportionately.
But lawmakers are considering some minor consumer relief, endorsed
by the governor, in sales tax exemptions for diapers and
over-the-counter medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But the most critical difference legislators can make is through
further improvements to the public education system, including
incentives for young people to remain in school. The jury is still
out on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Texas parents who work but are still poor are
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doomed,'' Lavine said.
</P>

AS I SAID, ELACTING HOMER A NO-BRAINER

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 b.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHKENIX - ``Homer Simpson has the most disrespectful,
irresponsible show and image on TV, and is a horrible example to
ever}one.''
</P>
<P>
   So said one reader who(didn't leave his name$on a phone message.
Do tell. Please, sir, continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody I know likes the show,'' he went on. ``So, no,(he's not
</P>
<P>
   the greatest character, and you can't proclaim him that because of
your little vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I can. And will. Repeating what I said in this space
last week: Homer Simpson is the greatest televisioj character of
all time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what this fellow would have you believe, I'm not the
only one who thinks so. In a decidedly unscien|ific poll, about 140
readers called or wrote to vote for their favorite chazicter.
</P>
<P>
   And 75 of 'em voted for Homer. Bazney Fife and Archie Bunker
were a distant, distant second and third, Barney with seven votes
and Archie with five.
</P>
<P>
   How do you love Homer? Let us count just some of the ways.
</P>
<P>
   - ''Homer Simpson surely is the greatest TV character of all and
for one simple reason: There is (as much as we'd hate to admit it)
a little Homer in all of us,'' wrote Scott Orr. ``I find myself
kind of*amused to admit that I'm sort of `Homeric,' but it's true.
So watching him on TV is watching a reflection of us all.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``he's the best because, throughout it all, he and his sife
love each other, they keep their family together, and they love
their kids,'' Jo Anne said in a phone message. ``Let's face it,
Homer's like mkst husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``My husband is Homer, and my daughter is Homer,'' Cindy Wise
said. Your daughter? ``She's just like her dad,'' Wise said. ``I
yell, `Homer!' and they both come.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``You'd have to be a Grade A moron to ever question whether
Homer Simpson is TV's greatest character!'' Deanna Jiddulph said by
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   - And, as more than one voter put it, ``Homer rules!''
</P>
<P>
   Misguided though they lay be, some people dof't appreciate
Homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you insult your readers by writing this stupid
article?'' one apparently insulted reader asked. ``It is probably
one of the dumbest, idiotic shows on television. Why they think
these cartoon shows are cute, I don't understand. Maybe I'm too
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Nah, that can't be it. After all, Martha Mazo said, ``There's
only one show that I will say is worth watching, and that's `The
Simpsons.' '' And she's 85 years old. Got her first television in
1951, so she knows what she's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   No one argued that Homer should be hailed as a role model
(though many peopde acknowledged similarities between their lives
and his).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my kids to watch the show,'' Kathy said. ``So I
have to sneak and watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the messages that were hard to decipher, such as
this one, e-mailed by Paul Connolly of Royal Oak, Mich.:
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Homer is the Pope of Chilitown when it comes to TV's
greatest characters. But as Homer told Bart, `It's not whether you
win or lose _ it's how drunk you get.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Don't know what it means, but I like it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Barney Fife fans were just as passionate as Homer fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hole did you crawl out of?'' Charles Denman asked. ``How
could (Homer) be greater than Barney Fife? Simpson can't come close
to him. It's hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   True, bumbling Barney is a great character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underweight constable could never outgrow his part,'' as
Joel Rittmueller wrote. And Barney's boss, Andy, got a few votes
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those votes was as impressive as the one cast for
another member of ``The Andy Griffith Show'': ``It's me, it's me,
it's Ernest T!'' one man shouted in a respectable impression of
Ernest T. Bass. Made you want to throw a rock with a note tied to
it through a window.
</P>
<P>
   (Along the same lines, another caller left a vote for Homer in
an excellent Mayor Quimby drone.)
</P>
<P>
   Archie Bunker's supporters also felt strongly about their
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg to differ with your choice, or as he would say it,
`cherce,' '' Bob Marshak wrote. ``Archie opened new avenues of
expression and opinion for all TV viewers. Before Archie, many
topics were strictly taboo, but Arch explored them all. From race
to religion to homosexuality to menopause, Archie and his family
exposed the TV audience to these new areas of our lives. Some may
say these topics should have remained in the closet (pardon the
pun), yet others were happy we were taking about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Glaser figures Archie would be right at home in cactus
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't represent America, especially Arizona, I don't
know who does,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Some votes were thoughtful _ a nod to Molly Dodd, for instance.
Others were, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else can overcome obstacles, has all the integrity in the
world . . . takes the initiative?'' asked Vitto. ``Gilligan.
G-I-L-L-I-G-A-N.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelling it was a nice touch.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one woman who didn't leave her name didn't limit her
love of a good TV character to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ed, because he was smarter and funnier than most people,''
she said. ``And he was a beautiful horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. &QL;

 &HT;    Bonds' big capital appreciation looks like it's history
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't worry about interest rates. So says Bill Gross, the
nation's most successful bond fund manager, who oversees $155
billion in fixed-income investments at Pimco Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: He doesn't think interest rates will move much.
</P>
<P>
   Gross has an uncanny knack for sifting through economic data and
betting the right way. He's beaten the benchmark Lehman Brothers
aggregate bond index for eight of the past 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   That success hasn't gone unnoticed. One of the funds he manages,
Pimco Total Return, now is the nation's largest bond fund, with
assets of more than $25 billion. Since July, investors in Japan
also have been allowed to invest in the fund. So far, they've
plunked down $675 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates may go down a bit over the next few months if
the economy slows,'' Gross says. ``But don't expect fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross explains that the bull market in bonds, which began in
1981, is probably over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean that the bottom (of the bond market) we saw in
October 1998 during the global contagion probably marked the ebb of
interest rates and the peak of bond prices going forward,'' Gross
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices and bond yields move in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   How confident is he of his forecast?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 80 percent,'' Gross says. He puts the chance of
inflation reigniting at 10 percent; and global recession at 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a steady, low-inflation environment, Gross says bond
investors should expect that most, if not all, of their return will
likely come from the coupon _ or yield _ on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would caution investors to simply think of bonds as income
and yield generators, as opposed to capital gains providers,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Current yields remain attractive, relative to inflation, which
is running about 1.5 percent, Gross says.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some fixed-income investments are better buys than
others, he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorites: Mortgage-backed securities, which now
account for half of the $155 billion in fixed-income investments he
oversees. They currently yield about 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One way to invest in mortgage-backed securities is to buy shares
in a Ginnie Mae fund, Gross suggests.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes tax-free municipal bonds. Insured 10-year munis
now yield 4.45 percent. That translates into a 7.37 percent yield
for those in the 39.6 percent tax bracket, and 6.18 percent for
those in the 28 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Gross recommends Treasury securities that mature in five to 10
years. They now yield 5.14 percent and 5.28 percent, respectively.
That's on average about a half percentage point less than the yield
of 30-year Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get almost as much yield, and a lot less risk,'' he
observes.
</P>
<P>
   Gross is lukewarm to high-yield, or junk, bonds, even though
their yields are attractive. The bonds could be hurt if the economy
tanks, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't load up the boat,'' he says. He suggests a mix of junk
bonds and municipals to mitigate that risk.
</P>
<P>
   Gross would avoid foreign bonds. High-quality ones have low
yields, while those of developing countries are ``dicey,'' he says.

 &HT;    Online investing has its perils and requires research
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet cuts out the middleman. For the most part, that's
good: less-expensive books and plane tickets and, in some cases,
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If you're buying a book or a ticket, squeezing out the middleman
doesn't cost you much _ maybe some small talk at the register. But
cutting out the middleman in a stock investment can mean missing
out on information.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, Jayme Colasanti heard about a company
announcing a 3-for-1 stock split. He'd read about it on America
Online, on a page that lists stocks with pending splits. Instead of
going to a stockbroker for advice and information, Colasanti, who
invests as a hobby, called up Yahoo!'s finance site to do his
homework. Satisfied with the company's press releases available
online, the 35-year-old Syracuse, N.Y., resident then went to a
discount broker and put in an order for 333 shares at a total cost
of $4,300.
</P>
<P>
   When the split became effective, the shares dropped much more
than the split would account for, reducing the value of his total
investment to about $500.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for an explanation, Colasanti called the only number
listed on the press releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy came to the phone and was all accusatory, asking me
who I was. I asked about the split and what happened, and he didn't
have an answer. But he kept asking who I was and where I was from.
Keep in mind this is a public company, and I'm one of its
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd made a mistake right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Colasanti is one of a growing number of investors taking
advantage of technological improvements that let people juggle
investments from the den. More investors are bypassing traditional
investment routes and buying stock from Web sites of online
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of online investing or online research are cost
savings and convenience. Just as it is true when you buy from a
store where you bag your own groceries, helping yourself can be
cheaper than paying for help.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process, some investors are throwing themselves into
the jungle of do-it-yourself investing, where the dominant law is
Darwin's: the survival of the fittest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the interest in the stock market, and Internet stocks in
particular, is created and sustained by the Web. Investor sites
such as Silicon Investor (www.techstocks.com), Raging Bull
(www.ragingbull.com) and Yahoo! Finance (quote
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com) offer solid information, such as historical data
about the performance of public companies and links to Securities
and Exchange Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sites offer message boards, which can be sources of
reliable information, but can also be filled with rumor and hype.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has guidelines to help investors filter the information
available and possibly avoid Internet stock fraud. The main advice
is do your homework, which means more than reading press releases.
The SEC advises against investing based solely on what you read in
an online newsletter or bulletin board posting, especially when the
company is small and obscure.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also says not to invest in small companies that don't
file regular reports with the agency, unless you are willing to
analyze the financial reports yourself, verify claims about new
products or contracts, call suppliers and customers, and check out
the backgrounds of the people running the company.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 6,500 stocks whose prices are quoted on
the over-the-counter bulletin board do not file financial documents
with the SEC, which means investors are on their own. They would
have to contact each company and request such information.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory agencies are trying to make sure financial
information is more readily available to investors. The National
Association of Securities Dealers recently passed a rule that will
make companies traded on the OTC bulletin board file with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Companies traded over the counter have not had to file quarterly
and annual financial reports. The new rule, adopted by the SEC in
January, requires the filings to begin by June 2000.

 &HT;    Overseas investments can bolster a portfolio
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While many investors continue to pour money into U.S. stocks _
dazzled by spectacular returns over the past nine years _ others
are hedging their bets by putting some money to work overseas.
</P>
<P>
   They are attracted not only by the relative bargains, but also
by the fact the addition of foreign stocks to a U.S. stock
portfolio will _ over time _ reduce risk and enhance returns.
</P>
<P>
   Studies support that.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 16 out of the 20 rolling 10-year periods between
1979 and 1998, a portfolio that included 20 percent international
stocks and 80 percent U.S. stocks matched, or outperformed, a
portfolio invested exclusively in U.S. stocks, according to T. Rowe
Price Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions were the last four years, when U.S. stocks, as
measured by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, enjoyed outsized
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can put their money overseas in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   One is to buy shares of international mutual funds, which invest
everywhere but in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some funds invest only in a particular region, such as Latin
America, or in a single country.
</P>
<P>
   Many regional and single-country funds are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, often at a discount to their net asset values.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also can buy shares of foreign companies in the form
of American depositary receipts, or ADRs, which trade like U.S.
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ADRs possess all of the other problems associated with
buying a foreign stock, including exposure to currency risk and
country risk. Returns on an ADR are determined in large part by the
sum of the return of the stock on the local exchange, plus the
return of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign markets, such as Argentina and Hong Kong, are
closely correlated to ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina and Hong Kong both have currencies fixed to U.S.
dollars,'' explains Vivian Lewis, editor of Global Investing
newsletter. So the stocks of companies based in those countries are
likely to be negatively affected by a tumble on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock markets of other countries, such as Chile and
Israel, aren't much correlated to ours, says Lewis. She
particularly likes Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of concern about the political risks, Israel is a very
cheap market,'' according to Lewis. ``It has a lot of high-tech
companies, and we constantly find new ones that are terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   One is BVR Systems (ticker symbol BVRS), a maker of
advanced-training and computer-based simulation systems for
military use.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Magal Security Systems (MAGSF), which makes
computerized systems that automatically detect, locate and identify
intruders, or explosive devices in luggage and packages.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, Lewis likes Provida (PVD), which administers pensions
in a growing number of countries in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   She also recommends investors consider:
</P>
<P>
   AXA (AXA), a French insurance group expanding its global reach.
In the United States, the company's insurance activities are
conducted through Equitable. AXA also controls the Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Aracruz Celulose (ARA), a Brazilian producer of bleached
eucalyptus pulp that is sold for dollars to high-grade paper makers
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among closed-end funds, Lewis suggests Austria Fund (OST),
European Warrant Fund (EWF), First Australia Prime Income Fund
(FAX), India Growth Fund (IGF), Korea Fund (KF) and Templeton
Emerging Markets (EMF).
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy funds that enable you to do certain kinds of investing
that you otherwise would not be able to do as a retail investor,''
Lewis says. She notes, for example, that markets in some countries,
such as India, aren't readily accessible to individual American
investors.

 &HT;    Long-term winner ever the optimist
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to investing, it pays to think positive.
</P>
<P>
   So says L. Roy Papp, who's managed money on Wall Street for more
than four decades, frequently beating the performance of the
benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: My professor at Wharton (School of the
University of Pennsylvania) once said to me, `You can be
pessimistic whenever you feel like being pessimistic, just don't
stay there very long, because long term you can't win as a
pessimist,''' says Papp, who turned 72 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, our country has been growing ever since it was
started,'' says Papp, who believes that although stocks have gone
up a lot, they still remain attractive.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: The U.S. economy keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months ago, economists were talking about 2 percent
growth,'' says Papp, whose collection of Chinese paintings recently
was exhibited at the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of
Georgia. ``Now, they're talking about 3 percent. The amazing thing
is this is all happening in spite of economic problems in Asia and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy remains strong because consumers still are willing,
and able, to spend, Papp says. And our economy, which is less
reliant on manufacturing, is more resistant to recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recessions don't occur with regularity as they once did,''
Papp says. They used to occur every 51 months and last nine months.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer has helped change all that, Papp says. It has
boosted productivity and helped companies manage inventories
better.
</P>
<P>
   If recessions don't occur as often, ``that makes stocks worth a
lot more than they used to be worth,'' according to Papp, whose
firm manages five no-load funds, including the L. Roy Papp Stock
Fund and the Papp America-Abroad Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Papp avoids buying shares of cyclical companies, whose prospects
are closely linked to economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers to buy stocks of companies with above-average
profitability, evidenced in part by at least 10 years of consistent
earnings and dividend increases. And he likes to buy them at prices
that do not reflect their superior long-term earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   The shares are kept so long as Papp believes the prospects for
appreciation remain favorable, and the stocks are not greatly
overvalued in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   One stock Papp jettisoned was Coca-Cola (ticker symbol KO).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our largest holding in 1993 in the Papp America-Abroad
Fund,'' he says. ``We started selling Coca-Cola in 1994 because it
was very high priced. We kept some of it until last year, when we
sold the remaining stock at between $85 and $66.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares Coca-Cola to State Street Corp. (STT), which serves
as custodian and manager of almost $5 trillion in assets. Its
shares have performed just as well as Coca-Cola's, both
appreciating at an annual rate of 27.1 percent from 1988 through
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally believe both companies will achieve earnings
growth of about 14 percent over the next five years. Yet Coca-Cola
currently trades at more than 42 times this year's estimated
earnings of $1.44 a share; and State Street, which Papp recommends,
trades at 28 times estimated 1999 earnings of $3.03 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Papp also likes stocks in two industries that are likely to
continue to enjoy robust growth: pharmaceuticals and technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the former, he likes Merck (MRK). Papp says it has one of the
lowest valuations in the drug group, but has one of the best
new-product pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   In technology, he likes American Power Conversion (APCC), which
makes power packs and surge protectors for computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the third best average annual return for shareholders
for the last 10 years,'' according to Papp.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes chip maker Intel (INTC) and BMC Software (BMCS), a
provider of application management software that helps companies,
including those related to the Internet, to improve their
competitiveness and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Other stocks he recommends include insurer American
International Group (AIG); money manager T. Rowe Price Associates
(TROW); advertising giant Interpublic Group (IPG); retailer Office
Depot (ODP); and Steiner Leisure (STNRF), a debt-free company that
provides beauty parlor and spa services on 80 percent of the cruise
ships that ply the North Atlantic and Caribbean.

 &HT;    Small-caps' champion banking on a rebound
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric T. McKissack invests where many fear to tread. The manager
of the Ariel Appreciation Fund, which has $335 million in assets,
invests mostly in small- to mid-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It's an asset class that has lagged behind large-company stocks,
epitomized by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, for five years
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   That's prompted many investors to abandon small-company stocks
and the mutual funds that invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   But McKissack believes that small- to mid-cap stocks are due for
a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   History is on his side. After all, over the past 72 years,
small-cap stocks have provided a compounded annual return of 12.4
percent, outpacing the S&AMP;P 500, with 11.2 percent, according to
Chicago-based Ibbotson Associates.
</P>
<P>
   McKissack says there are good reasons why large-cap stocks have
outperformed their smaller brethren in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The globalization of business has been to the greater
advantage of large-cap companies,'' he says. ``The huge asset
inflows into mutual funds has emphasized the larger-cap issues,
where there is more liquidity and greater ability to put dollars to
work quickly for the fund manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors also prefer investing in the shares of big
U.S. companies they are familiar with, McKissack adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger companies also can take advantage of cost cutting and
business efficiencies to a greater degree, which has led to higher
earnings growth,'' McKissack says. ``They have also benefited from
interest rate trends. They have been able to leverage the business
and marketing environment to impact their growth rates to a greater
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   And some technology stocks _ particularly those related to the
Internet _ have rocketed in value, quickly transforming them into
large-cap stocks and attracting investors in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's drawn a lot of attention away from the smaller names,''
McKissack says.
</P>
<P>
   And prices are cheaper as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price-to-earnings ratio of the Russell 2000 is about a 20
percent discount to the S&AMP;P 500,'' McKissack observes. ``The
price-to-book value is about a 40 percent discount to the S&AMP;P 500.
So those relative valuations are historically low.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McKissack acknowledges that history also shows that
investing in small-cap stock is riskier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our value orientation helps mitigate that risk,'' says
McKissack, who is co-chief investment officer at Chicago-based
Ariel Capital Management, which manages assets of more than $2.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to buy out-of-favor stocks _ including those that have
been misunderstood or ignored _ whose prices already are depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they're not as volatile when the market goes into the
tank,'' says McKissack. He likes companies that have distinct
market niches, solid finances, strong managements and established
records of success.
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorites:
</P>
<P>
   Specialty Equipment (ticker symbol SEC), which makes service
equipment for restaurants, including McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not widely known on Wall Street,'' McKissack says.
``They went through a reorganization a few years ago, so their
balance sheet isn't pristine. That has probably deterred some
investors. But the cash flow and business characteristics are very
good. The stock has done well over the past year, moving from the
mid-teens to $26. We still see upside from here.''
</P>
<P>
   McKissack also likes Equifax (EFX), which isn't a small-cap
stock. But the stock has lagged. It tumbled 22 percent Dec. 23
after the company, which provides credit and other information to
businesses, warned that earnings would fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McKissack notes the company has a ``good record of
consistent earnings'' and the stock will remain under pressure
until profits get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock's attractive for someone looking beyond the one- to
two-year horizon,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another stock McKissack likes is Interface (IFSIA), a maker of
carpet tiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that management was slow to recognize the
slowdown in their industry,'' McKissack says. ``But we have done a
lot of homework in terms of talking to their customers and people
in the industry and have found they remain highly regarded for
their products and service. We're fairly confident the selling is
overdone. It's selling at a fraction of sales and book value.''
</P>
<P>
   McKissack also recommends Galileo International (GLC), a
provider of computerized reservation services to the travel
industry. It has fat profit margins and low debt, but some
investors fear it may lose market share as more travelers use the
Internet to buy airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, many of the Internet-based travel providers use
Galileo and other computer reservations systems to do their
comparative travel bookings,'' McKissack says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the money manager recommends two media companies. He
says Central Newspapers (ECP), which owns newspapers in
Indianapolis and Phoenix, is selling at a ``substantial'' discount
to its peers. Lee Enterprises (LEE, LEENB) owns newspapers and
television stations. The performance of the company's TV business
has lagged that of its newspapers, McKissack observes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for management to improve the returns on
the TV side, or sell the stations off,'' he says.

SHEPARD TRIAL NEAR, TOWN ON THE DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ Residents say this wind-swept college town is
Anywhere, USA.
</P>
<P>
   From the part-time mayor to university students, they say it
with an edge of defensiveness. One after another they point out
that a young gay man could have been killed in any city in America
for no other reason than his sexuality. But that doesn't alter the
fact that Matthew Shepard died here.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of shame runs through Laramie these days. So does a
sense of siege. As this Western prairie town prepares for the trial
of one of two men accused of beating the 21-year-old college
freshman and leaving him lashed to a fence to die last fall,
townspeople understand that their way of life is on trial, too. As
a sign that appeared on bumper stickers and in store windows early
on explained, ``Violence is not a Laramie value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrendous crime, no doubt about that; it made us
sick,'' said Mayor Dave Wiliams. ``But now that the trial is here,
we're trying to paint a more-positive picture. Laramie has clean
air and blue skies. It's a good place to raise a family. The town
is a hardworking town.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a town of 29,000, including almost 10,000 students at
the University of Wyoming, where many residents say they never have
met a gay person, and where the safest place for gays and lesbians
to meet in public is at the Friday night ``coffee house'' at the
Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. Despite the outrage that
followed Shepard's killing, Wyoming failed for the fifth time to
pass a bias crimes bill _ a failure that state Representative Mike
Massie, a cosponsor, traces to its inclusion of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Jim Osborn, coadviser of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual,
Transgendered Student Association on campus, insisted that
small-town stereotypes of Laramie abound. It is not an easy place
to be gay, he says, but name somewhere that it is? He said he was
heartened by the outcry in Laramie after Shepard's gruesome death _
by the candlelight vigils, the protest marches, and the feeling
that sensibilities began to shift after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laramie definitely got stereotyped as a backwater community, a
gun-toting redneck place,'' said Osborn, who was a friend of
Shepard's. ``These attacks happen all over the nation. This is not
just a Laramie problem. It just happened to happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ugliness of what happened in the early hours of Oct. 7 will
be revisited day after day in a trial expected to start Wednesday
and last up to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the onslaught of attention _ and the
possibility that antigay activists from Kansas who picketed
Shepard's funeral with signs reading ``No Tears for Queers'' may
return _ the simple stone courthouse has been fortified with
barricades. Uniformed guards will patrol the grounds. Cameras have
been banned in the third-floor courtroom of District Judge Jeffrey
Donnell. The 12 jurors and three alternates chosen last week will
be sequestered.
</P>
<P>
   First up in Albany County District Court is Russell Henderson,
21, a roof repairman who is charged with first-degree murder,
kidnapping, and aggravated robbery. Police allege he and Aaron
McKinney pretended to be homosexuals, lured Shepard from the
Fireside Lounge, and took him to a remote area east of Laramie,
where they bludgeoned him with the butt of a .357 Magnum pistol,
robbed him and left him for dead.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, 22 and also a roofer, is slated to go on trial Aug. 9.
Each of their girlfriends is charged with being an accessory after
the fact. One has pleaded guilty, the other not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   During jury selection, Henderson's defense lawyer appeared
concerned that the suspects already have been convicted in the mind
of the nation and of the town, considered one of the most liberal
in conservative Wyoming because of the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to begin by disregarding the guilt thing, that we
have to punish somebody to show the nation we're not some dusty old
cow town,'' Wyatt Skaggs, Henderson's lawyer, told potential jurors
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants could face the death penalty. Since 1967, six
people have been sentenced to death in Wyoming; only one has been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs is expected to argue that Henderson was a bystander to
Shepard's death, that McKinney was the killer in what has also been
described as a robbery gone awry. Both of Shepard's shoes and his
wallet were taken. But McKinney also allegedly told Shepard, a
slightly built political science major, that he was about to be
beaten because it was Gay Awareness Week on the Laramie campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of violence doesn't just happen in small towns; this
was not an isolated instance,'' said Cathy Renna, who was
``pleasantly surprised'' to be embraced by Laramie when, as
community relations director for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Discrimination, she arrived here after the killing. ``It
isn't Laramie's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for gay rights fear the defendants' lawyers will
try to use the so-called homosexual panic defense, arguing that
Shepard made a pass at the pair of high school dropouts and that
they overreacted in fear and revulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The panic defense was used in the case of the man who shot and
killed a ``secret crush'' he was introduced to on the ``Jenny
Jones'' tabloid TV program. He was convicted of second-degree
murder, but a new trial has been granted. He is now suing the TV
show.
</P>
<P>
   A similar defense was unveiled recently in the case of one of
two men charged with killing Billy Jack Gaither, a gay man in
Alabama who was beaten and then set afire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexual panic is not a recognized psychological disorder;
it's a defense obviously manufactured to sway juries toward some
level of sympathy for the defendant,'' said Jeffrey Montgomery,
executive director of the Triangle Foundation, a Detroit-based gay
and lesbian antiviolence project.
</P>
<P>
   But the morality play unfolding in Laramie appears to have left
little room for ambiguity about the murderers and the motive. The
defendants have been demonized from the start. Shepard has been
cast as a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine an unbiased jury because everyone I know
thinks they're guilty, and it seems like they're just debating the
degree of guilt,'' said Brian Elliott, who is in the university's
graduate botany program. ``The lines are pretty clearly drawn.
They've been demonized and rightly so.''
</P>
<P>
   Expected to cost at least $150,000 apiece, the two trials,
together with the police investigation, are a burden for Albany
County, which has an annual budget of about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the belt-tightening is worth what the Gem City of the
Plains has learned about itself in the six months since Shepard
died.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rev. Stephen Johnson, minister of the Unitarian
Universalist Fellowship, said: ``I know some in the community just
want things to get back to normal, whatever normal is, but we've
started a conversation here that isn't going to stop. Laramie is
never going to be the same again.''

 &HT;    Tech watcher: Choppy '99, then upturn
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors have been flocking to high-tech stocks, lured by their
spectacular returns.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks tumbled in February, only to roar back in early
March.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the volatility to continue, says Charles A. Morris,
manager of the T. Rowe Price Science &AMP; Technology Fund, which has
assets of nearly $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: The industry is working through some fundamental
issues, such as excess capacity in semiconductors, a hiatus in the
introduction of new products and the economic meltdown in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers also have deferred spending on hardware and
software, as they strive to resolve the millennium bug. In some
cases, customers also have been distracted by mergers and
acquisitions, particularly in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``1999 is essentially a workout period for many of these
issues,'' says Morris, who has managed the fund since 1991. ``But
many of those issues will be neutralized _ or begin to get better _
as we move through the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Morris isn't making any big bets.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's assets are about evenly divided in four industry
groups: Software, hardware, communications and data services.
</P>
<P>
   Within those groups, he's investing in stocks whose prospects
remain bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Company-specific fundamentals will drive performance,'' Morris
says.
</P>
<P>
   One stock he likes is Parametric Technology (ticker symbol
PMTC), the No. 1 maker of computer programs that help engineers
design cars, planes and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Morris thinks the shares could rebound to $25 to $40 over the
next 12 to 18 months. After trading as high as $36.31 1/4 in June,
they tumbled to as low as $8.50 in October, after the company
warned of weak demand in Asia and a shift to a new product.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his optimism: He thinks earnings will be back on
track, estimating Parametric Technology will earn 80 cents a share
this fiscal year and $1.15 to $1.40 a share next year. It earned 40
cents a share last year.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also likes Atlanta-based First Data (FDC), the largest
processor of credit card transactions. Earnings have been under
pressure, as the company restructured to close unprofitable
businesses and cut expenses. The stock traded as low as $19.68 3/4
in October, but has since rebounded to around $43, as its earnings
prospects have brightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock has legs to go in the $50 to $60 range,'' Morris
says.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Atlanta-based National Data (NDC), which processes
bank card transactions. It also provides claims processing and
other services to the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Morris thinks the stock could rise to $60 from around $42
currently, particularly if the company recasts itself. ``I would
strongly encourage the company to split into two before somebody
does it for them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Morris has avoided buying the pure-play Internet stocks,
such as Yahoo! (YHOO) and eBay (EBAY). ``They'll need to pull back
at least 50 percent for us to be interested,'' Morris says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he suggests that investors buy the shares of four
established companies that aren't totally dependent on the Internet
for future growth, yet are benefiting from it: Cisco Systems
(CSCO), EMC (EMC), Oracle (ORCL) and Sun Microsystems (SUNW).
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular performance of one Internet-related issue, that
of Norcross-based CheckFree Holdings (CKFR), which provides
electronic commerce software and services, prompted him to lock in
profits. It jumped from a low of $5.75 in October to around $44
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold in the past month,'' Morris said. The fund had owned a
million shares.

   SCI-WRITING-ORIGINS (Undated) _ When it comes to explaining the
origins of writing, scientists are largely at a loss. But many at a
recent symposium favored a broad explanation of writing's origins
in the visual arts, pictograms of things being transformed into
increasingly abstract symbols for things, names and eventually
words in speech. Their views clashed with a widely held theory that
writing grew out of the pieces of clay that Sumerian accountants
had used to keep track of livestock and stores of grain. Scholars
assembled also conceded that they had no definitive answer to the
question of whether writing was invented only once and spread
elsewhere or arose independently several times in several places,
like Egypt, the Indus valley, China and among the Olmecs and Maya
of Mexico and Central America. By John Noble Wilford. (2200 words)

designed the building blocks of a new kind of computer memory that
could fundamentally alter computer design early in the next
century. Chips based on this new technology, known as tunneling

PERSONAL HEALTH: COPING WITH COLD, HARD FACTS ON TEEN-AGE
DRINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest statistics on teen-age drinking are startling:
</P>
<P>
   _A 1997 national study of teen-age students revealed that 54
percent of eighth graders, 72 percent of 10th graders and 82
percent of 12th graders had consumed alcohol, and more than a third
of 12th graders had been drunk at least once.
</P>
<P>
   _More than one-third of high school seniors see no great risk in
consuming four to five drinks a day. Yet 16 percent of teen-agers
have had ``blackouts'' where heavy drinking erased their memories
of what happened the previous evening. And alcohol is the single
biggest factor behind the leading cause of death among teen-agers _
traffic fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   _Teen-agers who start drinking before age 15 are four times as
likely to become alcohol dependent as those who begin drinking at
age 21, the legal drinking age.
</P>
<P>
   _An American Academy of Pediatrics survey found that teen-agers
who drink one day a month typically consume nearly three drinks at
a time, and those who drink six or more days a month average more
than five drinks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _A Harvard study of college drinking showed that more than
two-fifths of students indulge in binge drinking, defined as
consuming five drinks at one setting by men or four drinks by
women. Of college students who drink, one-third drink to get drunk.
</P>
<P>
   _According to the Federal Office of Substance Abuse Prevention,
college students spend more money on alcohol than on soft drinks,
coffee, tea, milk, juice and books combined.
</P>
<P>
   _The highest rate of binge drinking _ greater than 80 percent _
occurs among college students who live in fraternity and sorority
houses, and the second highest rate is found among athletes who
participate in intercollegiate sports.
</P>
<P>
   _Alcohol is involved in 95 percent of violent and property
crimes on campuses, including date rape, and 40 percent of
students' academic problems are alcohol-related.
</P>
<P>
   As with most health problems, the best way to deal with them is
to prevent them from occurring in the first place. Alcohol abuse by
teen-agers, college students or anyone else is a preventable
disorder. Colleges around the country have undertaken a concerted
effort to curb excessive drinking by students, both on and off
campus. But long before youngsters reach college age, parents play
the largest role in fostering a healthy respect for alcohol in
their children. What Parents Can Do
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, parents must set a good example by using
alcohol only in moderation, preferably with meals, and never
suggesting it as a solution to stress or other emotional problems.
Although parents tend to think that peer pressure is the primary
influence on drinking by teen-agers, youngsters say otherwise.
According to a survey released last year by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, the leading reasons given by high school seniors for
drinking are to have a good time with friends, to see what it's
like, to feel good, to relax or relieve tension, to relieve
boredom, to get away from problems and to cope with anger or
frustration. Only 8 percent gave ``to fit in with a group I like''
as their reason for drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should emphasize that getting drunk is always to be
avoided,'' said Dr. Henry Wechsler, director of College Alcohol
Studies at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``Most parents
aren't teaching their kids anything about alcohol, especially not
that alcohol in large quantities has many dangerous effects. Too
many kids think that as long as they don't drive, it's OK to get
drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents should always pay attention to their
children's behavior, including the friends they hang out with, be
consistent about discipline and be clear but realistic about their
expectations for academic achievement. Students about to go off to
college should be cautioned about checking out the drinking
practices in various sororities and fraternities before they
consider joining one.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler said parents also could help by monitoring the
activities of their state and municipal alcohol control boards with
regard to enforcement of the minimum drinking age, sales of alcohol
around college campuses and bars that offer students ``specials'' _
high volumes of alcohol (usually beer) for a low price _ which he
said encouraged binge drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Marchell, director of substance abuse services at
Cornell University, suggested that parents discuss social life at
college with their college-bound children and review all the things
there are to do there besides partying and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   What Colleges Can Do
</P>
<P>
   Under a grant from the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, Cornell and the University of North Carolina are testing
an education program aimed at changing attitudes about alcohol and
campus drinking practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Talbot, community health educator at Cornell University,
said a university survey revealed that the drinking norm was much
lower than most students believed. The survey showed that 62
percent of Cornell students consumed zero to three drinks when they
partied, not five or six, as many students believed.
</P>
<P>
   The program also emphasizes the secondary effects of excessive
drinking on other students, including unwanted sexual advances to
women, destructive behavior, routines that disrupt sleep and
studying and vomiting in the street or communal bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reshape the environment in which students make
choices,'' Marchell said. ``We're trying to increase student
awareness of and intolerance for the second-hand effects of other
people's drinking by drawing attention to the problems excessive
drinking inflicts on the entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   Because members of fraternities and sororities drink two to
three times as much as other students on the same campus, Cornell
has instituted such regulations as having all parties in Greek
houses catered and regulated to prevent excessive drinking and
insisting that all new fraternity and sorority members attend an
alcohol education workshop. And because athletes are the second
largest group of excessive drinkers, Cornell is also working with
athletic coaches to foster a change in student drinking behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell has also increased the availability of alcohol-free
social activities during the hours that students typically engage
in drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to show students they can have a good time without
indulging in alcohol. The activities, under the rubric of ``Up All
Night,'' are scheduled between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. and include
movies, food and various forms of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, colleges have to work with local businesses to get bars
accessible to students to refrain from offering alcohol specials
that encourage excessive drinking.

A TRIBUTE TO THE OLD WAVE OF SAILING

A UNIT OF WATER,  A UNIT OF TIME 
Joel White's Last Boat 
By Douglas Whynott 
Doubleday; 303 pp.; $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone sailing on Maine's Penobscot Bay on certain days last
summer would have had the good fortune to be transported with
nostalgia back to the time when speed on the water also represented
beauty in the wind. For to be seen sailing there _ out of a
long-ago past, it seemed _ was a majestic and graceful creature.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was Wild Horses, the first of a new class of racing
yachts, the W-76s, designed by Joel White and inspired by the the
classic lines of the New York 50 sloops that had been designed by
Nathanael Herreshoff and built in the early 1900s _ like them, with
hulls of wood, not fiberglass. Older old-timers will remember
Pleione, an NY-50 rerigged as a staysail schooner and still winning
races off Marblehead in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Unit of Water, a Unit of Time'' purports to be, as the
subtitle puts it, the story of ``Joel White's Last Boat.'' Wild
Horses was the last boat that White designed and oversaw
construction of at his boatyard in Brooklin, Maine, but he never
lived to see it sail. He died of cancer at 67, six months before it
was launched in spring 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By far the major portion of ``A Unit of Water, a Measure of
Time'' is taken up with an evocation of classic wooden sailing
boats and with Douglas Whynott's warm and admiring portraits of the
men (mostly) who build them today.
</P>
<P>
   Little is actually said about the W-76 _ a commission for
Massachusetts developer Donald Tofias _ until close to the end of
the book. But that is as it should be, for what becomes clear is
that the ``last boat,'' whether Joel White's or Herreshoff's, is
not important in itself, but as part of a living heritage of the
people who build them. Readers might be alerted to that by the lack
of illustrations, other than a jacket photo of Wild Horses under
sail (in Eggemoggin Reach) and the construction plan for the hull
on endpapers.
</P>
<P>
   This lack might seem to be like publishing a book about art with
no pictures of paintings, but it establishes that the wonderfully
realized subject of this book is a culture. It's a culture made up
of men such as Sonny Williams, a carpenter who ``liked planking
most, attaching the spiled planks and then getting on the inside of
the hull to see if light came through.'' But in true Maine fashion,
he also took time off in August to rake blueberries, and he loved
clamming: ``when the tide was right he'd clam on a low tide before
coming in to work and then on the second tide after work.''
</P>
<P>
   In that culture, too, are the people who have been sailing all
their lives _ sometimes (and most admired by Whynott) the same
boat. Among them is Dave Bradley, a man in his 80s who has been
sailing Mischief, a Herreshoff-designed S-Boat, since 1932. Bradley
comes one winter day to the Brooklin yard where Mischief is stored.
Whynott writes: ``It seems to me, as I sit in the cabin and listen
to Bradley (talking about the boat and its fixtures), that this is
the most intimate connection between a person and a boat.
Everything on it means something to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel White was the son of the writer E. B. White and ``A Unit''
is as much about the elder White's relationship to his son, and his
own love of sailing, as it is about Joel White. ``With me,'' E. B.
White once wrote, ``I cannot not sail.'' As Whynott defines that
compulsion, ``he's written a note to the boatyard to put the boat
up for sale, but doubts he means it. He knows that when the breeze
comes, the sloop will be there, and he'll get underway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' was Joel White's favorite of his father's
three children's books. ``One can imagine the delight of the little
boy who was crazy about boats,'' writes Whynott, ``listening to his
father tell the story of two-inch Stuart wearing a sailor's suit''
who skippers a model sailboat in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The title is a slightly contrived attempt to merge E. B. White's
notion that ``contemplation is work,'' and his boatbuilder son's
knowledge that the amount of water displaced by a boat is ``equal
to the time and money spent displacing it.'' To many readers _
those who happily accept the designation as people who ``mess
around in boats'' _ the title will more aptly suggest the time warp
known to patient spouses and indulgent parents as ``boatyard
time,'' wherein the boat owner disappears to check on some
seemingly minor matter and returns many, many hours later, unable
to account for the missing hours.
</P>
<P>
   The clock is just about to go on ``boatyard time,'' so there are
more practical matters _ painting the bottom, installing some piece
of not-entirely-needed new gear _ to be concerned about than a book
about them. But that boat owner would be well advised to tuck a
copy of ``A Unit'' into the ditty bag before heading down to the
yard. It will serve as a reminder of why he or she is going there _
and justify whatever measure of time is spent.

 &HT;    LETTER FROM PODGORICA: A SMALL COUNTRY STEWS AS IT WAITS FOR A
COUP
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia By almost any definition this
tiny Balkan republic should be a trivia question, meaningless to
much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are a buff of alpine mountains, rugged Adriatic
coastline or Slavic history, you should never have heard of
Montenegro. It is sparsely populated, has a meager economy, no
major industries and a small army.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is a vague spot on the map, but a potentially
dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of place that now has combat-ready troops
standing watch in front of the president's office and frequent
police roadblocks throughout the capital to inspect who is coming
and going.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing belief in Podgorica, and among Western
intelligence agencies, is that a coup or civil war could be the
by-product of the NATO-Serb conflict next door. ``If we start to
kill each other here, it will make Bosnia look like a playground,''
a senior government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tension is palpable. After a unpleasant brush Sunday night
with some pro-Serb men in the street, I and another American
reporter had reason to believe we were in danger. An unreassuring
Yugoslav soldier told our translator: ``No one will kill them in
Montenegro _ not for now at least.''
</P>
<P>
   First, a bit of background, and more about that incident later.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is a multi-ethnic nation that sits next to Serbia and
serves as its junior partner in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
It has 680,000 people, not enough to classify it as a major city in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Self-governing Montenegro has been a troublesome little brother
to Serbia and the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
It has become cozier with the United States and Western Europe and
aspired to make itself more democratic and less a part of
post-Communist Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Serb troops rampaging throughout Kosovo and NATO
warplanes hitting Yugoslavia, the overwhelming concern among
Montenegrans is that Milosevic will work his destructive talents on
them.
</P>
<P>
   The concern centers on federal troops ostensibly loyal to
Milosevic and stationed in Montenegro. They number between 12,000
and 30,000, depending on whose estimate you believe, and last week
they got a new commanding general handpicked by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that Milosevic wanted to dispatch more troops prompted
U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia on Saturday to blow up the
railroad tracks that run between Podgorica and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The federal troops in Podgorica have become increasingly
prevalent and provocative in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials privately report that there have been
almost daily instances of gun-pointing and hard words between the
army troops and police forces loyal to Milo Djukanovic, the
reform-minded president of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   At the information ministry here, there exists a sheet listing
the names of various news organizations. It is not a sign-up sheet
for interviews. It is a tally of correspondents looking to retrieve
cars and equipment that have been confiscated by Milosevic's
federal troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, anti-American sentiment is soaring. The first few
nights of the NATO bombing, military targets within Montenegro were
hit, including the airport near the capital. It has agitated
pro-Serb sentiment here, making it all the more difficult for the
Western-leaning government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is Hitler,'' a sales clerk hissed at me in a store
last week. I offered a handshake to a man in a cafe on Sunday
morning; he refused and threatened to hit me.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post correspondent with whom I'm traveling could
not make a international call from the apartment we have rented
here. As on previous nights, he took his portable satellite
telephone to the parking lot to get a clear signal.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers in the neighborhood have been fascinated by the
technology and eager to practice their rough English on us between
the calls we make on the small, battery-powered telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night, two angry men joined the crowd. They were
convinced we were spies with sophisticated targeting equipment to
help NATO jets hit their targets. They spoke fiercely, motioning
their index fingers across their necks. One of the men took the
cord of the telephone and began making a noose to place around my
colleague's neck.
</P>
<P>
   We retreated to the apartment, only to be informed by one of the
teenagers whispering through a window that the men were back with
20 army troops outside our building.
</P>
<P>
   The incident underscores the problem here amid NATO's airwar and
Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo: Montenegro does not
know who to trust. People here seem angry at everyone, but most of
all at their own inability to manage their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montenegro above all needs peace and time,'' said Srdan
Darmanovic, head of Montenegro's Center for Democracy and Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro: the little country that just wants to be left alone.

WOMEN RISE TO THE TOP OF TV NETWORKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Runs with sidebar slugged - GUY-SHOWS) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's true, though a generalization, that men and
women watch different television programs. There are plenty of
women who enjoy ice hockey and professional wrestling and a goodly
number of men who follow the soaps and watch ``Touched by an
Angel'' religiously. But they are not typical.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a fact that, until very recently, there have been
almost no women in top executive positions at the television
networks. Now, there are suddenly four top broadcast executives who
are female, as well as a number of high-ranking women in cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? After all, television has long been considered more
of a ``women's'' medium than, say, motion pictures. The television
audience is about 51 percent women, so the executive ranks have a
long way to go toward reflecting who their ultimate customers are.
</P>
<P>
   The next question is ... will they do things differently than
men? Will their presence affect what we see on television?
</P>
<P>
   It can be a touchy subject among these newly powerful women.
``My parents and the people surrounding me never suggested to me
what I could do in terms of being a woman. Being a good executive
or a bad executive has nothing to do with sexuality,'' insisted
Jamie Tarses, president of ABC Entertainment, when asked recently
about the gender issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tarses is the longest-tenured female network entertainment
president; she works for Pat Fili-Krushel, president of the ABC
Television Network, who is television's highest-ranking woman.
Along with Susanne Daniels, executive vice president of programming
for the WB Network, Nancy Tellem, president of CBS Entertainment
and Kathy Quattrone, programming chief at PBS, they make up a
handful of women who now occupy the top ranks at broadcast
television providers.
</P>
<P>
   Tarses has endured (and sometimes invited) close scrutiny in the
press, often focusing on her being female. She was rumored for
months to be on the verge of losing her job at the network. So she
admits gender is a hot-button issue for her: ``I get a little bit
of an edge when I talk about this,'' Tarses concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Others tend to agree with Tarses' soft-pedaling of the issue.
``I think (there being several top female network executives) is
just reflective of what's happening in the workforce today,'' said
CBS' Tellem. ``Whether it's entertainment or any other industry in
America, more and more women are working. It's a natural
progression.''
</P>
<P>
   The insistence of women like Tarses and Tellem that their gender
is already a ``nonissue'' is typical, says Joe Saltzman, an Emmy
Award-winning documentarian and associate director of the USC
School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What usually happens with anyone who's been deprived of
executive status is, the early group who make it tend to want to
fit in. They tend to emulate the white, male model,'' says
Saltzman. ``But as more and more women and people of color get to
positions of power, they will start to make decisions that men
wouldn't make, or wouldn't even think of making,'' Saltzman says,
adding, ``I think we're already into the cycle now where we're
starting to see decisions being made that have a different point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Would a male network president have developed the popular
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' in the same way that the WB's Daniels
did? When she was growing up in Westport, Conn., her favorite
``Batman'' episodes were the ones featuring the strong female
action hero Batgirl.
</P>
<P>
   It's perhaps no coincidence that, less than 30 years later,
Daniels helped develop ``Buffy,'' the network's first hit. The show
stars a strong female action hero. ``How cool is that?'' remarks
Daniels, who shepherded the quirky show to success.
</P>
<P>
   Other women concede they have an advantage in understanding what
appeals to female viewers. ``I think it's similar to coaching a
basketball team,'' says Carole Black, the newly appointed CEO of
cable's female-targeted Lifetime Network, of being a woman and
programming for women. ``I don't think you ever have to have played
basketball. But it's helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   At her most recent job as president and general manager of Los
Angeles' NBC affiliate, Black found that stories on such topics as
education and health brought a much-needed infusion of female
viewers to the channel. Her experience in boosting the local NBC
station to the area's top-watched news channel, along with her
background as a top marketing executive for Disney's television
production arm, attracted the attention of Lifetime's hiring
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Women began climbing the television corporate ranks about 20
years ago. Many women, like Black, got their breaks in areas that
were considered more ``female'': TV movies and children's
programming. As those areas within the networks have gained
importance, so naturally have the women who came up through them.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television has provided great opportunities for women for
years before the networks opened up to them. USA Networks and
Nickelodeon were until recently headed by women. The Cartoon
Network has been headed by Betty Cohen since its launch in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, cable was considered not really `ready for
prime time,' '' admits Cohen, ``but in a way, I think that made it
easier for companies to `risk' hiring women. Women have been able
to show their abilities in the cable industry and help grow it into
one of the greatest industries in telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen points out that the skills many women honed at the cable
channels have become highly valued by the major networks.
``Presentation, promotion and branding are the things the cable
networks have used to differentiate themselves. Now, the major
networks are looking more than ever to those things as well,''
Cohen says.
</P>
<P>
   But even as women are showing up at the top of the television
heap, they continue to be underrepresented both behind the camera
and on camera, according to recent reports by Hollywood guilds. The
West Coast branch of the Writers Guild of America reported in
October that men outnumbered women 3-to-1 in television writing
jobs, showing virtually no improvement in the '90s. It also showed
men were paid, on average, 5 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released by the Screen Actors Guild in
December, women _ as well as minorities including Latinos and
Asians _ are still underrepresented in front of the TV camera. The
study found that there are still fewer roles for women than for men
on television and that female characters generally ``age faster
than men, and as they age they become more evil.''
</P>
<P>
   While TV has clearly come a long way in depicting women, some
complain that the sexy-goofy female leads on such shows as ``The
Nanny'' and ``Ally McBeal'' are actually a step backward for women.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-targeted shows could prove to be a big area of opportunity
for young actresses, though. With more channels than ever vying for
``niche'' audiences such as teens, there's been an explosion in
shows such as ``Felicity'' and ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' that
showcase young women. To the extent that these shows create stars
out of young actresses _ for example, ``Felicity's'' Keri Russell _
they may help foster a new generation of actresses who have the
power to demand better roles for women.
</P>
<P>
   For now, their primary appeal is obvious: They're young. For the
coming TV season, barely known teen actors reportedly are getting
record salaries of up to $20,000 per episode. Executives both male
and female say that, if anything, age is the predominant connection
between programmers and their audiences. Television, they note, is
demographics-driven: Age-segmented data is used to help target
programming, with a frequent emphasis on youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually don't think it has to do with being a male or a
female,'' says Tony Jonas, who as president of Warner Bros.
Television deals with all six networks. ``It has to do more with
age group _ if you are younger or older _ and whether you have a
family or don't have a family. It has more to do with personal
experience than gender.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB, which aims at the 18-to-34 market, is programmed by a
33-year-old. ABC, which targets viewers between the ages of 18 and
49, is headed by someone who's 34. CBS goes after those 25 to 54,
so they promoted a 45-year-old to program its lineup. The
decision-maker at PBS, which doesn't have to cater to advertisers
the way the commercial networks do, is 47.
</P>
<P>
   PBS chief programming executive Quattrone's take on women at the
top reflects her network's educational mission. ``I like to do for
young women what women did for me,'' said Quattrone, who began her
public television career in 1976 and joined PBS in 1987. ``I will
always talk to them and give them a sense of what their options
are. There are so many role models for men to give them a sense of
what their options are.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women admit they're thrilled to see others following in
their footsteps. ``There are great women coming up through the
ranks. (Cable networks) are going to have enough women to supply
both cable and the networks for years to come,'' says the Cartoon
Network's Betty Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   But the WB's Daniels isn't satisfied just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you in on a secret,'' Daniels joked. ``We're not
gonna rest until we are running all six networks.''

TELEVISION NEEDS A FEW GOOD MEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES It's only natural that the networks should hire more
females, since women watch more TV than men. According to the most
recent data from Nielsen Media Research, women over the age of 18
watch television an average of four hours and 44 minutes per day,
while men watch four hours and 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So if anything, the nets should worry about attracting more men.
The tried-and-true ways of attracting the elusive male viewer are
faltering. After paying a record $17.6 billion last year for the
rights to televise NFL football games, the four TV networks who
chipped in watched ratings erode this season. Monday Night Football
has even been losing male viewers to ``Ally McBeal''! Now that they
have dozens (or even hundreds) of channels to choose from, men have
become inveterate channel-flippers, defying attempts to keep them
tuned in to one program.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing as how some are predicting a female takeover of media, we
humbly suggest that the networks hire more men in the spirit of
affirmative action. We also submit the following ideas for new
series that might help attract male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Extreme Stooges Wrestling'': All the bone-crushing
excitement of professional wrestling, coupled with the timeless
brand-name appeal of the Three Stooges. Eye gouging and
mallet-to-the-head blows are just the beginning of the
no-holds-barred fun!
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Victoria's Secret Ironwoman Cup'':!off! A weekly contest
featuring Victoria's Secret models taking part in a mini-triathlon,
wearing only barely there lingerie from the catalog. A special
twist: The ladies are handicapped according to the size of their
implants, so those with the largest ones get a head start in the
race. Winner receives an iron-clad replica of a VS bra.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``ATF: Too Hot for TV'': The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms gets in on the ``Cops'' craze with its own reality show.
See agents arrest people, seize illegal smokes and guns, and blow
things up. Whoa!
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Virtual Rat Pack'': Cross-generational appeal, courtesy of
new ``virtual reality'' technology. Now YOU can be a member of the
Rat Pack. It's booze and broads galore as you cavort with Frank,
Dean, Sammy and friends. A welcome refuge from a 1990s culture that
scorns such vices, ``VRP'' is your own private Vegas.

 (PICK UP AFTER: other state agencies, Macy said.) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kight said she doesn't believe a jury in Oklahoma could judge
Nichols or McVeigh fairly. Macy says he is convinced otherwise,
though he will not fight a motion to move the trial out of Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been four years. And you take the city of Tulsa, for
instance,'' Macy said. ``I don't think there's anyone from Tulsa
killed in the bombing. Right now, if you were to interview people
from nearly anywhere else in the state as to what they know about
Terry Nichols, their knowledge of the case is very limited. They
don't know what evidence was presented against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy agrees the case will be stressful and difficult to
prosecute. Nichols was not in Oklahoma the day of the bombing, but
federal prosecutors said he was clearly responsible _ plotting the
attack, stealing and buying items to build the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest pieces of evidence against Nichols was a
receipt for a ton of ammonium nitrate fertilizer (an ingredient in
the killer bomb), which was found in his kitchen drawer with
McVeigh's fingerprint on it.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors in the federal trial said that their first vote had
been 10-2 for acquittal, fueling 41 hours of argument before they
agreed on a verdict. And when they could not agree on punishment,
that handed the decision to the judge who was barred by law from
assessing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm doing the right thing,'' Macy said. ``That's
the main thing I'm concerned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Heath, a psychologist and bombing survivor, said he's
already counseling survivors and family members to get them over
the emotional hump of the upcoming state trial. The support group
that he leads is planning a meeting next week to talk about the
trial process, as well as guilt, forgiveness and punishment _
including capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial process is a worry because you've invested so much
of your life working for the federal government, then so much of
your life since reconfirming that you'd made the right decision to
work for them,'' Heath said. ``You take a deep breath and say, `I
will not be defeated by this next trial.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think I want to go through that again,''
Williams said. The assistant building supervisor at the time of the
bombing, he testified at both federal trials that anyone surveying
the outside of the building would have been aware of the
second-floor day-care facility because the children's artwork was
pasted to the glass and the children, themselves, were frequently
visible.
</P>
<P>
   He fears he would be subpoenaed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know those were important but difficult times,''
Williams said. ``I was a basket case _ this big old tough guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, we've come so far,'' he added. ``We've done so many
things. I've seen improvement in family members and survivors since
the last trial. I've seen them turn loose of that and do what they
needed for their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the trial is a year from now, how rough is it going to be
as the anticipation builds during that time, he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those emotions are still out there.''

 &HT;    HIGH COST: MANY FEAR ANOTHER TRIAL FOR NICHOLS WILL ONLY REOPEN
EMOTIONAL WOUNDS
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By KIM COBB 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Richard Williams stood a few yards away from the
blasted footprint of the old Murrah Building, watching bulldozers
shape the scorched earth into a memorial to the people who died
here.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   But when the first stage of the memorial opens next spring, the
state of Oklahoma will likely be taking bombing conspirator Terry
Nichols to court again. Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy
last week filed 160 first-degree murder charges and three other
related charges against Nichols, who is already serving a federal
life sentence after his conviction in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In this city, where nearly everyone has some sort of connection
to a victim or survivor of the April 19, 1995, bombing, people are
divided over the wisdom of retrying Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a General Services Administration supervisor who
narrowly survived the blast and testified against Nichols and
bomber Timothy McVeigh, thinks another trial is just going to tear
open emotional wounds that were finally beginning to heal for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Kight, who lost her 23-year-old daughter in the blast, is
thinking about moving away from Oklahoma City to escape the pain
that one more trial will only make more sharp for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speak for myself,'' Kight said. ``I've been through
enough mental anguish. Life in prison (for Nichols) is enough. The
toll it will take on people ... My question is, will it really be
worth the cost?''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hall, a Murrah Building credit union worker who spent
weeks in a coma after the blast, said she felt that way, too, at
first. But she visited the graves of nine co-workers last Memorial
Day, and it changed her perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a peaceful thing we did, but it was more disturbing to
me later on,'' Hall said. She began to agree with people who felt
cheated that the federal charges against Nichols and McVeigh had
named only the eight federal law enforcement officers killed in the
blast _ not the other 160 people who died in and around the
building that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for me, let's just go ahead and have the trial,'' Hall
said. ``This will be for all the survivors and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then that door is closed. It doesn't mean closure, because you
don't get over this. But you've got to get on with your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy has been roundly criticized for the cost and the redundancy
of retrial. But he said he did not foresee the emotional toll that
retrial would take on his community, because he made the decision
to prosecute those responsible for the crime when the bomb went off
April 19, 1995. His resolve was strengthened when the federal jury
convicted Nichols only of conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter
and did not assess the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma City newspaper conducted an informal poll of its
readers shortly after the Denver jury handed down its verdict. Even
though he had not been formally sentenced, it was clear Nichols
would not be executed _ and only 20 percent of those who
participated in the poll favored bringing either Nichols or McVeigh
back to their home state for retrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I don't have any choice,'' Macy said. ``It's my
duty to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has not decided whether he will pursue state charges
against McVeigh if he has not been executed by the time Nichols'
trial is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Macy said Oklahoma County has already filed the paperwork to
transfer Nichols back to Oklahoma City to await trial, and expects
the transfer will be made within a couple of months. The state
Legislature has earmarked $800,000 for the trial, and the cost of
additional security for Nichols will be shouldered by other state
agencies, Macy said.

SUPPLEMENT OFFERS A HEALTHY BOOST LIKE NOTHING ELSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joints a little achy these days? Feeling
depressed? Maybe your liver could use a little extra help defending
itself against a daily onslaught of toxins?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy'' may be your new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy is the nickname of SAM-e _ short for S-adenosylmethionine,
a compound produced by all plants and animals that is crucial to
dozens of metabolic processes, including joint tissue repair, liver
protection and the brain functions that control mood.
</P>
<P>
   SAM-e supplements have been popular in Europe for two decades,
but the compound just last month found its way onto the shelves of
American supermarkets and drugstores. Chemical giant BASF Corp.
released it on the growing U.S. dietary supplement market earlier
this month, the first so-called ``nutraceutical'' from the company
best-known for producing magnetic tapes. It will be marketed under
individual labels such as GNC and Nature Made.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say SAM-e is no snake oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of doctors come up to me and say no one thing can do so
much, but it can, and it's very well documented,'' said Dr. Richard
Brown, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia
University in New York City. ``The nicest thing about SAM-e is it
works as well as standard prescription medications, but it has less
side effects and it works faster, so people feel better sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Animals produce SAM-e from the essential amino acid methionine
energy-yielding compound adenosine triphosphate. As it breaks down,
the compound is involved in the synthesis, activation and
metabolism of biological compounds such as neurotransmitters,
proteins, cell membranes, detoxification, and even nucleic acids in
DNA. SAM-e is required in more than 35 biochemical reactions in the
body, and researchers continue to find new interactions.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, SAM-e helps a variety of cells work better.
</P>
<P>
   But as we age, researchers found, SAM-e levels in our blood
decrease, which can lead to depression, joint aches and a decline
in the liver's ability to defend itself against toxins such as
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Since its discovery in 1952, European doctors have studied SAM-e
and found it can improve the mood of depressed patients by
improving brain cell function and boosting production of mood
enhancers seratonin and dopamine. SAM-e also gives the liver a
boost in its defenses because it is the main source of glutathione,
the liver's cleaning agent. Other studies found that SAM-e helps
preserve and repair cartilage, shock absorbers in joints that keep
bones from grinding against each other and causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   Because SAM-e is natural, there are few side effects. Some users
complained of nausea or mild gastrointestinal disturbances, but
Brown said people taking placebos in studies often complained more
than those who took SAM-e.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact it has very few, if any, side effects makes it
attractive to many people because there is really no harm in taking
it,'' said Dr. Teodoro Bottiglieri, director of neuropharmacology
at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. ``It can be taken as
a general enchancer of health.''
</P>
<P>
   The body gets its supply of SAM-e from methionine, which is
found mostly in protein-rich foods. A deficiency of methionine,
vitamin B12 and folacin can affect the body's ability to produce
SAM-e.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bottiglieri said, ``You can't get SAM-e just by eating
certain foods.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also one big catch: the price. A 10-day supply of 20
pills will cost about $25. And although SAM-e works within a couple
ofweeks, Brown said that when it is used to treat depression, it's
best to take it for six to nine months or risk a relapse.
</P>
<P>
   SAM-e isn't for everyone. People suffering from bipolar disorder
_ also known as manic depression _ should consult their doctor
before taking SAM-e because it may push them toward the dangerous
manic side of the illness, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He advised taking SAM-e supplements only for specific problems,
such as mild depression or joint pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can take a gazillion supplements a day if they want to,
but it really works best if you take something targeted to a
problem you have,'' he said. ``People should not take supplements
without a clear reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Another risk: Consumers will see SAM-e as some kind of magic
bullet that can reverse the biological clock or protect the liver
from abuse. Doctors stress that a balanced diet and regular
exercise are still the ultimate key to peak physical and mental
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not to do anything in excess,'' said Jay Rho, an
associate professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes overdosing on SAM-e.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything in moderation is probably OK. When you get into large
dosages, that's where you get into trouble,'' Rho said. ``Sometimes
people think if a little bit helps, a lot helps faster, and that's
just not true. Even with prescription anti-depressants, the cure
takes quite a bit of time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of IBM researchers said last week that they had
successfully designed the building blocks of a new kind of computer
memory that could fundamentally alter computer design early in the
next century. Chips based on this new technology, known as
tunneling magnetic junction random access memory, or tmj-ram for
short, would be ultrafast, consume very little power and retain
stored data when a computer was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   As such they would combine the best features of computer disks,
which can store prodigious amounts of information, and conventional
memory chips, which are fast but limited in their capacities.
</P>
<P>
   An IBM researcher revealed at a meeting of the American Physical
Society in Atlanta last month that a small research team working at
the company's Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose, Calif., had
succeeded in building microscopic magnetic memory cells that can
switch on and off as quickly as the fastest microprocessor chips,
consume power only when reading and writing, and are almost as
small as the tiny capacitors that store data in the most advanced
conventional memory chips. In contrast, today's memory chips must
be continually electrically refreshed while operating, because the
electrical charge continuously leaks from the millions of storage
capacitors that make up the chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the holy grail of computer memory,'' said Randy Isaac,
a vice president at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. ``This
is the result of a global quest that has gone on for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the advance is a crucial step toward a new class of
electronic materials and a new kind of microelectronics, which has
been named ``spintronics'' because it is based on the ability to
detect and control the spins of electrons in ferromagnetic
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Spin is an aspect of quantum mechanics, the rules that govern
subatomic physics, that is still untapped commercially. According
to quantum mechanics, the electrons in a normal electric current
are spinning in a random mix of quantum states known as up and
down. By ordering this mayhem in a process analogous to the
polarization of light _ in effect, aligning the quantum spins to be
either all up or all down _ scientists can create the ``off'' and
``on'' states central to computer calculations and give the digital
revolution a remarkable new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Spintronics is already a billion-dollar industry because of
another IBM innovation based on a phenomenon known as ``giant
magnetoresistance,'' which is being used to read hard disks. In the
so-called gmr effect, tiny magnetic fields are used to control the
electrical resistance of a sandwich of alternating layers of
magnetic and nonmagnetic metals.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, progress at research laboratories in the United
States, Europe and Japan has touched off an international race
among scientists who believe that spintronics may offer dramatic
gains in memory and processing power in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a number of companies including IBM,
Honeywell, Hewlett Packard and Motorola are working on spintronics,
according to Stuart Wolf, who is in charge of funding Pentagon
research in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two or three years there will be results in this field that
will make people sit up and take notice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new tmj-ram devices combine the phenomenon of spin with
another heretofore elusive quantum feature known as tunneling, in
which current can pass from one metal layer to another, switching
its spin from up to down, like a ghost melting through a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to improve these materials beyond my wildest
dreams,'' said Stuart Parkin, the IBM physicist who has been
leading the Almaden research group. ``These are wonderful devices
because in principle you can scale them through many many
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Such memories might have a broad impact on the design of
computers, he said, because they could be applied at both the very
high and low ends of the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because today's memory chips are much slower than microprocessor
chips, computer design is based on a hierarchy of memory. A
conventional computer will have a number of different types of
memory, which descend in speed and increase in capacity. This
hierarchy ranges from the so-called ultrafast cache, which is built
directly into the microprocessor and stores data and parts of the
program used most frequently, to the magnetic computer disk, which
is the slowest part of the system but holds the most data.
</P>
<P>
   Computers based on the new type of quantum-effect memory would
not only start instantly because program information and data could
be permanently stored, but would also be faster because the tmj-ram
memory would keep pace with the fastest microprocessor chips.
</P>
<P>
   Memories based on quantum-tunneling effects were first predicted
theoretically by John Slonczewski, an IBM physicist at the Watson
Research Center, in 1975. But it was not until three years ago,
when research groups at MIT and in Japan simultaneously were able
to demonstrate the magnetic tunneling effect, that Parkin's group
returned to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Parkin attributed much of his group's progress to the
development of a rapid prototyping machine that allows researchers
to quickly test new compounds for the memory cells.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the research is remarkably small. For example, the
aluminum dioxide insulating layer in the tiny sandwich of
iron-cobalt magnets that makes up the experimental memory cell is
only four atoms thick.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were able to lower the electrical resistance of
that layer by ten-million-fold at room temperature. This allowed
current to ``tunnel'' between the layers, altering the direction of
the spin in one of the magnets and creating the equivalent of a
digital 1 or 0.
</P>
<P>
   So far the group has demonstrated reading and writing times of
about 10 nanoseconds, about six times faster than today's dynamic
random access memories.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM researchers said they had chosen to pursue the tmj-ram
because the tunneling approach promises greater memory capacity in
the future.

(EDITORS: THIS WEEK REFERS TO WORKWEEK BEGINNING 4/5/99) &HT;    
 &HT;    U.S. TO OFFER RUSSIA $100 MILLION TO KEEP NEW STATION ON TRACK
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By MARK CARREAU 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The United States will offer Russia another $100 million this
week in an attempt to keep the international space station project
on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the money will purchase a three-man Soyuz crew
capsule from the Russians to serve as an additional temporary
lifeboat during the final stages of station assembly, a range of
ground-based equipment that could be used at the Johnson Space
Center to train spacewalking astronauts and other gear useful to
NASA for the station.
</P>
<P>
   But the real objective, NASA administrator Dan Goldin told
Congress recently, is to keep the more crucial Russian
contributions to the new station from slipping further behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's fiscal realities continue to impede the Russian Space
Agency's ability to deliver its substantial contributions to the
international space station in a timely manner,'' Goldin testified,
referring to the financial crisis in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The key issues that NASA intends to address this week in Moscow:
</P>
<P>
   The launch of the Russian service module, which is to furnish
the living quarters and life support for the new station's first
crew of astronauts and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   Behind schedule 17 months because of flagging Russian finances,
the service module is to lift off Sept. 20. Those within NASA who
track its progress envision setbacks for the module during the
final months of fabrication and ground testing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, they believe it could be launched from Central Asia
before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's fabrication of the Soyuz rockets, Soyuz crew capsules
and Progress cargo ships, a less visible issue though one that is
vital to the first few years of the international station's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new outpost requires a pair of Soyuz capsules annually to
serve as lifeboats while they are docked. Three propellant-laden
Progress capsules are needed annually to fuel the propulsion
systems that will keep the new station at safe altitudes above the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for Progress capsules will grow to six annually after
the turn of the century, though NASA began making plans to take
over responsibility for future propellant requirements in response
to last year's Russian financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Mir space station. NASA wants the still-occupied,
13-year-old outpost safely ditched by September because it competes
with the international station for scarce Russian government
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are in the final weeks of a so-far-unsuccessful bid
to find a private source of funding to keep Mir operating for
several more years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian emotions run high for the preservation of Mir, but the
country's space agency has pledged to the United States that the
aging outpost will not interfere with commitments to the
international station.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance before Congress, Goldin said his agency is
prepared to follow $60 million in payments to Russia last fall with
$100 million in 1999 NASA funding.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that a plan to direct a total of $660 million
to Russia over several years has been shelved. There is no station
funding for the Russians in the proposed NASA 2000 spending plan
now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators must approve any funding agreements reached between
the two space agencies.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached, the latest monies would flow in
installments as part of a purchase contract linked to carefully
monitored milestones with regard to Mir and the service module,
space agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The more than five-year effort to assemble the new station began
last November with the launching of the first component aboard a
Russian Proton rocket from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   American shuttle astronauts successfully joined a second
component in December. They are circling the Earth unstaffed at an
altitude of about 250 miles, their electronic systems watched
closely by ground control teams in Houston and suburban Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. shuttle supply mission to the fledgling outpost is
planned for May. But there is a backlog of U.S. components awaiting
the arrival of Russia's 21-ton service module, whose launching date
slipped from July to September earlier this year, its third slip.
</P>
<P>
   During the portion of the upcoming meeting called the general
designer's review, NASA will be looking for assurances that the $60
million it forwarded to Russia last year helped to assure a service
module launching this year.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for those funds, NASA obtained partial use of the
service module to conduct U.S.-sponsored research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we want to come out of the general designer's review
with an understanding that Mir is coming down in the
August-September time frame,'' said Dan Hedin, chief of staff in
NASA's Washington space station development office. ``We need a lot
higher confidence as to when the service module is going to be
delivered and a clear understanding of their financial
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two agencies prepare to convene, the service module is
nearing a point in its ground testing that it can be transported by
rail from its Moscow factory to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Russia's
launch complex in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   With no new snags, the service module should reach Baikonur
around May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Once it reaches Baikonur, engineers will install the antenna for
a communications system, satellite navigation equipment and a
docking radar. Those components will require about 30 additional
ground tests to complete the module's pre-launch checkout.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, the Russian service module will become a passive
docking target for the station's first modules. Once linked, the
newest module will provide living and working quarters for three.
</P>

   Blood Types
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is your blood type _ A, B, AB or O _ so important? I have
never understood exactly what would happen if you got a transfusion
of an incompatible type.
</P>
<P>
   A. The most basic classification of the hundreds of ways to type
human blood, the ABO system, is important because incompatible
types of blood react with each other to form sticky globs of red
blood cells that can cause serious sometimes fatal blockages.
</P>
<P>
   The classification was developed in 1901 by Karl Lansteiner, a
Viennese pathologist and immunologist. For the first time, it
explained why certain blood transfusions were beneficial while
others caused severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   The red blood cells of people with type A blood has a protein
called the A antigen on its surface; people with type B blood have
the B antigen. In type O, the cells have neither A nor B antigens;
in type AB, there are both antigens.
</P>
<P>
   In one example of incompatibility, type A red blood cells
(erythrocytes) have the A antigen and the liquid part of the blood
(the serum) contains antibodies against the type B cells; type B
blood has the opposite configuration. So if the two types are
mixed, the antibodies from the serum react to the ``foreign'' types
making the cells clumb together.  &QL;

  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Note use of italics throughout; ``last week'' is CQ)  
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ken Goldstein spent 10 years helping first
Broderbund, then its spinoff Red Orb create award-winning games
such as the Carmen San Diego series and Riven.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Broderbund was bought up last summer, Goldstein got a
call from Jake Winebaum, the head honcho of Walt Disney's Internet
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   When Goldstein, who lived outside San Francisco, said he might
consider a new job, Winebaum invited him to dinner in Los Angeles.
That night.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein hurriedly caught a plane and has been busily
transforming Disney Online as its general manager and senior vice
president virtually ever since.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see what Goldstein's been up to the past six
months _ and if you're a parent, gamer or animation buff, you
definitely should _ mosey over to Disney Online at
www.disney.go.com, where they unveiled a major site overhaul last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and most overdue change is a merger of Disney.com
with the separate subscription-based Disney Blast premium site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot more frequency (of use) because, by taking two
worlds and merging them into one world, we've given them a lot
more,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   You can find areas devoted to the Disney Channel and its heavily
trafficked Zoog Disney area, Radio Disney, movies, cartoons,
trivia, archival animation and much more.
</P>
<P>
   To keep customers coming back, Disney Online has added or
expanded wrinkles such as instant messaging, Disney-themed e-mail,
animation archives, online-store discounts, parental controls,
multiplayer games and access to the company's myriad
entertainment-related ventures, such as travel booking.
</P>
<P>
   Though many areas will be accessible to any visitor, the
subscription-based Club Blast will provide access to the
instant-messaging, store discounts and some other premium services
at $5.95 a month or $39.95 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll start everything in the club, then roll it out to the
rest of the areaafter 60 to 90 days,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said a new emphasis will be put on community, just as
is happening with other major sites on the Internet (memo to
Internet buzzword watchers: portal is passe; community is in).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about community, friendship and family play,'' Goldstein
said. ``It's now about how you, your family and friends can
share.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, for instance, that games such as Mickey's Bingo will
not only allow you to play bingo but chat with up to 23 other
players at the same time. The game areas will even include canned
taunts to hurl at other players.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with the larger Go Network's emphasis on parental
controls, the site will allow parents to decide who their children
will be able to communicate with while on the site, whether it's in
game/chat areas, the instant-messaging service or e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole idea is to let children and adults play with
others, safely.
</P>
<P>
   The networked universe ``is forcing us to rethink the experience
of playing computer games,'' Goldstein said. ``This whole notion of
playing games against computers is really artificial. It's like the
difference between going to Disneyland alone and going to
Disneyland with your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Magazine for WebTV types
</P>
<P>
   When new Internet users hop online, they're much more likely to
look for an entertainment site or e-mail a pal than are the Net
vets who preceded them, according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
   Also, more than 1 million people already own some sort of
interactive television box, be it WebTV types or any of several
miscellaneous providers who have married a TV with Internet access
and are much more likely to use it to access TV-related Web sites
while watching their shows.
</P>
<P>
   And when AT&AMP;T and America Online put their marketing muscle
behind their respective versions of interactive TV later this year,
the number of people with those merged TV/Internet boxes will
likely skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Phillip Swann contends, is why it's the perfect time
to come out with a magazine devoted to this particular
technological union. The magazine is TV Online, based in Santa
Monica, and Swann is its editor, publisher and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision is that this is going to be in every home within
five to 10 years,'' Swann said. ``Where this thing will really
start to take off is when cable providers bring it into the home.''
</P>
<P>
   The 64-page glossy magazine aims to be a cross between
Entertainment Weekly and Wired. It debuted modestly in January and
still is available only by subscription through its small Web site
at www.tvonlinemag.com.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a trial-subscription deal given to all buyers of
Sony's WebTV box, the newborn monthly can already claim a hefty
300,000 subscribers, good design and relatively punchy articles
with a bit (though more would be better) of critical edge.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine includes the Web sites and links for the month's
notable TV programs, movies, home videos, DVDs, pay per view, CDs,
sporting events, even books. There are relatively penetrable
technical articles, lots of short reviews of general entertainment
sites and a page of all the links used in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   For the terminally twitchy, major stories come complete with an
estimated reading time and one-line description of the story's
content (so much for old media tricks like headlines and lots of
graphics).
</P>
<P>
   But there's plenty there for the entertainment obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the piece (by former Daily News TV critic Ray
Richmond, a contributing editor to the magazine) on ABC News'
history series ``The Century'' includes a terrific collection of
history Web sites beyond ABC's rich online home for the show, along
with four short reviews of other (BEGIN ITALICS)fin de siecle(END
ITALICS) sites.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of convergence, don't count on finding much
at the magazine's own Web site, at least not soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a billboard,'' Swann said. ``With many people,
the Internet is a whole new thing. They're looking for something
more traditional to help them get online. For us, we think
(focusing on the magazine) works really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pray for NYC
</P>
<P>
   Those peripatetic publishers, the Mad Monks James Crotty and
Michael Lane, are back at it, with a new, offbeat guide to New York
City that is equal parts travelogue and social commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty and Lane have traveled the country in a pink motor home,
publishing Monk magazine from it for most of the decade now, using
a solar-powered Macintosh computer to compose stories about the odd
and offbeat things they've seen on their jaunts.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, they started a Web site at www.monk.com, and even
cut an unlikely deal last year with Playboy.com as an associated
site. And then there are the books, with the latest a delight for
those who prefer to look at Gotham's unvarnished underside.
</P>
<P>
   What's most interesting about ``The Mad Monks Guide to New York
City'' (published by Macmillan Travel), however, is how positively
ambivalent our favorite friars sound about the city. Oh, they still
find plenty to rhapsodize about in the city's quirks and
characters, sites and scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But the relentless efforts of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the NYPD and
the Walt Disney Co. to make New York safe for even the gape-jawed
rubes amongst us seems also to have dulled the city's edge a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the Big Mouse and the Grimacing Hunchback taken a
bite out of the Big Apple's Times Square porn parlors and
street-corner con men, their attitude also seems to have gone and
cleaned up much else in the city, even stuff that was better when
it was dark and grimy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to hear the Monks tell it, Hell's Kitchen is at best
Purgatory's Patio, SoHo is so-so, and the Lower East Side has been
``thoroughly tamed and claimed,'' then festooned with concept bars
designed to ``woo twenty-somethings eager for that antiseptic
downtown thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monksters welcome the Giuliani-related drop in crime and
give him and the boys in blue their proper due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchy had its day,'' they write. ``The city is becoming
something different. Safer, cleaner, more hospitable.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a cost, they also moan, that won't be fully
known for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``... After years of knocking on the door, mainstream America
has finally broken into the city,'' they write. ``Here comes
everybody _ and with their arrival, there goes a lot of what made
New York (BEGIN BOLD OR ITALIC)New York(END BOLD OR ITALIC). Call
us nostalgic, anti-growth or simply out of touch, but we think what
is currently happening to the city is tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by the chain megastores, the Monks went looking for
``the funky, frumpy, eccentric New York of old. Our prognosis, at
the end of our search, is a qualified mix of doom and delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for people who think New York is at least fun to visit,
they've detailed all here. Check it out next time you point that
jet plane East.

NOT ALL MISSING PERSONS CASES GET EQUAL TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three days after the disappearance of three
women visiting the Yosemite National Park, a Santa Clara doctor
vanished in California's ski country.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Julie Sund, 15, and
family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16 has generated international
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But few people have heard about Dr. Katherine Wong, who
disappeared while skiing Feb. 19 about 167 miles north of where the
three sightseers were last seen. After a three-day sweep through
Bear Valley, the Alpine County sheriff's office called off its
search-and-rescue effort for Wong on Feb. 21. Her case is open, but
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   There is no multistate hunt. No hot line. No Web site. No
brochures. No national television coverage. No big headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities insist they are giving her case appropriate
attention. ``We're waiting for the snow to melt,'' said Bob Tucker
of the Alpine County Sheriff's Department. ``We have no idea where
she is. We've checked the area in the ski resort where she was in
very thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong's case is similar to many missing persons cases. In
California along, more than 150,000 people are reported missing
each year. More than 95 percent of those reports are runaways,
children taken by noncustodial parents or adults fleeing personal
or financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   But of the cases suspected to be abductions by strangers, very
few generate enough attention to make the victim a household name.
</P>
<P>
   These little-known cases contain the pain and heartbreak of
loved ones, but the tragedies are not played out in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what catches the imagination and interest of the
news media and then the community,'' said Deborah Brady, a case
manager with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hear about cases like Polly Klaas that are picked up by
the media. But there are similar cases that don't get so much
attention. And the parental abduction cases and the runaways who
are at risk for exploitation are very, very hard to get any media
exposure at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady also notes that if a loved one disappears, you can't count
on news coverage or public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen cases where 15-year-old girls with no history of
running away, no known problems, who disappeared without taking any
belongings, even her contact lens case, and the local newspapers
told parents to take out an ad,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators who specialize in missing persons cases note that
many times children or married adults want to be lost. For better
or worse, they are fleeing unhappy circumstances. And the custodial
parent doesn't always want the child back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parents who have said, `If you find him, I don't
want him,''' said Officer Patrick Mahanay of the police missing
persons unit in Oakland, Calif. ``Sometimes these kids are such a
handful for the parents that if the kid runs away it's not that big
a deal for the parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually the message is expressed more subtly, but to
investigators it's clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people fill out a report, but you can tell they don't
really want to find the person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sund/Pelosso case, Francis and Carole Carrington, Carole
Sund's parents, have spared no effort _ and no expense _ to resolve
the case. They set up a command post in Modesto and have been
joined by hundreds of volunteers who are willing to help them find
their loved ones or cope with their grief.
</P>
<P>
   The Carringtons have shown steadfast willingness to keep the
story in the news.
</P>
<P>
   It's not completely clear if developing a network of supporters
and aggressively courting the news media help to solve a crime or
return a loved one safely. In October 1993, Polly Klaas was killed
several hours after she was kidnapped from her Petaluma home by
Richard Allen Davis. The cases of the Sund family and Christina
Williams, who was abducted last year while walking her dog near her
family's Monterey-area home, much of the public effort came after
the victims were likely dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately in these cases they are almost never found
alive, they are murdered like Polly or Christina,'' said Ann Deasy
Collins, the mother of a missing child. ``I can't think of many
times where an abducted child has come home safely in these
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins knows firsthand that the giant team effort associated
with the search for a missing loved one comes with its own rewards.
Her son Kevin Collins, 10, disappeared while waiting at a bus stop
in San Francisco on Feb. 10, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Kevin remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't find Kevin but the support of the community is a
blessing in disguise,'' Collins said. ``It really helps you get
through this. It takes pressure off the police department.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are now many groups that help parents when their children
are abducted or loved ones disappear mysteriously. There are
toll-free numbers, Web sites and training manuals for volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1984, that infrastructure wasn't available for the
Collins family. They built it themselves. It started with fellow
parishioners at St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church using maps that Ann
Collins' brother obtained from his job at the California Department
of Transportation. Once the story was featured in the news, the
effort grew exponentially. For the next couple of years, brochures
with Kevin's face were on the windows of businesses throughout the
San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Even people with little knowledge of the case saw Kevin's
familiar image on milk cartons. His parents formed the Kevin
Collins Foundation, which helped to channel the energy and efforts
of volunteers in a series of high-profile child abductions in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of parents like those of Kevin Collins also have
changed the way law enforcement looks at these cases. By law, the
police are required to investigate all cases of missing persons.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, authorities will say that all cases are investigated
the same. Privately, many veteran officers concede that in certain
cases authorities do little more than write a report, search a few
databases and send a bulletin as a reference for other police
departments in case a body turns up elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a horde of volunteers comes to us and says, `What can we do
to find this kid?' you can bet our chief is going to see that and
put more resources on the case,'' said a veteran missing persons
investigator who asked not to be identified by name or law
enforcement agency. ``The flip side is that if the family or
community doesn't do that much, then maybe there are other cases we
should be spending our energy on, more promising cases.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If living and viewing in ``Pleasantville'' isn't
quite your DVD style, try the just-released ``General Chaos
Uncensored Animation'' disc from Manga Video.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of great stuff on the disc, some 40 animated
shorts from around the world, but be warned that it's not for the
delicate and sensitive. As the box warns, it has ``plenty of sex,
tons of violence and enough subversive humor for even the most
twisted mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-known contributors are Bill Plympton and the
bolexbrothers' Mike Booth, as well as contributors to shows such as
``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head,'' ``Rocko's Modern Life'' and ``Daria,''
among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nature of the disc, it probably won't be in your local
Blockbuster. Go to www.manga.com for ordering info.

MAKE TRAVEL PLANS NOW, AND YOU'LL SAVE CASH LATER 
 
 &HT;    By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Just as it signals a need for spring cleaning, April's arrival
serves as a reminder to get our travel agendas in order.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wait until the last minute to assess priorities,
formulate budgets and plan and schedule vacations too often find no
cheap seats aboard an airplane, no affordable rooms at a hotel and
an expired passport buried in a dresser drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips that could help avert disappointment:
</P>
<P>
   Can't decide whether to visit Hollywood, Dollywood, the Big Bend
or Big Apple? Schedule a family get-together to discuss potential
destinations. Make an honest assessment of each traveler's
objectives. Don't be shy about expressing candid opinions, and
listen to those of others. Carefully evaluate the pros and cons,
and you may avoid friction later.
</P>
<P>
   Establish a budget. A vacation should be one of the year's most
satisfying experiences; you work hard and deserve a good time away
from home or the office, and it's also an excellent occasion for
family bonding. But your enjoyment will be marred if you spend
every minute fretting about how each expenditure will affect the
bank account once you return.
</P>
<P>
   Make a practical assessment of your finances. If you can afford
to follow your dreams to Paris or Rome or take that
long-anticipated cruise in Alaska, go for it. But if circumstances
dictate that those adventures wait another year, schedule the car
for a tuneup and get ready to explore nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the budgetary fence? Consider ways to make your
vacation money go further.
</P>
<P>
   Order free brochures from tourism bureaus. The literature you
receive just by making a few calls (often toll-free) can help in
finding affordable lodging, dining and attractions. Many brochures
describe hotel packages and multiple-attraction passes, and some
include coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a good time, too, to check any frequent-flier accounts
you may have. Unused mileage in some airline programs expires after
a stipulated period; you may want to redeem mileage for your next
vacation rather than risk losing it. Or if you are 10,000 miles shy
of earning a free trip in Continental's OnePass program but have
earned 11,000 miles in the American Express Membership Miles
program, study the transfer rules and consider taking action. Seek
out other ways _ grocery shopping, telephone services, flowers for
a loved one _ to pad those mileage totals. And remember:
Frequent-traveler award seats are limited and fill up fast,
especially during the summer. Don't tarry before making a
redemption request.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't rely on frequent-flier miles should evaluate air
fare trends to preferred destinations. We've already witnessed two
fare hikes on standard domestic tickets this year. And we had the
usual short-term winter sales. Some analysts believe we'll witness
one more sale before the peak travel season. But if you wait until
June to buy a ticket for air travel in July, chances are good
you'll pay a premium. Booking in advance is usually wise, too, for
hotels, rental cars and cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rule out travel by train or bus. Amtrak and Rail Europe
offer cost-saving passes. So do bus lines.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who remain open-minded about destinations normally
reap the best bargains. An exchange rate of $1 U.S. to $1.50
Canadian makes travel north of the border a good bargain. Because
of the financial crisis in Asia, packages to many parts of that
continent also cost much less than in recent years. Likewise, since
Asian tourism is down in Hawaii, a concerted effort is under way to
attract more visitors from the U.S. mainland, resulting in
discounts. Continued introduction of mammoth new cruise ships is
keeping prices down for seagoers, especially in the Caribbean. A
travel agent can provide details and recommend other bargain
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   International travelers should make sure passports remain valid
and necessary visas are secured. If you need to renew a passport,
act soon; the heaviest processing period is almost upon us.
Applications can be downloaded via the Internet by accessing
travel.state.gov. Call 900-225-5674 for passport information; a
per-minute charge is assessed.
</P>
<P>
   One final thought: Any discussion of vacation plans likely will
include at least some consideration of millennium-related events.
Do we cut back on summer travels so we can usher in 2000 with a
binge? Obviously, this is an individual or family choice. Just be
aware that most travel in late December will come with an inflated
price tag. And since the real turn of the century doesn't occur
until 2000 gives way to 2001, it's a safe wager that another round
of millennium bashes will tempt us a year later.

(HLW) 
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 47, Dr. Michael Balick, who directs research and
training at the New York Botanical Garden, is one of a handful of
scientists who earns a living as an ``ethnobotanist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the things I do is wander through New York City looking
at urban markets asking healers in botanicas, `What do you use this
for?''' Balick, the co-author with Paul Alan Cox of ``Plants,
People and Culture'' (Scientific American Library, 1996), explained
on a recent morning in his office at the gardens in the Bronx. ``I
also advise physicians on the methods of traditional healers. What
can be more interesting, or more fun?''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did ethnobotany become your life's passion?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was one of those kids always taking leaves from the woods
and pressing them between wax papers and ironing them. Forty years
later, I'm being paid to still do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Give us the job description of an ethnobotanist.
</P>
<P>
   A. Someone who studies the relationship between plants and
people. That means the foods that people eat, the spices in their
foods, the medicines they use, and how people manage their
resources, forests, farm lands.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, this profession was traveling to a distant
culture and collecting plants. In the last 20 years, the paradigm's
been changing. What we now do is add the modern tools of science to
this old discipline. Also, we educate. We try to help urban peoples
see how much we all depend on plants. Plants are the bottom line in
life. They support all of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have a favorite ethnobotany movie?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Medicine Man.'' It featured a couple of big ethnobotanist
fantasies in it. The Sean Connery character, the ethnobotanist, had
a high pressure liquid chromatograph, which is a very sophisticated
analytical device and he had it set up in a remote indigenous house
_ with no electricity! That's always been my dream. To have the
latest scientific equipment down in the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What kind of equipment do you actually take to the field?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very simple tools: a machete, a still camera, a video camera,
a backpack, a hat, sun screen, a plant press, some old newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The second fantasy in that movie was when Sean Connery wrote for
a research assistant, Lorraine Bracco peddled up in a boat. The
first words out of her mouth were: ``Dr. So and So, our company has
been sending you money for nine years and we never have even gotten
a report from you once!'' That to me was the greatest! We are
swamped with report-writing.
</P>
<P>
   The general public thinks ethnobotany is a very romantic
activity. But the truth of it is that you're traveling for long
periods of time _ not with your family _ to isolated places. You're
living in miserable conditions most of the time, covered with
insects. You're often sitting around waiting for things to happen
because you can't force them.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is a very difficult profession. I could tell you
stories of people who said they wanted to do this work and then
when they finally got in the field, they wouldn't come out of their
hut.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your best personal story from the field?
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1976, my wife, Daphne, and I canoe up the Ampiyacu River
in Peru, looking to spend time with the Bora Indians. And when we
eventually arrived at a village, 40 or 50 people came out and
circled us. They had not seen many of our kind. We were a great
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   While we were explaining what we wanted to do, suddenly an old
woman came out of the Long House and hugged me. Everyone fell on
the ground laughing. So Daphne asked, ``What is grandmother
saying?'' And the village chief says, ``You don't want to know.''
To which, Daphne says, ``Oh, no. Please tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   So he explains, ``Grandmother said that what a great opportunity
it would have been to have this guy come to our village three years
ago before the missionaries came here, when we were still eating
people because he could have fed us for a month!'' And she
proceeded to describe how you cook the fingers, the hands, the
back. Three or four years previously, before the missionaries came,
they were practicing cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   We lived with them for six weeks and they were just the most
hospitable and giving of people. They showed all these uses of
plants: how they grew things, how they cultivated their tubers, how
they harvested things from the forest, how they made backpacks from
palm leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand you do a lot of fieldwork in a different kind of
forest _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yes. One of the most diverse laboratories that an
ethnobotanist could have is New York City. All these different
cultures can be found here. They all bring their healing plants,
food plants, relaxing plants, beverages with them. I give a class
at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. I do my
shopping for it in Chinatown and Harlem and also Dean &AMP; DeLuca in
SoHo. They have amazing tropical fruits that no one else has.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do your two worlds _ New York and tropical rain forest _
sometimes clash?
</P>
<P>
   A. Rarely. Though once, I was home in Westchester unpacking my
collection of rain forest hunting tools. And I had had this dart
set that had curare poison on its tip. I was very tired and I stuck
myself and I started feeling a little funny. So I called up the
number of Poison Control and they said, ``You should call Dr.
Balick _ he's our specialist.'' And I said, ``Man, this is Dr.
Balick!''
</P>
<P>
   So the woman on the other end of the phone asked my symptoms and
said, ``Now you get yourself to a hospital, but you call in advance
first.'' I then called one of the local hospitals and said, ``I
have a curare stick wound from a poisoned dart and I'm coming in an
ambulance.'' And the physician in charge, thinking it was a joke,
hung up. I eventually ended up in the E.R. of another hospital _
where there were people with heart attacks and knifings; I was the
guy in the corner with the poisoned dart wound from the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The use of botanicals and herbs in Western society has
increased. Do you find this a positive trend?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it is fascinating. In the last few years, probably over
a third of the American public has begun using botanical medicines
for some aspect of their health care. People now know if they get
into a car wreck, they go to an emergency room, but if they want to
stave off a cold, they might take echinacea. If they want to help
with their memory retention, they might take ginko.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I only recommend that people utilize herbs under the
care of a trained health-care professional. There are specific
situations where you shouldn't be using herbs. For example, if you
have a disease of the immune system like lupus or scleroderma, you
shouldn't be using echinacea.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also concerned about the growing use of botanicals in the
personal care industry. I'm worried that in some cases, this use _
without any thought of sustainability _ could lead to the demise of
some plant resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers have jumped on the bandwagon of
sustainability these days, but in truth, they had don't have a
clear idea of what that means. Sustainable harvest involves
removing only that quantity of a plant or a plant population that
will insure that the wild resource continues to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Not all personal care product manufacturers who say they ``help
the environment'' actually do that. I had a student look at some of
these manufacturers who claim, ``We're giving back to the rain
forest.'' She called some of the companies that bragged on their
labels about how much they were giving back to the environment. It
turned out that one of the bigger ones was giving away $140 that
year and another one said, ``We had no profits so we didn't give
away anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. In all your years in this business, what would you say has
been your greatest accomplishment?
</P>
<P>
   A. Working with people in Belize _ Dr. Rosita Arvigo and Gregory
Schropshire and a community of traditional healers _ to help them
preserve an entire forest, an entire ecosystem. And we call this,
the world's first ethno-biomedical forest preserve.
</P>
<P>
   It's a forest preserved so that traditional healers would have a
place to sit, teach students, plant things that are being destroyed
in other places and gather the materials for their art.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing I do, which I love, is work with urban young
people who come to the Botanical Garden from the neighborhoods of
New York. If you watch kids, they have boundless enthusiasm for
nature. They will make observations adults never would, like:
``This flower smells just like old socks!'' You want to maintain
that level of enthusiasm and openness to nature. Indeed, I think
people who really enjoy this kind of work, have maintained that
persona of a child's awareness of the earth and humility to it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you keep plants at home?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some. I keep plants that can go without care or watering for
a very long time. Because, obviously, I travel.
</P>
<P>
   I keep dracaena and yuccas and other things like that. I have an
herb garden and I struggle with it. My house happens to be situated
on a shaded plot. I grow tomatoes and they will cost about $40 a
pound, if you calculate what I've spent on them at the end of the
year. But it's money well spent. The therapy is in the growing.

   Whatever the destination, our spring travels are frequently
brightened by colorful floral displays.

Bellingrath Gardens and Home encompass 65 landscaped acres in a
semitropical setting.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens were created in 1917 on the private residence of
Walter Bellingrath. During the Depression in 1932, Bellingrath
opened the gardens to the public, and they remain one of the
nation's premier floral attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Azaleas, which began blooming in March, are complemented this
month by lilies, pansies, tulips, snapdragons, impatiens,
geraniums, dogwood and fuchsia baskets. The season's first roses
also appear in April; 130 varieties are showcased by June. A
late-autumn highlight is the world's largest outdoor chrysanthemum
display.
</P>
<P>
   Walkways shaded by centuries-old trees encourage leisurely
exploration. Benches are strategically placed for respite and views
of lovely lakes, pools and brooks. Don't miss Rustic Bridge,
bedecked with flowers. The entire area is wheelchair-accessible.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellingrath home, situated on the banks of the Fowl River
and dating to 1935, is notable for its antique furniture and
European porcelain. Another enticement is a 45-minute river cruise
on the 150-passenger Southern Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens are open daily from 8 a.m. until one hour before
dark. Home tours begin at 9 a.m. River cruises operate hourly from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in April and May, then at 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3
p.m. from June through November.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $13.95 for adults and $9.95 for children ages 5-11;
this includes entrance to the gardens and a guided home tour or
river cruise. Several driving routes lead from Mobile to
Bellingrath Gardens; from Interstate 10, take Exit 15A and follow
the signs.

The Flower Fields &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each spring, hundreds of families, many dressed in their Sunday
best, make a pilgrimage to the Flower Fields in Carlsbad, Calif.,
for the ultimate photo opportunity. Picture-perfect poses put
family members waist-high in spectacularly colored blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The most predominant blooms at the Flower Fields are giant
ranunculus in a rainbow of colors, including golden yellow, vivid
orange and a creamy white.
</P>
<P>
   Also grown here are the spiky blazing star (``Tritonia
crocata''), the ruffley gladiolus, the star-shaped harlequin
(``sparaxis''), watsonia (``Watsonia pyamidata''), the purple
baboon flower (``Babiana stricta''), the towering Adam's rib
(``Chasmanthe floribunda'') and the lovely blooming shamrock
(``oxalis'').
</P>
<P>
   The commercial flower ranch owes its beginnings to the Frazee
family, which has been cultivating ranunculus in California since
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   When the family moved its operations to Carlsbad in northern San
Diego County in 1958, the 50 acres of brilliant spring color
grabbed the attention of motorists traveling between San Diego and
Los Angeles on Route 101. Drivers often would stop for a closer
look, and a tradition was born.
</P>
<P>
   The Flower Fields, now owned by the Paul Eckes family, are in
full bloom for about six weeks each year beginning in early March.
By the time the season ends in early May, the fields will have
received about 200,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The fields are open 10 a.m.-dusk daily. Admission is $4.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the Flower Fields is Carlsbad Company Stores, an
outlet shopping center with galleries and restaurants. Carlsbad
also is the site of Legoland, the spanking-new theme park that pays
tribute to the tiny plastic bricks.

Biltmore Gardens &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to upstage a Victorian mansion with 101 bedrooms and
65 fireplaces, but the Biltmore Gardens in Asheville, N.C., does
just that.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens were designed for George Washington Vanderbilt's
country home in 1890 by Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscaper
behind New York's Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   When Vanderbilt purchased the 125,000 acres that made up the
original Biltmore Estate, the land had been deforested and
overfarmed. Olmstead met the challenge with planned woodlands,
fields and gardens. A highlight of a garden tour is the four-acre
English walled garden with its formal touches and 236-foot-long
grape arbor. In the spring, this garden is ablaze with daffodils,
hyacinths and tulips. Classic statuary, manicured lawns and three
symmetrical pools are the focal points of another visitor favorite,
the Italian Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Olmstead's naturalistic landscaping also includes an azalea
trail, pools and a lagoon. Birders and other nature lovers find
spring an ideal time to explore Biltmore's meadow and woodland
trails.
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore recently kicked off its Festival of Flowers with
the reopening of the steel-and-glass Conservatory, which underwent
a two-year, $2 million renovation. The Conservatory is home to many
exotics including ferns, cycads and orchids. The Festival of
Flowers, which runs through May 2, celebrates the return of spring
blooms such as daffodils, snowdrops and azaleas. Each day, the
festival presents special events such as barbershop quartet
performances and fashion shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore Estate is open 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a
week, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas days. Admission is
$29.95 ($22.50 for children) and includes a self-guided tour of the
first four floors of the Biltmore House and a self-guided tour of
the grounds and gardens. The Biltmore Estate also includes a
winery, three restaurants and several retail shops.

BUTCHART GARDENS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These spectacular 50-acre gardens, situated just outside
Victoria on British Columbia's Vancouver Island, originated in 1904
through an effort to beautify a worked-out quarry site on the
estate of cement manufacturers Robert and Jennie Butchart.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a century later, 1 million visitors annually enjoy the
floral beauty, entertainment programs and an excellent restaurant
near the gardens' entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Tulips of every imaginable color dominate in spring. Japanese
flowering cherry, dogwood, magnolia and crabapple trees are at
their prettiest. By next month, lilacs, azaleas and rhododendron
will begin peaking. The Rose Garden, which includes 2,500 plants of
250 varieties, is especially bountiful from July through September.
</P>
<P>
   Paved walkways connect all areas; elevations vary, so some
gradual ascents (and descents) are required, but paths without
stairs are available for visitors in wheelchairs. Allow time to
admire ever-changing ``dancing fountains'' amid the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Summer evenings are especially festive. June 15-Sept. 5, the
gardens remain open until 10:30 p.m. and are illuminated by
thousands of lights in dozens of hues. Beginning June 29, musical
revues are scheduled Mondays-Fridays just prior to dusk. Fireworks
displays occur Saturday nights July 3-Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission charges vary depending on the season and number of
blooms. Current adult admission is only $8 Canadian, or about $5.35
U.S. Peak-season admission (June 15-Sept. 15) is about $10.35 U.S.
for adults, $5.20 U.S. for ages 13-17 and $1.35 U.S. for children
5-12.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria is accessed by ferry from near Vancouver on the British
Columbia mainland or from Seattle. Butchart Gardens is located 13

KEUKENHOF &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For two months each spring, this 80-acre floral paradise in the
Netherlands becomes the unofficial tulip capital of the world. And
celebrating its 50th birthday this year, Keukenhof, which opened
March 25, expects to welcome almost 1 million visitors before
closing May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in Lisse, about an hour's drive from Amsterdam (and
also accessed by public rail and bus or on a group tour),
Keukenhof's fields are covered with 6 million tulips, narcissus,
hyacinths and other flowering bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,000 varieties of tulips comprise one-half of the total
plantings, and the color combinations are so astonishing that
Keukenhof ranks among the most photographed places in the world.
New bulbs are used every year so that designs and color
combinations can be changed; some gardens are themed according to
color, fragrance and style.
</P>
<P>
   It's wise to allow most of a day here to wander about on wide,
paved walkways (all wheelchair-accessible). Signposts identify each
variety of tulip. Rest stops include numerous benches and open-air
(and indoor) dining facilities placed throughout gardens that are
accented by ponds, statues and fountains.
</P>
<P>
   On rare rainy spring days Keukenhof features 10 changing indoor
expositions and flower-arranging demonstrations in three indoor
pavilions. Periodic indoor shows focus on orchids, roses,
daffodils, lilies and other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the birthday celebration, the park also will host
Zomerhof, a first-ever summer flower show Aug. 19-Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Keukenhof by car from Amsterdam, take the A4 motorway
toward The Hague and exit on N207 toward Lisse. Train information
is available at all rail stations.
</P>
<P>
   Keukenhof is open daily from 8 a.m. until 7:30 p.m. through May
19. Admission is about $9 U.S. for adults, with 50 percent
discounts for children under age 12. Call the Netherlands Board of

CYPRESS GARDENS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long before Walt Disney World and Universal Studios were even
imagined, this tropical paradise in Winter Haven, Fla., was billed
as Florida's first theme park. Created by Richard Pope 63 years
ago, Cypress Gardens continues to appeal to a wide range of
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Its botanical collection includes more than 8,000 varieties of
plants and flowers from 90 countries. Each plant is labeled by name
and nation, and paved walkways make observation enjoyable and easy.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular feature is a series of miniature theme gardens
whose emphasis is education. Learn about various floral scents,
cultivating roses, natural Florida designs, and fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Within a large butterfly conservatory, visitors walk among more
than 1,000 butterflies in free flight representing more than 50
species from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal floral festivals are a highlight: The current spring
extravaganza, which continues through May 15, is the world's
largest topiary show of its kind. Each topiary is decorated with
begonias and other flowers to create more than two dozen animal
formations. Adjacent floral beds feature 35,000 impatiens, salvia,
dusty miller, marigolds, celosia and begonias in varying colors.
</P>
<P>
   Cypress Gardens' famed water-ski shows remain a tradition. Also
offered are paddlewheel boat rides, weekend concerts, educational
programs and children's rides and games.
</P>
<P>
   Cypress Gardens is located off U.S. 27, about 22 miles south of
Interstate 4 between Orlando and Tampa. Hours are 9:30 a.m.-5 p.m.
(later on some holidays and special occasions). Regular admission
is $33.87. Seniors 55 and older pay $28.78; ages 6-17 pay $15.85.

   Fitness: 4 Minutes And $600 Later
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of a hot new exercise machine make a profound claim: a
four-minute workout that really works.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion comes in an infomercial from Time Works for a $600
device that works the upper and lower body with twisting and
stepping motions. Though such a less-is-more approach _ four
minutes, four times a week _ seems hard to fathom, the Time Works
infomercial and Web site prominently feature an as yet unpublished
study conducted at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y.
Researchers compared increases in fitness levels of two sedentary
groups of subjects who worked out four times a week. One group
exercised for 4 minutes per session on the Time Works machine and
another group exercised for 20 minutes per session on a treadmill
with an upper body component.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of six weeks, the researchers said, the four-minute
Time Works exercisers increased their aerobic fitness levels by an
average of 12.5 percent compared with the 20-minute treadmill
group's 9.7 percent improvement. Researchers also reported
decreases in waist circumference measurements in the Time Works
group but not in the treadmill group.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable? Many prominent exercise researchers are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``However appealing in concept,'' said Dr. David Neiman,
professor of health and exercise science and director of the human
performance lab at Appalachian State University, ``you cannot
improve cardiovascular function, gain significant health benefits,
or lose a meaningful amount of weight by doing four minutes of
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own study published in the American Council on Exercise's
magazine Fitness Matters, Neiman found that a four-minute Time
Works session did not provide sufficient exercise to help build
heart and lung fitness or positively affect general health over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Robert Otto, Adelphi's lead researcher, defends his
study, which he plans to present at an American College of Sports
Medicine conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``quite a few studies have shown that
short duration activity can have a positive impact on fitness,
especially in deconditioned individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have bitten. Since being released in 1998, Time Works,
produced by Quantum Fitness Corp. in Stafford, Texas., and
distributed by E4L, has racked up more than $60 million in sales.
Most experts stand by the college of sports medicine's
recommendation of 20 to 60 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic
activity four to six times a week for improved health, weight loss,
increased stamina and protection from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glenn Gaesser, associate professor of exercise physiology at
the University of Virginia, helped formulate the sports medicine
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now,'' Gaesser said, ``I don't think we have enough
evidence to tell people they can get by with four minutes of
exercise a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians Urge Hearing Tests at Birth
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has begun recommending that
all infants be checked at birth for hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in February, the academy said that prompt
diagnosis of hearing problems could help offset lapses in language
development.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing impairment in infants can cause delays in speech,
language and cognitive development, said Dr. Philip Ziring, the
chairman of the academy's Committee on Children With Disabilities.
Often, hearing loss is not diagnosed in children until they are 2
to 3 years old and are not speaking properly, Ziring said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if hearing loss is detected early enough, babies can be
fitted with hearing aids or watch others use sign language, said
Dr. Barbara Herrmann, an audiologist at the Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary and an assistant professor of otology and laryngology
at Harvard Medical School. ``Children learn language by exposure to
language. And without some kind of exposure, it's hard to catch
up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss is more frequent than other disorders now tested at
birth, Dr. Herrmann said. Hearing impairment occurs in 4 of 1,000
births, yet screening is required in only 10 states. Meanwhile,
babies are routinely checked for the metabolic disorder
phenylketonuria, or PKU, which occurs in one 1 of 16,000 births.
</P>
<P>
   Screening for hearing is non-invasive and painless. One test
evaluates hearing by measuring the vibration of the small hair
cells in the cochlea when exposed to sound, and the other uses ear
cuplets over the baby's ears and sensors on her head to measure
brain response to sound. Ideally, infants are tested while they
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge to pediatricians is insuring follow-up
testing and making sure these kids end up in early treatment
programs,'' Ziring said. ``You have about three to six months to
get it right. These tests can help prevent a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   1/1/00 Baby Race: Push for 12:01 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It is a date that has already crept into millennium folklore:
Friday, April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big date,'' is what Dr. Amos Grunebaum, director of
maternal-fetal medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
Manhattan, calls it: the theoretically ideal date for an egg to be
fertilized to produce a baby born at 12:01 a.m. on 1/1/00.
</P>
<P>
   Motels have offered special rates for that night, television
stations have sought to recruit couples for millennium baby
contests and a Web site, is offering a Millennium Baby package,
which for $49.95 offers a book of advice, a pregnancy test, candles
and massage oil. The Web site is www.babycenter.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two problems with the April 9 countdown, said
Grunebaum, whose own pregnancy information Web site,
www.babydata.com, offers a Conception Calculator complete with tips
on what sexual positions to try for a boy or girl. (``50 percent
serious and 50 percent fun,'' he allowed.) The first is that the
date is based on a theory that almost never works in practice. By
obstetrical convention, due dates are calculated by counting 266
days from the date of ovulation. In practice, ``only 5 percent of
women who have a due date will deliver on that specific day,'' he
said. ``It's a crapshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The second obstacle is a misconception of where the window of
opportunity lies.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman ovulates on April 9, then her chances of becoming
pregnant are the highest between April 5 and April 9; the odds that
sex on April 10 or 11 will produce a baby ``are nearly zero,''
Grunebaum said.
</P>
<P>
   He Thinks He Can, He Thinks He Can
</P>
<P>
   Studies in recent years have shown that boys tend to
overestimate their academic abilities, while girls tend to
underestimate them. Now, researchers from the University of Notre
Dame have tracked the growth of that gap and suggested a cause.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in March in the journal Child Development,
psychologists tracked 807 students, half starting in third grade
and half starting in sixth, for three years. They were periodically
asked to assess their own academic abilities and express their
anxiety or depression. Their teachers' assessments were collected
for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Self-confidence, even when misplaced, the researchers wrote, can
be a powerful force for success: ``Believing that one is competent
or capable of handling a particular task can be highly motivating,
even when it is not true.'' In first and second grades, earlier
researchers found, most students give themselves high marks. At the
start of the third grade, Notre Dame researchers found only a small
gap between boys and girls in the accuracy of their ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But from then on, an increasing number of boys thought better of
their skills than their teachers did; the number of girls who were
overly harsh on themselves increased at roughly the same rate.
Emotional measures were similar: depression grew among girls and
fell among boys. Anxiety levels for girls remained almost constant,
but fell among boys after third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the researchers focused on anxious and depressed students
and found that boys and girls in this group were equally likely to
underrate their skills. This led them to conclude that the gap in
self-esteem was largely explained by the higher prevalence of
emotional troubles among girls.
</P>
<P>
   They also concluded that the girls' depression was the likely
cause of their low self-esteem, and not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the researchers said, it may be important to try to
determine why so many girls are unhappy.

   GALTUR, Austria _ It's a brilliant afternoon. The thermostat
reads 30 degrees, but the temperature feels more like 50 as the sun

   So this is Galtur. The only images I know of this village are
the graphic newspaper and television accounts I saw a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, a devastating avalanche pushed Galtur into the world
spotlight. It was one of more than a dozen slides in the European
Alps that have left 80 people dead since January. Galtur's
avalanche killed 31, including six of this village's 701 residents.
</P>
<P>
   This visit in mid-March is coincidental, just one of four stops
long planned on a whirlwind Austrian tour. Galtur was to be a
small-town contrast to metropolitan Innsbrook, glitzy St. Anton and
romantic Kitzbuhel.
</P>
<P>
   After watching on television the rescue efforts _ both
successful and not _ I had given much thought to re-routing this
trip, a research project for future travel stores. The
recommendations coming from my Austrian-specialist travel agency
were to go to Galtur. The agents compared the slides to a Caribbean
island that is visited by a tropical storm. Within days, they
assured, all the tourist facilities would be up and running.
</P>
<P>
   I had my doubts. Would I get a true impression of this town as a
tourist destination?
</P>
<P>
   I hop aboard one of the free buses that stops right outside
Galtur's visitors center. The buses connect a series of communities
spread along stunning Paznaun Valley, which is located so high that
it can hardly be called a valley. In the winter, it is more like a
fold in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   My destination is Wirl, an assortment of hotels, guest houses,
cafes and some of the area's 10 ski lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few minutes' drive from Galtur, Wirl is a flurry of
activity. Ski school is in session, and the bunny slopes are
hopping. Across the street, the more skilled skiers and
snowboarders are laughing and loading onto a lift called the
Birkhahnbahn.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the ski area's parking lot, I find some of the
most dramatic reminders of the past weeks' events: a dozen gnarled
cars, their bent interiors still packed with snow.
</P>
<P>
   I decide to walk back into town on a snow route that parallels a
cross-country ski trail. Galtur boasts nearly 28 miles of tracks
for skiing and winter walking. What should be a 20-minute walk
becomes an hourlong adventure as I make frequent stops to study the
surrounding peaks.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to deduce the path of the killer avalanche and the
smaller slides that shook this community. In places, the mountains
have completely sloughed their snow. The 8,202-foot Adamsberg
Mountain, which spawned the killer slide, seems pure in afternoon
sun.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone in my gawking. Carload after carload of sightseers
eases past spots of ruin. Some cars are equipped with ski racks as
if this Saturday-afternoon rubbernecking is just part of a spring
holiday. Others clearly have made the drive from the big cities for
a look at the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   While the lifts here are running again, most of the dozens of
hotels and guest houses advertise rooms to let. Little signs with
beds posted outside each establishment describe the units
available, while an electronic board outside the tourist office is
ablaze in green lights. A red light would signal a full house, but
there are no red lights this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   These signs of the time are not good, says Gerhard Walter.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting over a cup of coffee in a cozy, sun-splashed corner of
the Post Hotel's lobby, Galtur's director of tourism is concerned
for his home town. March traditionally is the village's busiest
month, but bookings, not surprisingly, are down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, we are 95 to 100 percent full,'' Walter says of
March, ``but only about 5 percent of the lodging is booked now.''
</P>
<P>
   Galtur, along with the other valley communities such as Wirl and
Mathon, count about 3,800 beds spread among its hotels, guest
houses and rental apartments. Last year, the city welcomed about
300,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, that number is out of reach this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pity for us because in the last four or five years,
we've been able to build up tourism even when other places had bad
seasons,'' Walter says. ``Tourism was growing here by 5 to 10
percent each year. Our opinion is that that kind of steady growth
(because of the avalanches and the media coverage) is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter's pain of the past few weeks is still palpable as he
tells of the relief help supplied by Austrian military personnel.
The military had completed its clean-up efforts and left town just
the day before my arrival, Walter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism is not the major industry in Galtur,'' Walter says,
``It is the only industry.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the village's visitors come in the winter, a
season that spans five months (December through April). Summer
tourism is only about three months, Walter explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to finish this season in a serious way. And then we
have to think over everything,'' Walter says. ``Now everything is
too fresh. We need to get a distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance always has been a theme for Galtur. The hamlet is both
plagued and blessed by its remoteness.
</P>
<P>
   It is a three-hour drive from Munich, Germany, or Zurich,
Switzerland, the closest major airports. And despite the village's
steady growth in tourism, U.S. travel agents have yet to embrace
Galtur.
</P>
<P>
   Walter admits that Americans account for less than 1 percent of
its tourist numbers. In the long run that also may be the key to
Galtur's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   This valley is the least Americanized. No fast food and no
phoniness, Galtur offers a Tyrolean experience that is genuine and
welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Walter describes it as both family oriented and familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been here once, you feel familiar,'' he says. ``It
is good to go to a place where you feel at home. You know the
innkeeper, you know the cafe owner. A ski village should have a
relaxing atmosphere. It should be a relaxing holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   During a TV report on Galtur's tragedy, an Austrian expert
concluded that avalanches are just a way of life for those who
choose to live so far up the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a way of life also can be a way of death.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the slides this year, thousands of tourists and
residents in western Austria had been essentially cut off from the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   My last afternoon in Galtur, I feel cut off from the world. No
English-language papers are to be found. My guest-house room is
without a TV, and even my watch has stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The waning hours are measured by the ring of the church bell,
which sounds every half-hour. In tiny Galtur, you're never out of
the range of the church's bells.
</P>
<P>
   Walking past the church, I admire the bell tower, a dainty spire
rising above wooden chalets. I am taken by the soothing afternoon
light that soaked the building until my eyes fall upon six wooden
crosses protruding from the church courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping and sliding on an icy walk, I carefully climb the hill
to the courtyard entrance as the bells begin to chime again. This
time, it is not the hours being announced, but a twilight song for
the faithful. The song is long; and now standing directly under the
source, my heart clangs with each note.
</P>
<P>
   I trudge through slushy snow, straddling patches of ice, to
reach the back of the small courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   The six graves are fresh and piled with flowers and greenery
just past their prime. The dates on the crosses are all the same:
Feb. 23, 1999.

   These are some pleasing Texas gardens:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin. Ecological
concepts and the beauty and value of native flora are celebrated at
the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, founded by the former
first lady in 1983. One of the center's most interesting components
is its Home Comparison Garden, which features two landscaped
gardens. One showcases common non-native grass, trees, shrubs and
flowers; the other is designed with native grasses and plants. Both
plots are carefully monitored for their ecological soundness,
maintenance costs and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   With the blooming of colorful wildflowers such as bluebonnets
and Indian paintbrush, spring is a busy time for the center.
Special events include a photo festival April 24, Earth Day and
Arbor Day celebrations April 25 and an arts festival May 22 and 23.
Located at 4801 La Crosse Ave., the wildflower center is open 9
a.m.-5:30 p.m. daily, except Mondays. Admission is $4 ($2.50 for
children).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens. The 66-acre botanical
collection boasts 33 acres of formal gardens, including one of the
largest azalea collections in the country. Also of interest is the
intimate Woman's Garden. The Dallas Arboretum, located at 8525
Garland Road, is open 10 a.m.- 6 p.m. daily. Admission is $6 ($3
for children). Call 214-327-8263.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moody Gardens in Galveston. Tropical and subtropical plants

Gardens, which includes restaurants, a hotel, a rain forest with
tropical birds and butterflies, and a white-sand beach. Fees and
hours vary. Call 800-582-4673 or access www.moodygardens.com on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Antonio Botanical Gardens. Just a short drive from the
bustling River Walk, these gardens are one of the Alamo City's
unsung delights. A favorite is the fragrant and texture-rich Garden
for the Blind. But a word of warning: The striking glass-domed
conservatory is miserably hot in the summer. The botanical gardens,
located at 555 Funston Place, are open 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Admission is
$4 ($1 for children). Call 210-207-3250 or access www.sabot.org.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tyler Municipal Rose Garden. Discover the meaning of petal
power at the Tyler Municipal Rose Garden, which features more than
400 rose varieties spread across its 14 acres. While most Texas
gardens peak in the spring, the Tyler garden hits its prime in
October when the city hosts its popular Rose Festival. This year's
festival is Oct. 14-17. But you don't have to wait until fall to
enjoy this garden: Roses bloom throughout the summer, and the
garden, located in Rose Park, also features camellia and daylily
displays. It's open daily; admission is free. Call 903-531-1212.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Kristie Wolek, the trouble started about a year ago, when
her periods became so heavy that the blood loss made her severely
anemic. She was exhausted all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was caused by four fibroids, benign tumors in her
uterus that had been tiny and harmless for more than a decade but
had recently begun growing rapidly. Two doctors recommended a
hysterectomy, an operation to remove the uterus and the only sure
cure for fibroids. Though Ms. Wolek, 43, did not want to have more
children, she did not want a hysterectomy, either. But she thought
she had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before she was to have the operation, however, a friend
called to tell her about a television news report about a clinic
near her home in Chicago that was offering a new, minimally
invasive alternative. In August, Ms. Wolek had the operation,
called fibroid embolization, which shrinks the fibroids by blocking
their blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of enduring major surgery and several weeks of
recuperation, she felt fine in two days and has had no problems
since.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolek is fairly typical of the hundreds of women around the
country who have had the operation in that she learned of it not
from her doctor but from the news. Though the same can be said for
many treatments, fibroid embolization has attracted exceptional
attention.
</P>
<P>
   And some experts are concerned that its heavy promotion by
doctors and medical groups on news programs and the Internet makes
women think that it is an established treatment when it is not. ``I
think it's an interesting procedure,'' said Dr. Bryan Cowan,
director of reproductive endocrinology at the University of
Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, ``but, unfortunately, there
are people who have run out and grabbed the banner and are touting
this, with no evidence that it represents the standard of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hysterectomy alternatives have been developed, but recent
studies have shown that this one requires minimal recovery time and
reduces symptoms of those fibroids that resist other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get 20 e-mails a day from women in all 50 states and even
from as far away as Japan, Hong Kong, Egypt and Nairobi,'' said Dr.
Carlos Forcade, an interventional radiologist at New York United
Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester, N.Y., who performs fibroid
embolization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want this, or, rather, they don't want surgery,'' said
Dr. Gaylene Pron, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto
and coordinator of a multicenter study on fibroid embolization.
``This is a women-driven technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Any woman of reproductive age can get fibroids, but they are
most common in women over 35. According to the Society of
Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology, about 20 percent to 40
percent of these women have fibroids of significant size, and among
African-American women, the incidence is about 50 percent. Fibroids
run in families, though the cause is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, fibroids cause no symptoms and require no
treatment. But if they grow large enough or appear in sensitive
areas of the uterus, they can cause several problems, like
dangerously heavy menstrual bleeding, severe pelvic pain and
possibly infertility and miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   At first, doctors try to control fibroid-related symptoms with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or birth control pills, but
when medicine is not sufficient, women need surgery. More than
200,000 women in the United States have hysterectomies each year
because of fibroids.
</P>
<P>
   There are less invasive kinds of surgery to get rid of small
fibroids, like hysteroscopy, in which a fiber optic scope is
inserted into the vagina to remove them. But for women with
relatively large ones who hope to become pregnant, the only
surgical option is myomectomy, abdominal surgery to remove the
individual fibroids. But with myomectomy, about 10 percent of women
need further surgery because the fibroids grow back, the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reports. And doctors
have found that myomectomy is least effective for women with
multiple fibroids or individual fibroids that are deeply embedded
in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Embolization seems to work on fibroids that myomectomy cannot
eliminate, according to doctors who have studied them. The
procedure is usually done in a hospital with the patient under
local anesthesia. The patient can go home the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular and
Interventional Radiology in Orlando, Fla., last month, Dr. James B.
Spies, vice chairman of radiology at Georgetown University Medical
Center in Washington, said that 89 percent of his 61 patients had
less menstrual bleeding and that 96 had less pelvic pain. The tumor
sizes shrank by half, on average, he said. In the six years that
patients have been followed, he said, none have had new fibroids
grow. Spies said that 3 percent of women suffered complications,
like injury to the uterus and infertility. He also said that the
treatment failed in fewer than 1 percent of the women, who then
needed to have hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions about the treatment is its effect
on a woman's fertility. Though Spies and other doctors have had
patients go on to have normal pregnancies, most of their patients
are in their 40s and are not interested in pregnancy. About 1
percent to 2 percent of women go into premature menopause following
the procedure, said Dr. Scott Goodwin, the first doctor to do
fibroid embolization in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women may be suffering ovarian damage because the
embolism material migrates to the ovaries,'' said Goodwin, chief of
cardiovascular radiology at University of California, Los Angeles
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the risk of infertility, Goodwin and Spies do not
recommend fibroid embolization to women who hope to become pregnant
unless they are poor candidates for myomectomy and therefore would
face infertility with any other fibroid surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Haas, chairwoman of the Massachusetts section of the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and an
assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said she considered
it ``on the cusp between experimental and standard practice''
because it looked promising in the short term. But she was at a
recent meeting when doctors discussed technical problems. ``I heard
there were arteries that couldn't be catheterized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is new, most insurance plans do not cover the
emolization, but doctors say they can often persuade insurance
companies to pay for it on a case-by-case basis by showing them
research about the outcomes. But they say that some women want the
operation so badly that they pay for it on their own, at a cost of
as much as $15,000.

<P>
   An ambitious plan to bury the crippled Chernobyl nuclear reactor
in a giant hole more than half a mile deep has been proposed by a
group of Ukrainian research centers.
</P>
<P>
   They have suggested digging a one kilometer-deep hole next to
the nuclear power plant and letting it ``fall in'' in a controlled
manner before covering it up and sealing it with layers of rubble
and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts have reacted with alarm to the idea, which is
being put forward by four respected research institutes in the
Ukraine with the support of leading figures within the Ukrainian
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident in April 1986, which sent plumes of
radioactive material across Europe, Chernobyl's stricken reactor
Number 4 has been encased in a concrete ``sarcophagus,'' which has
since showed signs of becoming unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Western nuclear engineers brought in to advise the Ukrainian
government have suggested that the sarcophagus _ which was built in
a hurry just six months after the accident _ should be replaced or
strengthened so it would last another 100 years, by which time much
of the radioactivity inside would have decayed.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian plan put forward two years ago to create a giant
monolith by filling the entire sarcophagus with concrete was
abandoned after safety assessments showed there was a hidden risk
from missing nuclear fuel believed to be still inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   Now some Ukrainian scientists have openly criticized the Western
plan, believing that the foreign grant of $758 million will end up
being spent on Western firms and consultants rather than Ukrainian
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they want Ukrainians to dig a giant grave for the
sarcophagus which would be big enough to bury the 50-story tower
block at Canary Wharf, the biggest building in Europe, and still
have room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The Kryvbasproekt Institute in the Ukraine is leading the idea,
which also has the support of the Ukrainian Scientific Center for
Environmental Radiochemistry, the Mining Construction Institute and
the Institute of Construction Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Dmytro Hrodzynskyy, a member of the Ukrainian Academy of
Sciences, says in the magazine ``Nuclear Engineering
International'' that geological research in the region will assess
the risk of ground water contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Academy of Sciences will be performing some drilling next
year to study the issue. We should not forget earthquakes
either...But we have to support this idea in general, it is very
promising,'' Hrodzynskyy said.
</P>
<P>
   Emlen Sobotovych, another academician who backs the proposal,
said the Western plan of strengthening the sarcophagus envisages
removing the radioactive contents gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four reactors at Chernobyl, only one is still working and
that is due to be shut down next year when the power plant is
scheduled to stop producing electricity for the Ukrainian national
grid. &QL;

   Western nuclear engineers brought in to advise the Ukrainian
government have suggested that the sarcophagus _ which was built in
a hurry just six months after the accident _ should be replaced or
strengthened so it would last another 100 years, by which time much
of the radioactivity inside would have decayed.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian plan put forward two years ago to create a giant
monolith by filling the entire sarcophagus with concrete was
abandoned after safety assessments showed there was a hidden risk
from missing nuclear fuel believed to be still inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   Now some Ukrainian scientists have openly criticized the Western
plan, believing that the foreign grant of $758 million will end up
being spent on Western firms and consultants rather than Ukrainian
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they want Ukrainians to dig a giant grave for the
sarcophagus which would be big enough to bury the 50-story tower
block at Canary Wharf, the biggest building in Europe, and still
have room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The Kryvbasproekt Institute in the Ukraine is leading the idea,
which also has the support of the Ukrainian Scientific Center for
Environmental Radiochemistry, the Mining Construction Institute and
the Institute of Construction Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Dmytro Hrodzynskyy, a member of the Ukrainian Academy of
Sciences, says in the magazine ``Nuclear Engineering
International'' that geological research in the region will assess
the risk of ground water contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Academy of Sciences will be performing some drilling next
year to study the issue. We should not forget earthquakes
either...But we have to support this idea in general, it is very
promising,'' Hrodzynskyy said.
</P>
<P>
   Emlen Sobotovych, another academician who backs the proposal,
said the Western plan of strengthening the sarcophagus envisages
removing the radioactive contents gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four reactors at Chernobyl, only one is still working and
that is due to be shut down next year when the power plant is
scheduled to stop producing electricity for the Ukrainian national
grid. &QL;

   Wintry Uranus
</P>
<P>
   Winters may be long and hard here, but consider the situation on
Uranus, the seventh planet in the solar system. There, where the
seasons last for more than two decades, old man winter is a  &UR; very &LR; 
old man indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But now, parts of Uranus are coming out of a long wintertime
slumber. And a new time-lapse movie of images taken by the Hubble
Space Telescope shows for the first time the seasonal changes
taking place. Uranus, long considered fairly featureless, is
wracked by spring storms.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Earth, which spins on an axis that is perpendicular to
the plane of its orbit around the Sun, Uranus is on its side, with
each pole pointing toward the Sun for about a quarter of the
planet's year. And with a year that is equivalent to about 84 Earth
years, that means that the hemisphere opposite the sunny pole is in
winter for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble images, compiled by an astronomer at the University
of Arizona, were taken from 1994 to 1998 as the Sun began to warm
the northern hemisphere again. They show rapid movement in Uranus'
largely hydrogen and helium atmosphere, with some clouds,
presumably of methane crystals, billowing around the planet at 300
miles an hour. The images also show a distinct wobble in Uranus'
ring system, which may be caused by the planet's slightly flattened
shape or the pull of its moons.
</P>
<P>
   Storm Ribbons
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, springtime storms are often accompanied by electrical
activity, of which lightning bolts are the most visible and
dramatic sign.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of this decade, scientists have been investigating
another phenomenon of electrical storms _ wispy glowing ribbons
that appear at high altitudes, above the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   These red glows, known as sprites, accompany about one in every
200 lightning strikes. They are difficult to view from the ground
(although airline pilots reported them for years before scientists
determined what they were), and getting a reliable estimate of
their number has been practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of Massachusetts and Stanford
have determined that lightning bolts that have accompanying sprites
have a distinct electrical signature. The scientists studied a 1996
storm in Kansas, videotaping the sprites and noting the duration of
the electrical currents from the lightning. Bolts that were
accompanied by a sprite lasted much longer than those that were
not.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported their results in the April issue
of Geophysical Research Letters, say that with just four relatively
low-cost receivers the number of sprites could be counted for the
entire Western hemisphere. Determining their number may help
determine what effect, if any, sprites have on the chemistry of the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical Cleanup
</P>
<P>
   Electricity in the ground, not the atmosphere, may have an
effect on the chemistry of contaminated industrial sites, helping
to clean up them up.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Monsanto, General Electric and Du Pont have
tested a method of removing trichloroethylene, a common industrial
solvent, from soil by running an electric current through it. The
method, known as ``lasagna'' technology because of the layered
treatment zones within the soil, uses electrodes buried up to 45
feet in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   With a current running through them, the electrodes attract
water laced with trichloroethylene toward them. The water reaches
the treatment zones, which are areas of clay mixed with iron
filings that destroy the trichloroethylene by dechlorinating it.
</P>
<P>
   Because cleanup can be done at the site (as opposed to trucking
the contaminated soil elsewhere) and the treatment zones can be
left in place once the process is completed, the method should be
less expensive than traditional decontamination techniques, the
researchers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of admitting the truth about the current Kosovo
conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us It has all gone
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, was supposed to stand by the Rambouillet peace
accords, force Slobodan Milosevic to accept limited autonomy for
Kosovo and end the slaughter and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Kosovo
Albanians. Then NATO troops were to move into Kosovo in order to
protect the Muslim Albanian and Serb populations.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened? Rambouillet is in ashes. Serbia is
refusing to budge after 13 days and nights of air raids. Those we
pledged to protect are being driven from their homes in the
greatest act of depopulation in Europe since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of admitting the truth, our leaders consistently
lie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were told that the Serb leader would be forced to
end his ``ethnic cleansing.'' The opposite has happened and now we
are told _ by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, no less _ that
Milosevic will be made to ``pay the price,'' which is not the same
thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised to attack only military targets and, for as long
as it thought it could crack the Serb military, that is what it
did.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is doing just what the Americans did in Iraq _
spreading the war to civilian targets, to bridges and electricity
stations and factories and refineries, under the spurious excuse
that these are also of use to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are _ just as roads and railway tracks and water
mains are of use to the military. And as we get more desperate,
they may well be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never an operation that was planned for only two or
three days,'' NATO's spokesman James Shea told us on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Really? So why were we not told this before we went to war? Why
were we not told of the possibility of weeks of air raids and the
wholesale abandonment of the Albanian civilian population of Kosovo
if Milosevic did not give in?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only now learn about the prospect of a ``long war,''
perhaps lasting four years?
</P>
<P>
   And why, for God's sake, did no one _ not President Bill
Clinton, not NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana, nor Robin
Cook, nor General Wesley Clark _ realize that bombing must be
supported by ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   How on earth did Clark come to believe that the Serbs would give
up so easily? Did he mistake the Yugoslav army for the Serb
militias of Bosnia? Did he think that bullies are always cowards
and will therefore give in? Did he not realize that only a real
threat of ground invasion might force Milosevic to agree to the
Rambouillet accords in time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, we have been told other lies: that it
would have been even worse if NATO had not bombed Serbia _ and that
we knew Milosevic had planned the total ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Kosovo Albanian population before we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the first statement _ from President Clinton himself _
is rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb paramilitaries butchering their way across Kosovo and
poised to drive out every last Albanian, it could not possibly be
worse. And if we knew that Milosevic had planned this, why did NATO
not provide fighting ground troops in those precious weeks
following the original Rambouillet conference?
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, our defense analysts have been hard at
work to explain the continued war. Not only is it intended to make
Milosevic ``pay the price'' for his brutality, but any faltering
now would damage the credibility of NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it would. Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone
to war to save the Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are
at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Nato's 50th birthday was this weekend, marked by a
blazing oil refinery, an electricity station burning itself out in
northern Belgrade and hundred of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
freezing on the mountainsides of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised. We asked the Kurds and the Shia
Muslims of Iraq to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and, when
they did as they were told, we abandoned them to the torture
chambers of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This time, we asked the Kosovo Albanians to sign the peace
accords in Paris and praised the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Now they are on the run, we can do no more than bomb the
Serbs from the air. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a telling moment last week when a senior RAF officer
stood up at NATO's regular briefing to tell journalists that the
KLA ``has not been defeated'' but was ``regrouping'' in order to
``take up the armed struggle'' once again.
</P>
<P>
   What is this nonsense? That a NATO officer should seek to
support the KLA in such a way proved two terrifying things: to the
Serbs, that the KLA was a fifth column (and thus worthy only of
execution) and, to us, that NATO now regards this ragtag bunch of
ill-disciplined ex-Marxists as its foot-soldiers in Kosovo. The
substitute army for the NATO soldiers who will not be sent into
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO briefings become ever more sinister. At each one, a new
and ever more ghoulish story is produced for journalists _ the mass
execution of intellectuals one day, the rape of young women the
next, the killing of fathers and sons in front of their families,
the setting up of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   These stories may well turn out to be true _ I suspect the truth
may be worse _ but the effect is pornography-by-press-conference,
with spokesman ``Jamie'' Shea acting as the East End club doorman
touting the evening's horror story and his RAF colleague playing
the role of manager, promising us that the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will until every last Kosovo Albanian has been driven
from his home, or until MI5 or the CIA engineer the secession of
Montenegro or the overthrow of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the promises continue: ``We shall attack his
murderous forces in Kosovo: we shall strike at the nerve center of
his decision-making machine'' (British Armed Forces Minister Doug
Henderson).
</P>
<P>
   NATO is showing ``unflinching resolve'' in the battle against
the ``unbelievably brutal actions of Milosevic's special police and
army'' (Air Marshal Sir John Day). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is suggesting that the Serb leader may face a war
crimes indictment. Do they think Milosevic will be frightened by
all this?
</P>
<P>
   After his supporters killed and raped their way through far more
Muslims in Bosnia than they have in Kosovo, we treated him as a
peacemaker. He was invited to the Dayton conference, he was
regarded by Washington and by the Foreign Office as ``a force for
stability in the Balkans'' (as Saddam was in Iraq after he invaded
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was one of ``our'' dictators _ or at least a man with
whom we could do business.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has joined our list of ``beasts'' _ we remember
Saddam and Qaddafi although, oddly, Osama bin Laden has dropped off
our Satanic radar screens for the present.
</P>
<P>
   We believe Milosevic can be ``defanged'' or ``declawed,'' or
that we can, in the words of the Sun newspaper on the first day of
the war, ``Clobba Slobba.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, history is not like that. NATO thought that within three
days of its bombing campaign, it would have 200,000 Serbs on the
streets of Belgrade demanding Milosevic's removal. Instead, tens of
thousands of Serbs now gather on those streets for daily pop
concerts to demonstrate their hatred of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There are many words to encompass the events of the last two
weeks: brutality, vanity, arrogance. But above all, folly is the
word that comes to mind. Maybe we will find another persecuted
population to ``protect'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   They had better watch out. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam S. was clearly a bright little boy. He began reading at age
2, and as a preschooler would lecture friendly adults _ actually,
any adult who would listen _ about state capitals or presidents or
famous painters.
</P>
<P>
   But something was wrong. Adam had no friends, no connection to
his peers. By third grade he was adrift: isolated, troublesome and
unhappy, despite his academic ability.
</P>
<P>
   A string of experts gave Adam a string of diagnoses: attention
deficit disorder, nonverbal learning disorder and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Then three years ago, when he was 9,
doctors reached a new diagnosis _ Asperger's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's confusing mix of abilities and deficits and the confusion
of those who tried to assess it are both typical for children with
Asperger's, a condition that is generally considered a form of
autism. While it remains little known, the number of diagnoses has
soared since psychiatric authorities formally defined it five years
ago. Dr. Marie Bristol-Power, of the National Institute of Child
Health and Mental Development, said recent survey data suggest that
under some definitions as many as one in 500 people have the
condition, higher than the estimate for classic autism.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Asperger, the Viennese pediatrician who first described the
condition in 1944, called his patients ``little professors'' who
use words as their lifeline to the world. Most Asperger's patients
have average intelligence or above; 80 percent of autistic people,
by contrast, suffer some degree of mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking characteristic of the syndrome is consuming
interest in arcane subjects. Dr. Fred Volkmar, a psychiatrist with
the Yale Child Study Center who helped write the standard
diagnostic definition of Asperger's, has encountered obsessions
with clocks; the Titanic; deep-fat fryers; lists of congressional
members, wives and aides; refrigerators, and train, plane and bus
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows someone with an all-encompassing interest in
something or other, said Volkmar, whose Child Study Center team
last month held a conference on Asperger's, organized with the help
of Aspen of America, a national advocacy organization. ``But the
key point in the diagnosis is that their obsessive behavior
significantly impairs their social functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters with the condition are unable to pick up on the
nonverbal cues that underlie most interactions with others, but
they are smart enough to come to realize, and regret, a gap they
can cross only with extreme difficulty. As teen-agers they may
experience what one expert called ``extreme teasing.'' And while
many adults manage to master enough social skills to attend
college, find good jobs and even marry, others sink into isolation.
Researchers report high levels of depression and suicide, and
anti-depressants are the only medication considered appropriate for
the condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can learn to pretend to be normal,'' said Lianne Holliday
Willey, a 39-year-old Kansas writer who describes herself as having
``residual'' Asperger's. ``We just don't get the point of it the
way you all do.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Willey is unusual in one sense _ Asperger's is largely
a condition affecting boys and men _ she came to her diagnosis in
1997 the way many adults do: by having a child diagnosed with it.
At a North Carolina conference on the subject for parents of
children with Asperger's, Dr. Bristol-Power said, so many wives
recognized their husbands in descriptions of the syndrome that they
formed a support group for spouses.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slow acceptance of Asperger's work is that
writing in German in Vienna, Austria, in 1944 was not a good way to
spread an idea, Volkmar noted. His paper was first translated into
English in 1981 by a London psychiatrist, Dr. Lorna Wing, and only
in 1994 was the syndrome included in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual IV, the latest version of the mental health profession's
guidebook.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wing's shorthand for the condition was ``active but odd,''
to distinguish it from the extreme self-absorption of classic
autism. More recently, scientists have talked of an autistic
spectrum, with Asperger's commonly being described as the span's
``smart end.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Volkmar and some other researchers, Asperger's appears
more like a separate but related condition he would describe as
autism's mirror image.
</P>
<P>
   All of the autistic-like conditions that have come under an
umbrella term of ``empathic disorders'' _ to emphasize the stunted
social skills that undermine the learning process _ appear to be
caused by lesions in a portion of the brain that processes sensory
input. In cases of classic autism, the difficulties are
predominantly with the verbal skills handled by the brain's left
hemisphere. In Asperger's the deficits are largely in nonverbal
skills, connected to the right hemisphere, leading Volkmar to
speculate that the syndrome may someday be known as right-brained
autism.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic link is also stronger in Asperger's than in autism:
In more than one-third of the 800 cases studied at the Yale center,
a family member identified at least one other relative as having
similar traits.
</P>
<P>
   Autism is usually diagnosed around age 3, but children with
Asperger's are not usually identified until after they enter
school, when their social inabilities begin to stand out.
</P>
<P>
   That lag is unfortunate. Applied behavioral analysis, a type of
intensive, one-on-one teaching that experts consider the most
effective treatment for autism, is itself most effective in the
preschool years, said Dr. Mary Jane Weiss, the director of the
Rutgers University Autism Program.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Dr. Weiss said, because ``their strengths obscure what
their deficits are,'' Asperger's children typically receive less
help.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires ``appropriate'' services for children with
special needs over the age of 3, but Echo Fling, whose book
``Eating an Artichoke _ a Mother's Perspective on Asperger's
Syndrome'' will be published this fall, says that in practice,
districts are ``all over the map'' in the types of services
offered.

   Instead of admitting the truth about the current Kosovo
conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us It has all gone
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, was supposed to stand by the Rambouillet peace
accords, force Slobodan Milosevic to accept limited autonomy for
Kosovo and end the slaughter and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Kosovo
Albanians. Then NATO troops were to move into Kosovo in order to
protect the Muslim Albanian and Serb populations.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened? Rambouillet is in ashes. Serbia is
refusing to budge after 13 days and nights of air raids. Those we
pledged to protect are being driven from their homes in the
greatest act of depopulation in Europe since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of admitting the truth, our leaders consistently
lie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were told that the Serb leader would be forced to
end his ``ethnic cleansing.'' The opposite has happened and now we
are told _ by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, no less _ that
Milosevic will be made to ``pay the price,'' which is not the same
thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised to attack only military targets and, for as long
as it thought it could crack the Serb military, that is what it
did.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is doing just what the Americans did in Iraq _
spreading the war to civilian targets, to bridges and electricity
stations and factories and refineries, under the spurious excuse
that these are also of use to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are _ just as roads and railway tracks and water
mains are of use to the military. And as we get more desperate,
they may well be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never an operation that was planned for only two or
three days,'' NATO's spokesman James Shea told us on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Really? So why were we not told this before we went to war? Why
were we not told of the possibility of weeks of air raids and the
wholesale abandonment of the Albanian civilian population of Kosovo
if Milosevic did not give in?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only now learn about the prospect of a ``long war,''
perhaps lasting four years?
</P>
<P>
   And why, for God's sake, did no one _ not President Bill
Clinton, not NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana, nor Robin
Cook, nor General Wesley Clark _ realize that bombing must be
supported by ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   How on earth did Clark come to believe that the Serbs would give
up so easily? Did he mistake the Yugoslav army for the Serb
militias of Bosnia? Did he think that bullies are always cowards
and will therefore give in? Did he not realize that only a real
threat of ground invasion might force Milosevic to agree to the
Rambouillet accords in time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, we have been told other lies: that it
would have been even worse if NATO had not bombed Serbia _ and that
we knew Milosevic had planned the total ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Kosovo Albanian population before we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the first statement _ from President Clinton himself _
is rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb paramilitaries butchering their way across Kosovo and
poised to drive out every last Albanian, it could not possibly be
worse. And if we knew that Milosevic had planned this, why did NATO
not provide fighting ground troops in those precious weeks
following the original Rambouillet conference?
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, our defense analysts have been hard at
work to explain the continued war. Not only is it intended to make
Milosevic ``pay the price'' for his brutality, but any faltering
now would damage the credibility of NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it would. Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone
to war to save the Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are
at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Nato's 50th birthday was this weekend, marked by a
blazing oil refinery, an electricity station burning itself out in
northern Belgrade and hundred of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
freezing on the mountainsides of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised. We asked the Kurds and the Shia
Muslims of Iraq to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and, when
they did as they were told, we abandoned them to the torture
chambers of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This time, we asked the Kosovo Albanians to sign the peace
accords in Paris and praised the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Now they are on the run, we can do no more than bomb the
Serbs from the air. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a telling moment last week when a senior RAF officer
stood up at NATO's regular briefing to tell journalists that the
KLA ``has not been defeated'' but was ``regrouping'' in order to
``take up the armed struggle'' once again.
</P>
<P>
   What is this nonsense? That a NATO officer should seek to
support the KLA in such a way proved two terrifying things: to the
Serbs, that the KLA was a fifth column (and thus worthy only of
execution) and, to us, that NATO now regards this ragtag bunch of
ill-disciplined ex-Marxists as its foot-soldiers in Kosovo. The
substitute army for the NATO soldiers who will not be sent into
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO briefings become ever more sinister. At each one, a new
and ever more ghoulish story is produced for journalists _ the mass
execution of intellectuals one day, the rape of young women the
next, the killing of fathers and sons in front of their families,
the setting up of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   These stories may well turn out to be true _ I suspect the truth
may be worse _ but the effect is pornography-by-press-conference,
with spokesman ``Jamie'' Shea acting as the East End club doorman
touting the evening's horror story and his RAF colleague playing
the role of manager, promising us that the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will until every last Kosovo Albanian has been driven
from his home, or until MI5 or the CIA engineer the secession of
Montenegro or the overthrow of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the promises continue: ``We shall attack his
murderous forces in Kosovo: we shall strike at the nerve center of
his decision-making machine'' (British Armed Forces Minister Doug
Henderson).
</P>
<P>
   NATO is showing ``unflinching resolve'' in the battle against
the ``unbelievably brutal actions of Milosevic's special police and
army'' (Air Marshal Sir John Day). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is suggesting that the Serb leader may face a war
crimes indictment. Do they think Milosevic will be frightened by
all this?
</P>
<P>
   After his supporters killed and raped their way through far more
Muslims in Bosnia than they have in Kosovo, we treated him as a
peacemaker. He was invited to the Dayton conference, he was
regarded by Washington and by the Foreign Office as ``a force for
stability in the Balkans'' (as Saddam was in Iraq after he invaded
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was one of ``our'' dictators _ or at least a man with
whom we could do business.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has joined our list of ``beasts'' _ we remember
Saddam and Qaddafi although, oddly, Osama bin Laden has dropped off
our Satanic radar screens for the present.
</P>
<P>
   We believe Milosevic can be ``defanged'' or ``declawed,'' or
that we can, in the words of the Sun newspaper on the first day of
the war, ``Clobba Slobba.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, history is not like that. NATO thought that within three
days of its bombing campaign, it would have 200,000 Serbs on the
streets of Belgrade demanding Milosevic's removal. Instead, tens of
thousands of Serbs now gather on those streets for daily pop
concerts to demonstrate their hatred of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There are many words to encompass the events of the last two
weeks: brutality, vanity, arrogance. But above all, folly is the
word that comes to mind. Maybe we will find another persecuted
population to ``protect'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   They had better watch out. &QL;

<P>
   In Massachusetts, many doctors give a diagnosis of nonverbal
learning disorder because it qualifies a student for more help,
said Ms. Fling, who lives in Hamilton Township, N.J. In Texas,
children with Asperger's are often labeled high-functioning
autistic for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is usually a mix of speech and occupational therapy
combined with behavioral training focused on social skills, Dr.
Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmar called the overall goal using childrens' strengths _
intelligence and verbal ability _ to overcome their deficits.
Judith Rivkin, the mother of a Manhattan 9-year-old with
Asperger's, Sam D., described the process as breaking down behavior
that most people master without thinking into discrete fragments
that can be learned by rote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of practicing what you could say,
practicing taking the other person's point of view,'' Ms. Rivkin
said. ``Things like, `Do I have to look him in the eye?' `Yes, but
just a little bit to let him know you're listening.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents have found music and pets helpful. Ms. Willey
called music a ``salvation'' in her own childhood. ``When you're
really obsessing on something, it's as if music makes something
click, and gives your brain permission to say, `Ah! I can float
away on this!'''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescence is particularly hard for children with Asperger's.
Many teachers find it hard to believe that a bright student who is
disrupting class is not doing it on purpose, Volkmar said. Until
recently, that often meant that students with Asperger's were
lumped in with aggressive students in special classes for
troublemakers, a practice that he said amounted ``to putting the
perfect victims in with the perfect victimizers.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam S.' mother, Lori, has dealt with the trauma of teasing both
with her son and as president of Aspen Inc., a New Jersey group
that offers support to parents in the New York region. ``Because
our kids are so bright, they have a lot of self-awareness. They're
aware that the thing is to blend in, and that they don't _ and that
can lead to depression.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Adam's district has assigned him a ``shadow'' aide,
who helps guide him away from inappropriate behavior as well as
keep him working smoothly in his mainstream classes. And his recent
victory in his school's geography bee is the kind of positive side
to his intense focus that his family and teachers can use to help
bolster his self-esteem. ``I was very worried about his starting
middle school,'' his mother said. ``But it's turning out to be his
best year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Adam sometimes comes home crying, frustrated by his
inability to connect. Volkmar recalled one teen-ager with the
syndrome who tried to translate emotions into equations and offered
to give up a watch that was his prize possession if he could get a
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But children can be helped to connect. Ms. Rivkin said her son
has ``learned to have friends and to care about his friends.'' He
recently gave a rundown on his classmates ``all about how he likes
her, but she doesn't like him, and how this one likes me,'' and
wrapped it up by declaring ``and that's the Love Report!''
</P>
<P>
   Even adults who have overcome the most isolating elements of
Asperger's say they still struggle with the consequences of things
like having a poor grasp of what to say _ or not to say _ when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people tell me I'm just a little weird,'' said Ms.
Willey, who has published a memoir, ``Pretending To Be Normal.''
``Other people think we're quirky and cute. Well, our quirkiness
keeps us from getting jobs, from making friends, keeps us on
antidepressants. We're screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kirby, the creator of an Internet resource site for
Asperger's called the Oasis, said she gets messages regularly from
adults who hear a description of the syndrome and think it matches
them. Dr. Bristol-Power said many people receive diagnoses as
adults, but cautioned that the label could easily be overapplied.
``Where do you draw the line between a syndrome and diversity of
personality types, which you want?''
</P>
<P>
   The active role on the issue being taken by some adults with
Asperger's has made a push for greater acceptance for
``non-neurotypicals'' a central goal. David Spicer, a North
Carolina computer programmer who received an Asperger's diagnosis
at the age of 46 in 1994, says he is often asked if he wishes he
could be cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if there's my autism, and then there's me,'' he
said. ``I don't exist separate from my autism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey's daughter with Asperger's, Meredith, 8, is well
aware of the difficulties Asperger's imposes, from recognizing word
sounds to being easily overwhelmed by the bustle of a mall. But she
sees another side as well. ``When I find something I like, like
horses and Shakespeare and Winnie the Pooh,'' she said, ``I like
them a whole lot more than other people like their things.''

   JERUSALEM _ The worst drought in 50 years has led Israel to cut
the supply of desperately needed water to Jordan in a move likely
to provoke a crisis in relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the winter rains _ only 40 percent of normal in
Israel _ will have a devastating impact on Jordan, which already
suffered a severe water shortage last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, householders found that when
they turned on their taps they received only a trickle of grey
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very serious,'' says Gershon Baskin, director of
the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``By summer people in Amman may be getting only one or two days
water a week. It is destabilizing for the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel is pledged by treaty to supply Jordan with 45 million
cubic meters of water annually, but has told the Jordanian
government that it can only send 40 percent of this. Israeli
farmers have already had their supply cut by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The hills east of Jerusalem, usually carpeted with green grass
and wild flowers at this time of year, are as barren as in high
summer. The government is expected to declare an official drought
this month.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan the situation is much worse. Its own water resources
are limited. In the east Jordan Valley, the center of Jordanian
agriculture, one of the main canals has grass growing along its
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the filtration plants at the Amman reservoirs stopped
working leading to toxic water flowing into the supply system.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin, who has studied regional water problems for twenty
years, says: ``For Israel it is an economic issue; for Jordan it is
a survival issue.'' He says that Jordan might lose half its crops
in the east Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has rejected outright an Israeli proposal to cut the
water supply. Israeli officials are concerned that the affair may
provoke a crisis in relations between the two countries especially
as the newly-crowned King Abdullah will need to show that he can
deal with the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel the government gave the go-ahead earlier in this month
for preliminary studies for a desalination plant. Experts argue,
however, that the problem could be solved by cutting the subsidies
to Israeli agriculture which takes 60 percent of the water in
Israel but produces only two percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Countries in the Middle East have long quarrelled about water.
Syria is vulnerable to Turkey damming the water of the upper
Euphrates for irrigation and agricultural schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is dependent on the waters of the Euphrates, which can be
dammed by Syria, and the Tigris which comes from eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan is the most vulnerable country in the region, with
few water resources of its own. The oasis at Azraq east of Amman,
once full of water fowl, is now largely dried mud.
</P>
<P>
   In order to cope with the water crisis it has been draining its
underground aquifers at an unsustainable rate.
</P>
<P>
   Such water resources that it does have are at the upper end of
the Jordan Valley where the Jordan River and the Yarmouk flow into
the sea of Galilee. Under the 1994 peace treaty between Israel and
Jordan the country was to receive extra water from Israel. It is
this which is now being cut.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the first full year when the plan was in operation,
Israel met its obligations. But nobody expected such a serious
drought this year and there are no provisions in the treaty about
what to do if a water shortage affected the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   As with Israel most of the water in Jordan is used in
agriculture, which consumes 68 percent of total supply, while
domestic use is only 28 percent. On other hand Amman, with a third
of the Jordanian population, is expanding fast and using ever more
water. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In the old, Cold War days, when gathered
university scientists would turn to complaining about how secrecy
strictures sometimes kept them from sharing their work, they
usually meant pesky national security restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   These days, they tend to mention non-disclosure agreements,
worldwide patent rights, royalty streams, intellectual property
fights _ in a word, money. And all the commercial hindrances to
open science carried by the powerful wave of private capital that
has been washing into the country's research universities in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The strings that often come with private research money _ the
publication delays while patents and profits are pursued, the
proprietary findings _ hold the pernicious potential to impede the
free exchange of information that speeds scientific progress,
speaker after speaker warned last week at a conference on ``Secrecy
in Science'' held by the American Association for the Advancement
of Science and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, private research financing is also undeniably good
for scientific progress, many noted, from the biotechnology
companies' bankrolling academic gene research to the start-ups
owned by professors who work that much harder in the hope of
getting rich.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, one official said, private capital has gone from paying
for about 5 percent of research 15 years ago to nearly 25 percent
today. But, conference organizers worried aloud, at what price?
They called for a national dialogue to explore just how much the
secrecy requirements imposed by private finance cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercialization of science,'' said Irving A. Lerch,
chairman of the science association's Committee on Scientific
Freedom and Responsibility, ``has resulted in a new regime of
secrecy which is very concerning to the scientific community,
something which we have to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the scientific enterprise _ which depends
greatly on its own control, on its openness and exchange _ and the
need of our commercial patrons to recover their investment, those
create tensions that are tremendously important.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the commercial influence on science is not new, but
the advent of the biotechnology era seems to be bringing it to a
head. Compared with other industries, biotechnology companies rely
very heavily on academic work for the scientific underpinnings of
their products.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, said Robert Cook-Deegan, director of the
National Cancer Policy Board, private investment in health-related
research surpassed the public money put into it, and biotechnology
companies report that about a quarter of them are heavily dependent
on academic research, and another quarter are somewhat dependent.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, said Nelson Y.S. Kiang, a professor emeritus at MIT, the
committee ``has come across a number of cases that all had the same
characteristics: someone had a scientific result that he or she was
enjoined from making public because it went against the interests
of a third party, either government or a commercial business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not aberrations,'' Kiang continued. ``It looks like
this is a pattern which is built into our social institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among cases brought up at the conference was that of Dr. David
Kern, a Brown University occupational health specialist who
described the pressure he encountered not to publish his findings
of a new, potentially fatal occupational lung disease he had
identified among workers at a local textile company that had hired
him as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Kern had signed no scientific non-disclosure agreement, he said,
but the company insisted that he had and pressured his employers,
Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket, R.I., and Brown University, to
silence him. After Kern published anyway, his employers dissolved
his program, Rhode Island's only occupational health center, he
said, and barred him from treating the company's employees. They
also eliminated his tenurelike position. His contract with Memorial
was not renewed, and will run out in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the conference and put forth as a cautionary
example was Dr. Nancy Olivieri, a researcher at the University of
Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. She recently
received a settlement and was reinstated by her employers after a
three-way dispute between her university and a Canadian drug
company, Apotex, Inc., over the publication of her studies of a new
drug for thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A third case was that of Dr. Betty Dong, a pharmacy professor at
the University of California at San Francisco whose research showed
that generic thyroid drugs worked as well as their brand-name
equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   Because she had signed a confidentiality contract with the drug
company that financed her work, Boots Pharmaceuticals, it took
almost seven years for Dr. Dong's results to be published in a top
medical journal. In that time, the paper's authors estimated,
Americans could have saved about $365 million a year by using the
cheaper generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of universities and scientists is sad, shocking
and frightening,'' said Dr. Drummond Rennie, another committee
member, who described Dr. Dong's case and the University of
California's failure to defend her. ``They are seduced by industry
funding and frightened that if they don't go along with these gag
orders, the money will go to less ethical institutions.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Some scientists pointed to other, subtler dangers. What, for
example, of the incentive for professors who need research money to
gear their work toward areas with the greatest potential commercial
applications, rather than the greatest inherent scientific worth,
in hopes of attracting corporate sponsors? And what of the
temptation to sign contracts with sponsors all but giving away the
shop, by, say, long delaying publication?
</P>
<P>
   A study by Massachusetts General Hospital policy analysts of
more than 2,000 life-sciences researchers published in 1997 found
that about 20 percent reported having delayed publication of their
results for more than six months, or not publishing at all, mainly
because of their relationships with private sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association said the withholding of data was less than widespread,
it said it had affected a significant number of faculty,
particularly the most productive and entrepreneurial.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with money, Alan Hartford, a
Massachusetts General Hospital research fellow, told the
conference, but ``what we must guard against is the loss of
professional values.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another, strong side to the issue that emphasizes the
good that is done by private money: studies have found that
professors with private financing publish more, teach a bit more,
and serve more as department chairs and journal editors. Indeed,
when this topic has come up in science publications, there has been
a solid chorus of voices from professors who say they see private
money as an overwhelming good, and feel unconstrained by the
agreements they negotiate with companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts General report also found that privately
financed researchers kept more secrets, and were three times as
likely as non-commercial professors to delay publication and to
deny colleagues access to their data.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, said Martin Michaelson, a lawyer specializing in
representing universities, the academic world seems to be divided
into two types of professors, one doing largely unappreciated
research without much funding, the other a kind of academic
rainmaker who brings in industry money and becomes ``a reigning
prince.'' And the problem, Michaelson said, is that ``they are
often not talking to each other.'' And frequently when such
entrepreneurial professors do talk about their work, they want to
reveal only enough to titillate potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, too, said Charles M. Vest, MIT's president,
is that the boundary between science and technology is increasingly
blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because technology frequently is tied directly to
commercial interests,'' he said, ``it presents an even fuzzier
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what to do? Proposals varied, from calls for faculties and
administrations to defend information flow more vigorously, to more
concrete suggestions that universities refrain from taking equity
positions in companies or rein in professors tempted to sign what
they should not.
</P>
<P>
   Lita L. Nelsen, director of MIT's Technology Licensing Office
described one kind of clampdown. Sometimes, she said, ``faculty who
need money to do research to get tenure have to be told, `You
cannot sign that agreement; we will not honor it.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had the general impression that there was a
``drifting tide,'' at work, the attractive force of money, and not
enough of a counter-force. Maybe, she said, the conference would
get that countervailing force going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful,'' said Howard K. Schachman, a
biochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, ``to return
to the era when collegiality and sharing took precedence over
commercial interests.''

ABANDONED BUNNIES ARE SAD EASTER TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Has sidebar slugged BUNNY-TIPS) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine it ...
</P>
<P>
   You were snatched away from your brothers and sisters, hugged
and squeezed unmercifully, picked up by your long ears, chased by a
big dog, and penned up in a backyard cage all by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you're a bit bigger, the people who took you to live
with them aren't interested in you anymore. They turned you loose
in a park near the hills. You're hungry and it's getting dark and
cold, and your sensitive nose detects something that smells like
coyotes on the prowl ...
</P>
<P>
   A scary scenario? That's the fate of many Easter bunnies, say
those whose job it is to care for abandoned rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbits can live up to 10 years, but most of them (bought as
Easter bunnies) won't live to see their first birthday,'' said
Jackie David, spokeswoman for Los Angeles City Animal Services.
``People regard them as disposable.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months after Easter, many rabbits who've lost their
holiday luster begin to show up at public and private shelters,
discarded by their owners after baby cuteness turned into bunny
puberty, with raging rabbit hormones triggering biting, scratching,
urine spraying and an urge to mate.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than get the animals spayed or neutered to calm their
behavior, owners dump two or more rabbits a week at city shelters
for several weeks after Easter, said David.
</P>
<P>
   At the nonprofit spcaLA shelters, the population of abandoned
rabbits grows by 12 to 15 a week shortly after the holiday, said
shelter spokeswoman Mary Brankovic.
</P>
<P>
   Without proper facilities to care for them _ rabbits, with
unpadded feet, need special cages _ the shelters work with the
nonprofit House Rabbit Society to find new homes for abandoned
bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   But the HRS itself gets about 100 calls a month from rabbit
owners eager to get rid of bunnies they've grown tired of _ and
there are only about three new homes available monthly for
abandoned rabbits, said HRS spokeswoman Karynne Johnson of Sherman
Oaks, herself a rabbit owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happens to the rest,'' she said regretfully.
``Some of the people, I know, just put them in the front yard and
ignore them until they go away. Others turn them loose in parks or
take them into the hills. But they don't know how to fend for
themselves in the wild, and most of them are killed by coyotes.
Even a good-sized owl can swoop down and carry off a rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   The lucky Easter bunnies are those purchased by owners who
intend to keep them for life, who study up on rabbit care and who
know that rabbits are delicate creatures who are very different
from other domestic pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to really like rabbits to be good rabbit owners,''
said David. ``They're not an interactive animal like a cat or a
dog. They don't walk on a leash. They don't come when they're
called. And they stress out very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbits also have very delicate spines, said Brankovic, and can
be paralyzed or killed by unknowing mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you treat them like a cat or a dog, rolling them over and
roughhousing with them, you can kill them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbits have even been known to die of fright, sometimes caused
by the mere smell of a predator.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the HRS _ with the emphasis on ``house'' _ advocates
adopting a bunny and making it part of the family. If your cat or
dog curls up on the sofa next to you while you're watching
television, there's no reason your bunny can't do the same, says
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, rabbits can have the run of the house,'' she said.
``Of course, you have to keep them groomed, and you teach them to
use a litter box, just like a cat. And there's no reason they can't
go where they please with the rest of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leaving rabbits feeling bored and unloved, caging
them in the back yard can also doom them to short lives of ill
health, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to see your rabbit, to know how he's doing, whether
he eats or not, because rabbits get very sick very quickly,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Hyman, a small-animal vet at the Newbury Park
Veterinary Clinic, said rabbits have medical problems that aren't
prevalent in dogs and cats _ respiratory infections, abscesses,
bladder stones and hairballs they can't vomit up. Owners should get
to know their rabbits so they'll pick up on early signs of illness
and take the animal for medical treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most aren't so delicate that they can't survive an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sick rabbit is not a dead rabbit, but you do have to
recognize what's going on,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbits are happiest in pairs. And abandoned rabbits often find
good homes with rabbit-owning families who are looking for a
companion bunny, said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   HRS rabbits, which are spayed or neutered, are introduced to
their adoptive families carefully. Despite their docile demeanor,
rabbits can be fierce if faced with another rabbit they don't like,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We supervise them getting together to make sure nobody gets
hurt,'' she said. ``Sometimes, it's love at first sight. Sometimes,
they fight like mad. They shred each other to pieces and the bloody
fur flies. Of course, we try to keep that to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling which rabbits will get along. So it may take
several attempts before a compatible mate is found. Sometimes that
``mate'' may be the family dog or cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbits are extremely social,'' Johnson said, ``and when they
find a mate they like, they're very happy animals.'' &UR;

(WITH PASSENGER-BILLS SIDEBAR) &HT;    
 &HT;    CONGRESS IS RESPONDING TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT AIRLINES, BUT IS
THERE A REAL NEED?
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trapped on a Northwest Airlines plane grounded for eight hours
in Detroit during a January snowstorm, passengers were without
food, water or usable bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, a Trans World Airlines plane sat for two hours in
December and passengers aboard had no food or water. One testified
at a congressional hearing that there were no obvious mechanical
problems and the weather was fine. Two days later, word came of an
employee sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents like these, closer scrutiny by lawmakers and perhaps a
little political grandstanding are spurring a ``passenger rights''
movement in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   At least four congressional plans aimed at forcing airlines to
shape up are pending, and Vice President Al Gore has rolled out an
administration proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment portrayed by the proposals is that at airports
across America, traveler anger has intensified as services provided
by the airlines have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more wide dissatisfaction with airline service
than I had anticipated,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of
the House Transportation Committee and author of a passenger rights
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Whether passengers are more angry and airline service has become
worse is not clear. Even if both allegations are true, some doubt
whether the legislation is justified and whether good customer
service can be mandated.
</P>
<P>
   The various plans feature many requirements for the airlines,
which would have to tell passengers why flights are delayed and
provide refunds within 48 hours of a ticket purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The plans also call for airlines to disclose more information
about overbooked flights and frequent flier plans, and compensate
passengers for runway waits of more than two hours. They also would
increase carriers' liability for losing bags and bumping
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the airlines can be blamed for some passenger anger, some
of it has been triggered by circumstances beyond their control.
Delays caused by the nation's aging traffic control system,
increased security or traffic jams in driving to the airport are
just a few.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-seat factor also is making some passengers grumpy. As
more people fly, travelers can't take for granted that the seat
next to them will be empty or that they won't get middle seats
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry filled an average of 70.1 percent of its
domestic seats last year, up from 65.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To make their case, lawmakers and other supporters of passenger
rights plans point to an increase in the number of complaints
against airlines that customers have made to the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But, though the percentage increases are impressive, the
complaints are statistically small compared with the actual number
of people flying, Transportation Department statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   For the top 10 airlines:
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 5,808 complaints made to federal officials.
That year, people boarded 537.9 million times. That's 1.08
complaints per 100,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were 0.66 complaints per 100,000, or 3,212
complaints for 485.7 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   For all U.S. carriers:
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 7,994 complaints were made, while 643.3 million
passengers boarded. That's up from 4,635 complaints in 1995 with
579.7 million people boarding.
</P>
<P>
   The key indicators of service that airlines must report to the
government also don't show much change over recent years.
</P>
<P>
   For the top 10 airlines:
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of domestic flights arriving on time was 78.6
percent in 1995 and 77.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines got 5.18 reports of mishandled bags on domestic flights
per 1,000 passengers in 1995. Last year, it was 5.16 per 1,000
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The rate at which passengers were involuntarily denied boarding
on domestic and outbound international flights because of
overbooking was 1.06 out of 10,000 in 1995. Last year, it was 0.87
per 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A recent morning at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston
also didn't reveal a sense of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Among 15 travelers interviewed, most had little negative to say
about airline service. Several had some gripes, and just a couple
were strongly critical.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Vargus, a Tampa, Fla., retiree who travels frequently, said
he doesn't believe service has become worse. He's never had a bag
lost and said he's surprised that with all the people flying these
days, the airlines do as well as they do.
</P>
<P>
   Vargus originally had a ticket on an America West Airlines
flight from Las Vegas to Tampa. It was overbooked and he
volunteered to give up his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute arrangements put him on America West from Las Vegas
to Houston and Continental Airlines from Houston to Tampa. In
exchange, he got a travel voucher for a round-trip America West
ticket. The deal suited him fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very happy with my flying life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Karen Runge and her husband were connecting through Houston to
return to Toronto on Continental from a vacation in Ecuador. She
travels often for business and pleasure, including flights to the
United States. Among U.S. carriers, she has flown mostly American
Airlines and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Runge said she is reasonably satisfied with the airlines'
performance. Passengers and bags are moved fine. Her flights arrive
without many delays. Onboard service continues to be good, although
she said the food has declined.
</P>
<P>
   While Runge believes the service is as efficient as in the past,
she said employees are not as pleasant. That, though, is partly
because so much is expected of them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rich Laucks, a Green Bay, Wis., resident who flies once and
sometimes twice a week for his job, didn't have much positive to
say. He most often flies Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Airline service has become worse, he said, as carriers have cut
back to boost profits. Lines are longer because there are not
enough ticket agents, he said. Bags get lost and planes aren't kept
up as well, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Full planes mean increased employee workloads, he said. ``It
affects the morale of the people that work for the airlines, so
they're crabbier than they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Laucks recently was on a Northwest flight and had a 30-minute
wait onboard after landing because no one was available to operate
the jet bridge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only carrier he enjoys flying is Midwest Express, where he
said he is treated like he matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, it's all the same at all the other major
carriers,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ If there was a bunny in your Easter basket, or if
you're planning to adopt one, here are some tips from spcaLA and
the House Rabbit Society on taking care of a bunny.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't cage your rabbit, then forget it except for feeding
time. Ignored rabbits can become bored and anti-social and can also
develop undetected illnesses that can lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't overhandle rabbits. Most are sociable but prefer not to
sit on laps or be cuddled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rabbits can be spayed or neutered when young _ 4 months for
males, 6 months for females. Unless spayed, a female rabbit can
produce as many as 12 litters a year. An unspayed female has an 80
percent chance of developing uterine tumors by age 3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rabbits, once litter box-trained, can be given the run of the
house. Many also enjoy a few hours outdoors, but only in a large
cage or run they can't dig out of _ and that predators can't manage
to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bunnies like a cage they can retire to for security. Cages
should be at least three to five times as long as the rabbit is
when stretched out _ and wide enough for the rabbit to turn around
comfortably. Cages (preferably with wooden or slatted floors, not
wire) should be equipped with litter boxes and fresh, cool water at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rabbits love to chew, so provide plenty of plain, unfinished
wood (not redwood, which may be toxic for bunnies), branches and
twigs. If yours is a house rabbit, encase electrical cords or
string them out of reach so they can't be chewed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A spayed or neutered rabbit can co-exist peacefully with
another spayed or neutered rabbit, a cat or a dog, as long as
they're introduced and supervised carefully.
</P>
<P>
   _ For more information on rabbit care, check out the HRS Web
site at www.rabbit.org, or contact the HRS at P.O. Box 49356, Los
Angeles, Calif. 90049.

   (major carriers,'' he said.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people across America have had bad experiences with
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Some have told their horror stories to lawmakers during
well-publicized hearings in Washington, while others have
complained to the Transportation Department. But such complaints
represent a fraction of what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   A senior transportation official said the department estimates
that for every complaint filed with it, hundreds are made to the
airlines. Many encountering problems don't report them to the
government or the airlines. Instead, they tell friends or
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential source for gauging complaints, the Air
Transport Association, the lobbying group of the major carriers,
said it doesn't collect statistics on complaints made to airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But there is at least one indicator that passengers are
increasingly less happy with airline service.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's rating in the American Customer Satisfaction
Index has declined. The rating, put out since 1994, is produced by
the University of Michigan, the American Society for Quality and
Arthur Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry's index score, which was 72 out of 100 in
1994, had dropped to 67 by 1997. That mark was one of the lowest
satisfaction ratings among private-sector industries.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry's performance comes as customer
satisfaction overall has fallen from 74.5 to 71.1.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Boyd, a Colorado aviation consultant, said airlines
generally have poor attitudes toward their customers.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Delta Air Lines, which instituted, and later rescinded,
a surcharge on all tickets not bought at its own Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that show you someone who really cares about the
consumer?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Complicated ticketing rules that even airline employees don't
understand also frustrate passengers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, an online travel service,
also faulted the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers need ``truth in advertising'' for policies, including
frequent flier rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines raised fares twice this year as activity heated up in
Washington, Parsons said, leaving passengers feeling, ``You're
going to raise the fares one way or the other, and we're going to
get the shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers consider passing legislation, they point to some
legitimate anger and criticism from some industry experts. Adding
to the momentum in Washington are a few high-profile incidents at
several airlines and the technology-driven ease with which people
can express their views through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Shuster said his passenger rights proposal has struck a raw
nerve. He said he can't go anywhere, be it the floor or the House
gym, without members sharing their own or their constituents' bad
airline experiences.
</P>
<P>
   He put the bill together after the Northwest incident in
Detroit. Its provisions include payments to passengers for certain
waits on runways. For delays of two to three hours, passengers
would get 200 percent of their ticket prices. The amount goes up
after three hours. Delays caused by last-minute air traffic control
directives are exempted.
</P>
<P>
   Also, airlines must tell passengers why flights are being
delayed, diverted or canceled. They would be unable to stop
customers from using portions of their tickets. And, if asked,
airline representatives would have to tell how many seats on a
given date and route are available for frequent flier awards.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
each have their own plans. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican
who may run for president, and Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat,
co-sponsored another.
</P>
<P>
   These plans and Shuster's have some similar features. Provisions
include requiring airlines to provide information on all available
fares, give refunds for tickets within 48 hours of purchase and
return lost bags within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry is lobbying against the bills, saying that
they could mean increased costs that would be passed on to
passengers, and that they are not necessary. Industry observers say
it's too early to tell what, if any, legislation will be passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an airline doesn't do a good job in a snowstorm, should we
re-regulate the whole industry? That's foolish,'' said Gordon
Bethune, Continental's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Shuster, say more competition in the airline
industry is the real answer. The Transportation Department has
prepared new competition guidelines that are expected to go to
Congress soon.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster also has sponsored legislation to fund more
infrastructure such as gates and runways, which he said is needed
to bring in additional airlines. And Dingell's bill also calls for
increased penalties for airlines that use unfair competition
methods.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Trippler, a former travel agent who tracks airline issues
as a consumer advocate for 1travel.com, an online travel service,
said Congress should say to airlines, ``Clean it up now or we're
going to act.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors some legislative remedies, including allowing
passengers to use tickets as they want because consumers should
have the right to use as much or as little of a product as they see
fit.
</P>
<P>
   But he also believes passengers could help themselves. He
provided a hypothetical example: AirTran comes into a
Continental-dominated market with cheap fares to several cities.
Continental matches the fares. Continental frequent fliers stay
with Continental to get mileage points. Eventually, AirTran pulls
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer has made the choice,'' he said. ``We can't
protect the customers from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, legislation can't fix it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definite service problems. Can we legislate customer
service? No, we cannot,'' he said. ``We can't pass a law and say,
`You've got to smile.'''

`EVERYTHING'S RELATIVE' HAS TONS OF POTENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
EVERYTHING'S RELATIVE 
Starring: Jeffrey Tambor, Eric Schaeffer, Jill Clayburgh, Kevin
Rahm 
On: NBC, Tuesday night at 9:30 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On most sitcoms born A.S. ``After Seinfeld'' premiered _
everything is not relative. On series from ``Friends'' and ``Sports
Night'' to ``Spin City'' and ``The Drew Carey Show, the humor is
rooted in the single life, in the rigors of flirting, dating, and
getting dumped. But with ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' and, now, the promising ``Everything's Relative,'' the
family sitcom is coming into some new energy, with an unblinking
focus on the comic perversities of adult children and their
not-so-adult parents. Next to the raging eccentricities of these
1990s relatives, Gomez and Morticia Addams look a bit like Ward and
June Cleaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's Relative'' takes its cue from ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' but its characters are more educated, more therapized,
and whacked out in more psychologically distorted ways. There are
two sons in their 20s, Leo and Marty, and a pair of needy parents
who are divorced, but still tangled up in each others' daily lives.
Jeffrey Tambor, so perfectly clueless on HBO's late, great ``Larry
Sanders Show,'' plays the father, a big kid who thinks every pretty
woman has a thing for him and feels hurt when he realizes Marty
never buys him gifts. He's a lumbering, grinning adolescent. Jill
Clayburgh plays his ex-wife, a clinical therapist who wrote a book
about obsession. Naturally, she is quite obsessed with her family,
threatening to buy a new home first in her son's neighborhood, and
then across the street from her former spouse, whom she divorced
decades ago. In a funny recurring bit, she literally never can say
goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   These two nuts orbit around Kevin Rahm's Leo. He's a comedy
writer who isn't especially funny, and he frets about his parents
like a nervous parent. He recently broke up with a girlfriend,
which his mother and father see as an opportunity to invade his
life, and he now fears that he will have to be ``breaking up with
the family.'' Rahm, who looks like James Spader, has some
wonderfully crazed moments after he watches the movie ``Shine,''
and fears his overbearing father might turn him into a broken man
like David Helfgott. He even begins to stutter. The show's only
poorly conceived character is Eric Schaeffer's Marty, a high-strung
dolt who is about to get married. While the three other characters
are riddled with amusing ironies, Marty is just an idiotic cipher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's Relative'' has lots of potential. The writing is
less abrasive and one-liner-oriented than most sitcoms, and the
situation offers some room for comic exploration. Tambor and
Clayburgh, who appear to be happily liberated from the failed drama
``Trinity,'' have the potential to make a garish odd couple (though
neither looks to be as show-stopping as Doris Roberts, the invading
mother on ``Raymond''). And Rahm is a good foil, compelled against
his better judgment to throw himself in the middle of his family's
insane activities. It's the kind of show that will need to prove
itself, to push its characters beyond their conceptual
underpinnings (the obsessed obsession therapist, the unfunny comedy
writer) and into living, breathing people we might want to laugh at
every week.

   PHILADELPHIA _ The Sumerians had a story to explain their
invention of writing more than 5,000 years ago. It seems a
messenger of the king of Uruk arrived at the court of a distant
ruler so exhausted from the journey that he was unable to deliver
the oral message. So the king, being clever, came up with a
solution. He patted some clay and set down the words of his next
messages on a tablet.
</P>
<P>
   A Sumerian epic celebrates the achievement:
</P>
<P>
   Before that time, writing on clay had not yet existed,
</P>
<P>
   But now, as the sun rose, so it was!
</P>
<P>
   The king of Kullaba ((Uruk)) had set words on a tablet, so it
was!
</P>
<P>
   A charming just-so, or so-it-was, story, its retelling at a
recent symposium on the origins or writing, held here at the
University of Pennsylvania, both amused and frustrated scholars. It
reminded them that they could expect little help _ only a myth _
from the Sumerians themselves, presumably the first writing people,
in understanding how and why the invention responsible for the
great divide in human culture between prehistory and history had
come about.
</P>
<P>
   The archeologists, historians and other scholars at the meeting
smiled at the absurdity of a king's writing a letter that its
recipient could not read. They also doubted that the earliest
writing was a direct rendering of speech. Writing more than likely
began as a separate and distinct symbolic system of communication,
like painting, sculpture and oral storytelling, and only later
merged with spoken language.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the story, the Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia, the
lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now
southern Iraq, seemed to understand writing's transforming
function. As Dr. Holly Pittman, the Pennsylvania art historian who
organized the symposium, observed, writing ``arose out of the need
to store information and transmit information outside of human
memory and over time and over space.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchanging interpretations and new information, the scholars
acknowledged that they still had no fully satisfying answers to the
most important questions of exactly how and why writing was
developed. Many of them favored a broad explanation of writing's
origins in the visual arts, pictograms of things being transformed
into increasingly abstract symbols for things, names and eventually
words in speech. Their views clashed with a widely held theory
among archeologists that writing grew out of the pieces of clay in
assorted sizes and shapes that Sumerian accountants had used as
tokens to keep track of livestock and stores of grain.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars at the meeting also conceded that they had no
definitive answer to the question of whether writing was invented
only once and spread elsewhere or arose independently several times
in several places, like Egypt, the Indus Valley, China and among
the Olmecs and Maya of Mexico and Central America. But they
criticized recent findings suggesting that writing might have
developed earlier in Egypt than in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Dr. Guenter Dreyer, director of the German
Archeological Institute in Egypt, announced new radiocarbon dates
for tombs at Abydos, on the Nile about 250 miles south of Cairo.
The dates indicated that some hieroglyphic inscriptions on pots,
bone and ivory in the tombs were made at least as early as 3200
B.C., possibly 3400. It was now an ``open question,'' Dreyer said,
whether writing appeared first in Egypt or Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   At the symposium, Dr. John Baines, an Oxford University
Egyptologist who had just visited Dreyer, expressed skepticism in
polite terms. ``I'm suspicious of the dates,'' he said in an
interview. ``I think he's being very bold in his readings of these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of archeological evidence has shown that the
urbanizing Sumerians were the first to develop writing, in 3200 or
3300 B.C. These are the dates for many clay tablets with a
proto-cuneiform script found at the site of the ancient city of
Uruk. The tablets bore pictorial symbols for the names of people,
places and things for governing and commerce. The Sumerian script
gradually evolved from the pictorial to the abstract, but it was
probably at least five centuries before the writing came to
represent recorded spoken language.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian hieroglyphics are so different from Sumerian cuneiform,
Baines said, that they were probably invented independently not
long after Sumerian writing. If anything, the Egyptians may have
gotten the idea of writing from the Sumerians, with whom they had
contacts in Syria, but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the writing idea became more widespread at the
beginning of the third millennium B.C. The Elamites of southern
Iran developed a proto-writing system then, perhaps influenced by
the proto-cuneiform of their Sumerian neighbors, and before the
millennium was out, writing appeared in the Indus River Valley of
what is now Pakistan and western India, then in Syria and Crete and
parts of Turkey. Writing in China dates back to the Shang period
toward the end of the second millennium B.C., and it dates to the
first millennium B.C. in Mesoamerica.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists have thought that the undeciphered Indus script,
which seemed to appear first around 2500, may have been inspired in
part from trade contacts with Mesopotamia. But new excavations in
the ruins of the ancient city of Harappa suggest an earlier and
presumably independent origin of Indus writing.
</P>
<P>
   In a report from the field, distributed on the Internet, Dr.
Jonathan Mark Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin and Dr.
Richard H. Meadow of Harvard University showed pictures of marks
incised on potshards that they interpreted as evidence for the use
of writing signs by Indus people as early as 3300 B.C. If these are
indeed proto-writing examples, the discovery indicates an
independent origin of Indus writing contemporary with the Sumerian
and Egyptian inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Meadow, using e-mail, the electronic age's version of the king
of Uruk's clay tablet, confirmed that the inscribed marks were
``similar in some respects to those later used in the Indus
script.'' The current excavations, he added, were uncovering ``very
significant findings at Harappa with respect to the Indus script.''
</P>
<P>
   At the symposium, though, Dr. Gregory Possehl, a Pennsylvania
archeologist who specializes in the Indus civilization and had
examined the pictures, cautioned against jumping to such
conclusions. One had to be careful, he said, not to confuse
potter's marks, graffiti and fingernail marks with symbols of
nascent writing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the earliest writing systems, scholars said, only the
Sumerian, Chinese and Mesoamerican ones seemed clearly to be
independent inventions. Reviewing the relationship between early
Chinese bronze art, ``oracle bones'' and writing, Dr. Louisa Huber,
a researcher at Harvard's Fairbanks Center for East Asian Research,
concluded, ``Chinese writing looks to be pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   But few pronouncements about early writing go undisputed. Dr.
Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language at Penn, offered
evidence indicating, he said, that ``the Chinese writing system may
well have received vital inputs from West Asian and European
systems of writing and proto-writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mair cited an intriguing correspondence between the Chinese
script and 22 Phoenician letters and also Western-like symbols on
pottery and the bodies of mummies found in the western desert of
China. The recent discoveries of the mummies, wearing garments of
Western weaves and having Caucasoid facial features, have prompted
theories of foreign influences on Chinese culture in the first and
second millennia B.C. It had already been established that the
chariot and bronze metallurgy reached China from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one seemed ready to endorse his thesis, Mair said,
``We simply do not know for certain whether the Chinese script was
or was not independently created.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Damerow, a specialist in Sumerian cuneiform at the Max
Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, said,
``Whatever the mutual influences of writing systems of different
cultures may be, their great variety shows, at least, that the
development of writing, once it is initiated, attains a
considerable degree of independence and flexibility to adapt a
coding system to specific characteristics of the language to be
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he accepted the conventional view that writing
necessarily started as some kind of representation of words by
pictures. New studies of Sumerian proto-cuneiform, he said,
challenge this intepretation. The structures of this earliest
writing, for example, did not match the syntax of a language.
Proto-cuneiform seemed severely restricted, compared with spoken
language, dealing mainly in lists and categories, not in sentences
and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   This presumably reflects writing's origins and first
applications in economic administration in a growing, increasingly
complex society, scholars said. Most of the Uruk tablets were
documents about property, inventory, and, even then, taxes. The
only texts that do not concern administrative activities, Damerow
said, were cuneiform lexicons that were apparently written as
school exercises by scribes in training.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two decades, in fact, Dr. Denise Schmandt-Besserat,
a University of Texas archeologist, has argued that the first
writing grew directly out of a counting system practiced by
Sumerian accountants. They used molded clay ``tokens,'' each one
specially shaped to represent a jar of oil, a large or small
container of grain, or a particular kind of livestock. When the
tokens were placed inside hollow clay spheres, the number and type
of tokens inside was recorded on the ball with impressions
resembling the tokens. Finally, simplifying matters, the token
impressions were replaced with inscribed signs, and writing was
invented.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dr. Schmandt-Besserat has won wide support, some
linguists question her thesis and other scholars, like Dr. Pittman
of Penn, think it too narrow an interpretation. They emphasized
that pictorial representation and writing evolved together, part of
the same cultural context that fostered experimentation in
communication through symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the token system is a forerunner of
writing, and really important,'' Dr. Pittman said in an interview.
``But I have an argument with her evidence for a link between
tokens and signs, and she doesn't open up the process to include
picture-making and all other kinds of information-storage practices
that are as important as the tokens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Schmandt-Besserat, who did not attend the symposium,
vigorously defended herself in a telephone interview. ``My
colleagues say the signs on seals were a beginning of writing, but
show me a single sign on a seal that becomes a sign in writing,''
she said. ``They say that designs on pottery were a beginning of
writing, but show me a single sign of writing you can trace back to
a pot _ it doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first 500 years, she asserted, cuneiform writing was used
almost solely for recording economic information. ``The first
information that writing gives you is only the same information the
tokens were dealing with,'' she said. ``When you start putting more
on the tablets, products plus the name of who has delivered and
received them, that is where art would enter the picture. Then
writing is out of the box, in all directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Damerow agreed that cuneiform writing appeared to have developed
in two stages, first as a new but limited means of recording
economic information, later as a broader encoding of spoken
language for stories, arguments, descriptions or messages from one
ruler to another.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it was a long way from the origin of writing to truly
literate societies. At the symposium, scholars noted that the early
rulers could not write or read; they relied on scribes for their
messages, record keeping and storytelling. In Egypt, most early
hieroglyphics were inscribed in places beyond the public eye, high
on monuments or deep in tombs.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, said Dr. Pascal Vernus of the University of Paris,
early writing was less administrative than sacred and ideological,
``a way of creating and describing the world as a dominating elite
wants it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Piotr Michalowski, professor of Near East civilizations at
the University of Michigan, said the Uruk proto-cuneiform writing,
whatever its antecedents, was ``so radically different as to be a
complete break with the past, a system different from anything
else.'' It no doubt served to store, preserve and communicate
information, but also was a new instrument of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it's because I grew up in Stalinist Poland,''
Michalowski said, ``but I say coercion and control were early
writing's first important purpose, a new way to control how people
live.''

TOO MANY DOLES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tell me again. Which Dole is running for the 2000
Republican presidential nomination?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole is visible far up in the political stratosphere these
days, exhorting President Clinton to hang tough in Kosovo even if
it means sending in U.S. ground troops. In op-ed opinion pieces and
interviews, he has been brazenly stealing his wife's political
thunder since the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole echoes her mate's hawkish attitude toward the
Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic and the refugee crisis he has
created. But her brief statement while campaigning in Arizona last
week got little national attention and added nothing fresh to the
public debate over the military and humanitarian issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the former senator's aggressive support of
NATO's interventionist role in Kosovo and his wife's limited,
cautious response does not help her presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest political problem has always been the difficulty of
convincing voters that this very feminine, perfectly coiffed
southern lady would make a tough commander-in-chief, capable of
protecting national security and American credibility abroad by
leading our troops into harm's way if need be.
</P>
<P>
   If the major issues in the coming presidential campaign are
domestic, Elizabeth Dole, a former Cabinet officer and head of the
American Red Cross, is in good shape. But if Kosovo and the guns of
war are still our central preoccupation next year, the female half
of the Dole partnership will be forced to raise her soft, honeyed
voice to new, stern decibel levels. It is doubtful she can do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should expand the targets to the Serbian
government's infrastructure,'' she said Friday at about the time
bombing raids on Belgrade and other new strategic targets were
ordered. ``What we're doing is the right course,'' she added, ``...
and no options should be taken off the table.'' The implication
that she would back ground troops hangs in the air, but
presidential candidates do not win elections in crowded primary
fields by being coy about where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, has the serious
credentials that she lacks in foreign policy. An honored World War
II veteran, he was President Clinton's choice to try to broker
peace in Yugoslavia before it became appallingly clear that
Milosevic was not interested in peace at all.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, in an ABC-TV interview, Bob Dole endorsed ground
troops in Kosovo as ``an option'' that ``if necessary, should be
exercised.'' Is it coincidence that Elizabeth Dole, known for
relying on carefully scripted comments, a few days later used the
same word, ``option,'' as her husband?
</P>
<P>
   It's a common word, but there are lots of appropriate
alternatives to it that other public figures have used. Does the
candidate think and speak for herself in foreign policy or not?
</P>
<P>
   When she speaks, why should anyone listen?
</P>
<P>
   Her presidential candidacy has the elements of ``buy one, get
two,'' which candidate Bill Clinton promised in 1992 while rashly
advertising Hillary Clinton's political skills. But he was mocked
for giving his wife a co-equal status that conservatives felt she
did not deserve since her name was not on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And if memory serves, voters were asked in 1996 to buy Bob Dole
directly and rejected that opportunity. A recycled role for him as
a White House auxiliary does not seem to be the stuff of great
popular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bob Dole's endorsement of Clinton's slowly building
determination to take down Milosevic, return the suffering Kosovar
Albanians to their homes and bring peace to Yugoslavia is
important, politically and historically. He is not the only
Republican bringing bipartisan support to this risky venture. But
he has the gravitas to make it easier for less courageous
politicians to reject isolationism and agree with the correctness
of a military policy being carried out by a president they
distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole is unequivocal about the folly of giving up and
abandoning the hundreds of thousands of refugees huddled by
Milosevic's brutality without water, food, sanitation, identity or
hope. He insists we must win the war and achieve all our political
and military objectives. Period.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, he says, ``we must introduce NATO ground forces
and arm Kosovar Albanian authorities. ... it is time to increase
the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole is right. But where is Elizabeth?

   The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned balloon ever to make a
non-stop trip around the earth, will be permanently housed at the
Air and Space Museum in Washington, its owners have announced.
</P>
<P>
   The big balloon, which completed its epochal flight on March 21,
has been offered a berth at the museum, taking its place with a
host of other famous aircraft, including the Voyager airplane,
which in 1986 completed the first unrefueled nonstop flight ever
made around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling was built in England, financed and registered in
Switzerland and piloted by Dr. Bertrand Piccard, who is Swiss, and
Brian Jones, who is British. The pilots completed their three-week
trip when they landed in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055
miles. No previous attempts came even close.
</P>
<P>
   Walton Ferrell, a spokesman for the Air and Space Museum, said
the balloon would arrive in Washington this autumn. ``The Breitling
Orbiter 3 will take its place with the Voyager aircraft and with
the Winnie May, the airplane in which Wiley Post made a series of
solo flights taking him completely around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For their feat, Piccard, a psychiatrist, and Jones, a ballooning
expert, will be awarded a cup and a $1 million prize from the
Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which will be donated to
charities.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling company, a maker of specialty watches, announced
that the balloon and its crew capsule would be exhibited in
Switzerland until mid-July at the Lucerne Transport Museum.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented
to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum. Parts of the
balloon envelope will be kept in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A Breitling spokesman said the entire balloon crew, including
the pilots and Alan Noble, the mission director, would arrive in
New York City Tuesday to begin a tour of the United States.

AN EYE-OPENER ON MEDIA IMAGES OF WOMEN

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Women as doctors. Women as lawyers. TV and movies
are doing a good job of depicting strong, accomplished women,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, according to Susan Isaacs. The best-selling author
of ``Compromising Positions'' and ``Almost Paradise'' has written
the very readable ``Brave Dames and Wimpettes'' for Ballantine's
Library of Contemporary Thought. The book examines, as its subtitle
states, ``What Women Are Really Doing on Page and Screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Ally McBeal. Please. Isaacs bluntly says, ``When Mary Tyler
Moore threw her hat in the air (at the opening of ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show''), she was saying, I love my life, I love my job ...
Ally McBeal, on the other hand, could be living in the Eisenhower
era and been forced to go to work. She's not all bad, but she's a
pain in the ass.''
</P>
<P>
   The short, paperback format of the Library of Contemporary
Thought allows well-known authors to write essays that are topical
and easily read in one sitting (or over a couple of evenings before
bed). Since the production schedule is short, Isaacs is able to
discuss such recent films as ``There's Something About Mary''
(``Cameron Diaz ... as an orthopedic surgeon who is never actually
seen in surgery _ but who is seen undressing before an open
window'') and ``Fargo'' (Isaacs calls Frances McDormand's Marge
Gunderson ``one of the finest women characters in film.'') You may
not agree with all her observations, but it's fun to read and
compare notes with Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for women in their 20s and 30s who think feminism is
dead, here's a way to expand your horizons in three easy steps:
</P>
<P>
   1. Vow not to buy Cosmopolitan magazine for the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
   2. Take the $8.85 you'll save, throw in a dime and buy a copy of
``Brave Dames.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Read book. &QL;

 &HT;    FAA READIES COMPUTER TEST FOR Y2K BUG
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High above Colorado this weekend, a government jet
will test whether the nation's air traffic control system has been
immunized against the computer ``millennium bug.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying for a year that we'll be ready,'' Ray Long,
who directs the Year 2000 program office for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Monday. ``This is our chance to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof will be sought Saturday afternoon when an FAA Lear
jet, with its onboard systems set to Dec. 31, 1999, will take off
from Grand Junction, Colo., fly on to Colorado Springs, and land at
Denver International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   All aviation systems are set to run on Greenwich Mean Time, the
time zone that includes London. So the simulated millennium will
arrive aboard the test plane at 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time,
seven hours behind Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-based tracking systems will monitor the government plane,
as well as all other commercial and military craft that will be
flying through the region at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the test is designed to see whether all
parts of the complex air traffic control system will monitor
aircraft transponders correctly when the new millennium begins.
Those devices feed the plane's location, speed, altitude and other
data into the FAA's computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, we'll be acquiring two sets of data,'' Long said.
``We'll then read the (real-time and simulated) results. They
should lie seamlessly on top of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer readouts will be compared at the FAA's technical
center in Atlantic City, N.J., with the results to be announced
April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Long said the Denver area was chosen for the test ``because it
includes every type of monitoring system in the FAA's arsenal,
which means these results could be replicated anywhere else in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the agency was stung by criticism from the
General Accounting Office, which told Congress that as many as a
third of the nation's airports would fail to meet the FAA's
self-imposed June 30 deadline for completing tests and computer bug
fixes.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO noted at the time that prior safety concerns appeared to
have been resolved. But it warned that computer failures in baggage
handling and other areas could trigger flight delays that could
ripple through the entire air travel system.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Y2K'' problem has arisen because some computers
are unable recognize the year 2000, leaving them prone to crash or
to spew out bad data.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has adopted a five-stage process for solving its own Y2K
problems: awareness, assessment, renovation, validation and,
finally, implementation, which is scheduled to be completed on June
30.
</P>
<P>
   Long said 370 of the FAA's 423 mission-critical computers were
already certified as fully Y2K-compliant. ``We have met or exceeded
every goal,'' he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Morgan Jr., who coordinates the FAA's Y2K work at
foreign airports, gave a more problematic report. ``It's too early
to know whether other countries will deal with the problem, he
said.
</P>

 &HT;    SEC BATTLES 'BULL MARKET IN INTERNET SECURITIES FRAUD'
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Securities and Exchange Commission is
``stretched pretty thin now,'' but is bent on leaving Internet
fraud artists ``naked, homeless, and without modem,'' (CQ) the
agency's chief enforcement officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker compared the SEC's effort to police the Internet
with its campaign against insider trading in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this challenge even tougher for us is that we do
not have available to us new or additional resources to do the job,
although some members of Congress have expressed interest in making
additional resources available,'' said Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hopeful we will get more staff,'' he added in an address
at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has about 2,800 employees, including 850 in the
enforcement division run by Walker. The agency's annual budget is
about $300 million, equal to about a fifth (CQ) of the revenue it
produces from filing fees, fines and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Walker listed enforcement actions the SEC has taken against what
he called ``a bull market in Internet securities fraud,'' and
promised more.
</P>
<P>
   One area is the offering of free stock on the Internet, in
return , say, for clicking on a specific Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``These giveaways are illegal more often than not,'' said
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The issue for the SEC is the question of whether the offering is
in effect a sale. The sale to the public of securities that have
not been registered with the SEC is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect to hear more on this topic from us very soon,''
he promised.
</P>
<P>
   Walker also said the SEC's crackdown on Internet securities
fraud will expand in the months ahead through unspecified efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Sen. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, plans to offer
legislation to help the SEC fight Internet fraud. One proposal
would let the SEC bar brokers and dealers who have been banned from
the business from moving on to stock promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ``this creates a path for corrupt brokers to continue
to deceive investors,'' said Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Another Collins proposal would allow the SEC to apply _
nationwide _ enforcement actions by state regulators. That's aimed
at securities law violators who simply move their operations after
a run-in with state regulators.

LEADS IN `CINDERELLA' FELL INTO EACH OTHER'S ARMS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Love at first sight? Well, not exactly. Call it
love at first sweaty embrace.
</P>
<P>
   It happened six or seven years ago, when Adam Cooper and his
equally well-buffed colleague, Sarah Wildor, were rehearsing a duet
for London's Royal Ballet Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite passionate, erotic dancing,'' says Cooper, mentally
restaging the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we sort of knew something was happening,'' Wildor
chimes in, ``because (that dance) is very _ what's the word?''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper considers for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No holds barred,'' he says finally. ``Well, not quite! But,
yeah, it was obvious to us there was chemistry there. And then
about a year or so after that we got together.''
</P>
<P>
   And they both lived happily ever after ... Isn't that how fairy
tales are supposed to finish?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this one is still being written, six or seven nights a
week, in theaters stretching from London to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest chapter, we find the happily smitten couple
co-starring in the North American premiere of Matthew Bourne's
``Cinderella,'' the newest piece of cheeky revisionism by the
mild-mannered enfant terrible of British ballet. The production,
which opens Wednesday at the Ahmanson Theatre, is the highly
anticipated follow-up to Bourne's much-admired, gender-scuttling
``Swan Lake,'' produced by his dance company, Adventures in Motion
Pictures, at the Ahmanson Theatre two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella'' is set in London during the Nazis' aerial blitz
of England _ the so-called Battle of Britain of 1940-41 _ when the
Royal Air Force fought Hitler's Luftwaffe for mastery of the skies.
Bourne's reimagining of the Cinderella story contrasts the drab
grimness of wartime with the escapist glitter of London's legendary
ballrooms, where couples danced defiantly to big-band music while
bombs blew England's capital into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   In Bourne's retelling, the glass-slippered heroine (Wildor)
becomes a mousy homebody who takes refuge from the war and her
dysfunctional family in the illusory glamour of London's night
life. Her Prince Charming (Cooper) has been re-envisioned as a
wounded Royal Air Force pilot with a touch of what might be called
delusional paranoia. Their ballroom scenes become a kind of
self-scripted Hollywood movie into which the two characters project
idealized versions of each other.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the time period, Bourne is using Prokofiev's
Stalinist-era ``Romeo and Juliet'' score, which is darker and not
so lusciously romantic as Tchaikovsky's better-known one. The cast
features veteran British ballerina Lynn Seymour, who also appeared
in ``Swan Lake,'' as Cinderella's alcohol-addled stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a shellshocked soldier is a far cry from Cooper's
previous incarnation as a bare-chested, sexually voracious bird of
prey in ``Swan Lake.'' In Los Angeles, Cooper's magnetically macho
performance caused female and some male viewers alike to melt in
their seats, and prompted a debate whether Bourne's ``Swan Lake''
was or wasn't intended as a homoerotic allegory.
</P>
<P>
   So which is the real Cooper _ the lean, dryly understated,
rather average-looking chap seated next to Wildor in an Ahmanson
interview room, or the predatory sexual animal of ``Swan Lake''?
</P>
<P>
   Only his fiancee seems to know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's all a bit silly, really,'' Cooper says modestly,
``because the character they see on stage is not me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, rubbish!'' Wildor breaks in. ``There's a big side of you
...''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, of course there is,'' Cooper backpedals, ``but that's not
what I'm really like. I never see myself as that sort of thing
anyway. So when people were saying all this, yeah, it's nice to
hear it, but if I start believing it ...''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, Wildor insists, is that Cooper is ``the nicest person
you could possibly meet,'' whereas she's the one with ``a filthy,
filthy mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shocking you, aren't I?'' she teases Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still shocking,'' he says, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, neither of these pleasant, approachable
27-year-olds, who share a house outside London, strikes the
attitude of a sex-symbol wanna-be. Cooper, stylishly unshaven and
easily given to laughter, is the chattier of the two. Wildor, a bit
more reserved, has a tough-minded, let's-cut-to-the-chase style
that belies her soft blond looks.
</P>
<P>
   Identically dressed in black jeans and pullovers, they seem like
ambitious, dedicated team players, graceful personifications of the
new Cool Britannia. And although they can get pretty gaga around
each other, they're hardly joined at the hip, as their overlapping
but somewhat divergent careers attest.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper left the Royal Ballet, where he and Wildor met, about two
years ago. Since then he's been broadening his range as a dancer
and actor outside the Royal Ballet's institutional confines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard (leaving the Royal Ballet) in a way because that's
all I'd known for the last eight years,'' he says. ``I was 16 when
I joined the school and 18 when I joined the company. And also
knowing that you've got a paycheck every week, that's hard coming
away from that, kind of coming out into the wide world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But perhaps in a way it was easy, because I knew I wasn't
progressing there like I wanted to. It's just (that) it's a big
place with a lot of dancers to please, (and) you can't please
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says he was inspired to take up dance by old Gene Kelly
and Fred Astaire movie musicals. Wildor also began her career very
young and quickly turned into a dance addict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, I think it was my parents saying, `We've got to
find something for Sarah to get her out of the house!''' she says.
``And that was it, and I was 3. And I was just hooked, just loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part, she adds, was that her parents, though always
supportive, ``really didn't have a clue'' about dance. She was thus
spared the travails of having vicariously involved adults
constantly looking over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Wildor says that being separated from Cooper professionally was
hard at first. It was as though he was ``leaving me behind in a
way, because we used to go to work together, we used to go home and
talk together, and touring was much easier because we were always
together.''
</P>
<P>
   While she still ``quite likes'' being at the Royal Ballet, she
believes that working on ``Cinderella'' has allowed her to stretch
her acting technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any sort of dancer or principal in the Royal company doesn't
tend to get that many shows of one particular role,'' she explains,
``so for me having this amount of shows is fantastic. You can
really get stuck in it and bring out different things (on)
different nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourne says that in ``Cinderella'' he cast both Cooper and
Wildor ``against type, slightly, because I thought it would be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he (the pilot) ends up as being quite an ordinary
guy,'' Bourne says. ``He's not the kind of hero she (Cinderella)
thinks he might be. And everyone expects (Cooper) to be this sort
of sex bomb, so that was quite interesting, to play with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Sarah is kind of not your average ballerina type, I would
say. She has great sort of acting skills, she moves in a very
individual way. And she brings a quality to it which is quite
unexpected in a way, because she really enjoyed going for sort of
the frumpy side of Cinderella, not just in looks but in her sort of
body language. She hunches over a bit. She's not a pretty kind of
waiflike thing, as most Cinderellas are. She's a little bit more of
an odd character.''
</P>
<P>
   While a Broadway run of ``Cinderella'' seems likely to follow
its L.A. engagement, as it did with ``Swan Lake,'' Bourne is glad
to be opening his new work here ahead of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're sort of among friends here, which is a nice
feeling,'' he says. ``And so I think that our relationship with
this theater and Los Angeles will be one that we'll sort of
continue and hopefully develop _ maybe even premiere a piece here,
do a world premiere at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, Bourne is working on a version of ``Carmen'' that he
describes as ``loosely based'' on Bizet's opera, along with a
revival of AMP's production of ``The Nutcracker.'' He's also
considering putting some of his existing work on film.
</P>
<P>
   All that activity should give Cooper and Wildor time to fly back
to Britain next summer and tie the knot, as Cooper puts it, with
``all the millions of people who want to get married in the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   A fairy-tale ending, you might say.

JEWISH WRY: A POWERFUL NEW VOICE WITH AN INDELIBLE SENSE
OF  TRAGEDY AND HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By DAVID WIEGAND  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathan Englander is not the next Isaac Bashevis Singer, although
you'll probably hear that he is in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that this young and talented New York-born resident of
Jerusalem revisits territory made familiar by Singer's work
(including Chelm, the legendary village of benign fools), but his
debut collection of nine unforgettable short stories, ``For the
Relief of Unbearable Urges,'' establishes Englander's voice as
unique.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Nathan Englander, and why is he making such a big splash
in the publishing world? Knopf has ordered a first printing of
30,000 copies of ``Unbearable Urges'' _ a very big debut for
someone who published only three stories in Story magazine before
his book was sold (a fourth, ``The Last One Way,'' appeared in the
New Yorker earlier this year).
</P>
<P>
   Englander grew up in New York an Orthodox Jew and is a graduate
of the Iowa Writers Workshop. Each of the stories in his first book
is rooted in Orthodox Judaism, but what gives them all an
irresistible universality is their celebration of individuality. In
different ways, the stories speak to the need to break with
traditions when those traditions stifle the essence of life. Even
when Englander pokes fun at the tenets of Orthodoxy, he does so
with a wise understanding that even the most restrictive traditions
are born of the eternal human need to reconcile the joys and
tragedies of life.
</P>
<P>
   Humor and anger are the most common responses to life's
frustrations in Englander's world, and at times, the responses of
his characters are funny and angry at the same time. In
``Reunion,'' for example, Marty has been tossed into a mental ward
after he staged a knock-down, drag-out fight in a synagogue in
which the Torah was knocked to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   For his sin, the entire congregation shares 40 days of fasting.
His gripe with the congregation is that he is consistently passed
over to give the blessing during services. His wife, Robin, is so
furious at his behavior, she hurls dishes at him: Englander alludes
to Kristallnacht by calling their final tiff ``the night of the
broken dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marty's real sin is that he embarrasses everyone by his
outsized life and sense of himself: That's why he's been
consistently overlooked for saying the blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Reb Yitzhak's angry outburst gets him fired as a
department-store Santa Claus in ``Reb Kringle.'' He feels guilty
about his annual job, a case of ironic typecasting, thanks to his
girth and his snowy beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sin, this job,'' he tells his wife. ``Not since the
time of Noah has the world seen such boundless greed.'' Still, he
suffers the indignities of playing Santa, including wet pant legs
and sciatica like ``broken glass running up and down the nerve in
the back of his thigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he's pushed over the edge when a boy asks for a menorah
because his new father insists on celebrating Christmas instead of
Hanukkah. Yitzhak goes ballistic. He knows that his tirade will get
him fired, but there are principles at stake. ``He grabbed the
pompom hanging down from his head and yanked off his hat, revealing
a large black yarmulke. `This ... is not a fit job for a Jew.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even the saddest tale in Englander's collection, ``The
Twenty-Seventh Man,'' is laced with bleak humor. The story takes
place during the darkest hours of Stalin's reign, when the dictator
orders that 26 Jewish writers be rounded up, taken to a prison and
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Their ``crime'' was that, as Jews, they could never be entirely
loyal to the Soviet state. By a bureaucratic error, however, a 27th
man is added to the list, a man who is both completely anonymous
and the most prolific writer of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Pinchas Pelovits, through his unpublished writing, ``had
constructed his own world with a compassionate God and a diverse
group of worshipers. In it, he tested these people with moral
dilemmas and tragedies _ testing them sometimes more with joy and
good fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The other writers _ variously drunk, wasteful of their talent,
sucking up to the state with terrible poetry or hiding their Jewish
heritage behind false names _ are nothing compared to this foolish
boy.
</P>
<P>
   The writers are tossed into a cell and tortured. Fretting over
their fate and puffed up with self-importance, the other writers
squabble, while Pinchas alone keeps writing his fable:
</P>
<P>
   ``The morning that Mendel Muskatev awoke to find his desk was
gone, his room was gone, and the sun was gone, he assumed he had
died. This worried him, so he said a prayer for the dead, keeping
himself in mind. Then he wondered if one was allowed to do such a
thing, and worried instead that the first thing he had done upon
being dead was sin.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the writers will die, but only one will die a great man,
the one among them who will be instantly and forever forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The title story in the collection pits most directly the ancient
Jewish traditions and laws against modern life. Dov Binyamin is a
Hasidic Jew in Israel married to a woman who will not sleep with
him, reputedly because of the longest menstrual period known to any
woman on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The more he begs for her attention, the more she ignores him. He
goes to a rabbi, who gives him a dispensation to visit a prostitute
``for the relief of unbearable urges.'' ``I suffer greatly under
the urges with which I have been blessed,'' he tells the rabbi. Dov
Binyamin goes to Tel Aviv, ``the city of sin,'' and meets Devorah,
who is so filled with life that it frightens him.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining that it is a sin to spill seed in vain, he doesn't
use a condom. Back home, his newfound indifference to his wife
makes her want to sleep with him again. Happy ending in store? Not
quite: Careless about what he's been wishing for, Dov Binyamin now
has a venereal disease to boot, thanks to his adherence to Jewish
law. ``This couldn't possibly be the solution the Rebbe intended,''
Dov Binyamin thinks, as a different kind of fire burns in his
loins.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Jewish humor are planted deep in an enduring sense
of tragedy. Great Jewish comics as well as great Jewish writers
have understood the fundamental irony of life, that its gift comes
with strings, not the least of which is that eventually everything
we care about, including our own lives, will be taken away from us.
</P>
<P>
   Writers like Singer, Malamud and others have shared a common
theme: For all of its pain, life is pretty absurd when you think
about it. But a sense of the ridiculousness of life's fundamental
tragedy is not the sole purview of Jewish writers, which is why the
greatest of them have been able to tap into universal recognition
among readers of every description.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Englander evokes Singer, but he also calls to mind the
tragicomedies of absurdist dramatists Samuel Beckett and Eugene
Ionesco _ whose plays, not coincidentally, were brought famously to
life by two of America's greatest Jewish comic actors, Bert Lahr
(``Waiting for Godot'') and Zero Mostel (``Rhinoceros''). To
paraphrase that old Levy's Jewish Rye ad campaign, you don't have
to be Jewish to enjoy, laugh at and weep over Nathan Englander's
stories. You just have to appreciate extraordinary, insightful
writing. Englander's is a fresh, awe-inspiring voice that speaks
with a timeless understanding that life's tragic joke is on all of
us.

10-CENT GAS HIKE_WE'VE LIVED TO SEE THE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today would've been my father's 89th birthday, and he probably
would have felt that he lived too long if he'd gone down to the
corner gas station and watched them jack the price up 10 cents a
gallon in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dad said that gas cost not much more than 20 cents a gallon when
he first started driving.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was an old Ford with the doors ripped off to
make it look sporty, and some kitchen chairs nailed down for a back
seat. That used Ford cost him about a month's pay, he used to say.
</P>
<P>
   No way could he afford a new car then, much less today, when a
new vehicle averages more than $20,000, or about six months salary
for the average American. And while we struggle to make car
payments and get to the gas station before the price bumps another
10 cents, BP Amoco Plc cuts a deal to buy Atlantic Richfield Co.
for more than $31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When my twin sister and I were born just before World War II,
Dad had to sell the family car. And we couldn't afford another
until Dad bought a used 1951 Plymouth Cranbrook sedan in 1956. I
was allowed to drive it into the driveway for washing and waxing
... something I've not exactly overdone anytime since.
</P>
<P>
   Animals and people don't much like change, especially the
overnight kind. It comes so fast these days that we simply try to
swim out from under the avalanche. And if we think we've seen
change, those of my father's generation must be excused for
occasionally retreating to the so-called good ol' days.
</P>
<P>
   When my father was born _ at home, of course _ Japan had just
annexed Korea; Montenegro had declared independence from the
Ottoman Empire; Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner and Cy Young were national
heroes, and more than 70 percent of our bread was homemade.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Dad was 16, he was encouraged to leave high school
and join the peace-time Navy. In 1926, change was beginning to
accelerate: that year saw the introduction of everything from
Scotch tape to Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Valentino and Harold Houdini died; Joe Stalin ousted
Leon Trotsky; Gene Tunney beat Jack Dempsey, and Babe Ruth hit
three World Series home runs. A Michigan company advertised all the
materials needed to build a five-room house for $487. And Al
Capone's guys were selling bootleg beer for $30 a case.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether Dad ever felt he had been able to swim out
of the avalanche of change. As a high school drop-out, he worked at
everything from commercial photography to bar-tending. He drove a
tanker truck and operated a punch press. He was a traveling
salesman, tavern owner and sheet metal mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his lifetime is like doing an environmental impact
statement to scatter his ashes on Lake Michigan. He didn't impact
his environment much more than the mass of working men who lead
lives of quiet desperation. But if he knew many moments of
desperation, Dad certainly didn't go quietly into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   My father knew thousands of song lyrics _ even if he couldn't
sing well _ and lots of jokes. ``I gotta million of 'em!'' was his
borrowed Jimmy Durante line. This made him a helluva bartender. He
might have lived and died as a tavern keeper, but something called
the Outfit bought out his round-the-clock tavern in Cicero, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Dad knew the importance of tipping in the service industry and
almost always left a hefty gratuity. But he taught me that it
worked both ways, and a penny tip said more than words about bad
service. Dad also would get up from a table or counter and leave a
restaurant if it was apparent that his order was languishing under
a heat lamp.
</P>
<P>
   He could barely tip-toe to 6 feet, but Dad was built like a
barrel and no one, of any size, got in his face without getting
into trouble. Except a woman, of course, because Dad was Old School
polite to the point of charming. Open the door for 'em; give 'em
your seat on the streetcar; take off your hat in the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Dad also came with the kind of built-in prejudices you'd expect
in a lower middle-class, blue-collar culture. When my older sister
announced that she was having a party, and told Dad that ``there
will be some black people,'' he didn't say a word. But on the night
of the party in our cleaned-up basement, Dad left and didn't return
until long after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's street language was as rough as you could hear in any bar
or back street, but God help the child who might repeat any of it
within earshot of either parent. We learned early the taste of
Fels-Naptha brown laundry soap.
</P>
<P>
   Dad was the reasonably quiet father who came home, ate supper
and seemed to pay only cursory attention to family talk of school,
church or whatever. He worked weekends in good weather to earn that
little bit of extra money for luxuries ... like a television set.
</P>
<P>
   He drank heavily, until he got adult-onset diabetes, but I never
saw him drunk. Dad also smoked heavily, and that eventually killed
him.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad, of course. But if he'd lived to see gas go
up 10 cents in one pop, that might've made him feel he'd already
lived too long.

 &HT;    Just the FAQs, ma'am
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new twist on an old technology is being used to
create human-like guides to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Neuromedia in San Francisco, and, to a lesser
degree, Big Science in Roswell, are developing chatterbots. These
are programs fueled by artificial intelligence software, which has
been around since the 1970s but never found a practical use. It
might have one now.
</P>
<P>
   Big Science's Tom Rearick and Neuromedia's Walter Tackett are
trying to sell the chatterbots as customer service representatives
for Web sites, answering FAQs, or frequently asked questions. But
these representatives aren't flesh and blood, they're extra-smart
computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Neuromedia is one of the few companies that have a ``virtual
representative'' in commercial use. Tackett, chief executive
officer and chairman, said Oracle, Charles Schwab and
DaimlerChrysler have Neuromedia chatterbots in use or in
development.
</P>
<P>
   Rearick believes conversational software robots, or bots, will
be increasingly used on sales Web sites to greet customers and
answer questions. Bots can have a human face and serve to
personalize the impersonal _ a blend of the Wal-Mart greeter,
customer service desk and search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Rearick is not convinced the delivery of text, sound and video
will be the Internet's forte. Right now, the Internet is an
``awkward telephone,'' a ``flickering, postage-stamp-sized
television,'' a ``scratchy radio,'' and a ``50-pound, tethered
newspaper,'' he said. Rearick thinks the Internet's true edge will
be its ability to connect _ and the bots are a tool to make that
connection easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If new technology is supposed to be orders of magnitude better
than the technology it replaces, then what is the Internet good
at?'' he said. ``It's not a good substitute for any of the things I
mentioned. But it is incredible at making a connection between one
individual and a remote computer. But computers are hard to
understand. So why not teach computers humanese instead of teaching
humans computerese?''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``bot'' is short for robot. A bot is a software program
designed to sift data. An easy way to understand Rearick's use of a
bot is to think of it as a really specific search engine. Say
you're shopping at a bookseller's Web site, have managed to find
your book and want to buy it. As a first-time customer, you more
than likely will be asked to fill out a page or two of forms and
enter a major credit card number, all of which must happen before
you find out what it will cost to ship your book to you. As Rearick
sees it, the bot would be an icon on the screen that a customer
could activate and type in a question asking how much shipping
would cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of all stores are less than three clicks away,
but the Web sites have tens of thousands of pages that raise lots
of questions to a novice user,'' Rearick said. ``And portals are
adding features. There is no way to add links and not increase the
complexity without having a detrimental effect. There is no way to
organize it all. But what if you had your own personal guide? It
would provide answers that otherwise could be an obstacle to a
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Rearick also sees the bots being used as errand runners. Someone
going on a vacation could ask their bot to search the Web for the
right clothes, a map, plane tickets and a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind bots is not there yet. For now, the bots
respond to questions on specific topics. Computer experts call that
limited domain, and it means the bots are programmed to be
conversant on one topic, such as a company's inventory, but shaky
on most everything else.
</P>
<P>
   But if bots fulfill the promise Rearick thinks they hold, it
will be, in part, because of the work of people like Robby Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Garner develops artificial intelligence software as a hobby.
From his basement office on a residential street in Cedartown, a
small town in northwest Georgia, Garner has won an international
artificial intelligence award for two straight years.
</P>
<P>
   The Loebner Prize is based on the premise that one day software
will simulate human thought. The concept of artificial intelligence
was first theorized by Alan Turing. In 1950, Turing published a
paper titled, ``Can Machines Think?'' The Loebner contest was
started in 1991 to answer the question. Garner's software has come
the closest the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of chatterbots is maybe in its infancy,''
Garner said. ``I just don't feel like the technology is really
there to be especially useful. The conversations they're capable of
are more geared toward information, virtual sales reps that can
talk about a product. We still don't have a computer you can just
tell things to. That's really the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's easier to just click on a FAQ selection
and see your answer. The advantage, if the system really worked, it
would be sort of like a search engine: Pose a question and get a
response. But the technology isn't quite there yet.''

tell things to. That's really the ultimate goal.

   ``At this point, it's easier to just click on a FAQ selection
and see your answer. The advantage, if the system really worked, it
would be sort of like a search engine: Pose a question and get a
response. But the technology isn't quite there yet.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Love at first sight? Well, not exactly. Call it
love at first sweaty embrace.
</P>
<P>
   It happened six or seven years ago, when Adam Cooper and his
equally well-buffed colleague, Sarah Wildor, were rehearsing a duet
for London's Royal Ballet Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite passionate, erotic dancing,'' says Cooper, mentally
restaging the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we sort of knew something was happening,'' Wildor
chimes in, ``because (that dance) is very _ what's the word?''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper considers for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No holds barred,'' he says finally. ``Well, not quite! But,
yeah, it was obvious to us there was chemistry there. And then
about a year or so after that we got together.''
</P>
<P>
   And they both lived happily ever after ... Isn't that how fairy
tales are supposed to finish?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this one is still being written, six or seven nights a
week, in theaters stretching from London to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest chapter, we find the happily smitten couple
co-starring in the North American premiere of Matthew Bourne's
``Cinderella,'' the newest piece of cheeky revisionism by the
mild-mannered enfant terrible of British ballet. The production,
which opens Wednesday at the Ahmanson Theatre, is the highly
anticipated follow-up to Bourne's much-admired, gender-scuttling
``Swan Lake,'' produced by his dance company, Adventures in Motion
Pictures, at the Ahmanson two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella'' is set in London during the Nazis' aerial blitz
of England _ the so-called Battle of Britain of 1940-41 _ when the
Royal Air Force fought Hitler's Luftwaffe for mastery of the skies.
Bourne's reimagining of the Cinderella story contrasts the drab
grimness of wartime with the escapist glitter of London's legendary
ballrooms, where couples danced defiantly to big-band music while
bombs blew England's capital into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   In Bourne's retelling, the glass-slippered heroine (Wildor)
becomes a mousy homebody who takes refuge from the war and her
dysfunctional family in the illusory glamour of London's night
life. Her Prince Charming (Cooper) has been re-envisioned as a
wounded Royal Air Force pilot with a touch of what might be called
delusional paranoia. Their ballroom scenes become a kind of
self-scripted Hollywood movie into which the two characters project
idealized versions of each other.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the time period, Bourne is using Prokofiev's
Stalinist-era ``Romeo and Juliet'' score, which is darker and not
so lusciously romantic as Tchaikovsky's better-known one. The cast
features veteran British ballerina Lynn Seymour, who also appeared
in ``Swan Lake,'' as Cinderella's alcohol-addled stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a shellshocked soldier is a far cry from Cooper's
previous incarnation as a bare-chested, sexually voracious bird of
prey in ``Swan Lake.'' In Los Angeles, Cooper's magnetically macho
performance caused female and some male viewers alike to melt in
their seats, and prompted a debate whether Bourne's ``Swan Lake''
was or wasn't intended as a homoerotic allegory.
</P>
<P>
   So which is the real Cooper _ the lean, dryly understated,
rather average-looking chap seated next to Wildor in an Ahmanson
interview room, or the predatory sexual animal of ``Swan Lake''?
</P>
<P>
   Only his fiancee seems to know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's all a bit silly, really,'' Cooper says modestly,
``because the character they see on stage is not me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, rubbish!'' Wildor breaks in. ``There's a big side of you
...''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, of course there is,'' Cooper backpedals, ``but that's not
what I'm really like. I never see myself as that sort of thing
anyway. So when people were saying all this, yeah, it's nice to
hear it, but if I start believing it ...''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, Wildor insists, is that Cooper is ``the nicest person
you could possibly meet,'' whereas she's the one with ``a filthy,
filthy mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shocking you, aren't I?'' she teases Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still shocking,'' he says, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, neither of these pleasant, approachable
27-year-olds, who share a house outside London, strikes the
attitude of a sex-symbol wanna-be. Cooper, stylishly unshaven and
easily given to laughter, is the chattier of the two. Wildor, a bit
more reserved, has a tough-minded, let's-cut-to-the-chase style
that belies her soft blond looks.
</P>
<P>
   Identically dressed in black jeans and pullovers, they seem like
ambitious, dedicated team players, graceful personifications of the
new Cool Britannia. And although they can get pretty gaga around
each other, they're hardly joined at the hip, as their overlapping
but somewhat divergent careers attest.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper left the Royal Ballet, where he and Wildor met, about two
years ago. Since then he's been broadening his range as a dancer
and actor outside the Royal Ballet's institutional confines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard (leaving the Royal Ballet) in a way because that's
all I'd known for the last eight years,'' he says. ``I was 16 when
I joined the school and 18 when I joined the company. And also
knowing that you've got a paycheck every week, that's hard coming
away from that, kind of coming out into the wide world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But perhaps in a way it was easy, because I knew I wasn't
progressing there like I wanted to. It's just (that) it's a big
place with a lot of dancers to please, (and) you can't please
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says he was inspired to take up dance by old Gene Kelly
and Fred Astaire movie musicals. Wildor also began her career very
young and quickly turned into a dance addict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, I think it was my parents saying, `We've got to
find something for Sarah to get her out of the house!''' she says.
``And that was it, and I was 3. And I was just hooked, just loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part, she adds, was that her parents, though always
supportive, ``really didn't have a clue'' about dance. She was thus
spared the travails of having vicariously involved adults
constantly looking over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Wildor says that being separated from Cooper professionally was
hard at first. It was as though he was ``leaving me behind in a
way, because we used to go to work together, we used to go home and
talk together, and touring was much easier because we were always
together.''
</P>
<P>
   While she still ``quite likes'' being at the Royal Ballet, she
believes that working on ``Cinderella'' has allowed her to stretch
her acting technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any sort of dancer or principal in the Royal company doesn't
tend to get that many shows of one particular role,'' she explains,
``so for me having this amount of shows is fantastic. You can
really get stuck in it and bring out different things (on)
different nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourne says that in ``Cinderella'' he cast both Cooper and
Wildor ``against type, slightly, because I thought it would be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he (the pilot) ends up as being quite an ordinary
guy,'' Bourne says. ``He's not the kind of hero she (Cinderella)
thinks he might be. And everyone expects (Cooper) to be this sort
of sex bomb, so that was quite interesting, to play with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Sarah is kind of not your average ballerina type, I would
say. She has great sort of acting skills, she moves in a very
individual way. And she brings a quality to it which is quite
unexpected in a way, because she really enjoyed going for sort of
the frumpy side of Cinderella, not just in looks but in her sort of
body language. She hunches over a bit. She's not a pretty kind of
waiflike thing, as most Cinderellas are. She's a little bit more of
an odd character.''
</P>
<P>
   While a Broadway run of ``Cinderella'' seems likely to follow
its L.A. engagement, as it did with ``Swan Lake,'' Bourne is glad
to be opening his new work here ahead of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're sort of among friends here, which is a nice
feeling,'' he says. ``And so I think that our relationship with
this theater and Los Angeles will be one that we'll sort of
continue and hopefully develop _ maybe even premiere a piece here,
do a world premiere at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, Bourne is working on a version of ``Carmen'' that he
describes as ``loosely based'' on Bizet's opera, along with a
revival of AMP's production of ``The Nutcracker.'' He's also
considering putting some of his existing work on film.
</P>
<P>
   All that activity should give Cooper and Wildor time to fly back
to Britain next summer and tie the knot, as Cooper puts it, with
``all the millions of people who want to get married in the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   A fairy-tale ending, you might say.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning more and more about that Slobodan Milosevic --
bad guy, butcher of the Balkans...Listen to how bad this guy was:
10 years ago, he was a summer intern for Dr. Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't get things straightened out in the Balkans
pretty soon, President Clinton may have to do something he's never
done before -- he may have to use a sex scandal to cover up a
war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, one of our stealth fighters was shot down,
and...down at the White House, they had to wake up President
Clinton to tell him about the fighter being shot down. He was
beside himself -- well, actually, he was beside an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is now being criticized because he does not have an
exit strategy in Kosovo...The only thing this guy has an exit
strategy about is how to get out of his pants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing in Yugoslavia, what a mess that is. Everyone's
upset about it. Russian President Boris Yeltsin is upset. He was
very upset about Yugoslavia earlier today. He was so upset, he
could barely drink his lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also reports now that the Iraqis are giving military
advice to the Yugoslavians. They're teaching them how to surrender
in English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now saying that this war in Yugoslavia could be
President Clinton's Vietnam. And I'm thinking, well, hell, this
doesn't make any sense. Vietnam was not President Clinton's
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing in Yugoslavia is getting out of hand. It looks like
it's just getting worse, just getting uglier. President Clinton now
is preparing for all-out war. Earlier today, he told all of the
interns to take cover under his desk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you have done your taxes already? They've added
something new on the 1040 Form this year. There's a box on the 1040
Form this year, and you can check that box if you would like the
president to have sex with an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, Dan Rather, on 60 Minutes II,' interviewed
President Bill Clinton. President Clinton said he did not consider
the impeachment to be a badge of shame. He said the real badge of
shame was striking out with Kathleen Willey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's April Fools' Day and President Clinton today played his
favorite April Fools' prank, you know, the one where he has sex
with an intern and then lies about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like our old friend Amy Fisher will be getting out of
prison in the next couple of months. Well, that'll hold us over
until the next impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, the Baltimore Orioles went down to Havana
and they played the Cuban national team, the first time a Major
League team has played baseball in Cuba. They defeated the Cuban
team 3-to-2. Big, big day -- in addition to that, it was also Karl
Marx seat cushion day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual New York City Auto Show opens on Saturday. It will
run ten days -- or until all the cars have been stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you folks ride the New York subway system? Here's
something that makes absolutely no sense to me: conductors on New
York subway trains have been ordered to stop using the word please'
in their announcements to save time. However, subway riders will
still be allowed to say the word please' -- as in, Please don't
kill me!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Subway conductors will be allowed to say thank you.' They can
still say thank you' -- as in,
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for not urinating.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they have a brand-new service on the Internet where you
can take a virtual New York City cab ride on your computer...You
log on at, I believe, www.what'sthatfunnysmell.com''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a program reminder for you, big holiday special over on
ABC tonight: A Monica Lewinsky Seder.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to change your clocks and go to Daylight Savings'
Time at about 2:00 AM Sunday morning...March is a bad, bad month.
We've had a tough run here because you lose an hour this weekend,
plus the four hours we lost watching the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a program reminder: Sunday night on ABC -- ``The Ten
Commandments''...Historically, the Ten Commandments were carved on
two stone tablets. Now you can get them in easy to take gelcaps.''

there was simply no chance she was gonna get her own sitcom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our good friend Cindy Crawford says she lost five pounds in
the first three months of her pregnancy because she got morning
sickness and she kept throwing up. Course, when you're a supermodel
with morning sickness, you're throwing up for two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big news from the campaign trail. While campaigning in New

I think he unbuttons it for a second.''
</P>

   They usually meet for lunch on Tuesdays at a McDonald's in

seen service in World War II or in Korea. When I overheard them,
they were discussing their mutual bond: membership in a citywide
drum corps that flourished in their youth. The name of their
current group is Romeos. Romantic? Not really. It stands for

   A middle-aged man was sitting near the back door of a Madison
Avenue bus, carrying on an interminable and very audible
conversation on his cell phone. Head-shaking and angry looks from
fellow passengers failed to stem the flow.
</P>
<P>
   A woman sitting near the front who had been listening with
increasing irritation made her way to the back door, preparing to
leave at the next stop. Almost simultaneously, the man concluded
his conversation with ``I'll call you again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman moved directly in front of him. ``I hope when you make
your call tomorrow you are not on a bus,'' she said. The
passengers' applause was ringing in her ears as she made her exit.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Central Park West, during a sudden penetrating snow
shower.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Young woman in sneakers, hair dripping; older woman,
drenched, emerging from the park with four golden retrievers,
equally soaked and bedraggled, and Ursula Karelsen, who overheard
this exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``Wow, are they all yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Older woman: ``No, lady, I'm all theirs.''

   If you lived in Brooklyn about 40 years ago, there was only one
place to buy dessert. That was Ebinger's, a chain of bakeshops that
dotted the borough. It didn't matter when you went, it was crowded.
Ebinger's was famous for its blackout cakes, which were made with
pure butter, high-quality chocolate, real eggs and all the best
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   It was my routine to pick up a blackout cake for my
mother-in-law on most weekends. One of my friends had been looking
into franchising businesses and he asked me to inquire the next
time I went to Ebinger's whether they were franchised.
</P>
<P>
   When my mother-in-law was due for her treat, I headed over to
Ebinger's in Park Slope, packed as usual with customers being
served by the little gray-haired ladies who worked behind the
counter. I ordered my cake, and while the clerk was wrapping it, I
asked her if she knew if Ebinger's was franchised. She looked
around the store, leaned over the counter and confided, ``No, I
think they're Jewish.''

   Joan Cleveland was walking along Third Avenue recently when she
encountered a father trying to keep up with his son, who appeared
to be about 4. The little boy was darting about, and his father was
becoming increasingly exasperated. Finally, he called to the child,
``Ben, if this doesn't stop, there will be no escargots for
dinner!''
</P>
<P>
   A man who prefers to remain anonymous arrived at his apartment
after a busy day at work. He was greeted by one of the doormen, an
amiable fellow with a limited command of English.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you?'' the doorman asked. The man, his mind on other
things, replied absent-mindedly, ``You're welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked away, he realized his gaffe. He could imagine what
was going on in the doorman's mind: ``Just when I thought I was
beginning to understand this crazy language ...''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Hollenberg was on 14th Street when he noticed a large
disheveled man seated on the steps of an apartment building and
holding out a paper cup in which a number of coins had apparently
been deposited. A smaller, equally disheveled man approached and
asked for a share. ``You don't understand,'' the seated man boomed.
``This is not about you, it's about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Ackerman was at the 92nd Street Y waiting to hear Mary
Tyler Moore being interviewed by Joy Behar. She took out her
newspaper and opened it to the obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   The woman next to her asked if she could borrow part of the
paper and Ms. Ackerman gave her the entertainment section. The
woman thanked her and then glanced over to see what she was
reading. ``Do you always read the obits?'' she asked. Ms. Ackerman
replied that it was usually the first thing she looked at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you in real estate?'' the woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   My friend and I secured a less than prime spot for the St.
Patrick's Day parade on 53rd Street around the corner from Fifth
Avenue. We watched and listened as three extremely patient police
officers redirected countless people who were trying to cross the
avenue. Many of these people insisted they had to cross there _
their offices were directly across, they would be late, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The officers politely stood their ground and let no one cross.
An enterprising young woman, after being rebuffed, approached the
first vehicle waiting to cross Fifth, a sports utility vehicle
occupied by a man and a woman. She knocked on the window, spoke to
the driver, opened the rear door and jumped in. When the traffic
was waved on, the vehicle moved forward. She happily jumped out on
the opposite corner, having outsmarted three of New York's finest.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning more and more about that Slobodan Milosevic --
bad guy, butcher of the Balkans...Listen to how bad this guy was:
10 years ago, he was a summer intern for Dr. Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't get things straightened out in the Balkans
pretty soon, President Clinton may have to do something he's never
done before -- he may have to use a sex scandal to cover up a
war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, one of our stealth fighters was shot down,
and...down at the White House, they had to wake up President
Clinton to tell him about the fighter being shot down. He was
beside himself -- well, actually, he was beside an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is now being criticized because he does not have an
exit strategy in Kosovo...The only thing this guy has an exit
strategy about is how to get out of his pants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing in Yugoslavia, what a mess that is. Everyone's
upset about it. Russian President Boris Yeltsin is upset. He was
very upset about Yugoslavia earlier today. He was so upset, he
could barely drink his lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also reports now that the Iraqis are giving military
advice to the Yugoslavians. They're teaching them how to surrender
in English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now saying that this war in Yugoslavia could be
President Clinton's Vietnam. And I'm thinking, well, hell, this
doesn't make any sense. Vietnam was not President Clinton's
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing in Yugoslavia is getting out of hand. It looks like
it's just getting worse, just getting uglier. President Clinton now
is preparing for all-out war. Earlier today, he told all of the
interns to take cover under his desk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you have done your taxes already? They've added
something new on the 1040 Form this year. There's a box on the 1040
Form this year, and you can check that box if you would like the
president to have sex with an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, Dan Rather, on 60 Minutes II,' interviewed
President Bill Clinton. President Clinton said he did not consider
the impeachment to be a badge of shame. He said the real badge of
shame was striking out with Kathleen Willey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's April Fools' Day and President Clinton today played his
favorite April Fools' prank, you know, the one where he has sex
with an intern and then lies about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like our old friend Amy Fisher will be getting out of
prison in the next couple of months. Well, that'll hold us over
until the next impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, the Baltimore Orioles went down to Havana
and they played the Cuban national team, the first time a Major
League team has played baseball in Cuba. They defeated the Cuban
team 3-to-2. Big, big day -- in addition to that, it was also Karl
Marx seat cushion day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual New York City Auto Show opens on Saturday. It will
run ten days -- or until all the cars have been stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you folks ride the New York subway system? Here's
something that makes absolutely no sense to me: conductors on New
York subway trains have been ordered to stop using the word please'
in their announcements to save time. However, subway riders will
still be allowed to say the word please' -- as in, Please don't
kill me!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Subway conductors will be allowed to say thank you.' They can
still say thank you' -- as in,
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for not urinating.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they have a brand-new service on the Internet where you
can take a virtual New York City cab ride on your computer...You
log on at, I believe, www.what'sthatfunnysmell.com''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a program reminder for you, big holiday special over on
ABC tonight: A Monica Lewinsky Seder.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to change your clocks and go to Daylight Savings'
Time at about 2:00 AM Sunday morning...March is a bad, bad month.
We've had a tough run here because you lose an hour this weekend,
plus the four hours we lost watching the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a program reminder: Sunday night on ABC -- ``The Ten
Commandments''...Historically, the Ten Commandments were carved on
two stone tablets. Now you can get them in easy to take gelcaps.''

there was simply no chance she was gonna get her own sitcom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our good friend Cindy Crawford says she lost five pounds in
the first three months of her pregnancy because she got morning
sickness and she kept throwing up. Course, when you're a supermodel
with morning sickness, you're throwing up for two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big news from the campaign trail. While campaigning in New
Hampshire yesterday, Al Gore took off his suit jacket and tie. This
was a shock to his wife Tipper. He doesn't even do that during sex.
I think he unbuttons it for a second.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie ``The Mod Squad'' opened over the weekend. About an
African American man, a rich kid, and a woman, who come together as
police officers to fight crime. I understand Dennis Rodman was up
for all three parts.''
</P>
<P>

Moss.''

<P>

   Yesterday, Vice President Al Gore's staff threw him a surprise
birthday party. Apparently he was so moved he almost moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is thinking about allowing teams to sell

frequently scratched.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists say that the other day Dolly the Cloned Sheep gave

</P>
<P>
   ``The producers of `Live with Regis and Kathie Lee' announced
they are holding a Mother's Day contest to find the best mom in the
country. The winner will appear on the show where she'll be beaten
in a jealous rage by Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A group called American Atheists Incorporated announced they
are relocating their national headquarters to New Jersey. A
spokesman for the atheists said, `We feel the best way to prove
that God doesn't exist is to have people visit Newark.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luciano Pavarotti is performing in Las Vegas next week and he
admitted he always loses thousands of dollars at the gambling
tables. Luckily, he makes it back at the all-you-can-eat buffet.''

<P>
   They usually meet for lunch on Tuesdays at a McDonald's in
Forest Hills, Queens. A happy bunch, they are retirees who have
seen service in World War II or in Korea. When I overheard them,
they were discussing their mutual bond: membership in a citywide
drum corps that flourished in their youth. The name of their
current group is Romeos. Romantic? Not really. It stands for
Retired Old Men Eating Out.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning more and more about that Slobodan Milosevic --
bad guy, butcher of the Balkans...Listen to how bad this guy was:
10 years ago, he was a summer intern for Dr. Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't get things straightened out in the Balkans
pretty soon, President Clinton may have to do something he's never
done before -- he may have to use a sex scandal to cover up a
war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, one of our stealth fighters was shot down,
and...down at the White House, they had to wake up President
Clinton to tell him about the fighter being shot down. He was
beside himself -- well, actually, he was beside an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is now being criticized because he does not have an
exit strategy in Kosovo...The only thing this guy has an exit
strategy about is how to get out of his pants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing in Yugoslavia, what a mess that is. Everyone's
upset about it. Russian President Boris Yeltsin is upset. He was
very upset about Yugoslavia earlier today. He was so upset, he
could barely drink his lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also reports now that the Iraqis are giving military
advice to the Yugoslavians. They're teaching them how to surrender
in English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now saying that this war in Yugoslavia could be
President Clinton's Vietnam. And I'm thinking, well, hell, this
doesn't make any sense. Vietnam was not President Clinton's
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing in Yugoslavia is getting out of hand. It looks like
it's just getting worse, just getting uglier. President Clinton now
is preparing for all-out war. Earlier today, he told all of the
interns to take cover under his desk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you have done your taxes already? They've added
something new on the 1040 Form this year. There's a box on the 1040
Form this year, and you can check that box if you would like the
president to have sex with an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, Dan Rather, on 60 Minutes II,' interviewed
President Bill Clinton. President Clinton said he did not consider
the impeachment to be a badge of shame. He said the real badge of
shame was striking out with Kathleen Willey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's April Fools' Day and President Clinton today played his
favorite April Fools' prank, you know, the one where he has sex
with an intern and then lies about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like our old friend Amy Fisher will be getting out of
prison in the next couple of months. Well, that'll hold us over
until the next impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, the Baltimore Orioles went down to Havana
and they played the Cuban national team, the first time a Major
League team has played baseball in Cuba. They defeated the Cuban
team 3-to-2. Big, big day -- in addition to that, it was also Karl
Marx seat cushion day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual New York City Auto Show opens on Saturday. It will
run ten days -- or until all the cars have been stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you folks ride the New York subway system? Here's
something that makes absolutely no sense to me: conductors on New
York subway trains have been ordered to stop using the word please'
in their announcements to save time. However, subway riders will
still be allowed to say the word please' -- as in, Please don't
kill me!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Subway conductors will be allowed to say thank you.' They can
still say thank you' -- as in,
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for not urinating.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they have a brand-new service on the Internet where you
can take a virtual New York City cab ride on your computer...You
log on at, I believe, www.what'sthatfunnysmell.com''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a program reminder for you, big holiday special over on
ABC tonight: A Monica Lewinsky Seder.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to change your clocks and go to Daylight Savings'
Time at about 2:00 AM Sunday morning...March is a bad, bad month.
We've had a tough run here because you lose an hour this weekend,
plus the four hours we lost watching the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a program reminder: Sunday night on ABC -- ``The Ten
Commandments''...Historically, the Ten Commandments were carved on
two stone tablets. Now you can get them in easy to take gelcaps.''
</P>
<P>

passionate love on the floor inside the front of the White House.
April Fools!''

<P>

I'm not mistaken, I believe French is her native tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists say that your nose and ears will keep growing over
the course of your lifetime. If that's the case, Evander Holyfield
might want to fight Tyson again just to get a trim.''
</P>
<P>

people. Well you know guys are gonna jump all over this study.
`Honey, of course I wanna marry you, but you don't wanna gain
weight.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sad news. Roseanne's ex-husband Tom Arnold, divorcing his
second wife after just three and a half years of marriage. Arnold
said today that no matter how long he stuck with this marriage,
there was simply no chance she was gonna get her own sitcom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our good friend Cindy Crawford says she lost five pounds in
the first three months of her pregnancy because she got morning
sickness and she kept throwing up. Course, when you're a supermodel
with morning sickness, you're throwing up for two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big news from the campaign trail. While campaigning in New
Hampshire yesterday, Al Gore took off his suit jacket and tie. This
was a shock to his wife Tipper. He doesn't even do that during sex.
I think he unbuttons it for a second.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie ``The Mod Squad'' opened over the weekend. About an
African American man, a rich kid, and a woman, who come together as
police officers to fight crime. I understand Dennis Rodman was up
for all three parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new book, they asked 50 women what they would

<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;

<P>
   ``Over the weekend, the Baltimore Orioles played the Cuban
National team in Cuba. There was one weird moment when a Cuban
player got thrown out trying to go from first to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole said he is going to remain in the background during
his wife's campaign. Of course, because of Viagra, part of him will
remain in the foreground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Kevorkian was found guilty of second degree murder.
Reportedly, Kevorkian is very depressed about it saying, `I've lost
the will to help people who've lost the will to live.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, TV Minister Pat Robertson launched a new
reader-friendly translation of the Bible that uses more accessible
language. For instance, the word `begat' is replaced by the phrase
`get it on.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate Moss recently posed nude for British Vogue and it's been
reported that afterwards the photographs were retouched to remove a
small birthmark. It turns out that wasn't a birthmark, it was Kate
Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was reported today that Claudia Schiffer's fitness trainer
is releasing a workout video. The trainer shows how you can lose
weight just by spending 30 minutes a day pretending to date a
magician.''
</P>
<P>
   As a publicity stunt, Fabio agreed to be one of the first to
ride a new roller coaster and during the ride he was hit in the
face by a low-flying bird. Immediately afterwards, hundreds of
birds lined up for the new `Hit Fabio in the Face Ride.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Vice President Al Gore's staff threw him a surprise
birthday party. Apparently he was so moved he almost moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is thinking about allowing teams to sell
advertising on player's uniforms. Apparently it's $10,000 for a
player's sleeve and $20,000 if it's placed somewhere that's
frequently scratched.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists say that the other day Dolly the Cloned Sheep gave
birth to triplets that were conceived the old-fashioned way. And of
course by `conceived the old-fashioned way' they mean President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers of `Live with Regis and Kathie Lee' announced
they are holding a Mother's Day contest to find the best mom in the
country. The winner will appear on the show where she'll be beaten
in a jealous rage by Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A group called American Atheists Incorporated announced they
are relocating their national headquarters to New Jersey. A
spokesman for the atheists said, `We feel the best way to prove
that God doesn't exist is to have people visit Newark.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luciano Pavarotti is performing in Las Vegas next week and he
admitted he always loses thousands of dollars at the gambling
tables. Luckily, he makes it back at the all-you-can-eat buffet.''

</P>
<P>
   They usually meet for lunch on Tuesdays at a McDonald's in
Forest Hills, Queens. A happy bunch, they are retirees who have
seen service in World War II or in Korea. When I overheard them,
they were discussing their mutual bond: membership in a citywide
drum corps that flourished in their youth. The name of their
current group is Romeos. Romantic? Not really. It stands for
Retired Old Men Eating Out.

   Rose Marie O'Leary had the following conversation with a Macy's
telephone operator.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Leary: ``Is this Macy's?''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``Yah.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Leary: ``If I might make a suggestion, you should
identify your company when you answer the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``You should know who you're calling.''

   At a recent celebration marking the reopening of Kings Bay
branch library in Brooklyn, a first-grade class from Public School
52 presented Rep. Anthony Weiner, first elected to Congress in
November, with a handsome hand-made thank-you card.
</P>
<P>
   After promising to display it in his new Washington office, he
turned to the adults in the audience and jocularly asked, ``And
what have you made me?'' A voice responded, ``A congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   _ STEPHEN D. WEINSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged man was sitting near the back door of a Madison
Avenue bus, carrying on an interminable and very audible
conversation on his cell phone. Head-shaking and angry looks from
fellow passengers failed to stem the flow.
</P>
<P>
   A woman sitting near the front who had been listening with
increasing irritation made her way to the back door, preparing to
leave at the next stop. Almost simultaneously, the man concluded
his conversation with ``I'll call you again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman moved directly in front of him. ``I hope when you make
your call tomorrow you are not on a bus,'' she said. The
passengers' applause was ringing in her ears as she made her exit.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Central Park West, during a sudden penetrating snow
shower.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Young woman in sneakers, hair dripping; older woman,
drenched, emerging from the park with four golden retrievers,
equally soaked and bedraggled, and Ursula Karelsen, who overheard
this exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``Wow, are they all yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Older woman: ``No, lady, I'm all theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   If you lived in Brooklyn about 40 years ago, there was only one
place to buy dessert. That was Ebinger's, a chain of bakeshops that
dotted the borough. It didn't matter when you went, it was crowded.
Ebinger's was famous for its blackout cakes, which were made with
pure butter, high-quality chocolate, real eggs and all the best
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   It was my routine to pick up a blackout cake for my
mother-in-law on most weekends. One of my friends had been looking
into franchising businesses and he asked me to inquire the next
time I went to Ebinger's whether they were franchised.
</P>
<P>
   When my mother-in-law was due for her treat, I headed over to
Ebinger's in Park Slope, packed as usual with customers being
served by the little gray-haired ladies who worked behind the
counter. I ordered my cake, and while the clerk was wrapping it, I
asked her if she knew if Ebinger's was franchised. She looked
around the store, leaned over the counter and confided, ``No, I
think they're Jewish.''

   Joan Cleveland was walking along Third Avenue recently when she
encountered a father trying to keep up with his son, who appeared
to be about 4. The little boy was darting about, and his father was
becoming increasingly exasperated. Finally, he called to the child,
``Ben, if this doesn't stop, there will be no escargots for
dinner!''
</P>
<P>
   A man who prefers to remain anonymous arrived at his apartment
after a busy day at work. He was greeted by one of the doormen, an
amiable fellow with a limited command of English.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you?'' the doorman asked. The man, his mind on other
things, replied absent-mindedly, ``You're welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked away, he realized his gaffe. He could imagine what
was going on in the doorman's mind: ``Just when I thought I was
beginning to understand this crazy language ...''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Hollenberg was on 14th Street when he noticed a large
disheveled man seated on the steps of an apartment building and
holding out a paper cup in which a number of coins had apparently
been deposited. A smaller, equally disheveled man approached and
asked for a share. ``You don't understand,'' the seated man boomed.
``This is not about you, it's about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Ackerman was at the 92nd Street Y waiting to hear Mary
Tyler Moore being interviewed by Joy Behar. She took out her
newspaper and opened it to the obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   The woman next to her asked if she could borrow part of the
paper and Ms. Ackerman gave her the entertainment section. The
woman thanked her and then glanced over to see what she was
reading. ``Do you always read the obits?'' she asked. Ms. Ackerman
replied that it was usually the first thing she looked at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you in real estate?'' the woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   My friend and I secured a less than prime spot for the St.
Patrick's Day parade on 53rd Street around the corner from Fifth
Avenue. We watched and listened as three extremely patient police
officers redirected countless people who were trying to cross the
avenue. Many of these people insisted they had to cross there _
their offices were directly across, they would be late, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The officers politely stood their ground and let no one cross.
An enterprising young woman, after being rebuffed, approached the
first vehicle waiting to cross Fifth, a sports utility vehicle
occupied by a man and a woman. She knocked on the window, spoke to
the driver, opened the rear door and jumped in. When the traffic
was waved on, the vehicle moved forward. She happily jumped out on
the opposite corner, having outsmarted three of New York's finest.

   Look inside the machinery of a human cell, and you would see
that its working parts are composed largely of proteins and its
data storage is handled by DNA. But look a little closer, and a
third agent seems to be running many of the trickiest parts of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   That agent is a stubby tangle of a molecule, bristling with
curlicues and gnarled as a coelacanth. Like that ancient fish, it
is a living relic, yet its roots stretch deeper than the oldest
fossils. There are many reasons to suppose that RNA, short for
ribonucleic acid, lies tantalizingly close to the origin of life.
</P>
<P>
   RNA handles much of the information processing of cells, even
though its better known chemical cousin, DNA, has been assigned the
chore of archive management. The machine tools that build cell's
proteins are also made largely of RNA. To those who wonder how the
system got to be that way, a compelling thought is that RNA must be
the most ancient part of the system, and everything else accreted
around it. If so, the best chance of understanding how life first
arose on earth may be to understand RNA.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The RNA World,'' a book whose second edition was published
recently by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.,
some leading experts on RNA peer as deeply as they can into the
events of some 4 billion years ago when a bunch of molecules seem
to have dropped through the wormhole between two universes, from
chemistry to life. Much has been learned about RNA since the book's
first edition in 1993, yet the new knowledge, rather than
bolstering the theory of RNA's leading role, seems just as much to
accentuate its difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the full chemical structure of the DNA of a
bacterium was determined for the first time. The microbe, known as
Haemophilus influenzae, turned out to have 1,830,137 units of DNA,
coding for 1,743 working parts, most of them proteins. That is a
complex system, but it depends, like all today's living organisms,
on just three principal kinds of chemical: DNA and RNA for data
processing, and proteins to catalyze the required chemical
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of how life got started on earth, it seems
dauntingly unlikely that information-carrying molecules and
reaction-catalyzing molecules would emerge at the same time and
place. That impasse seemed to have been bridged with the discovery
in 1982 that certain kinds of RNA have catalytic properties. It
followed that a single RNA molecule could in principle both carry
information and catalyze reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the RNA world, a phrase coined by Walter Gilbert
of Harvard, held that in the beginning there were no proteins and
no DNA, just RNA molecules that constructed more RNA molecules from
chemical subunits known as nucleotides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first stage of evolution proceeds, then, by RNA molecules
performing the catalytic activities necessary to assemble
themselves from a nucleotide soup,'' Gilbert wrote in an essay of
1986. ``The RNA molecules evolve in self-replicating patterns,
using recombination and mutation to explore new functions and to
adapt to new niches.''
</P>
<P>
   As the RNA molecules grew more capable, according to apostles of
the RNA theory, they deployed their catalytic properties to direct
the synthesis of proteins. The proteins, being more efficient
catalysts, took over the housework of the cell, and DNA, a
longer-lived molecule, assumed the role of hard disk drive. If this
conjecture is correct, almost all that is left to explain about the
origin of life is how the first RNA molecules arose from the
chemicals likely to have existed on the primitive earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nucleotides, the components from which RNA is made, consist of
three simple chemical units strung together _ a phosphate group, a
sugar known as ribose, and a sidechain ring of atoms known as a
base. The phosphates and bases are reasonably likely to have been
present among the chemicals on the early earth. For example
adenine, one of the four kinds of base, can be formed naturally
from two common chemicals, ammonia and hydrogen cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Ribose is more problematic. When formaldehyde, the simple
chemical from which sugars are likely to have been made, is brewed
in suitable conditions, it makes a syrup of sugars, only 2 percent
of which is ribose, an unpromising route to ribose nucleotides. But
Albert Eschenmoser, the chemist, recently found that if phosphate
is added to the mix, the outcome is quite different: the major
product of the brew is ribose phosphate.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists hope that with only a few more chemical
surprises like this, the problem of the origin of life will go
away. But many chemists are unconvinced. No one has yet figured out
a plausible way of loading the bases onto ribose or ribose
phosphate under the circumstances likely to have prevailed four
billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald F. Joyce of the Scripps Research Institute and Leslie E.
Orgel of the Salk Institute write in ``The RNA World'' that they
believe the appearance of small RNA molecules ``would have been a
near miracle.'' And Thomas R. Cech, an RNA expert at the University
of Colorado, said in an interview that RNA ``is far too complex to
have been the first self-replicating molecule, as if it emerged
like Athena from Zeus' head.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cech and Orgel, a leading authority on the origin of life,
suggest that there was a pre-RNA world, in which the starring role
was played by some other self-replicating, catalytic molecule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what it was but we are looking,'' Orgel said.
</P>
<P>
   Several alternative genetic systems are now being studied. One,
known as pyranosyl-RNA, has a six-atom ring in place of the
five-atom ring of ordinary ribose. Another, called peptide nucleic
acid, has the same chemical backbone as proteins but with nucleic
acid bases in place of protein's usual amino acid side-chains.
</P>
<P>
   Both pyranosyl-RNA and peptide nucleic acid display the behavior
to be expected of a genetic molecule, such as linking together in
double chains like the double helix of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want DNA-like double helices, there are probably
scores'' of molecules that would serve as genetic systems, Orgel
said. ``It raises the question of why we have RNA and DNA instead
of others that are equally good.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a pre-RNA world creates many possibilities for
researchers exploring prebiotic reactions, the chemistry that led
to the first living entities. But in some ways it sets the search
for the origin of life back to square one. Pyranosyl-RNA and
peptide nucleic acid may be promising candidates, but no one yet
knows if their spontaneous formation is any more plausible than
that of RNA.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the RNA world is also unproven in its central
assertion, that an RNA molecule could catalyze its own replication.
The natural RNA catalysts found today sponsor quite simple chemical
reactions. Chemists like David P. Bartel of the Whitehead Institute
in Cambridge, Mass., have been trying to construct RNA molecules
with a more extensive repertoire. Some RNAs show promising behavior
such as being able to make copies of a short stretch of another
RNA. But that is a far cry from a self-copying molecule.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has come close to getting a self-replicating RNA,''
Bartel said. ``It's a long road. It would be exciting to get an RNA
that can copy a complete turn of the helix.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another worry for prebiotic chemists is the possibility that
they may run out of time. Scientists once thought that a billion
years or so elapsed before the first appearance of life on earth.
But the earliest date that life could have started has been pushed
forward by planetary astronomers. They believe that debris left
over from the early solar system would have continued to bombard
the earth long after the planet's formation some 4.6 billion years
ago. The larger of these impacts would have boiled off the early
oceans into steam, sterilizing the young planet of any life forms
that might have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The primeval bombardment is thought to have ceased some 4
billion years ago. Meanwhile, fossil hunters have steadily pushed
back the date by which life must have started by finding ever older
fossils. The earliest known fossils exist in rocks that are 3.85
billion years old, leaving a mere 150 million years for life to
have started.
</P>
<P>
   This sharply narrower window is not yet an intellectual
embarrassment _ a lot can happen in 150 million years. Still, the
shrinking window worries Francis Crick, the eminent theoretician of
molecular biology.
</P>
<P>
   In a foreword to the first edition of ``The RNA World,'' written
when the oldest known fossils were a mere 3.6 billion years old,
Crick said that the available window ``leaves an astonishingly
short time to get life started.'' He also noted that the three
kingdoms of early life _ bacteria, the bacteria-like microbes known
as archaea, and the plant and animal kingdom _ ``seem a very long
distance from their hypothetical common ancestor.''
</P>
<P>
   Crick then proposed that life might have started elsewhere in
the universe, maybe on a planet whose chemical environment was more
conducive to the genesis of life than was Earth's. The three
kingdoms might represent the survivors of an assortment of microbes
sent to colonize distant planets.
</P>
<P>
   Crick's speculation that life originated elsewhere would provide
an escape hatch for scientists trying to explain the origin of life
on earth should the available window of time be squeezed
implausibly short. So far the idea has few takers, but it is not
being dismissed out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Orgel believes there is no way of assessing the probability of
life or how many years may have been required for its emergence.
``It's hard to say whether the origin of life took a million years
or a billion,'' he said. ``I don't think there is anything to be
concerned about unless there were organisms extant before the earth
became inhabitable. That would be a real puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cech agrees that life on earth got started astonishingly
quickly, but still looks to explain that process in terrestrial
terms. ``While extraterrestrial origins cannot and should be
discounted _ a lot of organic material certainly came in via
comets, for example _ it may not be necessary to invoke `visitors
from outer space,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an experiment of 1953, still taught in every textbook,
Stanley Miller showed that several of the principal chemicals of
life could be formed by running an electrical discharge (lightning)
through a flask of air and water (atmosphere and ocean). At once
the problem of the origin of life seemed soluble in principle. But
Miller's brilliant experiment has proved something of a dead end;
no one has managed to take it much further.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the RNA world may be the best available scenario
of how life started, but as with Miller's experiment, it has proved
frustratingly difficult to take a promising idea further. ``It
would be unhealthy not to have doubts,'' Cech said. ``Scientists
are good at checking things in the lab, but this is a historical
question and there is no videotape to document what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   However soluble the mystery of life's origins may seem in
principle, it remains very far from solution.

 &HT;    Refugees, hostages the face of war in the Balkans
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All three newsweeklies are filled with the images of war, but
none is more unsettling than the Time ($3.50) cover of an ethnic
Albanian woman breast-feeding her baby as she walks into Macedonia.
``The editor was concerned about the tastefulness of the picture,''
says Time's director of photography Michele Stephenson, ``but there
was no real dissension. The young mothers on the staff were all
moved by it and were able to identify with it. We felt it was the
most telling single image we had seen of the refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek ($3.50) uses its share of poign-
</P>
<P>
   ant photographs of fleeing refugees, but the magazine devotes
its cover to a grainy picture of the three battered American
soldiers who were taken hostage. Accompanying the Kosovo coverage
is an interview with U.S. Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.), a former
prisoner of war in Vietnam, who insists that defeat is not an
option. ``(Slobodan) Milosevic needs to understand that even if
every Kosovar is moved out, and every village is burned to the
ground,'' McCain says, ``we can get them back in and we will
rebuild their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95), Michael Satchell describes
the methodical blueprint for terror that Milosevic's forces are
using against ethnic Albanians. Shortly after the NATO bombings
began, Satchell writes, ``death squads apparently working from hit
lists hunted down intellectuals, journalists, doctors, human-rights
activists and community leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   MIRACLE MAN: Long before Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker hit the
airways, charismatic Pentecostal faith healer and radio preacher J.
Charles Jessup delivered his message to millions. The flamboyant
Jessup was married three times by the age of 24, raised roosters
for cockfighting and went fishing in the Gulf of Mexico in his own
seaplane. In a fascinating article in The New Yorker ($3), Peter J.
Boyer describes the rise and fall of the evangelist that Robert
Duvall used as his model in ``The Apostle.'' He also was a role
model for Elvis Presley, Boyer writes. During one of Jessup's tent
revival tours out of Tupelo, Miss., Presley asked to join the
preacher's gospel and country music band. Jessup's brother Darrel
``told him that the Jessups didn't need another guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   WASTING AWAY: Students used to gain weight when they went to
college and were fed with extra helpings of high-carbohydrate
dining hall meals and late-night pizzas. Now, People ($2.99)
reports, an increasing number of women students _ and some men _
are battling anorexia. Most are perfectionist, type-A
personalities, but part of the problem is the idolization of
reed-thin models and actresses, says sociologist Traci Mann.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY KUBRICK: In the dozen years before his death last month,
director Stanley Kubrick had become an elusive figure, shunning
interviews and publicity while finishing his last film, ``Eyes Wide
Shut.'' That didn't stop Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) from running
an interview with him. The fact that it was conducted 40 years ago
when Kubrick had just finished ``Spartacus'' is a minor point; it's
still an insightful interview.
</P>
<P>
   BRINGING ON THE NOISE: J.C. Penney plans to publish Noise, a new
magazine for teenagers and distribute it for free in its stores.
The first issue, due in July, will be 84 pages and include ads from
the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this magazine as a vehicle to create a strong, personal
relationship with a very important customer _ teenagers,'' said
Gale Duff-Bloom, president of J.C. Penney Marketing and
Communications. The full-color magazine will focus on the latest
teen beauty and fashion styles and trends as well as sports and
music.

MICHIGAN MAN LINKED TO MISSING ATHEIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ An ex-convict being held in connection with the
1995 disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair has admitted
involvement in four Texas homicides, at least one of which involved
the decapitation and mutilation of a victim, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Gary P. Karr, 50, also admitted an extensive role in what
authorities believe was the month-long kidnapping, and subsequent
killing of O'Hair and her two adult children, for $500,000 in gold
coins, according to testimony given in federal court in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's involvement extended to ``concealing property (taken)
from the victims after their death ... acquiring equipment to help
the victims be moved,'' and concealing their bodies, according to
the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to FBI agent William O'Leary, who testified March
26 in the Detroit courtroom, Karr told the FBI where the victims'
bodies were buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) told me the city,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the FBI has not found the remains of America's
most famous atheist and her two adult children, Jon Garth Murray
and Robin Murray O'Hair, all of whom disappeared in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The three abruptly left Austin, Texas, in late August of that
year and spent a month in San Antonio, before vanishing on Sept.
29.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth slaying involves Danny Fry, a Florida man who went to
Texas in mid-1995 on a mysterious mission.
</P>
<P>
   His nude, mutilated body was dumped by a river east of Dallas on
Oct. 2, 1995. Fry's head and hands had been severed and were
missing, and until this spring, the identity of the body was a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of O'Hair and her two children have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's lawyer said the case pertains to the disappearance of the
O'Hair family and Fry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given they are talking about a triple homicide and this other
body that was decapitated, I think it's obvious they are talking
about O'Hair and Fry. How many cases fit that description?'' said
Richard Helfrick, a public defender representing Karr.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a federal search warrant, more than three dozen
agents from the FBI and Internal Revenue Service spent most of last
weekend combing a 5,000-acre ranch outside of Camp Wood, a small
town some 120 miles west of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigators apparently came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Karr was one of two men charged with weapons violations after
federal authorities simultaneously questioned people in Austin,
Detroit, Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas, on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcript of the March 26 court hearing, Karr
spoke freely to investigators who went to his apartment inquiring
about the Texas cases.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 13 hours of questioning, he was charged with
offenses related to two loaded pistols that were found in his
apartment in the Detroit suburb of Novi.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law makes it a crime for felons to possess ammunition or
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Waters, 52, was charged with the same offense after
agents found 119 rounds of ammunition during a March 24 search of
his apartment in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Both Karr and Waters have extensive criminal pasts, including
violent crimes, and both are being held without bond. They spent
eight months in the same prison in Vienna, Ill., in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was serving time for battery and Karr was serving time
for aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery. Waters was released in
1987, Karr in May 1995. Karr apparently then went to Texas before
moving to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he (Karr) got out of prison, I think he was trying to put
his past behind him, and go forward, and that if anything, Waters
interjected himself into Karr's life,'' Helfrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was O'Hair's office manager several years ago in Austin.
He also was an old friend of Danny Fry.

DISPENSING OF DRUGS ON INTERNET STIRS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. James De Yarman specializes in performing hair transplants
at his clinic in San Diego. Last September, he took his expertise
online, setting up a site on the World Wide Web called
DrPropecia.com. There, he offers information about the drug
Propecia, which promotes hair growth in men. Prospective patients
can fill out an online medical history form, which De Yarman
reviews for a $50 fee. If he determines that the drug would be
useful for a patient, he then prescribes it and sells it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to assume they're telling me the truth,'' he said.
``I'm not a drugstore. I look at this as providing a service, going
online to sell it. What would I do different if they were to come
into the office?''
</P>
<P>
   De Yarman and others, who essentially function as both physician
and pharmacist online, are just one example of the ways in which
the World Wide Web is changing how prescription drugs are changing
hands. In other cases, international pharmacies, which sell drugs
without prescriptions that may not be regulated in this country,
offer online signposts for their wares. And, in the freewheeling
climate of the Internet, patients are exchanging information and
selling leftover drugs to one another.
</P>
<P>
   These activities are raising questions about how drug
transactions should be regulated _ and about how, with the
borderless, seemingly infinite shape of the online medium, they can
be.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has leaped ahead of the agencies that govern
prescription drugs in the United States. Typically, drugs are
approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, prescribed by
doctors who are licensed by state medical boards, and dispensed by
pharmacies licensed by state pharmaceutical boards. But by using
the Internet, people can often purchase drugs from sources not
licensed by these agencies. These activities have long gone on
off-line, but have been difficult to detect. Now these practices
seem to be booming online.
</P>
<P>
   One concern stems not from the well-advertised Internet
drugstores like Drugstore.com or Soma.com, both of which require a
patient to fax a prescription from a doctor to have it filled
online, but from sites like MDpharmacy.com, Net-Dr.com and
US-care.com. These sites, like De Yarman's, circumvent the
traditional medical relationships by allowing a patient without a
prescription to fill out a consultation form online, pay a fee for
its review and, if approved, receive drugs through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   While the American Medical Association said it was not a
violation of its code of ethics for a doctor to sell prescription
drugs, it is an ethical violation to sell drugs without a
face-to-face consultation. State law in California, where De Yarman
does business, prohibits the sale of drugs without an examination.
But most laws and codes which govern medicine were written before
the Internet, said Greg Abrams, legal counsel to the California
Medical Society, and do not factor in the questions raised by the
medium.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lamb, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, recently purchased
oxycodone, a potentially addictive pain reliever classified as a
controlled substance in the United States, from a Spanish pharmacy
he found over the Internet, because no doctor he visited locally
would prescribe the drug for his back pain. ``Foreign pharmacies
willing to ship without prescription are a growing source who has
seized on this gap because their countries do not regulate drugs
the way the U.S. does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randy Wykoff, the associate commissioner for operations at
the FDA, said the sale of illegal or unapproved products is, of all
the violations made possible by the Internet, of particular concern
to the agency. In recent years, he said, several staff members who
would typically investigate medical fraud have been redeployed to
look for fraudulent practices online.
</P>
<P>
   Besides buying from foreign-operated Web sites, some Internet
users swap drugs, facilitated by bulletin boards and other Web
areas that foster a flea market environment online. One participant
in an online infertility group, for example, offered to sell
``leftover'' drugs she had purchased from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Determining which actions to take and which policies to rewrite
to acknowledge the vast impact of the Internet on the sale of
pharmaceuticals will take time. The House Commerce Committee last
month commissioned the General Accounting Office to conduct a study
on the scope of the prescription drug trade online.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the trade group
for pharmacies, announced last month that it is developing a seal
of approval for online pharmacies to help customers determine which
ones are legitimate. The first seals are expected to be issued by
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not concerned about the economics, but about patient
safety,'' said Carmen Catizone, the executive director of the
pharmacy association.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dr. De Yarman sees more benefits than pitfalls in
extending his medical practice online. ``This is the future of
medicine,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tornado warnings were issued for parts of Oklahoma and Kansas
early Monday as a compact but potent jet stream disturbance
arriving from the west sparked severe thunderstorms that spawned
twisters. Tuesday morning, a few thunderstorms will develop across
parts of Michigan and Ohio Valley as the disturbance continues on a
northeastward path across the Great Lakes region. Severe weather is
unlikely, however, given the weakening nature of the system and the
lower availability of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, clouds and showers will escort a cold front
associated with the disturbance in the Great Lakes toward the
central and southern Appalachians. A few thunderstorms will erupt
near the slowing front near the central Gulf Coast, where rising
temperatures and humidity near the ground work in tandem with
cooling several thousand feet aloft to destabilize the atmosphere.
Isolated downpours are possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the lifting disturbance, unseasonable warmth will
surge into the middle Mississippi Valley and southwest Great Lakes
region as clouds break from southwest to northeast across the
region and warm winds from the west ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will
shift from central toward southern California as a cold,
upper-level low-pressure system drifts southeastward across the
state. Snow will fall at high elevations in the Sierra and some of
the mountains east of Los Angeles. Splotchy, generally light
precipitation will spread across the Great Basin toward the central
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Whirlwind Tour
</P>
<P>
   Like a student pilot practicing touch-and-go landings, a tornado
briefly touched down and lifted up over western Louisiana on
Sunday. There is a notion that twisters corkscrew over the ground
for long periods of time, but most tornadoes take a whirlwind tour
over land, keeping contact with the ground, on average, for less
than ten minutes. The severe thunderstorm that spawns a tornado can
be much more long-lived. Indeed, after a thunderstorm's prodigy
tornado lifts off the ground, a sibling twister can later spin up
under the storm, giving rise to the notion of a ``family'' of
tornadoes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gloria Belisle is probably not the kind of patient doctors had
in mind when they first envisioned treating medically underserved
people from afar with high-technology diagnostic tools.
</P>
<P>
   Like any patient receiving such care in rural America, Mrs.
Belisle, who has congestive heart failure, does not generally see
the medical practitioners following her condition. Instead, twice a
day she sits in front of a computerized machine that asks, ``How
can I help you?'' It then proceeds to measure everything from her
blood pressure to her heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Belisle, 50, lives not on a farm in the outreaches of
rural America, but on the South Side of Chicago. To receive her
examination, she need only make her way to the dining room of her
two-story house.
</P>
<P>
   She is part of a trend in the practice of ``telemedicine.''
Increasingly, authorities say, telemedical equipment, from the most
basic to the most elaborate, is spreading from small medical
centers in the underserved parts of America that spurred its birth
several decades ago to homes in densely populated areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by health care providers who hope to cut costs and by
advocates who say the practice actually increases the attention
given to patients, electronic remote home care is being used to
monitor patients with widely diverse conditions including chronic
illnesses and high-risk pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has also helped shorten hospital stays, because
patients can now be monitored at home. And doctors say it is
especially useful for homebound patients like the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have come to realize that it can be just as
hard to get across an urban area as it is to go 200 miles in a
rural area,'' said Dr. Ace Allen, a Kansas physician who edits
Telemedicine Today magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Allen and two colleagues reported a sharp increase
in the use of the remote equipment, both in and out of the home,
from 1,715 consultations in 1993 to a projected 90,000 last year.
In the last several years, the magazine reported, usage has doubled
each year, a trend that Dr. Allen said seemed to be holding true
for the remote care at home.
</P>
<P>
   And as high-capacity Internet lines spread to ordinary
households, allowing people to quickly transmit high quality video
images and other data, the practice is expected to become more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few would suggest that this kind of home care will
overshadow the traditional role of the remote monitoring: treating
people in hard to reach places.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Belisle, who has been using the technology for about
two years, it has helped her control a condition for which her
doctors had considered a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Morning and evening, Mrs. Belisle sits in front of HANC, or
home-assisted nursing care. She attaches three electronic leads to
her chest so that the machine can check her heart with an
electrocardiogram. She slips her arm into a cuff so that her blood
pressure can be measured. She puts her finger in a small sleeve so
that her pulse and blood-oxygen level can be taken. And she enters
her weight. (The machine can also handle an electronic stethoscope,
allowing remote examination of the heart and lungs, and can move
video images in both directions.)
</P>
<P>
   The machine stores the information and relays it to nurses at
the home-care agency monitoring her condition _ immediately, if
there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   By her own admission, before her machine arrived, when nurses
visited several times a week, Mrs. Belisle was not always the best
patient. During the day, her husband was at work and her son was at
school. Weakened by her illness, she did not always find the
strength to take her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   HANC, however, is not the type to be ignored. It tells Mrs.
Belisle when it is time to take her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets louder and louder until you respond,'' she said.
Eventually, if his demand remains unsatisfied, the machine contacts
the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   While the machine Mrs. Belisle is using is top of the line,
costing about $12,000, doctors across the country say they have
been getting good results with equipment that costs far less, often
under $1,000. Dr. Allen sees a time when, even for patients with
only a short-term need, doctors will be able to phone in an order
for equipment to be delivered to the home. ``My personal image is
of the Domino's pizza-delivery model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns remain over whether the remote equipment will strip
medical treatment of its human element. Advocates say that patients
and, over time, health providers have been generally positive about
the technology, won over by the machines' power to allow numerous
contacts with a doctor or nurse each day, instead of just several a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Belisle acknowledged she was concerned at first. ``I miss
my nurses,'' she said. ``When they first stopped coming, I didn't
know if I could cope without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, she said, her machine won her over, and now she has
nothing but praise for her caregiver _ or, almost. ``My only
complaint with HANC: I hate him on Sunday morning,'' Mrs. Belisle
said.
</P>
<P>
   For HANC, Sunday is just another day, which means that at 7:30
a.m. sharp, he starts calling his patient over for her first
checkup. She tries to ignore the demands, but eventually the
machine always wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like sleeping late on Sundays,'' Mrs. Belisle laments.

 &HT;    Gospel rapper takes the heat
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kirk Franklin won't go so far as to thank the Rev.
Henry Lyons, but he has reason to.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lyons' wife set fire to one of his houses, sparking a
yearlong inquiry into the activities of the former president of the
National Baptist Convention USA, Franklin hasn't been the most
controversial figure in the black church. Charges of Lyons'
racketeering and theft have weighed a little more heavily on
congregations' minds than Franklin's infusing rap music into his
gospel message.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for that, all I can say is `Amen,' '' chuckles Franklin,
29, from his home in Dallas. ``Thank you, Father!''
</P>
<P>
   That sigh of relief comes after years of attacks from
traditional gospel circles.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's 1993 breakthrough single, ``The Reason Why I Sing,''
merely raised eyebrows in the music industry because it propelled
his first gospel album (``Kirk Franklin &AMP; the Family'') past the 1
million mark in sales. The song itself, a simple, stirring
call-and-response centered on a piano, was clear in its praise of
Jesus and posed no problem with the more upright in the pews.
</P>
<P>
   Then Franklin, a kind of choral director and crowd-rouser,
started borrowing from rapper Busta Rhymes in his improvisations.
He incorporated the bass line from Parliament-Funkadelic's ``One
Nation Under a Groove'' into his own ``Stomp'' and got all
buddy-buddy with R. Kelly, the R&AMP;B singer known as ``the
bump-and-grind guy.'' Franklin had USA Today lauding this ``new day
in gospel,'' People magazine calling him the ``apostle of gospel''
and both urban contemporary and gospel radio stations playing his
Grammy Award-winning music.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it also had some of the church folk upset,'' says CeCe
Winans, also a frequent target of opponents of contemporary gospel.
``People were saying, `Why do they have to dance so much? Why do
they dress that way?' I say, `Kirk is singing His praises and the
young people are hearing him. What's the problem?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people say they want everyone to be a part of the
church, that they want to embrace everyone, but they're
hypocrites,'' declares Kelly, who performed on Franklin's recent
single, ``Lean on Me.'' ``They just want everyone to worship God
exactly the way they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin himself won't weigh in on the subject. ``I'm trying to
please Him and only Him. If Jesus can go through all He endured,
surely little ole me can take it.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the major TV networks passed up the first gospel
pay-per-view concert, headlined by Franklin on Easter, ``I praised
Him on BET!'' Franklin says triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   And, of the time a man turned away from Franklin in first class
on an airplane because Franklin said he is in gospel music,
Franklin says, ``OK, he may think I'm a weirdo, but what matters
most is what God thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I just keep on praising Him! How I praise him.''

BOOK REVIEW: SEEING AND THEN, FINALLY, SEEING

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Knipfel's life, recounted in his new memoir, ``Slackjaw,''
sounds like a bad dream: He discovered in his early 20s that he was
afflicted with a rare genetic illness called retinitis pigmentosa,
which would leave him blind in a couple years, and he also learned
that he was suffering from a form of epilepsy that caused
depression and ``rage seizures.'' His marriage was falling apart,
he was drinking heavily, and he couldn't find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep returning to that simple mantra of mine, Deal With
It,'' he writes, ``while recognizing that life has become one long
slapstick routine _ like living a Marx Brothers movie, except
without quite so many musical numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Knipfel's sardonic sense of humor and his keen sense of
the absurd that kept him from going through with his plans to
commit suicide, and those same qualities enliven this memoir,
making his account of his travails less depressing than funny,
heroic and, yes, entertaining. Knipfel _ a staff writer and
columnist for New York Press _ is also blessed with a natural, one
might even say reflexive, knack for telling stories, and in this
volume he spins the most ordinary of events (a subway ride, a trip
to Times Square, a visit to a bar) into rollicking adventures,
crammed full of paranoia, suspense and giddy self-dramatization.
</P>
<P>
   Knipfel, himself, emerges as a sort of middle-class rebel, a
would-be anarchist and outsider who has read a lot of Kafka,
Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky. He and a friend considered naming their
rock band ``The Wolf Man, the Rat Man and the Psychotic Dr.
Schreber,'' after the subtitle to Freud's ``Three Case Histories'';
in college they formed a political group called the ``Nihilist
Workers' Party.'' Knipfel later takes to wearing a black fedora in
hopes that it will make him look like Bogart or Cagney. And when he
starts losing his sight, he considers buying a walking stick with a
silver wolf's head handle instead of a blind man's white cane. He
was, he says, ``a walking cliche.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing college with a degree in philosophy, Knipfel
enrolls in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, where he
teaches an introduction to humanities course. He complains,
however, that his students simply regurgitate his lectures back to
him in garbled form. (``Nietzsche's sister married an
anti-semantic.'' ``The poem argued for carpe diem _ that is, `cease
the day.''') And he soon tires of ``writing papers about papers
other people had written about books other people had written about
some cultural icon or work of art.'' He turns to a life of petty
crime.
</P>
<P>
   He orders some brass knuckles from an ad in Soldier of Fortune,
learns the craft of shoplifting and begins hanging out with
``dealers, other thieves, hookers, pimps, a few men who claimed to
be murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoplifting, it turns out, will be only one of his many careers.
He also works at a used-book store and a pornography shop. He tries
running a bar, works as a guard at the Guggenheim Museum, and takes
a long-term job as a receptionist (a decidedly undiplomatic one, it
must be said, who tells callers they've got ``25-to-1 odds'' of
talking to the person they're calling).
</P>
<P>
   As Knipfel's eyesight deteriorates, it becomes increasingly
difficult to get to work or run the most mundane errands. He finds
himself walking in ``a hunchback shuffle'' to avoid getting hurt.
He uses his wide-brimmed hat, like a cat's whiskers, as a sort of
early warning system for objects he might run into. And he divests
himself of most of his possessions (including his beloved books) so
he can better navigate his apartment. His life grows progressively
smaller. ``I had never much liked going out before,'' he writes,
``even when I could see, but now, whenever someone asked me to stop
by, or meet at a bar, or go out to dinner, my throat tightened,
dread filled my guts.''
</P>
<P>
   In time Knipfel does learn to deal with his blindness, just as
he learned to deal with his seizures. With the help of his ``home
survival trainer'' (who gives him a talking clock and oven mitts
that cover his arms) and ``the cane lady'' (who teaches him how to
get around the city), he slowly recovers his feisty independence.
He recounts the bizarre tale of enrolling in a track safety program
that is meant to teach blind people how to survive a fall onto the
subway tracks. And he provides a bitter but darkly comic account of
his efforts to deal with the competing agencies set up to help the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Knipfel's anecdotes sound overly polished, like the sort
of anecdotes performers tell and retell on talk shows. And his
writing occasionally slips into cliche. ``Some people drink because
it's Christmas Eve and they want to celebrate,'' he observes.
``Others drink just because it's Christmas Eve.'' A couple of pages
later, he declares that he ``was born with an infant's body and a
100 year old's spirit.'' Such lapses, however, are rare in a book
that displays remarkable elan and some wicked black humor in
chronicling ``the weirdness parade'' that has been Knipfel's life.

OF LIFE, DEATH AND THE RULES OF LIVER TRANSPLANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Benedetto is dying in his mobile home in Clearwater, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling around him is a debate over whether he and patients
like him should be denied liver transplants that might save their
lives _ specifically, whether the nation's health care system
denies transplants out of failure to keep abreast of medical and
technical advances or out of eagerness to save money.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto, 44, a disabled Medicaid patient, contracted hepatitis
B 10 years ago from a blood transfusion he received after he was
struck by a drunken driver. Two years ago, his doctors said his
disease had progressed to the point where he could die at any
moment without a liver transplant. But his health maintenance
organization refused to pay for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO, Staywell Health Care in Tampa, Fla., cited guidelines
issued by the state of Florida recommending against liver
transplants to hepatitis B patients on the ground that the virus
would destroy a replacement liver just as it did the original,
leaving the patient just as sick and wasting a scarce organ in a
transplant doomed to fail. The federal guidelines that apply to 39
million Medicare recipients say the same.
</P>
<P>
   But medical researchers and liver transplant surgeons said
advances in the treatment of hepatitis B had left the guidelines
outdated. Since the early 1990s, drugs started to become available
to better treat the disease and now, the researchers say, the drugs
appear to have blocked liver damage in more than 80 percent of the
thousands of hepatitis B patients who have received transplants in
states that allow them.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is now wide agreement that hepatitis B, in and
of itself, is no longer a valid reason to deny someone a liver
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Florida Agency for Health-Care
Administration said it was the agency's policy not to discuss
guidelines in detail. Benedetto's condition changes from day to
day, making it difficult for him to be interviewed. But his former
wife, who is caring for him, said she was furious when the
transplant doctors had recommended was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe Ralph would simply be allowed to die when
everybody knew successful treatments were available,'' Theresa
Benedetto said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dr. David R. Nelson, a professor of medicine and an expert
in hepatology at the Shands Hospital of the University of Florida
in Gainesville, and Dr. Scott E. Hallgren of the Florida Center for
Gastroenterology at Pinellas Park, had determined in June 1998 that
Benedetto was in danger of dying at any moment, but that he had an
excellent chance of regaining his health with a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO insisted that the sole reason for its denial was that
hepatitis B patients did not meet the state criteria for
transplants. Costs for the procedure are high, the company
acknowledged, with the average hospital bill for the operation in
Florida at $117,000, plus the costs of finding a suitable organ and
the subsequent costs of preventing rejection of the organ or
recurrence of viral infection, said Nancy Gareau, Staywell's vice
president for operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, under contract with Florida to manage Medicaid
patient care, covers five or six transplants a month, Ms. Gareau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the HMO refused to authorize a transplant, Mrs. Benedetto
said, Benedetto was turned away by three hospitals. Jackson
Memorial Medical Center, affiliated with University of Miami School
of Medicine, said it would not do the transplant unless Benedetto
produced a $150,000 down payment, Mrs. Benedetto said. Shands
Hospital required $136,000 down.
</P>
<P>
   Both hospitals confirmed Mrs. Benedetto's account and said the
total bills could run much higher. Benedetto, unemployed because of
his disability, could not begin to pay that cost. Tampa General
Hospital also turned him away, because it said its doctors were not
convinced that Benedetto would survive a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at several American medical centers, health care
experts and doctors do not fault hospitals that seek assurance they
will be reimbursed for transplants, whose high cost, if
uncompensated, would quickly drive them out of business. ``And if
it did one transplant free, wouldn't it be unjust to deny one to
someone else who also needed one,'' said Dr. John M. Vierling,
chairman of the American Liver Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And while some doctors characterized Benedetto's experience as
yet another example of how tight-fisted HMOs harm patients, others
said that in their experience most HMOs were fully cooperative in
covering transplants where they were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Vierling said, the original decision in the 1980s
to exclude patients with hepatitis B from transplant rosters was
legitimate. The problem now, he said, is adapting the rules to
changing medical conditions. Once a procedure is excluded, he said,
it is often a long and tortuous process to get the rule changed.
That is true in the case of hepatitis B, he said, even though new
treatments have produced long-term success rates equal to overall
rates for liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald A. Young, a senior vice president for policy and
clinical services of the American Association of Health Plans, the
nation's largest trade and lobbying association for private managed
care companies, said health care providers had an obligation to
treat their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first rule _ the principle of beneficence _ says you have
the responsibility to provide the care needed to the individual
without regard to your own interest,'' including financial
interests, he said. But, he added, ``Second, the principle of
stewardship provides that justice must be done for all where you
have to allocate resources.'' He said it would be unethical to
spend so much time and money or resources in saving one patient
that it became impossible to save a group of others. Although the
two principles may be contradictory, Young said, the goal is to try
not to violate either.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for Ralph Benedetto? In the past, it might
have meant that it would not be right to give him a liver in a
transplant doomed to fail, if the organ might save someone else's
life. But today, Young said, ``It seems to me the doctors and
hospitals and the state of Florida and the HMOs should all get
together and find a way to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day on which the American Association of Health
Plans discussed the ethical considerations in the Benedetto case,
March 4, its spokesman said it had pondered the question further.
``We found the question highly disturbing,'' the spokesman said.
``We will do something.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, on March 5, after probing questions had been raised
about Benedetto's case, Kate C. Morgan, chief of the Florida Agency
for Health-Care Administration's Bureau of Managed Health Care,
said the case had prompted senior agency officials to make an
immediate change in the agency's rule on hepatitis B. ``We have
relayed that information to the HMOs, and Staywell is going to move
forward with the transplant'' as long as Benedetto is still a
candidate, Ms. Morgan said. Staywell confirmed that this was the
case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But now Benedetto may no longer be viable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When he was tested in June in an effort to appeal Staywell's
denial, he was found to have responded well to various medications.
But now, Dr. Enrique J. Martinez, his hepatologist, said, the virus
is renewing its attack.
</P>
<P>
   If events had been conspiring against Ralph Benedetto, now they
seemed to be mobilized on his behalf. On the afternoon of March 5,
Martinez's transplant center, Lifelink, a nonprofit institute
affiliated with Tampa General, was notified that it had just
received approval to use an experimental drug, adefovir, that was
not yet approved for general use but could be prescribed by
selected research centers on a compassionate-use basis. Preliminary
trials have found it to be 90 percent successful in controlling the
recurrence of hepatitis B viral attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he believed the chances were excellent now that
the adefovir would enable Benedetto to be put on the list to await
a transplant within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Several health care professionals said it was heartening to see
senior state health officials act so quickly in this case, but also
expressed concern. Vierling of the American Liver Foundation, said:
``Those recent developments are, of course, good news for the
Benedettos. But it is still disturbing that it took the fight and
persistence of a person like Theresa Benedetto and the action of a
few key people in the system before it could be spurred into
action. And it disturbs me that many dying patients with hepatitis
B still cannot get transplants.''

THREE NEW NONFICTION WRITERS WIN HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newly created J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project honored three
nonfiction authors Monday, with the largest award being a $45,000
grant to a freelance writer who has been struggling financially to
finish a book about six World War II veterans from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the difference it will make in my life,''
said Kevin Coyne, 39, a former newspaper reporter who received the
$45,000 prize for his work in progress, ``The Best Years of Their
Lives.'' ``I had this naive faith that I could scratch out a living
from this, and it just hadn't been happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Also honored were Henry Mayer, with a $10,000 award for his book
``All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of
Slavery'' (St. Martin's Press), and Adam Hochschild, with a $10,000
prize for his account of the plundering of Congo, ``King Leopold's
Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa''
(Houghton Mifflin).
</P>
<P>
   Coyne said his $45,000 award would allow him to concentrate
exclusively on finishing his book, which essentially traces the
lives of World War II veterans who return home to Freehold, N.J.,
to face the shattered promises of small-town America, where the
main factory closes and race riots erupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great financial struggle these last couple years
because this book has taken a lot longer than expected,'' said
Coyne, who noted that ``without this grant it would just take
longer.'' The book is to be published by Viking Penguin.
</P>
<P>
   The series of awards was established in memory of J. Anthony
Lukas, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of
``Common Ground,'' who died in 1997 shortly before his last book.
about an assassination in turn-of-the-century Idaho, ``Big
Trouble,'' was published by Simon &AMP; Schuster. The awards recognize
nonfiction writing that demonstrates literary grace, serious
research and concern for an important aspect of American social or
political life.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were conceived by Linda Healey, his widow, and Arthur
Gelb, one of his former editors at The New York Times and now
president of The New York Times Co. Foundation. The project is
administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of
Journalism and the Nieman Foundation of Harvard University and is
financed by the family of Mark Lynton, who died in 1997. He was a
senior executive at Hunter Douglas manufacturers in the
Netherlands, and the father of Michael Lynton, the chief executive
of the Penguin Putnam Group.
</P>
<P>
   Finalists were Patricia Cline Cohen for ``The Murder of Helen
Jewett'' (Alfred A. Knopf); Jill Lepore for ``The Name of War''
(Knopf); William Adler for the unpublished ``Universal
Manufacturing,'' and Anne Matthews for the unpublished ``Wild
Nights: Nature Returns to New York.''

OF MILLIONS BORN IN PRINT, 55 STORIES OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annually for the last 83 years an editorial venture has sifted
through several thousand published short stories to choose two
dozen or so as America's most notable. ``The Best American Short
Stories of ...'' (filling in the year) has been the series title
since 1915.
</P>
<P>
   It approaches tautology. Whether the first editors were right to
claim the short story as peculiarly American _ John Updike suggests
it has something to do with national restlessness and no second
acts _ ``Best'' reflects a characteristic if not exclusively
``American'' proclivity for thinking No. 1. (I daydream a Pulitzer
Prize for Second-Best Poetry, for Second-Best American Short
Stories. The choices might well shine brighter over time.
Runners-up don't run faster, but _ make of this what you will _
they run longer.)
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, whose auspices span nearly all of the series'
life, has arranged for Updike and Katrina Kenison, its general
editor, to pick 55 stories from the 2,000 published over those 83
years. Selection goes way beyond that. Over the decades magazines
had winnowed millions of manuscripts to print hundreds of thousands
of stories that would be reduced to the 2,000 in the series and
then squashed down by Ms. Kenison into the 300 mashed through
Updike's 55-hole colander.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fathomless ocean of rejection and exclusion surrounds this
brave little flotilla,'' writes Updike, who snores in epigrams.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Best American Short Stories of the Century.''
``Century'' is reasonable, even if the first 14 years and the last
one are out of the game. ``Best'' is understandable, though it
could use qualification.
</P>
<P>
   To choose is to govern, and all government carries with it
elements of misrule, secular decline and the shadow of revolt. Yet
government is necessary. Choice is more than necessary; it is frail
and admirable. Milovan Djilas, the Serb who wielded a power, now
seemingly lost, to wrestle moral illumination out of history's
chaos _ how his absence aches today _ praised what he called ``the
imperfect society.'' Imperfect choice is a humane value. It outguns
canons.
</P>
<P>
   Imperfection is gracefully acknowledged by Updike and by Ms.
Kenison, who reads thousands of stories for each volume of the
series and offers 120 to the novelist chosen to act as that year's
editor. She has done it for nine years, an infant. Edward O'Brien,
the series' inventor, was 25 years on the job when he visited
wartime London, where a German bomb managed to accomplish upon him
what never-selected authors like John O'Hara and Mary McCarthy no
doubt wished to. Martha Foley, his successor, lasted 37 years,
dying almost literally with reading glasses on.
</P>
<P>
   Personally I felt faintly dizzy after three days and only these
55 stories. Short stories are sprints, and most of us need a
breathing spell after every three or four. The reader should treat
this centennial Best as an event of a season, not of an evening or
two. The risk otherwise is esthetic shell shock. Whether vociferous
or quiet, direct, distanced or revved-up absurdist, the form
involves a detonation in a small space. Sometimes, in a number of
the more recent stories, it is the detonation of what purposefully
doesn't go off.
</P>
<P>
   One of the discoveries in reading through the shifts of effect
and intention by writers over the course of a near-century is an
odd constancy. Throughout and with few exceptions, a short story
remains a hole the author quite noticeably digs, whatever the
camouflage, for the characters to fall into. The reader is pulled
close enough (in the older ones) or shoved close enough (in the
maneuvered ricochets of the newer ones) to be snagged as well.
</P>
<P>
   Almost always the holes are dark. Death or dying are not just
ending but dramatic climax. (Classically, death was not tragedy but
what followed tragedy.)
</P>
<P>
   In Susan Glaspell's shiveringly affecting ``A Jury of Her
Peers'' (1917), one of the collection's true resurrections, a farm
wife kills her brutal husband. In Flannery O'Connor's `'Greenleaf''
(1957) a fading Southern aristocrat is gored by her caretaker's
bull. Susan Sontag's perhaps too explicitly titled ``The Way We
Live Now'' (1987) uses a dying AIDS patient as denunciatory charge
against the trivial rivalries of a New York arts set maneuvering
around the deathbed. In Annie Proulx's ``Half-Skinned Steer''
(1998) the hallucinatory end of a fierce old man in a blizzard is a
near-biblical judgment.
</P>
<P>
   If not death, the hole can be a desolating social circumstance:
Bernard Malamud's ``German Refugee'' (1964); Carolyn Ferrell's
black adolescent tormented by poverty, violence and his own gay
loneliness in ``Proper Library'' (1994), or interior condition (too
numerous to count, a number of them from The New Yorker's chaste
glory days).
</P>
<P>
   Suburban wit and irony can light up the hole without diminishing
it: ``Gesturing'' (1980), Updike's modest self-selection. Cheever's
``Country Husband'' (1955) brings in gods and dogs to give a
friezelike mythic touch to more expensive suburbs than Updike's.
Damnation hovers, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the writers' hole digging can be brittly obvious, as
in remarkably similar stories by Ring Lardner and Dorothy Parker.
With ``City of Churches'' (1973) by Donald Barthelme, pretty much
the sole representative of the surreal absurd, the hole drops into
a shape-changing fun house that is no fun at all except, itchily,
for the reader.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely is the hole uplifting. (Never mind the physics.) An
anguished couple find reconciliation in a child's terrible death
(Paul Horgan's ``Peachstone,'' 1943). From Harold Brodkey:
``Verona: A Young Woman Speaks'' (1977), in which an adolescent on
a ruinously lavish Italian holiday lives that brief moment when
parents are gods of light.
</P>
<P>
   What more to make of this? Alfred Kazin is dead, Harold Bloom is
busy, and I am not Elizabeth Hardwick. A couple of thoughts about
the process.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many ways to choose. The editors might have ignored
the near-century span of the project and tried to pick, on quality
and survivability alone, the finest 55 of the 2,000. But the result
would have been less interesting. Instead, it was decided to
represent each decade with anywhere from three to eight selections.
Yes, there are some lumps _ not too many _ but it was the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a strictly contemporary judgment we have a running
one: These were the stories that judges in the 1930s, '40s and '50s
chose. We get a sense of how we and our writers have changed. And
we avoid the deadly ahistorical numbness of ourselves talking to
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   A second decision, inevitable but with mixed consequences, was
to get in the big and near-big names. Sometimes it works splendidly
and usually creditably. But in a few cases, because of the rules of
choice, the writers are not well represented.
</P>
<P>
   The rules had it that only those stories selected for each
year's volume could be considered. So, for example, Isaac Bashevis
Singer, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter and Jean Stafford are
displayed in stories that, though perfectly good, fail to convey
their particular genius. Is this more damaging than the
rules-governed failure to include a John O'Hara or Mary McCarthy
because they were never chosen for the yearly volumes? Oddly
enough, I believe so.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the jinx word ``best'' accommodates itself more easily
to an omission than to our facing, in the reading rather than the
missing, a ``not really best.''
</P>
<P>
   What else? The easy and uninteresting mention of authors whom
one would have included: Tobias Wolff, Christopher Tilghman, Mary
Gaitskell. (``Eder, go edit your own book.'') The subjective but
perhaps more interesting mention of several venerably established
stories to which my response was not, ``Good to see you again, and
of course you should be here.'' Instead it was, ``I know you until
I read you; and when I read you, it is as if I never knew you.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the perfect form of Hemingway's ``Killers.'' The
bottomless sorrow and beauty of Faulkner's ``That Evening Sun Go
Down.'' The joyful detail and stoic spaciousness of the Cheever.
The unexpected (to me) rating of Philip Roth's early ``Defender of
the Faith'' so high: the lyrical, unexplored energy of a
knowingness that would later be so complexly explored. Here it is a
new snowfall with only a single ski track.

`EVERYTHING'S RELATIVE': TIRED PREMISE WITH SOME SMART NEW TWISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wacky dad is Jeffrey Tambor, bald, not young, not slim,
convinced that every good-looking woman in Los Angeles is flirting
with him. The wacky mom is Jill Clayburgh, attractive, slim, not
young, completely obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's Relative'' is an odd little comedy, based on the
most tired sitcom premise of them all: one nice, normal guy
surrounded by lovable lunatics. But to its credit, this new series
gives the idea some new twists.
</P>
<P>
   Tambor brings to his new role the fascinating, oblivious
sleaziness of his ``Larry Sanders Show'' character: Hank, the
resentful fourth-rate talk show sidekick. Ms. Clayburgh is brightly
funny and seems much more at home than she did as the
self-sacrificing Irish-American housewife in ``Trinity,'' one of
NBC's early cancellations last fall. Kevin Rahm, a stand-up comic,
is likable as their normal son, Leo, the comedy writer. And Eric
Schaeffer is brilliant as the self-absorbed son, Marty the doctor.
Schaeffer, who began his career as co-writer and co-director of
``My Life's in Turnaround,'' is the kind of guy who would cast and
direct himself in his first nude scene, and he did, in ``Fall''
(1997), a film about the love between a taxi driver and a
supermodel. He was born to play Marty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's Relative'' is set in a contemporary, somewhat
amoral Southern California. Mom and Dad are long divorced. Dad's
idea of a father-son outing is having Leo shoplift for him. Marty
is getting married for the third time, and Mom accidentally drugs
his fiancee. The first two episodes, which revolve around
engagement parties, house hunting and Leo's vow to ``divorce'' his
family, look promising, with some inventive titles (``Later that
same lie'') and what must be one of television's first five-way
split-screen telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether viewers will really want to spend time
with these highly flawed characters every week. But a lot of people
said the same thing about Jerry, Kramer, George and Elaine.
</P>

JILL CLAYBURGH ENTHUSED ABOUT HER LATEST SITCOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jill Clayburgh has made some odd career choices. She admits it.
</P>
<P>
   After wowing movie audiences in the '70s and early '80s,
Clayburgh almost disappeared. Flying low enough to avoid detection,
she has focused on TV movies and other small-budget projects in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always picked very far-out, edgy things,'' said
Clayburgh, who received Oscar nominations for her performances in
``An Unmarried Woman'' (1976) and ``Starting Over'' (1979). Talking
by phone from a production studio in L.A. last week, she added:
``It probably was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   She was speaking in terms of career advancement as opposed to
artistic satisfaction _ one unreleased effort was a pro-Palestinian
film project titled ``Hanna K.'' She didn't sound the least bit
regretful.
</P>
<P>
   That may help explain her enthusiasm for another odd choice, the
new NBC series ``Everything's Relative,'' premiering Tuesday night.
NBC has ordered only four episodes of the half-hour comedy, meaning
``Everything's Relative'' may have a shorter shelf life than most
things in my refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it can't be renewed for next season. Anything's
possible. There once was a show called ``Seinfeld,'' whose pilot
aired in July 1989. Nearly a year later, four more episodes showed
up. (NBC evidently has a thing for the number 4.) But it wasn't
until January of '91 that it became a regular series.
</P>
<P>
   Though it strives mightily for the ``Seinfeld'' vibe,
``Everything's Relative'' isn't ``Seinfeld.'' But then,
everything's relative. NBC is falling off its perch as the
most-watched network. Meanwhile, ABC has a well-regarded
``Seinfeld'' clone in ``It's like, you know ...'' So why not make a
late-season play for the yada-yada-yada crowd?
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Clayburgh, whose voice conveys a sort of artsy
detachment, doesn't pretend to be interested in the wherefore of
network programming practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with the script,'' she said. ``I thought the
humor was genuinely original and brilliant. It just made me
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   She even showed it to her husband, the noted playwright David
Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved it,'' Clayburgh reported.
</P>
<P>
   Clayburgh, who will be 55 on April 30, plays a quintessentially
obsessive, overbearing mother of about the same age. It's a TV role
that has been an industry ideograph for decades, an over-the-top
alternative to the wacky neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Everything's Relative,'' though, Clayburgh keeps the
character, Mickey Gorelick, pleasantly under the top, making the
mother's obsessiveness and guilt-mongering eminently believable.
Indeed, it's the other three characters _ her ex-husband (played by
Jeffrey Tambor) and their two adult sons (Kevin Rahm, Eric
Schaeffer) _ who are a little out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's Relative'' is the second network series for
Clayburgh this season. She played the Irish-American matriarch of
the McCallister clan on NBC's short-lived drama ``Trinity,'' which
had good genes (created by John Wells of ``ER'') but poor health
(nobody watched).
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Clayburgh said she wouldn't have considered
doing a series. But now that her two children are teenagers (13 and
16), she said she's less worried about spending time away from them
and the family home in the hills of northwestern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinity'' was perfect for her because it was filmed in New
York. Her contract on ``Everything's Relative,'' should it go back
into production this summer, allows her to stop work at 2 p.m.
Friday so she can be back in New England by Friday night. And
working the standard three-weeks-on, one-week-off sitcom schedule
will make the absences even more bearable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``shocked'' and ``disappointed'' by the cancellation of
``Trinity,'' Clayburgh seems quite unconcerned about whether
``Everything's Relative'' will have a life beyond four episodes.
NBC won't announce its fall plans until next month and its
executives are mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get hysterical about what's going to happen in three
years,'' she said calmly. ``It's not very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a pro. Obviously, Clayburgh hasn't forgotten an
earlier experience in TV. Thirty years ago, before her film career
started, she appeared in the soap opera ``Search for Tomorrow.''
Though the series ran 35 years, Clayburgh's character, Grace
Bolton, died of a brain tumor after one season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Gorelick family survives past its brief tryout,
Clayburgh's intelligent approach will deserve some of the credit.
But don't ask her to explain her motivation or her method.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't describe myself as an actress,'' she said. ``I let
other people do that. I just try to act.''

NEVER ENOUGH WORDS TO SATISFY THE MAVENRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Noah Webster, the political activist, journalist and educator
who began his lexicographic career in the tempestuous Federal era,
asked Basil Hall, a British naval officer, why he considered all
American contributions to the English language unworthy. Hall's
reply: ``Because there are enough words already.''
</P>
<P>
   There are never enough words. That colloquy comes from a doozy
of a book being published this week titled ``Never Enough Words''
(Random House, $25), by Jeffrey McQuain, who has been both a
researcher and an occasional bylined contributor in this space for
15 years. (He teaches me grammar; I teach him mavenry.  &UR; Mavenry &LR;  is
a new word, coined five seconds ago because I couldn't come up with
a way to express aficionadohood, connoisseurship or state of
specialized enthusiasm. Never enough.)
</P>
<P>
   Interest in coinage, or neology, is closely akin to etymology,
the history of coinage and semantic development. In today's
future-oriented tummeling toward the millennium, you think this
glance backward is  &UR; small potatoes &LR; ? McQuain points us to the first
definition of that British phrase, from a Boston newspaper in 1831:
``When a person is guilty of a mean action, or takes much pains to
make himself ridiculous, it is often said in relation to the
circumstance, ` &UR; small potatoes &LR;  _ rather small potatoes, and few in
a hill.'''
</P>
<P>
   That led the language maven to the opposite meaning of a garden
phrase,  &UR; some pumpkins &LR;  (with the gourd's name from the French
 &UR; pompon &LR; , ``melon,'' usually pronounced  &UR; punkins &LR; ). During our
Revolutionary times,  &UR; pumpkin head &LR;  insulted New Englanders obeying
the Blue Laws that enjoined males to have their hair cut round by a
cap. When a cap or bowl was not available, the shell of a pumpkin
was used, and  &UR; pumpkin head &LR;  was a phrase of derision. With the
addition in 1846 of  &UR; some &LR; , however, the meaning was reversed, and
the politicians so described were considered highly praiseworthy.
</P>
<P>
   I called McQuain's book a  &UR; doozy &LR; , meaning ``a stunning example,
a wow.'' I've speculated that its origin is in the Duesenberg
automobile of the early '30s, but according to the etymologist
Gerald Cohen, that word may be an alteration of  &UR; daisy &LR; , influenced
by the Italian actress Eleonora Duse early in the 20th century (a
chronological term that used to connote modernity).
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, often collaborating with Barry Popik, publishes a
mimeographed 16-page ``Comments on Etymology'' from the hallway
outside his office at the University of Missouri-Rolla. (Address,
Rolla, Mo., 65401; annual subscription, $13 for eight issues, and
how far wrong can you go at less than two bucks a shot?) He is a
superb phrasedick, advertising for and reporting on origins of
current slang expressions.
</P>
<P>
   For example,  &UR; to hit on &LR;  takes the phrase  &UR; to come on to &LR; , or
``sexually approach,'' to an unwanted level; when a predatory male
 &UR; hits on &LR;  a woman, he harasses her and she considers him a  &UR; lech &LR; 
(pronounced ``letch,'' from  &UR; lecher &LR; , rooted in the Germanic
 &UR; leckon &LR; , ``to lick''). What is the source of the expression?  &UR; Hit &LR; 
in Standard English is a verb meaning ``strike,'' and in slang  &UR; hit
up &LR;  has long meant ``to seek a loan from,'' figuratively once
removed from striking. But whence  &UR; hit on &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   One of Cohen's colleagues, a chemistry professor named Gary
Bertrand, is a fisherman and provided a source of speculation. ``If
fish are nibbling or biting at the bait without taking the hook,''
reports Cohen, ``the fisherman may say that the fish are  &UR; hitting
on &LR;  the bait.'' Is the problem solved?
</P>
<P>
   Could be. After citations come in from the Izaak Walton mavenry,
we'll reopen that can of worms. Never enough words.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEPREFIXERS
</P>
<P>
   Stimulated by a recent piece about  &UR; couth &LR; ,  &UR; kempt &LR;  and
 &UR; gruntled &LR; , a new division of the Lexicographic Irregulars has
formed itself: The Deprefixers.
</P>
<P>
   My former Times colleague David Burnham, now with Syracuse
University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, is one. He
notes the poet John Milton's use, in ``Paradise Lost,'' of ``Not
 &UR; nocent &LR;  yet, but on the grassy Herb,'' with  &UR; nocent &LR;  (``harmful'')
the near-opposite of  &UR; innocent &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Norman Hyman of Milwaukee sends a 1994 New Yorker article by
Jack Winter: ``I was  &UR; furling &LR;  my  &UR; wieldy &LR;  umbrella when I saw ...
a  &UR; descript &LR;  person, a woman in a state of total  &UR; array &LR; . Her hair
was  &UR; kempt &LR; , her clothing  &UR; shevelled &LR; , and she moved in a  &UR; gainly &LR; 
way.'' His reaction: ``I was  &UR; plussed &LR; . It was  &UR; concerting &LR;  to see
that she was  &UR; communicado &LR; , and it  &UR; nerved &LR;  me that she was
interested in a  &UR; pareil &LR;  like me. ... I acted with  &UR; mitigated &LR;  gall
and made my way through the  &UR; ruly &LR;  crowd with strong  &UR; givings &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Berg of Madison, Wis., and Barbara Scholl of New York
directed me to the leading muse of the Deprefixers, the poet
Felicia Lamport. In both her ``Scrap Irony'' and ``Light Metres,''
she deprefixed furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamport, now 83, graciously gave me permission through her
husband to run her pioneering play:
</P>
<P>
   ``Life would be such a nice  &UR; broglio &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Running so smoothly and  &UR; mok &LR; ,
</P>
<P>
   If I had a nice portfolio
</P>
<P>
   Full of negotiable stock.
</P>
<P>
   And if it were tax-exempt,
</P>
<P>
   I would be  &UR; gruntled &LR;  and  &UR; kempt &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   But that was only getting started. Then came such an outpouring
of deprefixed delight not since matched:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing gives rise to such wild surmise/As the  &UR; peachable &LR; 
widow with  &UR; consolate &LR;  eyes.'' And: ``The  &UR; iquitous &LR;  girl often
loses her balance/When wooed by a man with unusual  &UR; chalance &LR; .''
And: ``Men often pursue in suitable style/The  &UR; imical &LR;  girl with
the  &UR; scrutable &LR;  smile.''

 &HT;    HUD CHASTISED FOR EMPOWERMENT ZONES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Months after a federal audit criticized Atlanta and
three other cities for major flaws in their ``empowerment zones,''
an internal report says the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development failed to exert ``adequate controls'' over the program.
</P>
<P>
   HUD has yet to assess 1997 findings of misspent dollars in the
program, said an audit issued last week by the department's
inspector general. The concept of empowerment zones, which use
grants and tax breaks to boost the economies of low-income
neighborhoods, has become one of the most visible anti-poverty
initiatives of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton late last year ordered an expansion of the
five-year-old program to 15 additional urban neighborhoods and five
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general report said that the empowerment zone
staff was so ``busy planning for the second round of Zone
designations'' that HUD declined to assess problems at the four
earlier sites.
</P>
<P>
   An audit released last fall concluded that four cities were
making ``little or no progress'' in carrying out their strategic
plans for empowerment zones, or that their programs did not always
benefit the targeted residents.
</P>
<P>
   That report recommended that the Atlanta program repay $1.1
million in grants for activities such as relocating businesses from
other locations in the city. Chicago, Detroit and Philadelphia also
have been asked to return some of their funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new report called on HUD to review progress of the four
cities. ``If the Cities are found not making the necessary
progress, then HUD should issue warning letters to the Cities based
upon the lack of progress as required,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. housing officials strenuously disputed the inspector
general's findings, saying they ``smacked of nitpicking'' and
arguing that they are based on a ``fundamental misunderstanding of
the design and purposes'' of the empowerment zone program.
</P>
<P>
   Further, housing officials said they have contacted the four
cities, offering reassurances that if the cities can justify the
spending, they will not have to return the funds.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ Military and political developments
in the ongoing Balkans crisis. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWS _ WASHINGTON _ The three American soldiers held
captive by Yugoslav military leaders have been trained to resist
their captors by strictly adhering to a rigid code of conduct
summarized in 10 sentences on a wallet card every soldier carries.
While pilots and others who operate behind enemy lines get
extensive survival training for life as a POW, those less likely to
be captured rely almost exclusively on their conviction to follow
the code of conduct and ``return with honor.'' (Montgomery, Cox
News Service)

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWS-EXCERPTS.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ TIRANA, Albania _ Developments here and in
Western capitals as the refugee crisis along Kosovo's borders
continues to worsen. (Roughton and Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-JOURNAL _ MONTENEGRO, Yugoslavia _ It was a typical day
in Montenegro. We were suspected of being spies. Then armed
soldiers showed up at the apartment building where we are staying.
When we explained to them that we were journalists, not spies, one
of them assured our translator: ``No one will kill them in
Montenegro . . . not for now, at least.'' Tensions remain high _
especially for Western journalists _ in this province of
Yugoslavia. (Holmes, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-GOVERNOR _ MEXICO-CITY _ Rumor has it he may have fled
the country in a speedboat he received from a drug trafficker. Or
he may be hiding in some corner of Mexico. Or he might even be dead
because of the secrets he possesses. Mario Villanueva, ex-governor
of Quintana Roo state, is not expected to show up at the
inauguration of his successor Monday evening _ fueling speculation
he has fled justice before Mexico's Attorney General even filed
drug-trafficking charges against him. Villanueva _ an embarrasment
to the ruling PRI party _ is the highest-ranking Mexican politician
to be investigated so vigorously while still in office. He's now
missing along with a police commander from his state, and an
investigation into Swiss bank accounts and other dubious
acquisitions continues. Villanueva's indictment could be a coup for
Mexican justice, which is struggling for credibility. But if the
government presents a persuasive case that he's guilty _ but has
fled _ it could be viewed as another failure. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service)
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   FED-FINANCIAL _ WASHINGTON _ Suppose a major corporation sent
out an annual report confessing to problems with fundamental
record-keeping that kept the company from accurately reporting a
significant portion of its assets, liabilities, and costs. Suppose
that same company admitted that last year, it wrote checks for
billions of dollars in improper payments, had only a rough estimate
of its loans, and lacked adequate records for a majority of its
buildings, facilities and equipment. That is the financial
condition of the U.S. government and its 24 major separtments and
agencies, according to the 1998 financial audit released quietly
last week. (Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   FAA-COMPUTERS _ WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration
on Saturday will test the air traffic system's ability to keep
working when the year 2000 begins. Using a Lear jet flown from
Grand Junction, Colo., the FAA will run a simulation of air traffic
as if the date were Dec. 31. (Glass, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   HUD-EMPOWER _ WASHINGTON _ The inspector general of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has suggested ways to
improve HUD's oft-criticized empowerment zone program, but
officials rejected the suggestions as ``invalid.'' (Malone, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   SEC-WALKER _ WASHINGTON _ The Securities and Exchange Commission
is ``stretched pretty thin now,'' but is bent on leaving Internet
fraud artists ``naked, homeless, and without modem,'' the agency's
chief enforcement officer said Monday. (McNaughton, Cox News

<P>
   UGAPPLY _ More students are applying to UGA this year, but that
means that more will end up being turned away. The result:
President Michael Adams is getting lots of complaints from parents
who want their children to attend UGA. (McCarthy, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   GA-TRANSPORTATION _ ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes on Tuesday will
sign the cornerstone of his first-year legislative package, a
regional transportaton authority to take on metro Atlanta's air
pollution and gridlock problems. (Pruitt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CARDINAL _ ATLANTA _ Cardinal Francis Arinze, a Roman Catholic
Cardinal originally from Nigeria who is on the short-list as a
successor to Pope John Paul II, is visiting Atlanta on Monday and
Tuesday. Monday eveningthere will be a prayer &AMP; benediction service
with Atlanta Archbishop John Donoghue, and probably with Father

   TEXLEGIS-AUTOINSURANCE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Paying for auto
insurance by the mile? That's the proposal by a Fort Worth lawmaker
who says it will help make auto insurance affordable for low-income
families. ``If the state makes drivers buy insurance, we should
give them a way to control insurance costs.'' Burnam plans a

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 COLUMN: MONICA STUFF IS A BUST
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, April 7.)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been searching night and day for the good that has
supposedly come out of the Clinton scandal and I think, at last,
I've found it: Monica Lewinsky memorabilia _ even the really tacky
stuff _ is not selling well.
</P>
<P>
   I will leave it to the pundits to decide whether our democracy
has been strengthened or weakened by the scandal; what, if any,
damage the office of the president has sustained and how long, if
at all, we must continue to endure Barbara Walters' celebrity
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is if the American people, after going through all
this, are reluctant to spend their hard-earned money on Monica
Bobbing Dolls or Monica Lewinsky Down-On-Your-Knees Hot Sauce, then
there is hope for our great nation after all.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in The Washington Post by David Segal,
entrepreneurs who hoped to use our national disgrace for personal
enrichment have been sorely disappointed. Tim Flynn of New Jersey
has been pushing Monica Lewinsky ties on the Internet but so far
has yet to sell one.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not because the ties aren't sufficiently tacky. The
$7.89, Korean-made ties feature a cigar, a brunette humanoid who
could be Monica or, perhaps, Marlo Thomas, and the word ``Tabu''
blaring out from a cheesy, fire-engine-red polyester blend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a bomb,'' Flynn said. ``Everybody thinks Monica is hot,
and it's a big fallacy. After a certain amount of time, this stuff
is going to be worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   That certain amount of time may have expired. Why is Monica
kitsch selling so poorly? Experts say Americans are keeping their
wallets and pocketbooks tightly shut because the whole scandal was
just too ... unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. A country that tripped over itself buying velour
Elvis wall hangings, Pope John Paul lawn sprinklers and Spiro
Agnew/Mickey Mouse wristwatches has some standards after all. Low
standards, admittedly, but standards nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I hear what you're saying. You're saying, ``Dave, it's one
thing to pass on Monica Lewinsky's Down-On-Your-Knees Hot Sauce _
there are, after all, a lot of other quality hot sauces out there _
but what if Monica gets her famous blue Gap dress back and decides
to sell it? What kind of standards will we have then, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   A good question and a fair question. For an answer let us hear
from Vredy Lytsman, a spokeswoman for the august, prestigious
auction house, Christie's: ``We're an established business, and
there are just certain things where you have to draw the line. Even
if there were a lot of money in it, we wouldn't do it. It's just
unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention pretty darn nasty.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is not to say that some people aren't buying some
Monica memorabilia. A Seattle company, MMD Global Marketing Inc.,
has sold a few thousand Monica yo-yos. The yo-yos, which cost
$14.95, have the president's caricature on one side and Monica's on
the other. Each comes with a booklet of helpful hints about tricks
like ``robbing the cradle'' and ``around the office.''
</P>
<P>
   A $49 set of Russian nesting dolls bearing the likenesses of
Kenneth Starr, Henry Hyde, Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg is
also selling well, according to the Post story.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of sucker buys this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has invested a small fortune in baseball cards
only to see his collection depreciate steadily until it is now
barely worth its weight in bathroom tissue, I would seem a likely
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And I probably would have thrown away some money by now were it
not for the fact that Bobbing Head dolls give me a migraine and hot
sauce upsets my stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yos, though ... they sound pretty cool.

   LONDON _ It is that twilight hour when the table lamps are
lighted before the draperies are drawn closed, the time before
cocktails, when a late winter's afternoon surrenders meekly to
nightfall. At his secluded, almost secret home in a private corner
of Hampstead, John le Carre is talking about his best-selling new
novel, and the hour seems to suit this discussion of treachery and
transition.
</P>

   ``Single &AMP; Single'' is le Carre's 17th novel, and his latest to
break with the sorcery of the Cold War that once conjured the
titanic contests of George Smiley and Karla, his archetypes for the
battle of duplicitous Western virtue against the Soviet foe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the Cold War ended, fiction's old spies were
supposed to just go home and tend their wounds and memoirs. Not so
their creators.
</P>
<P>
   To them fell the task of finding new adversaries, new crusades
to supplant the decades of tilting at Moscow. The spymasters they
created, after all, built legends for their ``joes,'' the scripts
by which agents lived their double lives. Now they must find new
legends for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John le Carre _ the name is the pseudonym of David Cornwell _
has found one, paradoxically enough, in the very system that
triumphed over Communism, turning the battle on its head. In
``Single &AMP; Single'' (Scribner), the West itself nourishes both
antagonist and protagonist: for Western values, read unbridled
capitalism; for the KGB and its hoods, read upper-crust Western
financiers run amok in harness with Caucasian thuggery and the
Russian mob.
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect, heroism by any conventional standard is
elusive: even the dominant, central character _ Oliver Single,
errant son of archcapitalist Tiger Single _ is a traitor to his
father, a mole burrowing under the foundations of the pin-striped
class that nurtured him. And in an upending of the class system
that pervaded many of le Carre's earlier novels, the erudite Smiley
has been replaced by Nat Brock, a customs and excise man with a
Merseyside twang to his voice and a rarely visited wife in the
suburbs: ``a man of layers, not all of them savory,'' as the novel
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Le Carre is a silver-haired 67 now. In his muted checked jacket
(with four buttons on the cuff, as is de rigueur among certain
Englishmen), his olive shirt and dark green tie, he could be a
retired civil service mandarin, a college professor, a ruminative
ex-spy gone comfortably to ground in a discreet corner of
Hampstead. He could have been any one of those if he had not become
Britain's paramount exponent of a kind of novel that is not easy to
classify.
</P>
<P>
   By his own frequent admission, he is a former member of what he
terms ``the secret world'' of British espionage, thus an initiate
in the corridors of British Establishment power, a learned man who
once taught at Eton after studies in Bern, Switzerland, and Oxford.
In his large home the easy comfort of the furnishings offset by
understated antiques is just as quintessentially English as the
four buttons on his jacket.)
</P>
<P>
   But what seems to come across in conversation is an inordinate
restlessness to define and catalog the new confusion that has come
in place of a new world order and to search for what he calls
``some kind of ethical standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a grand theme, I think, which is very much in my mind,
which is a political one,'' he said. ``As long as we had our Great
Satan, we could see ourselves in some kind of moral light. But when
that was removed, we were left with our own excesses. We have to
create some kind of ethical standard for ourselves _ I don't
believe that has happened at all _ some kind of self-restraint,
some acceptance that the global village is not capable of infinite
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just be carpetbaggers, exploiters,'' he added. That
theme, he said self-deprecatingly, ``was some kind of grand
pretentious vision'' underlying ``Single &AMP; Single.'' And this
period, the bull run of short-term investment capital to Russia
between glasnost and last year's debt crisis, ``was the little wave
of history I wanted to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   For le Carre aficionados the book is far more than that. It is,
the author said, a kind of companion volume to his work of almost
13 years ago, ``A Perfect Spy,'' in which he came closest to
allowing the pseudonym's mask to slip to reveal David Cornwell's
anguished relationship with his father, a matter that preoccupies
him still, for all his 67 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Cornwell, the real father, ``had a criminal record, was a
confidence trickster by profession,'' le Carre said, and the
peripatetic life of restless movings-on and deceit has stamped him
indelibly. The matter is unavoidable in le Carre's work, even
though Tiger Single is not as recognizably Ronnie Cornwell as the
father depicted in ``A Perfect Spy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a theme that runs through many of them,'' he said of his
books. ``Why did I, as a chap of 29 years old, invent a hero of
Smiley's age, and somebody of such flawed perfection as Smiley?
Perhaps he was the dad I wished I had had.'' His childhood plays
out in other ways. Ask him why so many of his fictional women are
fleeting players _ like the wife of the customs agent, Brock,
forever offstage in ``Single &AMP; Single'' _ and he will tell you that
he has ``got better at women'' after a difficult start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my childhood there were no girls, no sisters, no mother.
Such a nomadic life: all-male schools until I ran away from
Sherborne. Then the army. Then when I went into the secret world,
in those days it was very much a man's world.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is another tricky theme: ``I'm not very good
at America. I think I would have had to live there much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He defines his secret world by negatives rather than by any
clear exposition of what kind of spying he did. ``I was never an
East-West spy runner, but it's a piece of my image I can't
escape,'' he said, suggesting that his role was more modest than
his legend suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Yevgeny Primakov, a former KGB warhorse and now
Russia's prime minister, at a Russian Embassy dinner long after the
Cold War, le Carre said, ``I felt I should have been more of a spy
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But his secret years did provide the mother lode of his public
life as a writer. ``I just knew that in writing terms I had found
my material, my microcosm,'' he said, ``and all I had to do was to
move it into a literary context.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Carre strongly resents any comparison with former adversaries
in espionage, like Markus Wolf, the onetime East German spymaster
who has escaped every post-Cold War attempt to prosecute him. And
if people like Wolf linger as the enemy, there are other hostile
forces caught in le Carre's sights.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly surprisingly for an author of such established stature
and such readership, there is an all too easily evoked, prickly
sense that British letters do not accord the kind of recognition
due someone of his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country, there seems to be a literary academy somewhere,
and a readership somewhere else,'' he said, harking back to the
mass audiences of 19th-century English novelists that were no
stigma. ``It's fairly recently that the literary bureaucracy is at
one end of the spectrum and the popular readership is at the other
end of the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   He is fretful, too, about the power of the news media, of the
demonizing sound bite and the spin-doctoring of information in an
age of new adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think unbridled capitalism is an enemy, and I think the
greatest single enemy is the misuse of information, the perversion
of truth in the hands of terribly skillful people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacture and distribution of the sophisticated lie must
be one of the worst legacies of the Cold War,'' he said, bemoaning
the mental tyranny ``where there is only one respectable opinion
about anything.'' He added: ``If you don't have it, you are on the
wrong side of the fence. But I don't know what fence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There have been skirmishes, too, within the literary
establishment from which le Carre seems to feel apart. In November
1997, for instance, he was caught up in a bruising exchange of
letters in The Guardian with Salman Rushdie. Last year he ditched
his American publisher of long standing, Alfred A. Knopf, and
switched agents.
</P>
<P>
   The spats and irritations, though, are not what draw the
faithful to le Carre. Rather it is the distinctive voice that runs
through most of his books, a control of tone and shading that is,
to borrow from the books, his tradecraft. ``With this palette,
everything is possible, whatever you call it: a spy story, a story
of political suspense,'' he said. ``The form is limitless. I don't
feel I have got to go and find something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the actual writing, though, it is not too fanciful to
imagine the public author and his covert characters fusing in the
writer's quest for a spy's cover. He mentions eavesdropping on
British business types in an ``all-day, all-night bar'' in Moscow
and how, on one of three trips to Georgia for ``Single &AMP; Single,''
he recounts, the gunfire from an attempt to assassinate Eduard A.
Shevardnadze roused him from his bed in a boardinghouse, leading
him to grab his passport and think, ``Here's trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is le Carre, incognito, spying out the landscape of
his new novel from the ``eyeline'' of his characters. Heading off
from Tbilisi into the hills of Mingrelia ``wearing a woolly cap and
taking a bodyguard _ I mean taking two blokes with you _ you are
not going to be recognized by anyone,'' he said.

CLINTON TALKS TO FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS HELD IN YUGOSLAVIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
and ALLAN TURNER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) President Clinton has telephoned families of the three
U.S. servicemen being held in Yugoslavia and told them the
administration believes the soldiers will not face trial by
President Slobodan Milosevic's government, White House officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Julia Payne said that Clinton, in the
calls, was conveying ``the sense out of Belgrade,'' the Yugoslav
capital, and had ``no independent confirmation'' from the Milosevic
government about the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Texas native Spc. Steven Gonzales, at least, may
have taken the president's comments more literally.
</P>
<P>
   Texas prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald, who has been a media
representative for Gonzales's family in Huntsville, described the
call Sunday afternoon from Clinton to the soldiers' parents,
Gilbert and Rosie Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reassured them that the government was doing everything it
possibly could,'' Fitzgerald said. ``He informed them Steven had
been classified as a POW and that he wouldn't have to stand
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in his daily briefing
only that Clinton ``made some phone calls to some military
families'' while at the Camp David presidential retreat over the
Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart subsequently identified the families as those of the
three captives but refused to discuss the substance of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   After being told of the Gonzales' apparent interpretation of the
conversation with the president, Payne said Clinton was referring
to ``the indications out of Belgrade,'' including comments from an
official of the Milosevic regime on a U.S. television interview
program Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said the Milosevic government had refused to deal with
Swedish representatives in Belgrade, whom Washington appointed as
its contact in the Yugoslav capital when diplomatic relations were
broken as a result of the U.S.-led NATO aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Payne also said the Milosevic government had refused to allow
independent access to the soldiers, including visits by the
International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   In his calls, Clinton was apparently referring to Milan Bozic,
deputy mayor of Belgrade and a minister without portfolio in the
Milosevic government. On ABC's This Week, Bozic said the captives
will be treated well and not face trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they will not be tried, and they will be back in
their homes as soon as this stupidity stops,'' Bozic said,
referring to the airstrike in reprisal for Milosevic's campaign
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav media outlets had predicted legal action against the
soldiers could come as soon as last Friday, but there has been no
subsequent authoritative update.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said that while Bozic's comments
were heartening, it was uncertain how authoritative they were. He
also said the Milosevic government could change its mind quickly on
how to deal with the captive soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were picked up Wednesday along the
Yugoslavia-Macedonia border during what NATO described as a routine
reconnaissance mission. Officials of the Belgrade regime have said
that the soldiers were in Yugoslavia. A NATO official has said the
three men were in Macedonia, a position the Pentagon first adopted.
Subsequently, the Department of Defense has said the location of
the men was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gonzales, the captive soldiers are Staff Sgt.
Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.

   NEW YORK _ Designers from Valentino to Marc Jacobs went romantic
for spring, with pretty notions like the peasant blouse, the
ultra-feminine alternative to the ubiquitous T-shirt. Bergdorf
Goodman has two sheer cotton peasant blouses by Jacobs: a
cap-sleeved dot print ($365) and a three-quarter-sleeved solid in
pale blue, lilac or white ($400). A cap-sleeved cotton blouse in
pink or white by Theory is $135.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus has several styles by Anna Sui, including a glazed
cotton print ($175), a silk print ($205), a pale blue denim ($135)
and a pinstripe cotton ($170). There are also two cotton blouses by
Les Prairies ($130 and $165), and a dotted swiss by Rebecca Taylor
($150). An embroidered white cotton nightshirt by Katherine
Harestad is $185.
</P>
<P>
   In the peasant mood at Henri Bendel: a checked shantung dress by
Stephen DiGeronimo ($178) and a Liberty print bustier by Shoshanna
($178).

WHITE HOUSE OPENS DOOR TO ALLIED GROUND TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, moving to deflect an anticipated
plea for a cease-fire from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
vowed on Monday an ``undiminished, unceasing and unrelenting''
allied air campaign against Yugoslav armed forces until Milosovic
meets tough conditions for ending the 14-day offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to persist until we prevail,'' Clinton declared as
he launched a stepped-up refugee relief effort dubbed ``Operation
Sustain Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``We are prepared to sustain this effort for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said allied bombing would continue until Milosevic
withdraws Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, ceases attacks on ethnic
Albanian Muslims in Kosovo, agrees to autonomy for the province,
permits an international security force and clears the way for
immediate repatriation of 505,000 refugees who have fled to
Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Milosevic does not do what is necessary, NATO will
continue an air campaign. It will be undiminished, unceasing and
unrelenting,'' the president declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as senior administration officials cracked the
door for the first time to the possible movement of allied ground
troops into Kosovo to protect stranded refugees there.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said troops could enter
Kosovo if Yugoslav forces posed no ``risk'' or as the result of
``some sort of deal'' with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have previously ruled out the
use of allied ground forces inside Kosovo without a signed
agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon laid the groundwork for possible creation of an
allied-protected refugee sanctuary in southern Kosovo with
preparations to send 24 Apache anti-tank attack helicopters and 18
long-range rocket launchers to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Both the helicopters and a long-range version of the rockets
launched by the Multiple Launch Rocket System have the range to
cover the entire territory of Kosovo to protect any allied troops
dispatched into the mountainous terrain to help refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman said Clinton anticipates a move for a
cease fire from Milosevic in coming days because Yugoslav forces
have made great progress toward achieving the Serbian leader's goal
of eliminating ethnic Albanian Muslims from the Yugoslav-run
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be a surprise to see in the coming days attempts
at half measures, hollow cease-fires,'' Lockhart said, adding:
``They will not be acceptable to stop the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon declared: ``Milosevic may think
he's finished. We will not be finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended administration preparations to deal with the
flood of refugees unleashed in the wake of the allied bombing
campaign that began 13 days ago. Clinton said that it had been
``impossible to prepare fully for the chaos'' that stemmed from
Milosevic's campaign of ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States was shipping 500,000 individual
daily rations to the estimated 244,000 refugees crowded into
Albania and would begin shipping 600,000 rations requested by
Macedonia to feed an estimated 136,000 Kosovar refugees there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said another 65,000 Kosovars continue languishing
without adequate food or shelter in no-man's land between Kosovo
and Macedonia _ the site of some of the most heart-rending news
photographs in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do all we can to aid the victims of Mr.
Milosevic's expulsion policy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration agreed on Sunday to provide temporary
refuge for 20,000 refugees as part of a NATO-wide effort to absorb
100,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania and Macedonia to free space for
additional Kosovar refugees still trying to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman said that the United States would
probably provide temporary housing to up to 20,000 Kosovar refugees
at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where some 45,000
Haitian refugees were housed during an earlier U.S. refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged concerned Americans to telephone their donations
to a newly established governor-sponsored toll free number _
1-800-US-AID-RELIEF.

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ NATO forces waging an air war against
Yugoslavia also acted as a ``good Samaritan'' on Monday, beginning
an airlift of some of the 230,000 ethnic Albanians who have fled
their homes in Kosovo in the past 13 days to escape death at the
hands of Serbian soldiers and police.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a plane carrying the first 150 refugees landed in
western Turkey, President Clinton and his NATO allies emphasized
that moving the refugees to safe havens in allied countries is only
a temporary response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethnic cleansing of Kosovo cannot stand as a permanent
event,'' Clinton said during a brief appearance in the Roosevelt
Room of the White House to announce ``Operation Sustain Hope,'' a
stepped-up effort to help the Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees belong in their own homes on their own land,'' he
said. ``Our immediate goal is to provide relief. Our long-term goal
is to give them their right to return.''
</P>
<P>
   To better coordinate the humanitarian assistance, Clinton
established a panel headed by Brian Atwood, the administrator of
the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). In addition,
he ordered a toll-free telephone number for private citizens who
want to help: 1-800-USAID RELIEF (cq.).
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO wants to be a good Samaritan,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
said in Brussels, ``but we are not a refugee organization.''
Consequently, NATO has turned to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to coordinate assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged that western governments appreciate the
enormity of the refugee drama, which can no longer be handled by
Kosovo's immediate neighbors alone,'' High Commissioner Sadako
Ogata said in a statement from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In the first wave of humanitarian assistance by NATO, allied
aircraft delivered nearly 200 tons of food and emergency supplies
to refugees in Albania and Macedonia. NATO called the relief
flights a ``humanitarian air bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the continuing flow of refugees out of Kosovo is
threatening to overwhelm Albania and Macedonia, where most of these
fleeing have gathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that can be said is that the situation is critical,''
Albanian President Rexhep Meidana said in an interview Monday.
``I'm quite sure this flow will continue and in the next days there
will be many, many more refugees in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Meidana said he does not support plans by NATO to
temporarily place more than 100,000 refugees in other countries.
There is a fear here that the refugees may never come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must remain near their land and their houses,'' Meidana
said. ``They must return to Kosovo as soon as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the refugees will never return to their homes in Kosovo
unless there are NATO troops in the province to maintain their
security. He also said he supports the use of ground troops to
drive the Serb forces out of the province _ a contingency opposed
by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   On the humanitarian side, a small contingent of U.S. troops
began to set up a camp near the Tirana airport handle relief
operations. The United States plans to send at least 6,000 troops
to distribute food and supplies to refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the NATO airlift of refugees, the United States has
agreed to accept up to 20,000 people. ``Our goal is to take some of
the burden off the struggling front line nations,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at the State Department and the Pentagon acknowledged
that the 20,000 refugees the United States has agreed to host may
be housed at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo, Cuba.

HANCOCK AMONG INSURERS GIVEN OK TO SELL IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Boston
joined three Western insurers Monday in winning approval from
Beijing to sell life insurance in China.
</P>
<P>
   The move gives Hancock, one of three US insurers now approved,
and other competitors an early toehold in a market that could prove
vast and profitable once fully opened up. The approvals bring to 13
the number of foreign insurers licensed to operate in the Asian
country, where markets for financial services, especially
insurance, are still tightly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted by this news,'' Hancock chief executive
Stephen L. Brown said in a statement. ``China is the major emerging
market for US financial institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   With an aging population and creaky pension system, the Chinese
market is seen as a new insurance frontier as US and European
markets mature. China, with a population of 1.3 billion, has more
than 130 million people aged 60 or over.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's working investment in the world's most populous
country will be small _ around $12.5 million and one office in one
city. The company, which already has four representative offices in
four major Chinese cities, must now wait for the government to name
its Chinese joint venture partner and designate the city in which
it will sell its products.
</P>
<P>
   China, which insists outside insurers form joint ventures so
that domestic players will not be crowded out of the market, has so
far restricted foreign insurers to Shanghai and the southern city
of Guangzhou. Foreign insurers must open representative offices
before seeking formal sales licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock _ the nation's 13th-largest life insurer and the biggest
in Massachusetts _ plans to focus on life insurance, with a view to
branching out into other investment products, including mutual and
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets in China are undeveloped but growing rapidly,''
said Derek Chilvers, who heads Hancock's international operations.
``There's a general expectation that the government will accelerate
their opening.'' He gave no forecasts of sales revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and the others _ Chubb Corp. of the United States, Sun
Life Insurance Co. of Canada, and Britain's Prudential Corp. _
received their license approvals on the eve of Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji's planned visit to Canada and the United States. The nods
also came as China seeks support for its application to enter the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, with $120 billion in assets under management, is the
third US insurer, after American International Group (AIG) and
Aetna Group, to work in China. Some 20 US insurance companies have
opened representative offices in China and are lobbying for
licenses.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When their refugee resettlement agency
folded, the Bosnian mother and her four children were virtually
stranded in their Fort Worth apartment, left with just a few pieces
of furniture and no community support. It was in their plight that
Pat Friar and scores of fellow members at St. Paul's Lutheran
Church in Fort Worth discovered a thriving ministry. Three years
later, Friar, a volunteer, coordinates a thriving refugee ministry
at St. Paul's. Last week, Friar and other church members drove to
Dallas//Fort Worth Airport to greet their 18th refugee family, this
one from Bosnia. Thus began the now-familiar process of guiding the
newcomers through the difficult adjustment to Texas and America. By

STUDY POINTS TO BINGE DRINKING AMONG ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   College students aren't the only ones with drinking problems.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7 percent of elderly Americans are heavy drinkers and
about 4 percent are regular binge drinkers, according to a national
survey released Monday. Half of those binge drinkers say they
consume that much _ five or more alcoholic beverages _ every time
they drink.
</P>
<P>
   While those rates are lower than ones in recent surveys of
college students, they may be even more dangerous. That's because
the elderly are more vulnerable to alcohol-induced conditions
ranging from delerium to low blood pressure, and they are more
likely to be taking drugs that can be harmful when mixed with
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``More older people than you ever could conceive of are drinking
at levels that may be hazardous to their health,'' says Dr. Alison
A. Moore, assistant professor of medicine at UCLA and lead author
of the report in this month's Journal of the American Geriatrics
Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should realize that drinking gets more problematic when
you're older, particularly when you're taking medications for
things like high blood pressure and arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco, chief of general medicine at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and former director of the
Commonwealth/Harvard Alcohol Education and Research Program, says
the new study should set off alarms: ``Doctors are very poor at
eliciting honest reports from their patients about their drinking,
and they also often forget that it takes much less alcohol to get
an older patient into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who drank three to four drinks a day and never
showed anything can break his hip after a glass of wine when he is
old and infirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA report, the most comprehensive ever on alcohol use
among the elderly, was based on a national survey of 3,448 people
65 and older who participated in the first phase of the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. While those figures date
back to 1982, this is the first time results on elderly drinking
have been published and smaller surveys since then suggest habits
have remained consistent in the intervening years.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of those questioned said they had consumed 12
or more drinks during at least one year of their lives, and 79
percent of those said that over the last year they'd had at least
one 12-ounce beer, 5-ounce glass of wine or a drink with 1.5 ounces
of spirits. Among current drinkers, 77 percent drank at least once
a month and 25 percent reported drinking every day.
</P>
<P>
   Nine percent of elderly drinkers said they had consumed five
drinks at a sitting _ the definition of binge drinking _ at least
12 times over the last year. And more than 4 percent of elderly
drinkers said they had five or more drinks every time they consumed
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   That is considerably less than the 43 percent of college
students who said they were binge drinkers in a 1997 survey by the
Harvard School of Public Health. But the prevalence among the
elderly ``still is large, I'm surprised,'' said Dr. Henry Wechsler,
who headed the Harvard study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to take a look at heavy drinking across all age
groups, including those 65 and older,'' added Wechsler. ``Such
drinking presents problems for the drinkers and for those in their
neighborhood and their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems Wechsler, Moore and others worry about are
the way alcohol can impair acuity while driving, which already
oftentimes is diminished among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   It typically takes less alcohol to raise the blood alcohol level
in older people than in younger ones, because the elderly have less
lean body mass and less water content in their bodies with which to
dilute the alcohol. That means that binge drinking in the elderly
probably should be defined as having three to four drinks at once,
Moore said, compared to the five-drink standard used in her survey
and the one for college students. Using the lower standards, binge
drinking among the elderly is twice as prevalent as it is with five
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and her colleagues used a level of more than one drink a
day to define heavy drinking for elderly women, whereas it was more
than two a day for men, because women tend to have lower body
weight and face a greater risk of ailments like cirrhosis at low
levels of alcohol consumption.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a level of alcohol consumption that is okay and can
produce such benefits as lowering the risk of heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   ``One drink a day,'' Moore says, ``generally is a safe range for
all old people.''

 &HT;    Williams running backs story
 &HT;    (EDS: Info box at end of story.)
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great running backs don't necessarily arrive in the NFL with a
flourish, Heisman trophy winner Ricky Williams acknowledged last
week, . As evidence, the former Texas star noted the two dominant
rushers of the 1998 season, Terrell Davis from Denver and Atlanta's
Jamal Anderson, who were sixth- and seventh-round draft choices,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the nine NFL drafts have produced 29 first-round
backs, but only three of them have played in Super Bowls, and
Emmitt Smith is the only one to win a rushing title.
</P>
<P>
   The decade included more than its share of busts. Former
first-rounders Blair Thomas, Vaughn Dunbar, Tyrone Wheatley,
Rashaan Salaam, Ki-Jana Carter, Lawrence Phillips, Tony Smith,
Tshimanga Biakabutuka, Darrell Thompson and Dexter Carter have
rushed for a combined 12,141 yards and 79 touchdowns. By
comparison, Smith will enter 1999 with 12,566 yards and 125 scores.
</P>
<P>
   Despite knowing that history, Williams acknowledged that he is
more apt to be a guy like Smith than like another first-round
also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams seem to feel they can find the diamond in the rough
somewhere after the first round,'' said Williams, the all-time
Division I-A rushing leader who also scored more points and
touchdowns than anyone in college history. ``But if they want a
diamond who's already rough and ready _ then I'm their man.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, an ever-confident
Williams has been studied to excess by league scouts seeking flaws
in his game _ a penchant for fumbling, a postseason weight gain and
even the size of his hands. Williams fumbled 26 times in four years
at Texas, but he never lost one in the final 10 minutes of a game.
And while he had the smallest hands at the combine _ size 7 3/4 _
he still managed to catch 85 passes in his Longhorns career.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions about Williams, compounded by a record run on
quarterbacks at the beginning of the first round _ passers could be
the top three players selected _ has created a perception that his
draft stock has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   On some teams, cooler heads have prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only weakness I've seen is an inability to hit the
curveball,'' said Terry Bradway, the Kansas City personnel man,
referring to Williams' failed flirtation with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, coach Mike Ditka is prepared to offer all six of
his choices in this year's draft, along with first- and
third-rounders in 2000, for a shot at Williams. ``He's like (Earl)
Campbell and Walter Payton,'' Ditka said. ``He doesn't have
anything to prove to me. I've seen more than enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining skeptics should get an eyeful today, when Williams
works out in San Diego for league scouts.
</P>
<P>
   His weight is down to 225 pounds, said Tom Shaw, a New
Orleans-based ``performance enchancement specialist'' who trained
Williams. That's 19 pounds less than he weighed at the combine,
when his puffiness alarmed scouts, and 12 pounds under his
bowl-game weight. Shaw has predicted that Williams will run under
4.5 seconds for the 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Previewing the running backs
</P>
<P>
   1. Ricky Williams (RB)
</P>
<P>
   Texas 5-10-3/4, 227
</P>
<P>
   Despite naysayers, Heisman winner still is safest pick in entire
draft. Superproductive
</P>
<P>
   workhorse who will carry 25 times a game, should make immediate
impact. More fluid than he looks, decent change of direction,
finishes every run. Only negative is fumbling.
</P>
<P>
   2. Edgerrin James (RB)
</P>
<P>
   Miami (Fla.) 6-0, 216
</P>
<P>
   Smooth runner with deceptive speed for back with so much power.
Patient back, reads blocks well, runs with his pads low and can
make defenders miss. Has quick feet and will cut back in close
quarters. Very young, won't turn 21 until August, still maturing.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rob Konrad (FB)
</P>
<P>
   SYRACUSE 6-3, 251
</P>
<P>
   Often compared to Mike Alstott of Tampa Bay, but isn't as good a
lead-blocker, actually needs to improve in lead-block role. Might
be better in one-back set than as fullback. Is a straight-up runner
who needs to reduce fumbles. Good receiver, adjusts well to ball.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cecil Collins (RB)
</P>
<P>
   McNeese State 5-8-5/8, 209
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and spate of legal problems limited him to six games in
college, so he hasn't played much football over last two seasons.
Instinctive runner with powerful but squat build, strong legs.
Deceptive quickness and long speed. Beware his various court dates.
</P>
<P>
   5. James ``J.J.'' Johnson (RB)
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State 6-1-3/8, 227
</P>
<P>
   Superior physical specimen whose stock is rising. Aggressive
between the tackles and bleeds inside yardage. A little too upright
at times, gears down to make cuts and isn't very elusive. A little
older than you'd like, but willing worker who wants to get better.
</P>
<P>
   6. Kevin Faulk (RB)
</P>
<P>
   LSU 5-7-5/8, 205
</P>
<P>
   Height belies muscular upper body, strong legs and improved
toughness. Loose in hips, will change directions quickly and run
away from defenders. If he gets to the corner, it's trouble. Can do
a lot of things, returns punts and kickoffs and dangerous receiver.
</P>
<P>
   7. Amos Zeroue (RB)
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia 5-7-3/8, 203
</P>
<P>
   Built low to ground but very strong, can bench-press 500 pounds.
Remarkable balance and likes to use spin move to get out of
traffic. Big-play mentality and will take some losses looking for
long run. Some return skills but only average receiver and blocker.
</P>
<P>
   8. Sedrick Irvin (RB)
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State 5-10-3/4, 223
</P>
<P>
   Powerful lower body, but too often tries to dance past defenders
instead of blasting through them. Durable and competitive, with
naturally wide base. Might have softest hands of any back in draft.
Doesn't trust his own speed enough, gets caught from behind.
</P>
<P>
   9. Shawn Bryson (RB/FB)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee 6-0-1/2, 235
</P>
<P>
   In-between player, not nifty enough for tailback or solid enough
blocker for full-time fullback duty. Still, it's hard to ignore his
productivity and ability to do a lot of things well. Makes
something happen when he gets ball, more athletic than initially
appears.
</P>
<P>
   Others
</P>
<P>
   RB Michael Basnight (North Carolina A&AMP;T), RB Autry Denson (Notre
Dame), RB De'Mond Parker (Oklahoma), FB Terry Jackson (Florida), RB
Joe Montgomery (Ohio State), FB Cecil Martin (Wisconsin), RB Stacey
Mack (Temple), FB Jeff Paulk (Arizona State).
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise Mike Cloud of Boston College and Missouri's Devin
West won't run away from defenders, but they are explosive to the
hole and love to compete. Limited athletes who made themselves
players.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline The all-time NCAA rushing leader, Brian Shay of
Emporia State, is the kind of underdog everyone roots for.
Unfortunately, his story would have a better ending if he had
better quickness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Intriguing Arkansas tailback Madre Hill rushed for 1,387 yards
in 1995, then missed two seasons with reconstructive surgery on
both knees. His medical history is a red flag, but he ran 4.49 at
the combine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleeper New Hampshire tailback Jerry Azumah was productive at
I-AA level and scouts like his quickness and versatility. He
doesn't have ideal size (5-10, 195) but runs sub-4.5 times and is a
tough competitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Falcons view Coach Dan Reeves preaches that you never can have
enough good backs, and a knee injury to Byron Hanspard proved that
in '98. Atlanta could use another solid-blocking fullback behind
Bob Christian.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teams in need Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Kansas City,
New York Giants, New England, Miami, Atlanta.

 &HT;    Peer reviews: Duval `amazing'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Asked about the $190 million Big Game lottery
drawing tonight, Fred Funk quickly snapped, ``David Duval will win
that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Funk's comment captures the aura that golf's most prodigious
winner has created among his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really amazed,'' Steve Stricker said after a practice
round Monday for the Masters at Augusta National. ``Who would have
thought David would have four wins before the Masters? Or that he'd
set an earnings mark already? It looks easy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Stricker, Duval had the look of a consistent winner
before he actually won. ``I played with him about three or four
years ago,'' Stricker recalled. ``He hadn't won. I can't remember
where, but my wife was caddying for me. I told her then: `He might
be the best player in the world.' I could see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's obvious everything's clicking at the same time.
Sooner or later, you think he'll come down off this cloud he's on,
but he's still playing great.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory in this week's Masters would be Duval's first major
and, undoubtedly, would elevate him into the stratosphere
professionally and publicly. His national fame probably still
trails Tiger Woods'.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that ``he hasn't won a major,'' John Huston said.
``And that's just a matter of time. Once he does that, everything
will fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   He has struck the ball flush off the tee, his touch around the
greens has been velvety soft and his putting has been dead-on, but
a measure of good fortune has played a part in a run as successful
as Duval's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of luck,'' Huston said. ``I saw some of his
shots (in the BellSouth Classic) and he got some really nice
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaks that come with being in an outrageous zone. And yet, many
players hardly seemed surprised at Duval's run of 11 victories in
34 outings. Rather, they were more accepting of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ridiculous at all; it's impressive,'' Brad
Faxon said. ``It's amazing. Three years ago, people were writing
that he can't close and he can't win. Now, everybody's saying
nobody can beat him.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, a rivalry is warming up between Duval and Woods,
two of golf's biggest names and top players. ``I played with Tiger
a few years after playing with David,'' Faxon said, ``and I said
Tiger was the best, too. They're very similar. They're both very
long off the tee. I don't see a lot of differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval might not show emotion, but he's shown lots of game. ``I
wouldn't say I'm stunned,'' Justin Leonard said. ``I'm thoroughly
impressed. Incredible. If there was somebody's respect he didn't
have, he has it now.''

 &HT;    Norman: The champ the Masters forgot
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It used to be automatic. A Masters began and Greg
Norman was installed as a co-favorite. It was a pairing as natural
as azaleas and dogwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. It wasn't just age _ don't forget, this is a
44-year-old Great White Shark we're talking about. It was The
Collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Here in 1999, there is little difference of opinion about Greg
Norman and the Masters. Most observers think that Norman, a rebuilt
shoulder notwithstanding, is toast at Augusta National since the
6-shot, 54-hole lead vanished in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was no occasion to judge Norman; his shoulder throbbed
so much he sometimes had no idea where the ball was going. However,
he also missed the cut in 1997 in his first appearance since The
Green Jacket That Got Away.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Norman seems to have made more
disappearances than appearances. Before the surgery, he also missed
the cut at the U.S. Open, then tied for 36th at the British Open
and tied for 13th at the PGA. This from the same player who won two
British Opens, 1986 and 1993, and on eight occasions was a major
championship runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a virus kept Norman from playing in the BellSouth
Classic at the TPC of Sugarloaf he designed in Duluth, Ga. He came
to Augusta on Monday, still trying to regather his strength from
the illness, but no one had a chance to ask what travels through
his mind this week, after he became at least physically prepared to
handle the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Norman, ranked 28th, would not have made this
week's Masters field without the new eligibility requirements that
include the top 50 of the world rankings, but he could have
received an international invitation. However, he does not talk
like a player who will be accepting, for example, USGA exemptions
to the U.S. Open, as Jack Nicklaus has done in his late 50s. ``I
don't want to be out here,'' Norman said. ``I don't want to take up
space when somebody else who is 21, 20, could be out here playing.
It's like John Elway. He's the only one who knows if he's going to
play or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in here,'' he said, pointing to his heart. ``I don't want
to sit around and just come out here and walk on the green grass
just to take up space and breathe up oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Norman still have the hunger to win? Or is it merely to
play well enough, contending every once in a while somewhere on the
globe to keep his business interests sufficiently prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been driven to being No. 1,'' Norman said this
spring. ``I have been very honest about that for many, many years.
I am driven to be a competitor, and if you're a competitor on the
golf course, and your performance on the golf course is good
enough, everything else takes care of itself. I'm the same in
business. You come down to the final day, if you've got a chance to
win the golf tournament, you go, you do it. If you have a chance on
a business deal, you go, you do it. It's very much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman seldom speaks about the mental residue from Augusta '96,
nor do people often ask. Immediately after the 78 from hell that
Sunday in April, he bared his every private thought. Nothing was
left to say. Later, Norman would marvel at the outpouring from fans
he never imagined were on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, Norman was at the Masters, but just
barely. His shoulder hurting, he shot 76-78 and headed home,
embarrassed and ready for the knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy I missed the cut,'' Norman told Jeff Babineau
of Golfweek. ``I remember sitting at my locker, and I was glad to
be getting out of there. I didn't want to play. We're talking about
Augusta National _ can you imagine that? . . . It was just
embarrassing. You should never be out there hitting shots like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder if the shoulder might have given out under
the pressure of the 1996 Masters Sunday. In its deteriorated,
damaged state, it was common for the shoulder to pop out of joint
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's return at the end of last year showed early results _ a
Shark Shootout win with Steve Elkington and then a jubiliant part
in the Internationals' Presidents Cup win in Australia. But he has
not found similar reinforcement on the PGA Tour this year. Although
able to finish well in the Australian Masters, Norman tied for 19th
at Doral, where he's a three-time winner, and then missed the cut
at The Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's swing, which has been slightly flattened by instructor
David Leadbetter, appears solid, but his drives seem to be lacking
some distance. Buddy Nick Price, on the other hand, contends, ``He
looks like the old Greg Norman to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to say because I never played with him
before,'' Atlanta's Stewart Cink said, ``but I don't think he's as
long. He was hitting about even with me and he's usually been
longer. I know he's been working out a lot and lost a lot of
weight. He might have a little difficult time adjusting to that
different kind of frame he's got now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the adjustment, things can't approach the uneasiness of
last year's Masters for Norman. On what would be his last hole of
the tournament, his shoulder locked up during his tee shot at the
18th. He heeled a driver over the fans' heads along the ropes and
was stunned to see the ball hit a tree and roll back, stopping 30
yards from the teebox.
</P>
<P>
   Norman apparently finds his greatest enjoyment these days from
golf-course design, which draws him a fee of about $1.25 million
per course. His TPC at Sugarloaf in Duluth, which drew national
exposure last week at the BellSouth Classic, was the catalyst for
17 current projects.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his day, Norman spends several hours rehabilitating
the shoulder and requires a trainer to stretch it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I had the surgery, I had no desire to go out and hit
golf balls, because I was in so much pain. For the first 20 or 30
swings, I would just have shooting pains down my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's surgeon took care of them. It's those Masters' mental
twinges that could be the problem.

 &HT;    INTERNATIONAL SOCCER NOTES: Manchester United on verge of
another title
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After ending a 42-year drought against Italian teams in European
competition, Manchester United gets another dose of Italy in the
Champions' League semifinals, as the English powerhouse takes aim
this week on a rare triple crown.
</P>
<P>
   United, which ousted Inter Milan in the quarterfinals, hosts
Juventus at Old Trafford in the first semifinal leg Wednesday (2:30
p.m., live ESPN2). The goal is to go far beyond being the first
English team in 31 years to win the European Cup. The current
Premier League leaders are trying to grab their sixth league title
of the '90s and also capture the F.A. Cup. Even normally low-key
manager Alex Ferguson is talking confidently about the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we can win all three,'' Ferguson said. ``I've
always been a bit cautious about whether we have a big enough squad
to go for all the prizes, but not now. The treble is definitely on,
and the players are up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, United meets Arsenal in an F.A. Cup semifinal
showdown. United holds a four-point lead over the defending
champions after both were held to draws Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Juventus can reach the Champions' League finals for a
fourth year in a row might depend on whether French World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane is recovered from injury. The defending Italian
champions are out of the hunt for a Serie A title but have played
better since manager Carlo Ancelotti came on board in February.
</P>
<P>
   England: Fowler flap grows
</P>
<P>
   For Liverpool's Robbie Fowler, what goes around has come around.
After gesturing like a cocaine addict to celebrate scoring a goal
Saturday in a 3-2 win over Everton, Fowler faces disciplinary
action from the Football Association. Fowler said he pretended to
snort the goal line to respond to taunts of ``smackhead'' from
Everton fans, who have long accused him of using drugs. The
24-year-old also faces an F.A. hearing Friday for his ongoing row
with Chelsea's Graeme Le Saux. In a February match, Fowler made
vulgar gestures and remarks about homosexuality to Le Saux, who
promptly dropped him to the ground. The Liverpool win, by the way,
was the first over its Merseyside rival since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland: Rangers upset
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow Rangers, which signed American midfielder Claudio Reyna
last week and seemingly had a chokehold on its ninth title in the
last 10 years, was upset 3-1 by St. Johnstone on Sunday and now
leads Celtic by only six points in the Premier League. Reyna, who
had been playing sparingly at Wolfsburg in Germany, was transferred
for an estimated $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Goal drought ends
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn gave up his first goal in
736 minutes Saturday in a 2-2 draw with Borussia Dortmund, but his
team still leads the Bundesliga by a healthy 15 points. ...
However, Bayern will be missing some key players Wednesday in its
Champions' League semifinal with Dynamo Kyiv (4:45 p.m., ESPN2).
Leading scorer Giovanne Elber and defender Bixente Lizarazu are out
for the season with knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   France: Leaders play leapfrog
</P>
<P>
   Olympique Marseille vaulted into the lead in the Le Championnat
(first division) race Friday with a 2-1 win over Monaco but lost it
Saturday as Bordeaux beat Toulouse 3-1 to grab the advantage by a
point. Marseille, with 62 points, plays Bologna today in the UEFA
Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Lazio streak continues
</P>
<P>
   Although held to a 0-0 draw with AC Milan on Saturday, Lazio
maintained a six-point Serie A lead and extended its unbeaten
streak to 17 matches. The Rome club plays Lokomotiv Moscow on
Thursday in the first leg of the semifinals of the Cup Winners'
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Rivaldo hat trick
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian Rivaldo scored all three goals, two of them coming on
penalty kicks, as Barcelona stayed on top of the Primera Division
with a 3-1 win over Oviedo. Rivaldo has 18 goals for the season. .
. . Two Primera Clubs are still alive in European competition.
Atletico Madrid plays Parma today in the semifinals of the UEFA
Cup, while Mallorca meets Chelsea Thursday in the Cup Winners' Cup.
. . Real Madrird's Predraj Mijatovic has been fined more than
$32,000 by the club for refusing to play in Saturday's 3-2 win over
Alaves in protest of NATO bombing of his native Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil: Fan shot dead
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old man was shot in the head and killed Sunday during
skirmishes at Rio's Maracana Stadium before a match between city
rivals Fluminese and Flamengo. . . Former national team coach Mario
Zagallo isn't faring well in his return to domestic coaching. His
Portugesa team lost 5-1 to Barbarense Saturday and currently is
near the bottom of its group in the Sao Paulo league.
</P>
<P>
   MLS: Razov on Fire
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Ante Razov scored two goals and Peter Nowak added two
more as MLS champion Chicago Fire routed the Miami Fusion 4-1
Saturday. Razov, who has six goals in the Fire's three games, was
named MLS player of the month for March. . . . Raul Diaz Arce ended
a salary holdout and scored a goal as the San Jose Clash stunned
Los Angeles 2-1 in a shootout. . . . Roy Lassiter's second-half
goal for D.C. United beat the MetroStars 1-0. . . . Kansas City's
Wizards extended their MLS scoreless record to 550 minutes in a 1-0
loss to the New England Revolution. . . . Brian McBride knocked
home a late header as the Columbus Crew beat the Tampa Bay Mutiny
3-2. . . . Former Heritage High star Clint Mathis, playing a
leading role with the L.A. Galaxy, is profiled in the current issue
of Soccer America magazine.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE GRAPEVINE
</P>
<P>
   Mallorca goalkeeper Carlos Roa said he might have to retire
because of his religious beliefs. Roa, the 29-year-old Argentine
who came up big in a penalty-kick win over England in the World Cup
last summer, is an Adventist rarely able to take part in worship
activities because of playing commitments on Saturdays. Earlier
this year, Roa expressed an interest in playing for Manchester
United, which will lose the retiring Peter Schmeichel after the
season.
</P>
<P>
   TOP PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   In his first match as a team captain, Ronaldo scored twice, both
goals on penalty kicks, as Inter Milan dealt a major blow to
Fiorentina's Italian scudetto hopes Saturday in a 2-0 win at San
Siro. Ronaldo, battling season-long knee injuries, helped Inter to
its first Serie A win since Feb. 7.

<P>
   Jill E. Barad built a career as Barbie's surrogate mother,
giving her makeovers, expanding her wardrobe and lavishing her with
creature comforts to enhance her enchanted imaginary world.
</P>
<P>
   All that attention paid off: under her direction, the Barbie
line grew to an estimated $1.7 billion in sales in 1997 from $200
million in 1982, vaulting Ms. Barad into the chief executive's
office in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbie is 40 years old, and, like other Mattel Inc.
products, is showing signs of aging. Children are abandoning
traditional toys like Barbie sooner in favor of computers. Toys
that have been hot, like the Beanie Babies, are increasingly coming
from smaller, more nimble competitors. Toys ``R'' Us and other
large retailers have been ordering fewer stuffed animals and board
games to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Mattel's earnings have slumped, and its stock price
has tumbled. For Mattel, the question is whether Ms. Barad, who is
so identified with Barbie, the company's flagship toy, and who is
known mostly for her strengths in marketing, can turn the company
around at a time when the toy industry is undergoing such rapid
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the real challenges Mattel has is to educate Wall
Street that they are not just the Barbie company anymore,'' said
Chris Byrne, an industry consultant and editor of the Toy Report, a
weekly newsletter. ``Their stock goes up and down on Barbie's fate,
and that's a lot for those little plastic shoulders to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, her efforts to stem the decline are drawing mixed
reviews. She shook up management last month by announcing that two
senior executives were leaving and that five new department heads
would be directly accountable to her. And she has developed a plan
to sell more toys directly to consumers through catalogs and the
Internet. The strategy, however, has angered some retailers who
accuse her of trying to compete directly with them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, investors who were once enamored of Ms. Barad appear
to have grown impatient waiting for her to deliver results. Since
she took over, the stock has fallen 10 percent, while the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained nearly 74 percent. Monday, the
stock rose 31.25 cents, to $24.625. Many big investors say that
Mattel needs to generate hefty returns from recently acquired
companies, reduce its reliance on Barbie and respond more quickly
to changes in the way children play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of Jill is that she is very good and capable, but
that her relationship with Wall Street has been a little bit
strained because she is so positive and marketing-oriented that I
think people feel a little bit oversold,'' said Joe Kennison, a
money manager with American Express Financial Advisers, which sold
nearly half of its 8.3 million Mattel shares in December.
</P>
<P>
   Through a company spokesman, Ms. Barad declined to be
interviewed. But interviews with more than a dozen money managers,
analysts and retailers, as well as people who have worked with her,
paint a portrait of a charismatic and driven executive who is a
marketing whiz but who has not fully demonstrated that she has the
financial skills and leadership ability to turn around the $4.8
billion company.
</P>
<P>
   Her harshest critics contend that Ms. Barad, 47, spends too much
energy on charming Wall Street analysts and bankers to keep them
bullish on Mattel instead of on coming up with ways to grow
profits.
</P>
<P>
   A Mattel spokesman, Glenn Bozarth said that 1998 results ``were
affected by unexpected events and issues'' and that this year
Mattel's goal was to ``underpromise and overdeliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that the issue may be more one of style
than of substance. ``Most of the people who deal with her are
professional men, and their ability to critique her can't be taken
out of the context of them being men,'' said Sean McGowan, an
analyst who follows Mattel for Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``Jill
brings a level of animation and feminization to the role that
people find off-putting at times because they are not used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In company presentations that he has attended, for instance, Ms.
Barad has been known to dance to music used in product promotions,
apparently to drum up enthusiasm. ``This must be very infectious in
a sales presentation at a toy company but you are not accustomed to
seeing it at banker presentations,'' McGowan said.

COURT EXPANDS POWER OF POLICE TO SEARCH CAR PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday significantly boosted
the power of police to search motor vehicles, ruling that officers
may look through a passenger's personal belongings when searching
for criminal evidence against the driver.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 ruling, the high court ruled that a Wyoming highway
patrol officer properly searched a female passenger in a car after
he stopped the vehicle and suspected that drugs were inside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective law enforcement would be appreciably impaired
without the ability to search a passenger's personal belongings
when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence of criminal
wrongdoing is hidden in the car,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Scalia in the decision were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The justice's ruling expanded a 1996 Supreme Court decision
allowing police to stop motorists for routine traffic violations
stopping too long at a stop sign even if the officer's real reason
for stopping the car was to search for illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's decision, officers who take part in such stops can
search all containers in the car if they have reason to believe
they will find illegal contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``A passenger's personal belongings, just like the driver's
belongings or containers attached to the car like a glove
compartment, are `in' the car, and the officer has probable cause
to search for contraband in the car,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Police groups praised the decision while trial lawyers denounced
it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Scully, executive director of the National Association of
Police Organizations, said the ruling gives officers the ``tools
they need to do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers must be free of unreasonable, confusing and
unworkable restrictions on what may be searched,'' said Scully,
whose Washington-based coalition of police unions and associations
represents 220,000 law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Kemler of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers said the ruling is ``an abomination.'' She added, ``You get
in a car and, as a passenger, you basically have no rights. Almost
anything goes, as long as police can come up with some reason to
say they expected to find evidence of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's case began with a routine police stop on an empty
stretch of Interstate 25 in Natrona County in central Wyoming on
July 23, 1995. Just after midnight, Highway Patrol Officer Delane
Baldwin pulled over a car driven by David Young of Casper, Wyo.,
for speeding and because a brake light was out.
</P>
<P>
   As Baldwin asked Young for his driver's license and
registration, he noticed a syringe in the driver's pocket. Baldwin
told Young and two women passengers to get out of the car. Standing
in front of the car, Baldwin asked Young why he had the syringe.
The driver answered that he was using it to take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After searching Young and the two women for drugs, Baldwin then
began to look through the car. In the back seat, he found a purse
in which he discovered a wallet-sized bag with two syringes and a
vial containing diluted methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin then arrested the bag's owner, Sandra Houghton, also of
Casper, and charged her with possession of a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Young was never charged with a crime. Police later
tested his syringe and found no trace of any drug.
</P>
<P>
   After Houghton was convicted of felony possession of a
controlled substance in 1996, she appealed to the Wyoming Supreme
Court, arguing that the state had violated her Fourth Amendment
protection against unreasonable search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The state replied that the search was allowed under a law that
gives authorities the right to search a vehicle as long as the
police have probable cause to think that incriminating evidence
will be found inside. Specifically, the law says that the police
can search ``any container within the vehicle that could contain
the object of the search.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Baldwin had probable cause to believe drugs could be in
Houghton's purse, the state argued, he was within his rights to
search the bag.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998 the Wyoming Supreme Court disagreed. It threw out
Houghton's conviction, saying police are not entitled to search
containers that belong to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sensible rule ... is that such a package may be searched,
whether or not its owner is present as a passenger or otherwise,
because it may contain the contraband that the officer has reason
to believe is in the car,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that the court had
broken from a ``settled distinction between drivers and
passengers'' and created ``a new rule'' that would let police
search even a taxi passenger's briefcase if they had reason to
believe the driver had drugs somewhere in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Joining his dissent were Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.

 UNDATED: presentations,'' McGowan said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analysts and former company executives also say that instead of
keeping watch of the entire company, Ms. Barad manages the Barbie
brand so obsessively that she often devotes too little time to
other areas of the business. ``I think she has passion for part of
the product but not the whole,'' said one of the former executives,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Should she really be
critiquing the color of eye shadow for a doll?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are other areas of Mattel that could use more
attention. The company's boy's toys unit, for instance, will soon
face tougher competition because Mattel failed to win the ``Star
Wars'' license. Its chief rival, Hasbro, will roll out products
based on the much anticipated new film, which is due out next
month. And revenue in Mattel's infant and pre-school business fell
3 percent last year, hurt in part by a $27 million charge related
to a recall. The Fisher-Price Powerwheels cars, which children
ride, were recalled because its electrical components could
overheat and catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all of the attention she devotes to Barbie, however,
shipments of the brand _ which represents an estimated 40 to 50
percent of the company's profits _ fell 14 percent last year,
contributing to a 67 percent earnings drop in the fourth quarter.
Mattel, analysts say, flooded the market with too many
holiday-season versions, which forced retailers to cut prices
sharply to unload aisles of unsold dolls. The glut of Holiday
Barbies, the analysts added, diluted the cachet of the doll for
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Mattel remains the world's leading toy maker and has
had some successes on Ms. Barad's watch. Just a year ago, parents
were lining up for blocks to get their hands on a Tickle Me Elmo
doll, and last year the new Blue's Clues product line generated $40
million in revenue in four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impressive to me that they've got so many of these
characters that kids absolutely love,'' said Mark Greenberg, a
portfolio manager at Investco Funds Group's leisure fund who
recently bought 100,000 shares of Mattel and is bullish on Ms.
Barad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is substance there,'' he said. ``What I like
about Jill is I think she really understands the product and she
understands the business.''
</P>
<P>
   While few doubt her command of the business, others question her
ability to attract and hold on to talented managers. The job of
president of the Barbie unit _ the company's most important brand _
went unfilled for a year until last month, when Adrienne
Fontanella, who had been in charge of Barbie licensing and
collectibles, was named to the post.
</P>
<P>
   Also last month, Bruce Stein, whom Ms. Barad recruited in 1996
to help bolster the boys business, resigned as chief operating
officer and president of the worldwide business. Another division
head, Gary Baughman, president of the company's Fisher-Price
subsidiary, also stepped down. Mattel swiftly named a new head of
the boys division, but has not named a new chief operating officer,
effectively handing those responsibilities to Ms. Barad.
</P>
<P>
   Former company executives and some analysts contend that Ms.
Barad is concentrating her power, staking her reputation more
securely on a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if they are in the same position at the end of the
year, there will be a big outcry for a huge management change,''
said Byrne, the industry consultant, who still counts himself as
one of Ms. Barad's supporters. He says he expects the company to
begin to show improvement this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad, Greenberg of Investco said, is managing in a
difficult environment because in some ways Mattel is a victim of
its position in the marketplace. ``They are the largest company in
the industry,'' he said, ``so nothing they can do can have that big
an impact on the company outside of an acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is counting on two recent acquisitions to improve
its competitiveness. Mattel is expected to close soon on its
purchase of Learning Co., the leading maker of educational
programming. The deal will significantly increase Mattel's
competitiveness in a fast-growing market by combining its strength
in research and development, distribution and purchasing with
Learning Co.'s software expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, Mattel bought Pleasant Co., giving it a second
brand of best-selling dolls, American Girl. Mattel also gained a
company with expertise in direct selling, since the dolls are sold
exclusively through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad has said that Mattel, which generates about 10 percent
of its revenue from goods sold directly to consumers, ``will
aggressively build this segment'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy comes with some risk. While it would smartly reduce
Mattel's reliance on a few large customers, the push to diversify
Mattel's distribution further threatens to strain relationships
with some of its most important customers, according to two
executives at competing retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, we're not happy about it,'' said one of the
executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're watching,
and we're concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bozarth, the Mattel spokesman, said the company's
consumer-direct selling strategy would enable it to sell more
specialty items such as collectibles, and was not meant to compete
with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   And in making acquisitions to increase its direct-selling
capabilities, as well as to expand in interactive toys, Mattel may
have paid too much, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, I wish the price was less,'' McGowan of Gerard
Klauer Mattison said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, toy companies command one and a half to two times
sales, though it is not unusual to pay a premium for top brands or
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, however, paid $700 million for Pleasant Co., a business
that has $300 million in annual revenue. And it is paying $3.8
billion for Learning Co., which had $850 million in revenue in
1998. Bozarth said the price Mattel paid for each company was
appropriate and that ``both were structured in such a way as to be
accretive to earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McGowan said, ``toy companies just don't get that kind of
multiple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take on faith that the numbers will be there,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Faith may be in short supply among Mattel investors, who have
been caught off guard in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while analysts were saying that they were concerned
about possible weakness in the Barbie division, Ms. Barad
maintained that the product line was on track, leaving many
dumbfounded when the company then reported a 14 percent drop in
Barbie orders for the year. Last fall, Ms. Barad told analysts that
the fourth-quarter results would be in line with expectations, only
to report weeks later that Toys ``R'' Us had unexpectedly cut its
reorders of products after Thanksgiving and, as a result, profits
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike the 9-year-olds who are Mattel's ultimate customers,
investors do not like to find surprises wrapped in pretty packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she understands,'' McGowan said, ``that is not
something that goes over very well with investors.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO on Monday gave its military commander
the authority he sought to send 24 U.S. Apache helicopter gunships
to Albania, with surface-to-surface missiles and about 2,000
American soldiers who will use them to attack Serbian forces across
the border in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, also got approval for
the deployment from the Albanian authorities Monday evening,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache anti-tank helicopters and their missile systems are
expected to be in position in about a week, supplementing a bombing
campaign that the allies say has only begun to get seriously under
way now that the weather has cleared.
</P>

   The alliance's top commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, asked for the helicopters, along with the 12 additional
Stealth F-117A fighters and the scores of attack planes based on
the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the aircraft to bolster the bombing campaign that has
so far failed to stop Serbian forces in Kosovo from driving 360,000
ethnic Albanians out of the province in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just starting to hit them,'' said Air Commodore David
Wilby, a British officer who is the spokesman for the allied
military command. ``I think you will find very direct results
coming in shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday more refugees kept pouring out of Kosovo, and 34,000
of them arrived in Albania and 10,000 in Macedonia on Sunday alone,
allied officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   Allied transport planes flew 31 missions on Sunday to bring in
200 tons of food and medical supplies to the refugee camps along
the Macedonian border but have not yet begun evacuating refugees to
camps outside the Balkans, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Direct allied air attacks against the Serbian forces were
hampered until Sunday night by clouds and rain, military officers
here said. They said they hoped that the Apache helicopters, which
can fly at low levels at night and in any kind of weather, would
stop the attacks on civilians where higher-flying planes could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very grateful to the United States for making available
this extremely important capability,'' said the alliance's
spokesman, Jamie Shea. He said the allies would view any threat to
Albania from the Serbian forces under Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic with extreme seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Clark asked for the Apache helicopters to improve the air
campaign's ability to attack individual Yugoslav Army units and
heavily armed paramilitary police units that have been surrounding
ethnic Albanian villages with tanks or other armored vehicles,
driving out all the inhabitants at gunpoint and then herding them
onto buses and farm vehicles for expulsion to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches fly close to the ground at more than 150 mph and can
launch up to 16 laser-guided Hellfire missiles at targets like
tanks from more than three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the helicopters, President Clinton decided to send 18
rocket launchers that fire ground-to-ground missiles used to attack
radar systems and anti-aircraft weapons that could pose a threat to
the anti-tank helicopters. The rockets, M-39s, have a range of 100
miles and warheads that explode and disperse 950 deadly grenades
apiece over a wide area, sending lethal metal fragments that can
kill soldiers and disable or immobilize their anti-aircraft
missiles or guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches use laser guidance systems and night vision devices
that let a two-member crew zero in on armored personnel carriers
and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the most effective anti-tank weapons the NATO
campaign has been able to use against the marauding Serb units are
the two-engined A-10 aircraft that became known as ``tank killers''
in the Gulf War of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers said A-10s were in the air Monday as the
allies took advantage of improved weather over the Balkans to bomb
27 targets, including an oil refinery on the northwest outskirts of
Belgrade overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets hit overnight, Wilby said, were Serb tanks
ringing the Kosovo village of Glodane _ one village among hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   He showed photographs of the tanks, and said that later pictures
the command did not make available showed that the Serbs had set
fire to the village after forcing the inhabitants out. He said he
could not release photographs of the damage done to the Serb tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we want to stop the violence in Kosovo immediately,
as soon as we possibly can,'' Shea said Monday. ``The most
important thing is that at the end of the day we should be able to
reverse this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in the Apache helicopters posed ticklish problems for
Washington _ where their involvement was seen as taking the United
States one step closer to sending in ground troops to help the
refugees go home to Kosovo _ and for allied countries who do not
want to widen the war by bringing on attacks against Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, where most of the allied airplanes attacking Yugoslavia
are based, has also been wary of NATO actions that could increase
the flow of refugees across the Adriatic, and government officials
in Greece, where public opposition to the bombing runs strong, have
called for an end to the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Italy nor Greece, nor any other country, raised
objections Monday to a proposal to let Solana negotiate the Apache
deployment with the Albanian authorities, diplomats said.

NBC'S `EVERYTHING'S' RELATIVELY UNSOPHISTICATED SITCOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Described as a ``sophisticated'' comedy by the NBC publicity
mill, ``Everything's Relative'' is as sophisticated as just about
every other comedy on television. Which is to say, not very.
</P>
<P>
   For example, here's the putative central character, Leo Gorelick
(Kevin Rahm), having a talk with his mom, Mickey (Jill Clayburgh),
about her desire to meddle in the life of her ex-husband, Jake
(Jeffrey Tambor), even though they've been divorced 20 years:
``Mom, I just want you to be happy, OK? And I don't think that you
can be happy living your life purely in a reaction to his.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey's reply: ``You're the one who always said living well is
the best revenge. Well, that's all I'm doing. I'm going to live
well and I'm going to shove it up your father's ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, the sweet, sweet smell of sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just me. But Jill Clayburgh looks as likely to utter
those words as my own mom. Which is to say, fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clayburgh's sly portrayal of Mickey is the best thing
about ``Everything's Relative,'' a series about two obsessive
parents who can't let go of their adult sons. Imagine what might
happen with an even more ``sophisticated'' script. Jake might be
less of a cheesy vulgarian, Leo might be a better defined central
character, and Leo's brother, Marty (Eric Schaeffer), might be more
than a one-note whiner. But with only three more chances to make an
impression _ only four episodes were made _ it's likely that
``Everything's Relative,'' despite some clever moments, is going to
be relatively disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's Relative. Half-hour comedy series about a young
comedy writer and his close-knit but overbearing family. Starring
Kevin Rahm, Jeffrey Tambor, Jill Clayburgh and Eric Schaeffer.
Premieres Tuesday night on NBC. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

DAVID BLAINE BAFFLES AND AMAZES WITH MIND-BLOWING UP-CLOSE MAGIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) David Blaine, on foot, stops a car and asks its
driver, a middle-aged man with a heavy accent, permission to look
at his wristwatch.
</P>
<P>
   The man removes the watch, and Blaine shows it to a cameraman,
who's documenting the encounter for an ABC special to air April 14.
The watch reads 5 o'clock, almost straight up.
</P>
<P>
   He returns the watch to the man and, while the man clenches it
in his right fist, Blaine asks him to name a number between 10 and
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``25,'' the man says.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine cups the man's hand, then announces, ``We're going to
make the clock go to 25.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel it moving?'' Blaine asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah-yeah-yeah,'' says the man, excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Done,'' says Blaine, with a clap of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The man opens his fist. The watch reads 5:25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look-look-look,'' says the man, showing the watch to his
female passenger. ``Oh, mama mia, I can't believe that. That's
incredible!''
</P>
<P>
   No, that's David Blaine, a 25-year-old magician who not only
wants to test your mind, he wants to blow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to mystify,'' says Blaine recently, speaking in a deep
monotone from New York, where Monday he was buried alive (more on
that in a moment).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery is the most important emotion that humans are
lacking,'' he says. ``As they get older and more logical, they
really leave big voids in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little babies see faces on the doors and in the dark and on
the walls. It's amazing. But as (you) get older, (your parents)
tell you, `Oh, it's not real,' and you start to pretend you don't
see them, and the mystery disappears.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw Blaine's first TV special are familiar with his
unusual style. He is a street magician who specializes in up-close
tricks. In the first special, 18 months ago, he freaked people out
by, among other stunts, levitating himself a few inches off a city
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   For next week's show, ``David Blaine: Magic Man,'' he performs
feats so intense and personal that they leave some of his subjects
speechless and in tears. He resurrects what appears to be a dead
fly. He looks at a person's palm and tells him what card he's
thinking of. He gets a police officer to pick a card, then drops
the deck on the sidewalk; he tells him to check his shoe _ and the
officer's card is inside.
</P>
<P>
   He makes a chicken's head disappear and reappear, he
``projects'' the image of a card so that it appears as a tattoo on
a man's chest, and he swallows a long piece of thread, lifts his
shirt and pulls it out of his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Most spectacularly, he can walk up to a stranger, ask her to
write down the name of someone special to her, then reveal that
name in unusual ways. Once he appears to burn his arm, and the
smoke-black residue reveals the name. Another time the name appears
on a passing taxi.
</P>
<P>
   You have to see it to understand it and believe it _ and then,
in disbelief, you still won't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine's subjects are unsuspecting strangers on the street, and
their reactions are as priceless as the tricks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not magic, that's some crazy stuff,'' says one
confounded subject. ``How did you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   That's one question Blaine's not likely to answer. In fact,
Blaine isn't a person to reveal much of anything _ about his
tricks, his personal life, his past or his motives. That fits into
his image as true mystery man.
</P>
<P>
   What little we do know is that Blaine was born in Brooklyn and
raised in New Jersey, and decided, at age 16, to move back to New
York, alone. His parents were raised as Gypsies, and he knew at age
4 that magic was for him.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't perfecting his craft on city streets, he hung out
with ``beautiful people'' _ Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro _ and
did tricks for their friends. DiCaprio hosted Blaine's first TV
special, in which Blaine visited several cities across the nation,
plus the Dallas Cowboys' locker room (Deion Sanders and Emmitt
Smith are Blaine fans).
</P>
<P>
   For this second special, he hits the streets of New York,
Memphis, Nashville and New Orleans, then journeys to remote areas
of Haiti and South America to impress the often-superstitious
people there.
</P>
<P>
   His entourage can include up to a dozen people, from a
photographer and a sound guy to someone who gets releases so faces
and IDs can be used on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cameraperson is not in on the trick,'' Blaine assures. ``I
just say, `Try to shoot everything, action, then reaction.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is not shy about walking up to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty great thing,'' he said, speaking of the
reactions he gets. ``I like it better when there's no camera. In
fact, next show we're going to use hidden cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The question is whether there will be a next show. Monday he
was buried alive in a Plexiglas coffin in front of Trump Place in
New York. The coffin was lowered 6 feet into the ground. It will
remain visible from above, so people can watch him suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is a tribute to Harry Houdini, a favorite of Blaine's.
Houdini wanted to do the stunt but died before he could attempt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to blur the line between tricks and reality,'' Blaine
says. ``I just do what I feel. Some are tricks. Some are real. It's
just whatever works for that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He will go without food and ``only 3 to 4 tablespoons of water''
a day _ only enough to keep him alive, says promoter (and theater
producer) James Nederlander.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt, Blaine admits, intimidates him ``a little bit.'' It's
hard to practice these kinds of things, he explains. ``I guess it's
the same as preparing for death,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Should he make it _ he's scheduled to emerge Monday (April 12) _
he'll start work on a third TV special and more mind-blowing feats.

STRANDED FAMILY LEADS TO REFUGEE CENTER AT TEXAS CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When their refugee resettlement agency
folded, the Bosnian mother and her four children were virtually
stranded in their Fort Worth apartment, left with just a few pieces
of furniture and no community support.
</P>
<P>
   It was in their plight that Pat Friar and scores of fellow
members at St. Paul's Lutheran Church discovered a thriving
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Here is a place where we can really help
someone,' '' says Friar, a retired office manager who met the
family when her church was asked to step in. ``They had nothing. It
was something I think we were looking for without realizing we were
looking for it. It was just like coming home to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Friar, a volunteer, coordinates a thriving
refugee ministry at St. Paul's. Last week, Friar and other church
members drove to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport to greet their 18th
refugee family, this one from Bosnia. Thus began the now-familiar
process of guiding the newcomers through the difficult adjustment
to Texas and America.
</P>
<P>
   Like the latest arrivals, most of the families have come from
the troubled Balkans. St. Paul's has also assisted families from
Sudan, Burma and Vietnam. Most of them come with only a suitcase of
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get more out of it than we put in,'' Friar says.
``We're looking at people who have had really bad breaks, and we're
sitting fat, dumb and happy in America. All of them have horror
stories. They've lost everything, been on the run for years. In
some cases there's physical abuse. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Friar's church is a key cog in a resettlement network that has
made North Texas a common destination for people driven from their
homelands. Last year, Refugee Services of North Texas, a nonprofit
organization, resettled 244 people from 67 families, often with the
assistance of area churches.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have a well-founded fear of persecution in their
native countries based on religious, political or social beliefs.
Resettlement workers expect that many of the thousands of ethnic
Albanians currently fleeing Kosovo will ultimately end up in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee Services attempts to find church sponsors for each
incoming family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important part, besides their donations, is the time
they're able to spend with the families,'' Emily Russ, a caseworker
with Refugee Services, says of the church assistance. ``With the
size of our staff, we can't sit down and have coffee every day, or
go over there. A church's involvement allows more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day in a Fort Worth apartment, Friar seemed like kin
to Ivan Kis and his family of four, who fled Bosnia after Bosnian
soldiers ransacked the family's house and attacked Kis' wife in
1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But though her week is consumed with refugee work, Friar
deflects credit to the 80 or so people from St. Paul's who also
contribute. One man repairs appliances that the refugees may use; a
group of church men move furniture that another person has stored.
Other St. Paul members gather refugees from the airport, drive them
to an apartment they have readied, take the family for medical
exams and inoculations, drive them for groceries, help get the
children enrolled in school and get the adults jobs, and counsel
the refugees during a confusing and often frightening time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we stay in touch with them,'' Friar says. ``We want to be
friends with them after their needs have been taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Friar says, the refugees often seem confused by the
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're surprised that people are helping them with no gain in
mind,'' Friar says. ``But God is the one who's doing it. There is
no way we could have put together what we've got.''

ROOT, ROOT, ROOT FOR HARRY CARAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the official first pitch of the 1999 major league
season has already been thrown out, no baseball season ever really
begins until a really good book about the sport hits the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Well, batter up, then, because Steve Stone's ``Where's Harry?''
captures the fun, nostalgia and occasional plain silliness that
baseball is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Caray was truly a living contradiction,'' Stone says.
``Most of us don't have the nerve to live the way Harry did. He was
absolutely unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone spent 15 years playing understudy to Caray on the WGN-TV
superstation in Chicago. Caray spent a near half-century as
baseball's best-known, though, in his later years, not always the
best TV and radio broadcaster. First with the St. Louis Cardinals,
then with the Oakland Athletics, the Chicago White Sox and,
finally, the Chicago Cubs, Caray called 'em like he saw 'em, but
how he saw 'em was sometimes influenced by how much he was still
feeling the effects of the night before, or whether he was upset
with his producer for not providing more shots of buxom fans in the
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet 90 percent of his viewers and listeners loved him,
probably because, Stone postulates, Caray acted the way blue-collar
baseball fans thought they would if somehow they could switch
places with ol' Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said he worked for the fans,'' Stone said. ``If they
liked what he had to say, that was what was most important to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of ``Where's Harry?'' reflects the question Stone says
he was repeatedly asked during his stint with Caray in the WGN
booth, and what they still want to know two years after Caray's
death at age 83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Harry?'' works wonderfully well, and the reason is
Stone's determination to show Caray in all his warty glory. We read
about generous Harry, who never met a good cause he wouldn't try to
help or a stranger he wouldn't try to turn into a Cubs fan. We wipe
away a few tears learning about Harry the orphan boy and Grandpa
Harry who missed quality time with his children but harvested a lot
of love with a late-life third marriage and extended family.
</P>
<P>
   But we also meet Harry the Paranoid, who was always convinced
somebody was trying to steal his job; Harry the Jerk, who
mistreated Stone on the air when a business partnership didn't work
out as planned; Harry the Dirty Old Man, who never met a pretty
young woman he didn't like; and Harry the shameless self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is also honest about his tumultuous relationship with
Caray. There were times, he admits, when Caray's spotlight-hogging
grew tedious. He enjoys his professional role a lot more now that
Caray's laid-back grandson, Chip, shares the WGN booth at Wrigley
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Harry and me, it was like a marriage with all the ups and
downs,'' Stone said. ``I always realized I owed Harry a great debt.
He had the power at any given time to say to the bosses he wanted
me out of there, but he never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steve Stone, like baseball fans all over, misses Harry
Caray. The gregarious old-timer's good points far outweighed the
bad, Stone concludes, and baseball will never see his like again.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is an underlying theme in ``Where's Harry?,'' one
certainly not intended by the author, it is that Harry Caray was
almost as lucky to spend 15 years working with Steve Stone. Great
performers need great support; and, happily enough, ``Where's
Harry?'' qualifies as a great baseball book. If you loved Harry, or
if you love baseball, read it.
___
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, (basketball star) Michael Jordan visited Wrigley
Field, and Cubs officials went to his skybox to ask him if he
wanted to come up to the (WGN) booth and spend a few minutes with
Harry, who absolutely adored Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ```No way,' Michael said. `I can't do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Why not?' '' asked a befuddled Cubs official.
</P>
<P>
   ```I love Harry,' Michael said, `but I don't want to go on the
air and have him introduce me as Michael Jackson.' ''
_ from Where's Harry,? by Steve Stone with Barry Rozner.

   The title of ``Where's Harry?'' reflects the question Stone says
he was repeatedly asked during his stint with Caray in the WGN
booth, and what they still want to know two years after Caray's
death at age 83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Harry?'' works wonderfully well, and the reason is
Stone's determination to show Caray in all his warty glory. We read
about generous Harry, who never met a good cause he wouldn't try to
help or a stranger he wouldn't try to turn into a Cubs fan. We wipe
away a few tears learning about Harry the orphan boy and Grandpa
Harry who missed quality time with his children but harvested a lot
of love with a late-life third marriage and extended family.
</P>
<P>
   But we also meet Harry the Paranoid, who was always convinced
somebody was trying to steal his job; Harry the Jerk, who
mistreated Stone on the air when a business partnership didn't work
out as planned; Harry the Dirty Old Man, who never met a pretty
young woman he didn't like; and Harry the shameless self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is also honest about his tumultuous relationship with
Caray. There were times, he admits, when Caray's spotlight-hogging
grew tedious. He enjoys his professional role a lot more now that
Caray's laid-back grandson, Chip, shares the WGN booth at Wrigley
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Harry and me, it was like a marriage with all the ups and
downs,'' Stone said. ``I always realized I owed Harry a great debt.
He had the power at any given time to say to the bosses he wanted
me out of there, but he never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steve Stone, like baseball fans all over, misses Harry
Caray. The gregarious old-timer's good points far outweighed the
bad, Stone concludes, and baseball will never see his like again.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is an underlying theme in ``Where's Harry?,'' one
certainly not intended by the author, it is that Harry Caray was
almost as lucky to spend 15 years working with Steve Stone. Great
performers need great support; and, happily enough, ``Where's
Harry?'' qualifies as a great baseball book. If you loved Harry, or
if you love baseball, read it.

   ``In 1997, (basketball star) Michael Jordan visited Wrigley
Field, and Cubs officials went to his skybox to ask him if he
wanted to come up to the (WGN) booth and spend a few minutes with
Harry, who absolutely adored Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ```No way,' Michael said. `I can't do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Why not?' '' asked a befuddled Cubs official.
</P>
<P>
   ```I love Harry,' Michael said, `but I don't want to go on the
air and have him introduce me as Michael Jackson.' ''
_ from Where's Harry,? by Steve Stone with Barry Rozner.

STRANDED FAMILY LEADS TO REFUGEE CENTER AT TEXAS CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When their refugee resettlement agency
folded, the Bosnian mother and her four children were virtually
stranded in their Fort Worth apartment, left with just a few pieces
of furniture and no community support.
</P>
<P>
   It was in their plight that Pat Friar and scores of fellow
members at St. Paul's Lutheran Church discovered a thriving
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Here is a place where we can really help
someone,' '' says Friar, a retired office manager who met the
family when her church was asked to step in. ``They had nothing. It
was something I think we were looking for without realizing we were
looking for it. It was just like coming home to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Friar, a volunteer, coordinates a thriving
refugee ministry at St. Paul's. Last week, Friar and other church
members drove to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport to greet their 18th
refugee family, this one from Bosnia. Thus began the now-familiar
process of guiding the newcomers through the difficult adjustment
to Texas and America.
</P>
<P>
   Like the latest arrivals, most of the families have come from
the troubled Balkans. St. Paul's has also assisted families from
Sudan, Burma and Vietnam. Most of them come with only a suitcase of
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get more out of it than we put in,'' Friar says.
``We're looking at people who have had really bad breaks, and we're
sitting fat, dumb and happy in America. All of them have horror
stories. They've lost everything, been on the run for years. In
some cases there's physical abuse. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Friar's church is a key cog in a resettlement network that has
made North Texas a common destination for people driven from their
homelands. Last year, Refugee Services of North Texas, a nonprofit
organization, resettled 244 people from 67 families, often with the
assistance of area churches.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have a well-founded fear of persecution in their
native countries based on religious, political or social beliefs.
Resettlement workers expect that many of the thousands of ethnic
Albanians currently fleeing Kosovo will ultimately end up in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee Services attempts to find church sponsors for each
incoming family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important part, besides their donations, is the time
they're able to spend with the families,'' Emily Russ, a caseworker
with Refugee Services, says of the church assistance. ``With the
size of our staff, we can't sit down and have coffee every day, or
go over there. A church's involvement allows more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day in a Fort Worth apartment, Friar seemed like kin
to Ivan Kis and his family of four, who fled Bosnia after Bosnian
soldiers ransacked the family's house and attacked Kis' wife in
1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But though her week is consumed with refugee work, Friar
deflects credit to the 80 or so people from St. Paul's who also
contribute. One man repairs appliances that the refugees may use; a
group of church men move furniture that another person has stored.
Other St. Paul members gather refugees from the airport, drive them
to an apartment they have readied, take the family for medical
exams and inoculations, drive them for groceries, help get the
children enrolled in school and get the adults jobs, and counsel
the refugees during a confusing and often frightening time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we stay in touch with them,'' Friar says. ``We want to be
friends with them after their needs have been taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Friar says, the refugees often seem confused by the
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're surprised that people are helping them with no gain in
mind,'' Friar says. ``But God is the one who's doing it. There is
no way we could have put together what we've got.''

U.S. SOLDIERS BUILD CAMP IN ALBANIA FOR REFUGEE RELIEF EFFORT

   TIRANA, Albania _ Working under blazing runway lights, an
advance crew of American soldiers worked late Monday preparing a
camp from which about 6,000 U.S. troops will coordinate an airlift
of supplies for the ethnic Albanian refugees who have flooded this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five soldiers arriving in two large military transports
began building the camp next to Rinas Airport, on the edge of
Tirana, the capital. It will serve as a distribution point for aid
to the more than 200,000 refugees who have entered Albania so far.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have described the effort as a humanitarian
mission, and have repeatedly denied that any ground offensive is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   But local radio stations Monday buzzed with the news of the
American arrival, which many people here took as a signal that NATO
ground operations would soon begin in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much criticism among foreign officials here of
the many days it has taken relief organizations, including those of
the United Nations, to get large-scale assistance to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But the American relief missions Monday, in addition to others
from Italy and Turkey, turned Tirana's tiny airport into a bustling
center from which cargo trucks laden with supplies filed out onto
the main highway late into the night. American officials said that
up to 500 men would be required to build the base camp before the
thousands of U.S. soldiers arrive to handle the airbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Six more American C-130 cargo planes were to arrive in Albania
on Tuesday, and the pace was to accelerate to 10 supply flights a
day by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials said that, in addition to the trucks, six
helicopters were already ferrying supplies between the airport and
the northern Albanian city of Kukes, near the Kosovo border, where
many of the refugees are living on the street and in open fields.

CAST IS THE BEST THING ABOUT NBC'S `RELATIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Everything's Relative'' has a fine cast, a relatively modest
laugh track and flying broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the laugh track has good reason for its modesty.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC midseason sitcom, which premieres Tuesday, is bright,
perky and lily white, just the way NBC likes its comedies.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a young comedy writer, Leo Gorelick (Kevin Rahm) _
it's so nice to see TV writers broaden their horizons _ and his
wacky family.
</P>
<P>
   Wacky family member No. 1 is Leo's father, Jake (Jeffrey
Tambor), who is an L.A. kind of dad.
</P>
<P>
   He's a long-divorced attorney, he's self-absorbed, he wants to
be buddies with his sons and he thinks all women are in love with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Wacky family member No. 2 is Leo's mother, Mickey (Jill
Clayburgh), a clinical psychologist and expert on obsession who is,
naturally, raucously obsessive about her family.
</P>
<P>
   Wacky family member No. 3 is Leo's older brother, Marty (Eric
Schaeffer), a twice-married doctor who's homing in on his third
bride.
</P>
<P>
   The problems here seem to be about on the level of ``The
Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.'' They just seem more worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of Tuesday night's pilot, for example, is Leo's concern
that his mother may move into his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm was somewhere in the film ``Clay Pigeons'' and has appeared
in such high-visibility TV shows as ``Pacific Blue'' and ``Rescue
77'' _ which are, I believe, publicly subsidized work projects for
young actors. Keeps 'em off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But he's agreeable as the obligatory oasis of sanity in the eye
of the comedy storm. Rahm reminds me a little of David Spade, but
more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   The casting coups are Tambor and Clayburgh. Tambor is fresh from
six years as the pathetic Hank Kingsley on HBO's ``The Larry
Sanders Show.'' Clayburgh might not have been burning up theater
marquees in recent years, but she was, by golly, an Oscar nominee
for ``An Unmarried Woman'' and ``Starting Over.''
</P>
<P>
   Tambor is a seasoned comedy actor who can do annoying in several
variations. He's not another Hank Kingsley here. No, Jake is a (set
ital)confidently(end ital) annoying individual. But the producers
better be careful. A little can be a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The refreshing thing about Clayburgh is that she acts her
comedy. Despite being wacky family member No. 2, Mickey is the most
authentic character in the show.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you've been wondering about the flying broccoli. It
floats through the air in a kind of fantasy sequence _ Leo feeling
oppressed by his family.  &QL; 
There's also a wacky vegetable No. 2, played by cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   The writing isn't up to the level of acting talent. And the four
most frequently occurring words in the script seem to be ``the,''
``a,'' ``ass'' and ``hump.'' Not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   The show begins with Jake and Leo in a men's clothing store.
They go to a counter to ask about a particular label of shirts.
Something is wrong with the clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' says the clerk. ``Uh, how do I explain this? OK, my name
is Tim Inman, right? That's my name. OK. So, uh, OK, you know my
name's Tim Inman.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes on for a while. The laugh track is amused but has the
good grace not to howl. You, however, may feel free to groan.

   The New York Times plans 4 pages of stories, photos and graphics
on the continuing crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton said today that
the United States was committed to a relentless bombing campaign in
Serbia for ``the long haul'' if the Yugoslav President, Slobodan
Milosevic, did not withdraw his police units from Kosovo and work
toward a political settlement that would allow the refugees to
return home. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ NATO today gave its military commander
the authority he wanted to send 24 U.S. Apache helicopter gunships
to Albania, with surface-to-surface missiles and about 2,000
American soldiers who will use them to attack Serbian forces across
the border in Kosovo. Other developments. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   With a graphic and a map.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Washington) _ Senior officials of the Clinton
administration have refrained from using the words ``genocide'' or
``war criminal'' in describing Slobodan Milosevic and his actions
in Kosovo. This is in part, according to one of the officials
involved in the policy, because the administration is likely to end
up having to negotiate with Milosevic. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Kukes, Albania) _ Refugees pouring into Albania
from Kosovo have been bringing with them detailed firsthand
accounts of mass killings and burned corpses. The reports have been
so frequent and so repetitive in their detail that officials have
brought in 60 specially trained investigators to interview refugees
and keep records for possible war-crimes indictments. By John
Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-INTEL (Washington) _ A surveillance photo made public
today does show armored vehicles and civilians being routed, but
intelligence officials say that so far they have seen no evidence
of mass graves. By Steven Lee Myers. (500 words)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace, Macedonia) _ With tens of thousands of
fleeing Albanians backed up in dismal conditions at the Macedonian
border, international relief officials today accused Macedonia of
endangering lives by processing the refugees too slowly. By
Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ As Serbia tried to
clean up today after NATO's most intensive bombing raids so far,
Serbian television once again gave prominence to a moderate ethnic
Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, and his separate meetings today
with a senior Yugoslav official and the Russian ambassador. By
Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-EUROPE (London) _ The extensive news reporting of the
plight of the Kosovo refugees is having a powerful effect on public
opinion across Europe, turning pacifists and anti-NATO activists of
decades ago and anti-NATO critics of just a week ago into
supporters of sustained bombing. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ARMY (Tirana) _ Working under blazing runway lights, an
advance crew of American soldiers worked late into the night
preparing a camp from which some 6,000 U.S. troops ultimately will
man a humanitarian airlift to Kosovar Albanian refugees who have
flooded this country. By Stephen Levine.

   WINTER HAVEN, Fla. _ Many sets of brothers have played in the
major leagues. Some never got to play together.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre never played with Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Three DiMaggios played simultaneously, but never on the same
team.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron and Cal Ripken Jr. didn't have much more than a ``cup
of coffee'' with their younger brothers.
</P>
<P>
   So, Sandy Alomar Jr. and his brother, Robbie _ reunited with the
Cleveland Indians _ aren't taking it for granted. But it wouldn't
have been easy picking out the brothers after spending a few
minutes in the Indians' clubhouse in Winter Haven this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Your first guess might have been Robbie and Wil Cordero, a
fellow Puerto Rican whose locker stall was right next to Robbie's,
across the large room from Sandy's locker.
</P>
<P>
   Both new to the Indians, Robbie Alomar and Cordero talked a lot
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy, who as a catcher and an Indian veteran had a different
set of responsibilities, stood apart and aloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably gonna hit us on opening day,'' Sandy said. ``In
spring training we're not really focusing on playing together.
We're concentrating on fundamentals and getting ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when everything is ready and you go out there to play
ball, I think that's when you'll say: `Wow, I'm playing with my
brother!'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it'll be a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it won't be the first time. They played one game
together in 1988 and seven games in 1989 for the San Diego Padres
before Sandy was traded to the Indians. Since then, each have
played in the World Series twice. They have combined for 15
All-Star appearances, each winning an All-Star MVP award, and eight
Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But they rarely saw each other during the season.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of Robbie joining the Indians has been a Hot
Stove League topic for several years. He signed a four-year, $32
million contract on Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought it was gonna happen,'' Robbie said. ``They
were trying to make some trades, but it wasn't the right time. Now
is the right time, and looking at this club made my decision
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was here, I knew that. Sandy was part of the
decision. But I play this game to win, and we've got a chance to
win. And Cleveland was the most interested in my services.''
</P>
<P>
   Second base has been the Indians' weakest position since the
trade of Carlos Baerga in 1996. Now it is a strength. Robbie Alomar
will bat second or third and provide power and speed. Defensively,
he may be the best second baseman in the game.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother says it goes beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things in baseball that fans don't
understand, things you can't see from the stands,'' Sandy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans only see what happens on the action, but there's a lot of
stuff that happens in the dugout that nobody sees, but it helps
players perform better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie's a student of the game. He knows everything the
pitcher's doing. He figures things out very quickly, and that helps
out other players.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways they are very different.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy, who will be 33 in June, is married and has two children.
His career is identified with one team. He bats right-handed and
runs slowly. He's a catcher. He has become something of a
weightlifting fanatic and has built up his 6-foot-5 frame to more
than 220 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie, who just turned 31, is single and engaged to tennis star
Mary Pierce. The Indians are his fourth major-league team. He is
listed at 6-foot, 185 pounds. He is a switch-hitter. Quickness is a
a big part of his game. He has stolen 340 bases.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from being the sons of Sandy Alomar, who played 15
major-league seasons with five different baseball teams and is now
a roving instructor in the Chicago Cubs' organization, they also
have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Both Alomars are coming off disappointing seasons. Both feel an
urgency to win this season. And neither has given much thought to
the brothers who played before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't lie to you ... when the Alous played together, I was
probably 6 or 7 years old,'' Sandy said. ``I can't remember any
other brother combination other than George Brett and Ken Bett or
some of the guys when my dad was playing. I didn't really pay
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Robbie: ``They played with my dad. When you're a kid,
you're just playing baseball. You're not thinking about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now you think about the other brothers who have played,
the DiMaggios, the Alous, the Ripkens and those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But it beats playing against each other, as they have twice in
the playoffs. The Orioles eliminated the Indians in 1996, and the
Indians prevailed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie recalls some childhood spats with Sandy, but says they
have always been close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing,'' Robbie said, ``is to play against your
brother because he doesn't want you to go 0-for-4, or you don't
want him to come up with a man on third and two out and the game on
the line. Who are you gonna pull for?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm glad that's not gonna happen.''
</P>

   TIRANA, Albania _ NATO forces waging an air war against
Yugoslavia also acted as a ``good Samaritan'' on Monday, beginning
an airlift of some of the 230,000 ethnic Albanians who have fled
Kosovo for Albania in the past 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a plane carrying the first 150 refugees landed in
western Turkey, President Clinton and his NATO allies emphasized
that moving the refugees to safe havens in allied countries is only
a temporary response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethnic cleansing of Kosovo cannot stand as a permanent
event,'' Clinton said during a brief appearance in the Roosevelt
Room of the White House to announce ``Operation Sustain Hope,'' a
stepped-up effort to help the Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees belong in their own homes on their own land,'' he
said. ``Our immediate goal is to provide relief. Our long-term goal
is to give them their right to return.''
</P>
<P>
   To better coordinate the humanitarian assistance, Clinton
established a panel headed by Brian Atwood, the administrator of
the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). In addition,
he ordered a toll-free telephone number for private citizens who
want to help: 1-800-USAID RELIEF (cq.).
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO wants to be a good Samaritan,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
said in Brussels, ``but we are not a refugee organization.''
Consequently, NATO has turned to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to coordinate assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged that western governments appreciate the
enormity of the refugee drama, which can no longer be handled by
Kosovo's immediate neighbors alone,'' High Commissioner Sadako
Ogata said in a statement from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In the first wave of humanitarian assistance by NATO, allied
aircraft delivered nearly 200 tons of food and emergency supplies
to refugees in Albania and Macedonia. NATO called the relief
flights a ``humanitarian air bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the continuing flow of refugees out of Kosovo is
threatening to overwhelm Albania and Macedonia, where most of these
fleeing have gathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that can be said is that the situation is critical,''
Albanian President Rexhep Meidana said in an interview Monday.
``I'm quite sure this flow will continue and in the next days there
will be many, many more refugees in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Meidana said he does not support plans by NATO to
temporarily place more than 100,000 refugees in other countries.
There is a fear here that the refugees may never come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must remain near their land and their houses,'' Meidana
said. ``They must return to Kosovo as soon as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the refugees will never return to their homes in Kosovo
unless there are NATO troops in the province to maintain their
security. He also said he supports the use of ground troops to
drive the Serb forces out of the province _ a contingency opposed
by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   On the humanitarian side, a small contingent of U.S. troops
began to set up a camp near the Tirana airport handle relief
operations. The United States plans to send at least 6,000 troops
to distribute food and supplies to refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the NATO airlift of refugees, the United States has
agreed to accept up to 20,000 people. ``Our goal is to take some of
the burden off the struggling front line nations,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at the State Department and the Pentagon acknowledged
that the 20,000 refugees the United States has agreed to host may
be housed at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo, Cuba.

OFFICIALS FEAR MASS DEATHS IN REFUGEE CAMP

   BLACE, Macedonia _ More than 50,000 refugees stranded in an open
field on the Kosovo border will begin to die in large numbers if
they are not moved out of what one doctor called a ``human
cesspit'' within a couple of days, medical authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was little prospect of meeting that timetable, however,
because the Macedonian government is refusing to cede to the United
Nations the responsibility for processing the refugees, which has
been a painfully show process. The result is a human logjam in an
open field, where a lack of clean water and sanitary facilities
threatens to cause an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has built a huge refugee handling center just a few miles
from the open field at Blace. The United Nations said it was
capable of moving up to 20,000 people a day to the center and to
other inland camps. By Monday night, however, only a few thousand
had been moved.
</P>
<P>
   At least 120,000 refugees have entered Macedonia in the last
week, 65,000 streaming into the open field at Blace just last
Thursday and Friday, when Serb troops began packing them on trains
and forcefully expelling them from Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
The Macedonian government says it cannot afford to allow more than
20,000 refugees to stay here, insisting that the others be moved on
to other countries immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But while Western countries, including the United States,
scramble to arrange flights to take the refugees to temporary
shelters abroad, the Macedonians insist on handling the processing
of the ethnic Albanians in the open field. The Macedonians,
however, have deputized only a handful of officials to handle the
registration, creating what medical authorities say is a disastrous
backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a keg of dynamite, waiting to explode,'' said Dr. Tom
Durant, a Boston physician with the American Refugee Committee,
after surveying the field Monday. ``If we don't get them out of
there, we're going to have major problems with all the communicable
diseases. A lot of people will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Corbaz, deputy head of the International Red Cross, said
that between 20 and 30 people have already died in the field, most
of them newborns and elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakest, the smallest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and other medical personnel working with refugees said
the outbreak of dysentery and other diseases is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lex Winkler, director of the humanitarian medical group
Medecins Sans Frontieres, shook his head as he surveyed the huddled
masses. Hundreds collapsed Monday under a hot afternoon sun as Red
Cross volunteers brought them from the field on filthy stretchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ad hoc. We're moving very slowly,'' said Winkler, who
like other physicians here is frustrated that the Macedonian
authorities are not allowing humanitarian agencies to move larger
numbers of refugees out of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees have been using an adjacent river as an open toilet,
and aid workers have been desperately trying to provide bottled
water to prevent an outbreak of dysentery.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are appalling conditions,'' said Winkler. ``The river is
one huge toilet. We're asking for trouble. At most, we have a
couple of days left. If we have dysentery, we'll have a disaster.
It will spread rapidly through the camp. We need clean water and
latrines.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles to the south, that clean water and those
latrines are waiting to be used.
</P>
<P>
   The UN and NATO are both trying to maintain good relations with
the Macedonian government, but the situation has grown increasingly
strained as both groups claim the Macedonians are ignoring their
pleas to speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, said that her organization has offered to take over the
registration process, but that the Macedonian government rebuffed
the offer. She said the camp would have been more than half empty
already had the Macedonians allowed the UN group to process and
register refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the stench at the field becomes more overpowering.
Monday, the Macedonian police and soldiers keeping the refugees
inside the field, along with aid workers ferrying food and water
and diapers to them on five tractors, began wearing masks to ward
off the smell and guard against infection.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees themselves are becoming increasingly desperate.
Monday, Turkane Berisha cried as she tried to find out what became
of her father, Suleiman, who had collapsed with an apparent heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she tried to comfort her sister, Shukrane, who
also collapsed. Medical volunteers were too busy with more
desperate cases, leaving Shukrane to writhe and moan on a muddy
stretcher. Moments later, a woman came over and said she needed the
stretcher. Shukrane was moved to the bare ground, and her cries
became more hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I find out if my father is alive or dead?'' Berisha
asked. Medical staff dashed around, too busy to help her. There was
no one keeping track of who had come in for treatment, who had been
shipped off to a hospital, or who had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for me to hear that he is dead, so I won't worry
like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha said she and her family had left Pristina last week and
had spent four days in the muddy, wretched field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I never left Kosovo,'' she said. ``We've come here to
die. The Macedonian police are like the Serbs. They are killing us,
but they are killing us more slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   At another of the medical tents, Halil Avdiu looked on
helplessly as his unconscious wife was brought in. His five
children, ranging in age from 4 to 11, wept uncontrollably, sitting
on a small duffle bag that held all their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even animals could not live in these conditions,'' Avdiu said.
``If this goes on another week, half the people will die.''
</P>
<P>
   If Blace is a vision of hell, the NATO camp waiting for more
refugees is a little bit of heaven, at least comparatively.
Hundreds of British, French, and Italian soldiers handed out food
and blankets and showed kindness to the refugees. The refugees,
nearly all of whom are Muslim, had their shoes neatly stored
outside the flaps to their tents, which were erected by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Aran Shala, 20, who had spent seven days in the field at Blace,
waited with Ilir Berisha and his family for British soldiers to put
up a tent for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so much better,'' Shala said. ``I thank NATO for
helping Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler said the tens of thousands of refugees still waiting in
Kosovo to cross the border have no food, water, or medical help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only imagine how bad it is back there,'' he said.

TREASURY WOES `SYSTEMATIC,' PROBERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A task force assembled after nearly $9 million was
allegedly stolen from the state treasury's Unpaid Check Fund has
found ``serious and systemic problems'' in the department.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Record-keeping was so poor under former treasurer
Joseph D. Malone that 4,000 state checks already cashed and
totaling $8 million were recorded by the treasury as outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad information coming into the system,'' Malone's
successor, Shannon P. O'Brien, said Monday in announcing findings
of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also found:
</P>
<P>
   --That one staff person was responsible for reconciling dozens
of state accounts worth millions of dollars. The employee, who left
the treasury in October _ and has not been implicated in the thefts
_ was unable to balance the books, making it easier for the
suspects to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the checking accounts weren't reconciled monthly
and the potential for fraud increased dramatically,'' O'Brien said,
adding: ``We probably will never be able to fully reconcile those
accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   --That former deputy treasurer Robert E. Foley, one of four men
charged with embezzling the money, was the treasury manager in
charge of implementing internal cash management controls, of which
there were few.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this isn't the classic case of the fox guarding the
henhouse, I don't know what is,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   --Guidelines for writing checks were so lax, a $100 million
check the state issued to a hospital was signed by a single
treasury employee, the task force found.
</P>
<P>
   So far, four men have been charged in connection with the
alleged theft of $8.9 million from the Unpaid Check Fund, where
uncashed state payments are held for a year. The investigation
continues.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the fund, John F. Trischitta, was arrested in
February for conspiring with an outside ``heir finder,'' Martin
Robbins, to siphon $6.5 million into an escrow account at
BankBoston. A bank employee notified the attorney general when
Robbins later tried to withdraw those funds, an act that launched
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While that $6.5 million has since been returned to the state,
another $2.4 million remains missing.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who was Trischitta's boss, and another heir finder,
Thomas Ciliberto, were arrested shortly after, charged with bilking
the $2.4 million from the same account.
</P>
<P>
   Heir finders try to match money or abandoned property held in
state accounts to their rightful owners, who may be dead, have a
new name or address, or otherwise have been difficult to locate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have said that the rip-off of the Unpaid Check Fund can
be attributed to two bad apples,'' O'Brien said. ``But it's more
than that. It's about two bad apples who were able to take
advantage of a faulty system without adequate internal controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force, which included O'Brien, state Comptroller Martin
Benison, and state Auditor Joseph DeNucci, did not focus on the
Abandoned Property Division, O'Brien said. That account is filled
with money and other property the state declares abandoned. Checks
that sit in the Unpaid Check Fund for one year are then transferred
to Abandoned Property.
</P>
<P>
   DeNucci has said recordkeeping was also poor in Abandoned
Property, which Foley oversaw in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is seeking an additional $1.1 million in funding from
the Legislature for next year to increase what she feels is a
depleted staff, to upgrade computer systems that crash frequently,
and to hire an outside auditor to carefully monitor the treasury
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Of that money, about $580,000 would be a permanent increase for
the department to fund the new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeNucci regularly investigates state departments, he
does not check each office every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the level of (auditing) detail does not exist,''
said Beth Pearce, the new deputy treasurer for cash management who
replaced Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other changes the task force recommended:
</P>
<P>
   --Procedures for check cashing should be tightened. All check
signatures must be original and any payment of more than $100,000
will need more than one person to sign off on it.
</P>
<P>
   --All accounts under cash management should be reconciled
monthly.
</P>
<P>
   --O'Brien should consider increasing the insurance covering a
theft by a treasury worker.

 &HT;    Sehgal to oversee state trade initiatives
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier and Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes named R.K. Sehgal chairman of
the Industry, Trade &AMP; Tourism board, bringing a strong
international emphasis to the department charged with bolstering
the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Monday he wants Sehgal, who previously boosted the
international presence of three Atlanta companies, to increase
Georgia's trade abroad. In a lunchtime speech to the Atlanta Rotary
Club, Barnes said he wants Georgia to be more aggressive about
seeking international trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes apparently intends to rely heavily on Sehgal to
accomplish this mission. Sehgal said he will recommend candidates
to Barnes for the 20 spots on the Industry, Trade &AMP; Tourism board,
which oversees the work of the state's Department of Industry,
Trade &AMP; Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Thomas, president and CEO of the 3,100-member Georgia
Chamber of Commerce, said he liked Sehgal's international
experience. Thomas said he hopes the new chairman will also step up
economic development in the state's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sehgal, 57, replaces A. Ray Weeks, an Atlanta developer.
</P>
<P>
   A suburban Atlanta resident, Sehgal said he has known Barnes for
20 years. Sehgal gave at least $3,000 to Barnes' campaign,
according to public records.
</P>
<P>
   Raghbir Kumar ``R.K.'' Sehgal is a well-connected Atlanta
businessman credited with making Law Companies Group an
internationally known engineering company. Sehgal, 57, spent 32
years at Law, and during his decade as chief executive officer the
company grew from a respected regional company with $50 million in
revenue into an international firm with revenue of $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Law, Sehgal attracted well-known names to the company's
board, including former Atlanta Mayor and United Nations Ambassador
Andrew Young; former Gov. Joe Frank Harris; and the late John
Ehrlichman, Richard Nixon's former domestic policy adviser who
resigned during the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Sehgal resigned from Law in 1994. In February 1995, he was hired
as CEO of Williams Group International. Sehgal left the engineering
services company in late 1996, becoming vice chairman and CEO of
H.J. Russell, one of the nation's largest black-owned construction
companies. Sehgal said he stepped down as CEO in December 1998, but
still works as vice chairman.

CANCER-SHRINKING DRUGS MAY HELP CURTAIL HEART PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angiogenesis inhibitors _ drugs hailed as opening a new era in
cancer treatment _ can also dramatically slow the growth of
artery-blocking deposits that cause heart attacks and strokes,
Boston scientists are reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The results are the first evidence that the buildup of these
plaques in vital coronary arteries and other vessels can be
controlled by shutting off blood supply to the deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, so far limited to mice fed high-cholesterol diets,
suggest that the angiogenesis-inhibiting drugs could become novel
weapons not only in cancer but also heart disease: they are the two
leading causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drugs in the new study is endostatin, the glamor
compound whose ability to shrink tumors in mice has focused world
attention on its initial human tests expected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The inhibitor drugs work by curbing angiogenesis, the
development of new, small blood vessels branching off larger,
established arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis is a normal and necessary process in wound healing
and some other body functions. But the process is hijacked by
malignant tumors, which recruit the tiny new vessels to nourish
them so that the tumors can grow and spread.
</P>
<P>
   And, the new report confirms, the fatty and fibrous plaque
deposits that dangerously narrow arteries in the process called
atherosclerosis also rely on angiogenesis to grow past a certain
size.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Dr. Karen Moulton, a cardiologist and researcher in
the laboratory of Dr. Judah Folkman at Children's Hospital in
Boston, is being published in the journal Circulation. Folkman is a
pioneer in research on angiogenesis and its regulation by various
natural and synthetic compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton said in an interview that further research will show
whether giving angiogenesis inhibitors to people at high risk for
heart disease can prevent large artery-clogging deposits from
forming. It may also be, she said, that the drugs could even shrink
large plaques. Also of potential benefit, said Moulton, is that
cutting off the plaques' blood supply could reduce the chances that
they will rupture, spilling out their contents and triggering a
heart attack or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   These prospects were termed ``appealing'' by Dr. Jeffrey Isner,
a cardiologist at St. Elizabeth's Hosital in Boston, who wrote an
accompanying editorial. But he emphasized that ``the complexity of
these proposals should not be underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis drugs with the opposite effect _ to promote, not
block, new blood vessel growth _ are already in human tests for
treating heart disease. These compounds, among them the substance
known as vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, stimulate the
growth of new vessels that route blood flow around blocked heart
arteries. They may replace bypass surgery for some heart patients.
</P>
<P>
   But the angiogenesis inhibiting drugs are aimed at the
atherosclerotic plaques inside blood vessels. They are formed of
fatty substances and connective tissue debris that begin to build
up at points where the inner lining of the blood vessel has been
damaged. Often, these deposits form inside the coronary arteries
that feed the heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton said it has long been noticed in post-mortem
examinations of humans that a network of very fine blood vessels
sometimes sprouts from the blood vessel and grows into the interior
of the fatty plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent years was it suggested that the new blood vessels
might be critical to the plaques' growth beyond a certain size,
because without the new vessels there would be insufficient oxygen
and other nutrients for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton's idea was to choke off this vascular life-support
system and see if that slowed the growth of the plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Her laboratory animals were mice with a genetic mutation making
them prone to developing atherosclerosis, especially when eating a
high-calorie diet. All of the mice were fed these diets. At 20
weeks of age, some animals were killed and the researchers measured
the size of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta, the body's
largest artery.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining mice were divided into three groups. One received
injections of endostatin; another received TNP 470, another
angiogenesis inhibitor that's being tested in human cancer
patients; and the third was injected with an inactive solution. The
mice received the treatments for 16 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When killed later and examined, the original untreated mice had
developed atherosclerotic plaques, and 13 percent of those plaques
were being fed by newly formed capillaries _ tiny blood vessels.
The smaller, more recent plaques in the mice that lived the extra
16 weeks tended not to have new blood vessels, while the larger
ones were more likely to show evidence of angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   The key finding was that the plaques that formed in the mice
treated with endostatin and TNP 470 were 70 to 85 percent smaller
than those that grew in the untreated mice. This was evidence that
the drugs, by choking off the growth of new blood vessels, kept the
plaques from growing to a dangerous size.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment at different times showed that the inhibitors had much
less effect if given too early _ before the plaques reached
substantial size and needed new blood vessels to grow further _ or
too late, after the plaques were mature.
</P>
<P>
   The study, she said, shows that the tiny vessels formed by
angiogenesis ``affect the progression rate of the disease, and that
establishes them as a target for therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are using angiogenesis in the opposite fashion
for heart disease. Isner and others have shown that giving
angiogenesis-enhancing growth factors to patients with clogged
coronary arteries appears to encourage the sprouting of new, small
blood vessels that create bypassses so that blood can flow past the
blocked areas.
</P>
<P>
   The new research raises a question: Would those growth factors
also speed up the enlargement of plaques inside these patients'
arteries? Apparently not: Isner wrote in his editorial that no such
effects has shown up in patients treated with the growth factors.
</P>
<P>
   Blood vessel inhibitors like endostatin might be given at a
relatively early stage of disease, just as cholesterol-lowering
statins are now used to keep blood vessels healthy. The blood
vessel stimulators would be reserved for relieving arteries that
are already badly clogged.

THEY HATE THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM (BUT MAKE CHECKS PAYABLE TO
...)
</HEADLINE>
  (ac) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
devoted years to scorning the campaign finance system as riddled
with loopholes and ruled by wealthy interests. But that has not
deterred him from partaking in it himself.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent reception at the elegant Four Seasons Hotel, Bradley
snagged moneyed Democrats between their bites of beef Wellington
and seafood parfait and tried to persuade them to contribute to his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona is also known for championing
campaign reform. But there he was the other day at a fund-raising
brunch at the classy Sequoia restaurant on the Potomac River in
Washington. For $250, donors were treated to a buffet, topped off
with a speech by McCain, who is seeking the Republican nomination.
For $1,000, donors also got their photographs taken with the
senator and hobnobbed with him at a reception beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain argue that the existing laws leave them no
choice but to devote much time to traveling the country hunting for
millions of dollars or hitting up prospects during interminable
telephone calls. Neither is willing to follow the lead of Sen.
Russell Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who co-sponsored a
campaign finance bill with McCain. Feingold almost lost his
re-election last year because of several restrictions he imposed on
his own fund-raising, like limiting overall spending to $1 for each
registered voter and refusing to accept unregulated donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play by whatever the rules are,'' Bradley said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the paradox is striking: Never before in American politics
have two contenders (or even one) so identified with campaign
reform taken to the presidential fund-raising circuit. Ross Perot
made his disdain for the system one of his signature issues in the
1992 campaign. But because he dipped into his own fortune to
finance his race, Perot could spurn the system that he had vowed to
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore their seriousness about reform _ and to counter
criticism that they are hypocrites _ both Bradley and McCain have
taken some steps to restrict the ways in which they collect money.
Unlike many of their opponents, they did not establish shadow
organizations in states with lax regulations like Virginia. Doing
so would have enabled them to raise huge sums of unregulated money.
Bradley has also refused money from political action committees, a
concession that McCain has not made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley and McCain are walking the tightest tightrope of any
candidates,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center
for Responsive Politics, a campaign reform advocacy group in
Washington. ``They've got to raise the money. But they've got to do
it cleaner than any one else.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reputations as reformers have posed opportunities and
obstacles for Bradley and McCain. Rather than shy away from the
issue, both candidates are highlighting it _ even at their own
fund- raising events _ to try to bestow populist, outsider tilts
upon their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley avoids the subject, but his supporters do not shrink
from drawing a contrast with Vice President Al Gore, who was
accused of bending campaign finance laws in the 1996 campaign.
McCain eagerly pounces on the vice president's practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would never, ever happen with Bill Bradley,'' said Jay
Jordan, who runs a diversified holding company in Chicago and is a
member of Bradley's national finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain and Bradley are soliciting from the
very interests they have assailed. McCain, in particular, is a
magnet for contributors because he is chairman of the influential
Senate Commerce Committee; whether he is White House bound or not,
many lobbyists see it as in their interest to donate to him.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns have lined up big corporate names to help raise
money. McCain's roster includes Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the
American International Group; Richard Notebaert, chairman of the
Ameritech Corp.; Henry M. Paulson Jr., chief executive of Goldman,
Sachs; and Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the Chicago Bulls and White
Sox. Bradley's fund-raisers include Leonard Riggio, chief executive
of Barnes &AMP; Noble; Thomas Labrecque, president of the Chase
Manhattan Corp.; Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks; and
John Bryan, chief executive of Sara Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns performed respectably in the first quarter of
this year, each taking in more than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though their cries for change may catch on with voters _ and
even contributors _ others are offended that McCain and Bradley
have been so outspoken. Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition, has pointedly discouraged Republicans from backing
McCain. He said the senator's campaign finance proposal threatened
the ability of his organization to promote candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John McCain has done a great deal of harm to
grass-roots movements like the Christian Coalition through that
McCain-Feingold bill,'' Robertson said in a recent interview with
CNN. ``It's going to be very hard to mobilize people to support
him. I don't see him really going too far.''

 PALM BEACH: too far.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And backers of Gore have privately warned labor leaders that
Bradley's stand on campaign finance stands would undermine unions'
influence in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, chairman of Democracy 21, a policy group based
in Washington, said Bradley and McCain had been singled out because
they were genuine reformers. ``I have spent 30 years working on the
campaign finance issue,'' he said. ``These two guys are for real in
their commitment to changing the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Because political action committees usually contribute only a
tiny fraction of donations to Presidential campaigns, even Bradley
acknowledged that his rejection of PAC money was essentially
symbolic. (Gore also refuses PAC donations.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't give much _ what, $4 million?'' Bradley said.
``First of all, it's what I do because of what I believe about
campaign finance reform. That's where it starts. And the second
level is that you're making a judgment that by eschewing the most
visible examples of the way campaigns are now financed, you will
draw people to your cause who recognize that there's something
different about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also expressed confidence that his stand on campaign
finance would ultimately help, not hinder, his quest. ``The people
who disagree with me on campaign finance reform, I believe, are
obviously misinformed because they believe that this is going to
inhibit their ability to carry out their political agenda,'' he
said in an interview. ``And obviously, that's the last thing I
want. Do I want the Democrats to win elections? No. So the majority
of Republicans that I talk to believe that the system is broken,
that it's corrupt and needs to be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seems a bit sheepish in his appeals to donors. At the
event here at the Four Seasons _ in the same ballroom where
Republicans held their own big money event several weeks ago _ the
former senator's pitch was about his cautiousness in seeking
donations, not about his need for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to raise money in a little different way,''
Bradley said. ``Because I believe strongly in campaign finance
reform, I think I have to set a standard that is higher than the
existing law. And so I don't take any PAC contributions, and I
don't set up sham state PACs in states like Virginia that are
totally unregulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left it to one of the organizers of the reception, John
H. Kessler, for the hard sell. ``We have to put fuel in the fire,''
implored Kessler, chairman of an investment company in Parsippany,
N.J. ``The fuel is the money.'' The take was roughly $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   At McCain's reception in Washington, attended by friends from
the Naval Academy, the senator collected about $85,000. He did not
mention reform but vowed to spend his contributions wisely. ``There
are two aspects to money in a campaign,'' he said. ``Not just how
you raise it, but how you spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bradley said it was not easy to solicit more
than $20 million, mostly in increments of $1,000, the most any
individual can give. With a smile, McCain said he had been tempted
by offers of unregulated money that he cannot accept. ``We got a
check from one guy for $10,000,'' he recalled. ``I had to say, `I'm
sorry pal, but if you've got some close family members who are over
18 ... .'''

HIGH COURT WON'T HEAR REPORTER'S LIBEL CLAIM IN BRANCH DAVIDIAN
CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear a Waco
journalist's claim that he was libeled by a Dallas-Fort Worth
television news report that he had warned the Branch Davidian cult
of an impending federal raid in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents raided the compound of cult leader David Koresh
outside Waco on Feb. 28, 1993. Four U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agents and five cult members died in the ensuing gun
battle. A 51-day standoff ended when the compound was consumed by
fire during a subsequent federal raid on April 19, 1993, that
killed Koresh and more than 80 followers.
</P>
<P>
   John McLemore sued WFAA-TV for libel. But the Texas Supreme
Court threw out the lawsuit, saying the station did not commit
libel because it did not knowingly lie or show reckless disregard
for the truth in airing its report.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury Department investigation of the raid and its
aftermath cleared McLemore, then a reporter for KWTX-TV who was on
the scene when federal agents stormed the compound. The department
said a postal driver, acting on a tip from a Waco TV cameraman, had
warned the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling against McLemore last year, the Texas Supreme Court
deemed him a ``public figure'' because of his renown in the
community as a television reporter covering the standoff between
the Branch Davidians and federal agents. To prove libel, public
figures must show that untruths about them were reported knowingly
or with reckless disregard for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In his U.S. Supreme Court appeal, McLemore argued that he should
be regarded as a private citizen. Private citizens need only show
that a news organization acted negligently in reporting false
information about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public figure must not only act voluntarily when he enters
into a public controversy, he must intend to influence its
outcome,'' McLemore's lawyers argued in a brief to the high court.
``McLemore may have entered into the Branch Davidian raid
voluntarily, but nothing he said and nothing he did had anything to
do with the public issues surrounding the raid.''

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - As the baseball season begins, league

It's degrading. Not to ballplayers, of course, but to fans. We

baseball teams should simply expand upon existing uniform signage.
Arizona's $52 million-dollar pitcher would be more than happy to

 &HT;    Win the Par-3 tournament? Not a chance
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Hey, David Duval's PGA Tour colleagues might be
in awe of 11 wins in 34 events, but they haven't gone brain-dead.
Of course they're going to sign him up for Wednesday's Par-3
Tournament and then root for him big-time. Everybody knows of the
Par-3 Jinx. Nobody ever has won the Par-3 on Wednesday and then
prevailed Sunday in the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie (Couples) signed me up, I guess,'' Duval said Monday
on the Augusta National grounds.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Duval pondering? Also revising that bit of history?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'll probably dump one (in the water) if I have to,''
Duval said, grinning. ``Not that I'm superstitious or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-collar man
</P>
<P>
   First, there was Tiger Woods' Sunday Red. Now, there is David's
Sunday Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Two tournament victories in a row with Navy from cap to socks,
and you can safely presume the same outfit might come out again
Sunday at Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worn blue before when I haven't won, but I do like
blue,'' Duval said. ``I think it's kind of a nice mix. Kind of
workmanlike. You might see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval registered at Augusta National on Monday but did not play.
Maybe it was a good idea. Ordering lunch became his first no-win
deal of the past couple of weeks. When his clam chowder arrived,
there was a fly in it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go changin'
</P>
<P>
   Is there an advantage to having 1 3/8-inch rough at Augusta
National, as opposed to a second cut of 5/8-inch in other years
that barely was noticed? Around the greens, the new stuff can make
it easier for the players. There are some pitching areas, such as
to the right of No. 6 and No. 8, where sloped areas previously cut
extremely tight have now been rid of the chunk factor. ``If you get
around the greens with this rough, it's easier to get (the club)
underneath it,'' Brad Faxon said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at four holes, with rough all around, ``really
aren't enough to make you intimidated or have to change a club into
the greens,'' Faxon said. ``It's just not going to hold a whole
lot.'' While it will take some spin off the ball, he said, it also
will help keep some drives from running into the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen, the two-time U.S. Open champion, thinks the rough
was installed chiefly to discourage players from driving wildly,
scooting by the trouble and into the clear. ``Like at 11, you used
to be about to take it right as far as you want,'' he said. ``Now,
you can't do it. You have to play the hole straightaway.'' Beyond
that, Janzen said, the mowers also are combing the rough toward the
tees, ``so the ball rolls even less.''
</P>
<P>
   Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Because the field of actual participants is 96 players this year
_ the most since 103 in 1966 _ threesomes, as opposed to the
customary twosomes, might be used for Thursday and Friday rounds. .
. . Hotel price increases have reached a new level. The Holiday Inn
is charging $299 per night. . . . The Byron Nelson statue will be
unveiled at 11 a.m. today in downtown Augusta by the Georgia Golf
Hall of Fame. . . . Six-time Masters winner Jack Nicklaus,
attending tonight's Champions Dinner, still is recovering from his
January hip replacement and is not in competitive condition.
However, Nicklaus already is playing and is almost a sure bet to
compete in the Memorial and the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played twice
last week in Florida. . . . Augusta National seems to bring out the
best in Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar even when he's not playing well
in college tournaments. In February, he shot a 69 during a practice
round at Augusta with a double-bogey on No. 2. . . . Hank Kuehne,
the U.S. Amateur champion, will play a practice round today,
partnering with British Amateur champion Sergio Garcia, in a
friendly match with the past two Masters champions, Mark O'Meara
and Woods.

HOW TO SELL THE TABLOIDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; David Pecker &LR; , who is about to become chairman of the board of
the company that owns both the National Enquirer and the Star, says
he'd be willing to spend $50 million  &LR; on  &LR; ``repositioning'' those
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   What would be an appropriate campaign? Ad Age asked a bunch of
pros how that could be done; their answers describe the process of
advertising in America:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``There's always room for trash, and that's their legacy,''
said New York's  &UR; Jerry Della Femina &LR; . ``They can't get away from
that. But they can position it as a better grade of trash, a more
exclusive brand of trash.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The first thing to do is consider semantics, said  &UR; Al Ries &LR; .
Get rid of the word ``tabloids,'' he said, and find a new label.
``You need to upgrade along the same lines as, `I don't make
movies, I make films.' `I'm not a garbageman, I'm a sanitation
engineer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ted Leonhardt &LR;  said the papers should position themselves as
``a vanguard of social change, and they are recording that in a
populist sense. It's all about getting in touch with what's real
now. ... Maybe in the end that's very healthy for all of us. All my
Episcopal roots are screaming as a result of that sort of thing,
but that's what they've got working for them.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Max Carey  &LR; of Atlanta suggested that the Enquirer come up
``with a credible spokesperson who would say the new owners are
taking it back to its core and making it a better product. ... The
mea culpa approach. ... It may be a complete lie. But it buys you
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Billy Joel &LR;  got into the act at San Francisco's Redwood Room
on Friday night, joining bassist  &UR; Pat Klobas  &LR; and pianist
 &UR; Michael Udelson &LR;  on ``Ain't Misbehavin'.'' It wasn't completely
unrehearsed; Joel huddled with Udelson for a few minutes to work
out switching sides on the piano bench several times during the
song. And  &UR; Dario Oakley  &LR; and his twins,  &UR; Seth &LR;  and &UR; Cody &LR; , ran into
 &UR; Jerry Rice  &LR; and his three kids playing video games at Q-Zar in
Redwood City on Saturday morning. Furthermore, the New York Post
reports, with some sniffiness, that  &UR; Phil Bronstein  &LR; was seen
necking with  &UR; Sharon Stone  &LR; in a New York restaurant on the first
night of Passover.
</P>
<P>
   _ April 6 is the 61st anniversary of the discovery of Teflon,
which according to Saveur magazine has ``a thousand uses, from pump
coating to protecting the Statue of Liberty from wear and tear to
making pancake-flipping a one-handed task.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In a report in the Sunday Times of London about spending a
weekend chez, the  &UR; Prince of Wales  &LR; notes that ``the Royal Family
prefers not to eat cheese in the evening; they find it gives them
unpredictable dreams.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Growing selectivity has UGA sending more rejection letters
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Statistically, the profile of those accepted for
the incoming freshmen class at the University of Georgia has
changed very little _ the SAT scores and grade point averages are
both high _ but the number of those applying for admission just
keeps growing and growing, topping out this year at 13,500.
</P>
<P>
   Also growing is the number of high school seniors receiving a
letter from the admissions department informing them that they've
been rejected. Last week, almost 5,000 of those ``no'' letters went
out, compared to 3,500 in 1998 and 2,500 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people we don't admit have good academic
records,'' said John Albright, associate director of undergraduate
admissions. ``We hold on to their folders for two years. A lot of
them come to us as transfers as juniors or seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, UGA has room for a fall freshman class of about 4,200
and for about 2,000 transfer students. More high school seniors are
admitted than there is room for _ about twice as many _ because
many of those admitted don't enroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to come to campus to see if they like
it,'' Albright said. ``It's a lot like buying shoes _ some people
do all right buying them out of a catalog, others have to try them
on. You've got to have the right fit in both cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls from concerned parents to the admissions
officials had tapered off by Monday, but Albright and his
colleagues were fielding 200 or more calls a day last week. The
admissions department sends out advance information detailing UGA's
growing selectivity in the face of its increased popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're known by the company you don't keep,'' Albright said.
``The more people we turn down, the better the school we're
perceived to be. We're a real solid school, but a lot of the
increase in people trying to get in is the momentum in the growth
of our reputation. And a lot of it is word-of-mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13,500 applications UGA received for fall admission
represents a 6 percent increase over the 12,700 applications turned
in last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the final numbers aren't in, I'm sure this class will
be more academically accomplished than earlier classes,'' Albright
said, adding that the average SAT score for those accepted was
1220, while the GPA was 3.7.
</P>
<P>
   Albright noted that this year's applicant pool showed an
increase in the number of minorities. He said he isn't sure why
that number increased, but said that his office is working ``real
hard on recruiting minorities'' with top-flight credentials and in
convincing those accepted to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is to create a climate of acceptance
and openness to diversity,'' he said. ``We're trying to be good
stewards of the state of Georgia. We'd like to be open to a good
mix of students on our campus who are all able academically.''

HOW TO SELL THE TABLOIDS

   &UR; David Pecker &LR; , who is about to become chairman of the board of
the company that owns both the National Enquirer and the Star, says
he'd be willing to spend $50 million  &LR; on  &LR; ``repositioning'' those
tabloids.

<P>
   _ ``There's always room for trash, and that's their legacy,''
said New York's  &UR; Jerry Della Femina &LR; . ``They can't get away from
that. But they can position it as a better grade of trash, a more
exclusive brand of trash.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The first thing to do is consider semantics, said  &UR; Al Ries &LR; .
Get rid of the word ``tabloids,'' he said, and find a new label.
``You need to upgrade along the same lines as, `I don't make
movies, I make films.' `I'm not a garbageman, I'm a sanitation
engineer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ted Leonhardt &LR;  said the papers should position themselves as
``a vanguard of social change, and they are recording that in a
populist sense. It's all about getting in touch with what's real
now. ... Maybe in the end that's very healthy for all of us. All my
Episcopal roots are screaming as a result of that sort of thing,
but that's what they've got working for them.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Max Carey  &LR; of Atlanta suggested that the Enquirer come up
``with a credible spokesperson who would say the new owners are
taking it back to its core and making it a better product. ... The
mea culpa approach. ... It may be a complete lie. But it buys you
credibility.''

DESPITE A GUILTY PLEA, A DEFENDANT CAN ASSERT FIFTH-AMENDMENT
RIGHTS DURING SENTENCING &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled on Monday
that defendants who plead guilty cannot be penalized during
sentencing for refusing to detail their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision, the justices unanimously held that
defendants' guilty pleas do not prevent them from later asserting
their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during
the sentencing phase. The high court split 5-4, along ideological
lines, in ruling that a judge cannot hold the defendants' silence
against them when handing down a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision will require a federal judge in
Pennsylvania to reconsider his decision to sentence Amanda Mitchell
to 10 years in prison followed by six years of probation and a $200
fine for conspiring to distribute at least 5 kilograms of cocaine.
Mitchell had pleaded guilty to conspiracy but never testified
regarding the amount of cocaine involved.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Edward Cahn of Eastern Pennsylvania
interpreted her silence as an admission that at least 5 kilograms
were involved, elevating the mandatory minimum sentence from one
year to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the sentence,
ruling that Mitchell already had incriminated herself when she
pleaded guilty. Cahn was then free to interpret Mitchell's
subsequent refusal to testify as an admission that more than 5
kilograms were involved, the 3rd Circuit said.
</P>
<P>
   But the divided Supreme Court reversed, holding that Mitchell
retained her constitutional right even after her guilty plea.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said the
government could turn guilty pleas into ``a prosecutorial sword''
if defendants forfeited their right not to incriminate themselves
simply by admitting to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by three colleagues,
only grudgingly accepted the Supreme Court's line of decisions that
prohibit courts from interpreting as evidence of guilt a
defendant's refusal to testify at trial. The dissenters then
assailed the court for extending this prohibition to the sentencing
phase.
</P>
<P>
   While Mitchell had the constitutional right not to testify
before Cahn handed down his sentence, the judge was well within his
authority to make the ``common-sensical inference`` from Mitchell's
silence that at least 5 kilograms of cocaine were involved, Scalia
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the Fifth Amendment protects Mitchell from being
compelled to take the stand, and also protects her, as we have
held, from adverse inferences drawn from her silence at trial,
there is no reason why it must also shield her from the natural and
appropriate consequences of her uncooperativeness at the sentencing
stage,'' Scalia said. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas joined Scalia's
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, in a separate dissent, said he would be ``willing to
reconsider'' the court's holdings and allow courts to interpret a
defendant's refusal to testify at trial as an indication of guilt.
But Thomas noted that the case before the justices concerned only a
defendant's privilege against self-incrimination at sentencing.

POLICE SEARCHING CAR MAY INCLUDE PASSENGER'S THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., Pa., Va.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police officers who have probable cause to search a
car for illegal drugs can search the personal belongings of
passengers who are themselves under no suspicion of illegal
activity, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in its latest decision
expanding police authority over motorists and their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision overturned a ruling by the Supreme Court of
Wyoming, which held last year that a closed package belonging to a
passenger could not be included in a general search of a car and
its contents unless there was reason to suspect the passenger of a
crime or the driver of concealing evidence in the passenger's
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   The closed container in this case was a purse belonging to a
passenger in a car that police in Wyoming had stopped for speeding.
When the driver said that he used a hypodermic syringe, visible in
his shirt pocket, to administer drugs, police clearly had probable
cause to search the car.
</P>
<P>
   Despite knowing that the purse belonged to the passenger, Sandra
Houghton, and not to the driver, police searched it as well,
finding methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia. The Wyoming Supreme
Court found the search unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,
overturning Ms. Houghton's conviction for drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion Monday, Justice Antonin Scalia said the
Wyoming court had incorrectly drawn a distinction, on the basis of
ownership, between containers that could be the subject of a
warrantless automobile search and those that could not.
``Passengers, no less than drivers, possess a reduced expectation
of privacy with regard to the property that they transport in
cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said that in balancing the ``substantial'' law
enforcement interests in a complete search against a passenger's
reduced expectation of privacy, the law enforcement side was
clearly the weightier. ``A `passenger's property' rule would
dramatically reduce the ability to find and seize contraband and
evidence of crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer, who wrote a concurring opinion.
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion that Justices
David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg also signed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Wyoming vs. Houghton, No. 98-184, addressed an
issue that had remained in doubt since the court ruled in 1982 that
a search of a lawfully stopped vehicle could include ``every part
of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the
search.'' That case, United States vs. Ross, did not involve a
passenger, and courts have disagreed since then on the ruling's
implications for closed containers that police actually knew or
should have known did not belong to the driver.
</P>
<P>
   In barring the search of the passenger's property, the Wyoming
Supreme Court relied on a different Supreme Court precedent, a 1979
decision that police could not search patrons in a bar simply on
the basis of a warrant to search the premises and the bartender.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected
of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable
cause to search that person,'' the court said then in Ybarra vs.
Illinois, a decision from which then-Associate Justice Rehnquist
had dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Monday, Scalia said the barroom precedent was
inapplicable because it involved ``the unique, significantly
heightened protection afforded against searches of one's person.''
It remains the case, after Monday's ruling, that police do not have
the right to search a passenger whom they do not suspect of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Stevens said the majority had
overstated the law enforcement interests involved in the case.
``Certainly the ostensible clarity of the court's rule is
attractive,'' Stevens said. But he added, ``A rule requiring a
warrant or individualized probable cause to search passenger
belongings is every bit as simple as the court's rule; it simply
protects more privacy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The following were among the other developments at the court
Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that a person who pleaded guilty to a criminal
charge did not give up the right to remain silent at the sentencing
hearing, and further, that in imposing sentence, the judge could
not penalize a defendant for remaining silent.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in Philadelphia, which held that by pleading guilty to
participating in a narcotics ring, a woman had waived her Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination at the sentencing
hearing that determined the amount of drugs involved, on which the
sentence was based.
</P>
<P>
   All nine justices agreed that the woman, Amanda Mitchell,
retained the right to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege. But the
court split 5-4 on whether the judge was justified in drawing
adverse inferences from her refusal to testify. Ms. Mitchell did
not testify at her hearing, and the judge sentenced her to 10 years
after telling her, ``I held it against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Kennedy said that the judge's behavior
``imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of the
constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination.'' In a
dissenting opinion, Scalia said the Fifth Amendment did not shield
the defendant ``from the natural and appropriate consequences of
her uncooperativeness at the sentencing stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer joined the majority
opinion, Mitchell vs. U.S., No. 97-7541. Rehnquist, along with
O'Connor and Thomas, joined the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Habeas Corpus
</P>
<P>
   Accepting a death-penalty appeal from Virginia, the court agreed
to resolve several important questions under the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a law that limited the
jurisdiction of the federal courts to review state-court
convictions and sentences by means of petitions for a writ of
habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Williams vs. Taylor, No. 98-8384, raises the question
of how much discretion Congress left to the federal courts to
reconsider state court findings, particularly in the context of
whether the defendant received constitutionally adequate legal
representation. The case is an appeal from the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., whose unusually strict
interpretation of the 1996 law has led it to approve death
sentences rapidly and in growing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant in this case, Terry Williams, convicted of a 1985
murder, was scheduled to die on Tuesday before the Supreme Court
issued a stay of execution last Friday.

 &HT;    Barnes names new budget officer
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes continued to shape his administration
Monday, tapping Bill Tomlinson as the state's new chief budget
officer in charge of Georgia's annual budget of more than $13
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, now deputy director of the Legislative Budget Office,
will succeed Tim Burgess, the current director of the Governor's
Office of Planning and Budget. Burgess is leaving in mid-April to
join the administration at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year budget office veteran, Burgess, 43, had served as
director for the past four years under the administration of former
Gov. Zell Miller. He now will become associate vice president for
finance and administration at UGA.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement also is a veteran of state government.
Tomlinson, 57, spent 13 years in the governor's budget office
interrupted by time heading the Education Review commission for
former Gov. Joe Frank Harris. That commission produced the plan
that led to the Quality Basic Education Act, which determines the
funding allocation for Georgia's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The quick appointment Monday _ the same day as Burgess'
departure was announced _ is but one that Barnes must make. Also on
Monday, Barnes appointed R.K. Sehgal, the founder and president of
Law International, as the chairman of the Georgia Board of
Industry, Trade and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Another 43 appointments for vacancies on 11 state boards and
agencies _ from education to natural resources and the prestigious
Board of Regents _ still await decisions from Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also has to name his 15-member Georgia Regional
Transportation Authority and the nine-member board of his new
Georgia Department of Community Health, a superagency that pulls
all state insurance-buying functions into a single division. Those
appointments, and the naming of department heads to oversee state
agencies, are expected within the next 45 days, governor's
spokesmen have indicated.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jill E. Barad built a career as Barbie's surrogate mother,
giving her makeovers, expanding her wardrobe and lavishing her with
creature comforts to enhance her enchanted imaginary world.
</P>
<P>
   All that attention paid off: under her direction, the Barbie
line grew to an estimated $1.7 billion in sales in 1997 from $200
million in 1982, vaulting Ms. Barad into the chief executive's
office in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbie is 40 years old, and, like other Mattel Inc.
products, is showing signs of aging. Children are abandoning
traditional toys like Barbie sooner in favor of computers. Toys
that have been hot, like the Beanie Babies, are increasingly coming
from smaller, more nimble competitors. Toys ``R'' Us and other
large retailers have been ordering fewer stuffed animals and board
games to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Mattel's earnings have slumped, and its stock price
has tumbled. For Mattel, the question is whether Ms. Barad, who is
so identified with Barbie, the company's flagship toy, and who is
known mostly for her strengths in marketing, can turn the company
around at a time when the toy industry is undergoing such rapid
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the real challenges Mattel has is to educate Wall
Street that they are not just the Barbie company anymore,'' said
Chris Byrne, an industry consultant and editor of the Toy Report, a
weekly newsletter. ``Their stock goes up and down on Barbie's fate,
and that's a lot for those little plastic shoulders to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, her efforts to stem the decline are drawing mixed
reviews. She shook up management last month by announcing that two
senior executives were leaving and that five new department heads
would be directly accountable to her. And she has developed a plan
to sell more toys directly to consumers through catalogs and the
Internet. The strategy, however, has angered some retailers who
accuse her of trying to compete directly with them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, investors who were once enamored of Ms. Barad appear
to have grown impatient waiting for her to deliver results. Since
she took over, the stock has fallen 10 percent, while the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained nearly 74 percent. Monday, the
stock rose 31.25 cents, to $24.625. Many big investors say that
Mattel needs to generate hefty returns from recently acquired
companies, reduce its reliance on Barbie and respond more quickly
to changes in the way children play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of Jill is that she is very good and capable, but
that her relationship with Wall Street has been a little bit
strained because she is so positive and marketing-oriented that I
think people feel a little bit oversold,'' said Joe Kennison, a
money manager with American Express Financial Advisers, which sold
nearly half of its 8.3 million Mattel shares in December.
</P>
<P>
   Through a company spokesman, Ms. Barad declined to be
interviewed. But interviews with more than a dozen money managers,
analysts and retailers, as well as people who have worked with her,
paint a portrait of a charismatic and driven executive who is a
marketing whiz but who has not fully demonstrated that she has the
financial skills and leadership ability to turn around the $4.8
billion company.
</P>
<P>
   Her harshest critics contend that Ms. Barad, 47, spends too much
energy on charming Wall Street analysts and bankers to keep them
bullish on Mattel instead of on coming up with ways to grow
profits.
</P>
<P>
   A Mattel spokesman, Glenn Bozarth said that 1998 results ``were
affected by unexpected events and issues'' and that this year
Mattel's goal was to ``underpromise and overdeliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that the issue may be more one of style
than of substance. ``Most of the people who deal with her are
professional men, and their ability to critique her can't be taken
out of the context of them being men,'' said Sean McGowan, an
analyst who follows Mattel for Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``Jill
brings a level of animation and feminization to the role that
people find off-putting at times because they are not used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In company presentations that he has attended, for instance, Ms.
Barad has been known to dance to music used in product promotions,
apparently to drum up enthusiasm. ``This must be very infectious in
a sales presentation at a toy company but you are not accustomed to
seeing it at banker presentations,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and former company executives also say that instead of
keeping watch of the entire company, Ms. Barad manages the Barbie
brand so obsessively that she often devotes too little time to
other areas of the business. ``I think she has passion for part of
the product but not the whole,'' said one of the former executives,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Should she really be
critiquing the color of eye shadow for a doll?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are other areas of Mattel that could use more
attention. The company's boy's toys unit, for instance, will soon
face tougher competition because Mattel failed to win the ``Star
Wars'' license. Its chief rival, Hasbro, will roll out products
based on the much anticipated new film, which is due out next
month. And revenue in Mattel's infant and pre-school business fell
3 percent last year, hurt in part by a $27 million charge related
to a recall. The Fisher-Price Powerwheels cars, which children
ride, were recalled because its electrical components could
overheat and catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all of the attention she devotes to Barbie, however,
shipments of the brand _ which represents an estimated 40 to 50
percent of the company's profits _ fell 14 percent last year,
contributing to a 67 percent earnings drop in the fourth quarter.
Mattel, analysts say, flooded the market with too many
holiday-season versions, which forced retailers to cut prices
sharply to unload aisles of unsold dolls. The glut of Holiday
Barbies, the analysts added, diluted the cachet of the doll for
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Mattel remains the world's leading toy maker and has
had some successes on Ms. Barad's watch. Just a year ago, parents
were lining up for blocks to get their hands on a Tickle Me Elmo
doll, and last year the new Blue's Clues product line generated $40
million in revenue in four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impressive to me that they've got so many of these
characters that kids absolutely love,'' said Mark Greenberg, a
portfolio manager at Investco Funds Group's leisure fund who
recently bought 100,000 shares of Mattel and is bullish on Ms.
Barad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is substance there,'' he said. ``What I like
about Jill is I think she really understands the product and she
understands the business.''
</P>
<P>
   While few doubt her command of the business, others question her
ability to attract and hold on to talented managers. The job of
president of the Barbie unit _ the company's most important brand _
went unfilled for a year until last month, when Adrienne
Fontanella, who had been in charge of Barbie licensing and
collectibles, was named to the post.
</P>
<P>
   Also last month, Bruce Stein, whom Ms. Barad recruited in 1996
to help bolster the boys business, resigned as chief operating
officer and president of the worldwide business. Another division
head, Gary Baughman, president of the company's Fisher-Price
subsidiary, also stepped down. Mattel swiftly named a new head of
the boys division, but has not named a new chief operating officer,
effectively handing those responsibilities to Ms. Barad.
</P>
<P>
   Former company executives and some analysts contend that Ms.
Barad is concentrating her power, staking her reputation more
securely on a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if they are in the same position at the end of the
year, there will be a big outcry for a huge management change,''
said Byrne, the industry consultant, who still counts himself as
one of Ms. Barad's supporters. He says he expects the company to
begin to show improvement this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad, Greenberg of Investco said, is managing in a
difficult environment because in some ways Mattel is a victim of
its position in the marketplace. ``They are the largest company in
the industry,'' he said, ``so nothing they can do can have that big
an impact on the company outside of an acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is counting on two recent acquisitions to improve
its competitiveness. Mattel is expected to close soon on its
purchase of Learning Co., the leading maker of educational
programming. The deal will significantly increase Mattel's
competitiveness in a fast-growing market by combining its strength
in research and development, distribution and purchasing with
Learning Co.'s software expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, Mattel bought Pleasant Co., giving it a second
brand of best-selling dolls, American Girl. Mattel also gained a
company with expertise in direct selling, since the dolls are sold
exclusively through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad has said that Mattel, which generates about 10 percent
of its revenue from goods sold directly to consumers, ``will
aggressively build this segment'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy comes with some risk. While it would smartly reduce
Mattel's reliance on a few large customers, the push to diversify
Mattel's distribution further threatens to strain relationships
with some of its most important customers, according to two
executives at competing retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, we're not happy about it,'' said one of the
executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're watching,
and we're concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bozarth, the Mattel spokesman, said the company's
consumer-direct selling strategy would enable it to sell more
specialty items such as collectibles, and was not meant to compete
with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   And in making acquisitions to increase its direct-selling
capabilities, as well as to expand in interactive toys, Mattel may
have paid too much, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, I wish the price was less,'' McGowan of Gerard
Klauer Mattison said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, toy companies command one and a half to two times
sales, though it is not unusual to pay a premium for top brands or
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, however, paid $700 million for Pleasant Co., a business
that has $300 million in annual revenue. And it is paying $3.8
billion for Learning Co., which had $850 million in revenue in
1998. Bozarth said the price Mattel paid for each company was
appropriate and that ``both were structured in such a way as to be
accretive to earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McGowan said, ``toy companies just don't get that kind of
multiple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take on faith that the numbers will be there,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Faith may be in short supply among Mattel investors, who have
been caught off guard in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while analysts were saying that they were concerned
about possible weakness in the Barbie division, Ms. Barad
maintained that the product line was on track, leaving many
dumbfounded when the company then reported a 14 percent drop in
Barbie orders for the year. Last fall, Ms. Barad told analysts that
the fourth-quarter results would be in line with expectations, only
to report weeks later that Toys ``R'' Us had unexpectedly cut its
reorders of products after Thanksgiving and, as a result, profits
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike the 9-year-olds who are Mattel's ultimate customers,
investors do not like to find surprises wrapped in pretty packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she understands,'' McGowan said, ``that is not
something that goes over very well with investors.''

PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGIST SIGNS ON WITH BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick W. Griffin, one of New Hampshire's top Republican
strategists, had dumped his longtime client, Lamar Alexander, and
is expected to sign on with Texas Governor George W. Bush, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said Monday that he decided against renewing his
contract with Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, because
of heavy corporate client demands. In addition, he said, WMUR-TV in
Manchester, N.H., another client, has asked him to provide on-air
analysis for the 2000 New Hampshire presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said he has not had discussions with any other
campaigns, though he described himself as a free agent who loves
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not rule out down the road that I might be involved
again,'' said Griffin, who said goodbye to Alexander in Nashville
last week. ``Never is a very difficult word to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Griffin's official explanation is merely a cover
for the real reason he is leaving Alexander. At the end of May,
sources said, Bush will announce that he has hired Griffin to run
his campaign in New Hampshire. Griffin worked for Bush's father,
the former president, in 1992 and was a supporter in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander still retains the support and guidance of Thomas D.
Rath, a prominent lawyer and political activist in Concord, N.H.
But despite nearly 100 percent name recognition in the state,
Alexander has been languishing in the polls among the 10 other
Republican candidates for president.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Rath said he is ``heartbroken'' over Griffin's departure
and hopes he will come back to the Alexander campaign at some
point. Rath also said Griffin had agonized over his decision, but
that he has young children and did not want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's a very significant part of the things we've done from
the advertising to the lobster bake,'' said Rath. ``Of course it
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rath also said that Griffin has been ``extraordinarily
honorable'' in the way he has handled his departure from the
Alexander team. He said he does not believe Griffin will join
another campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculation is inevitable, but that is not what he has
told me and I would be surprised if he has entertained any other
offers,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin had worked for Alexander since 1993, helping him achieve
a third-place finish in the 1996 New Hampshire primary behind
Patrick J. Buchanan, the winner, and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Alexander, Griffin ran congressional races for
Representative Charles Bass and for former Representative Bill
Zeliff. He also handled Senator Judd Gregg's 1998 reelection and
Senator Bob Smith's difficult campaign in 1996 against Dick Swett,
the former Democratic congressman.

PASSENGER'S POSSESSIONS CAN BE SEARCHED IF DRIVER SUSPECTED OF
CRIME &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the
Constitution does not protect automobile passengers from having
their belongings searched by police who suspect the driver has
committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-3 decision, the justices extended to passengers its
long-held view that police officers, without a warrant but with
probable cause, can search all containers in a car that belong to
the driver suspected of criminality. The justices, however, said
their decision does not allow police to frisk passengers, unless
the officers have probable cause to suspect the passengers of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Police groups hailed the court's decision as a victory in the
fight against crime. But criminal defense lawyers assailed the
ruling as a defeat for the civil rights of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   With its decision, the high court reinstated the drug-possession
conviction of Sandra Houghton, a passenger in a car David Young was
driving July 23, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling Young over for speeding and driving with a faulty
brake light, a Wyoming Highway Patrol officer saw a hypodermic
syringe in the driver's shirt pocket and ordered him out of the
car. Asked why he had the syringe, Young told the officer that he
used it to take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Backup officers then told Houghton and another passenger to get
out of the car. A search of Houghton's purse, left on the seat,
uncovered two hypodermic syringes containing methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   She was convicted of felony possession of the drug. But the
Wyoming Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that the
officer's probable cause to suspect the driver of criminality did
not give him constitutional permission to search the personal
belongings of a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that ruling, saying the police
have broad authority to search automobiles once they have probable
cause to suspect the driver is committing a crime. In such cases,
passengers, like Houghton, lack the Fourth Amendment's protection
against unreasonable searches, the court held.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is probable cause to search for contraband in a
car, it is reasonable for police officers to examine packages and
containers without a showing of individualized probable cause for
each one,'' Justice Scalia wrote in the court's majority opinion.
``A passenger's personal belongings, just like the driver's
belongings or containers attached to the car like a glove
compartment, are `in' the car, and the officer has probable cause
to search for contraband in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the court said drivers and passengers have ``a
reduced expectation of privacy'' when in cars, traveling on public
streets and subject to police stops. As a result, drivers and
passengers have less Fourth Amendment protection from the prying
eyes and hands of police officers conducting a search.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer agreed with the majority but wrote
separately in an effort to make clear that the court's decision
applies only to searches of automobiles and of containers belonging
to passengers. Police are prohibited from searching the passengers
themselves, unless the officers have probable cause, Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by
Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the
Constitution bars police from conducting warrantless searches of
car passengers when the officers only have probable cause to
suspect the driver.

`DUMBFELLA' GOES ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not ``The Godfather.'' It's not even ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gotti Jr., the alleged boss of the Gambino crime syndicate,
goes on trial in Long Island Tuesday. Once, such an event would
have caused a sensation. Now, it will supply just another dribble
of proof that the Mafia has seen grander days.
</P>
<P>
   The charges tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   When Gotti's father, John Gotti Sr. _ the fierce, elusive, and
elegant boss, known as ``Dapper Don'' and ``Teflon Don'' _ was sent
up the river in 1992, it was for a whole raft of high crimes,
including the murder of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's son _ known to law-enforcement agents as ``Junior'' and
in the New York tabloids as ``Dumbfella'' _ faces up to 18 years in
jail for shaking down an upscale strip joint, running a gambling
ring, robbing a drug dealer, and fibbing on a home-mortgage
refinancing application.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Mob does today is kids' stuff, it's like a street
gang,'' James Kallstrom, former director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's New York office, said in a phone interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still has a lot of bad characters,'' Kallstrom added, ``but
these are different people, different times.''
</P>
<P>
   The infamous ``five families'' that ran organized crime in New
York once truly had enormous power. They controlled a handful of
major unions, were major players in the concrete and construction
industries, in commercial-garbage pick-up service, and in the fish
and produce markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You paid a certain percentage of your money to the Mob, no
matter who you were,'' Kallstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, the FBI's current New York director, said Monday
that, as recently as 1988, John Gotti, Sr., was raking in $100,000
a month from construction-industry shakedowns _ personally.
</P>
<P>
   Then the FBI became adept at using the anti-racketeering RICO
statutes, passed by Congress a decade earlier _ which allowed
agents not only to arrest individuals but to confiscate their
assets and bust up the whole hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the heads of all the organized-crime
families in New York were indicted, convicted, and locked up.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the Giuliani administration stepped in and
imposed licensing requirements on certain industries _ especially
the Fulton Fish Market and the garbage pick-up business _ that the
Mafia once monopolized.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gotti allegedly passed the titular leadership of the
Gambino family on to his son, there wasn't much left to control.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Mafia's activities today, Kallstrom said, involve
bits and pieces of the economy's dark underside: gambling,
prostitution, and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro noted that the syndicates still have a hand in
construction, cement, and the garment trade, though much less than
in the past. Some crime families, he said, are expanding into
``non-traditional activities,'' such as penny-stock fraud,
health-care fraud, and telephone-card scams.
</P>
<P>
   While none of this is trivial, it in no way remotely resembles
the vast, pervasive empire that the Mob bosses once oversaw.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the crime families has shrunk as well, to ``maybe
one-fifth'' their size a quarter-century ago, Kallstrom estimated.
``Even in the '80s,'' the former agent said, ``some families had
300 to 400 members and another 1,000 or so associates that did
their bidding. You just don't find anything like that today.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, it is only natural that, at the end of the century, one
of the top Mafia gangs is run _ allegedly _ by the likes of John
Gotti, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents, the past several months, have painted a pathetic
picture of the 34-year-old ``Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   When he visits his father at the maximum-security prison in
Marion, Ill. _ or so the videotapes reportedly show _ he spends
practically the whole time sulking in his chair while John Sr.
yells at him.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate business ventures he has started have all
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The other crime-family bosses are said to dislike him.
</P>
<P>
   He had to call on his sister, Victoria, the author of
best-selling romance novels, to bail him out of jail last
September.
</P>
<P>
   The bail terms were so stiff _ including house arrest and
$24,000 a month to pay for private security guards to watch over
him _ that, last week, he asked the judge to put him back in
prison, on the grounds that he couldn't make the payments. (Monday,
he changed his mind, telling the judge he would somehow manage,
after all.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in stylistic terms, he appears the polar opposite of
his father _ overweight, poorly dressed, and driving a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the mobsters today,'' Kallstrom sneered. ``They're not
Carlo Gambino. They don't have the discipline, the organization,
the code of silence. I'm not saying we respected the old dons _ we
despised them. But they were different from these young guys
today.''
</P>
<P>
   When his case first came up, Gotti Jr. was going to be one of 22
defendants _ but, in the months since, the number has dwindled to
two. The others have pled guilty, chosen to cooperate with the
prosecutors, or had charges dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Gotti was about to cop a plea, in exchange for a
reduced sentence, as well _ until his sister, mother, and father
all talked him out of it, telling him the federal prosecutors had a
weak case against him.
</P>
<P>
   He is pleading innocent to all charges and denies accusations
that he has any involvement with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will feature at least one vestige of the old-style
Mafia _ a cast of ex-Mobsters with colorful names, testifying
against the defendant, among them, John ``Jackie Nose'' D'Amico,
Dominic ``Fat Dom'' Borghese, and Willie Marshall, who once
referred to himself as a ``two-bit leg-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to appear is Frank Gioia Jr., a 250-pound star
witness who, in recent years, has helped the feds convict more than
60 mobsters, including Anthony ``Bowat'' Baretta, George ``Georgie
Neck'' Zappola, and Frank ``Frankie Bones'' Papagni.

 &HT;    Parking lot owners the big winners in Cincinnati as spaces at
premium
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar and Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ Between mouthfuls of a bratwurst smothered in
ketchup, Chris Ciganik of Mason shared his Opening Day parking
strategy: leave early and be ready to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were leaving a half hour before the game you might want
to leave some time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ciganik, 28, was one of 54,000-plus fans who turned out Monday
for the sold-out Cincinnati Reds' 1999 season opener against the
San Francisco Giants. Like thousands attending Opening Day, Ciganik
spent more time than usual finding a parking before he could join
an annual tailgate party held by his former University of Dayton
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati officials say the Paul Brown Stadium and the Fort
Washington Way construction projects eliminated 1,200 parking
spaces from the area around Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   For Ciganik, this meant parking in Newport, Ky., and walking 10
minutes across the Ohio River to the Third Street parking lot where
his friend and fellow UD alum Tom Thiel held a tailgate party for
60 people. Ciganik, who traveled easily from Warren County to
Cincinnati on Interstate 71, said he spent half an hour looking for
a spot before he opted to park across the river.
</P>
<P>
   Thiel, who parked his van at the Third Street lot near the
stadium at 6 a.m., said friends from both Dayton and Cincinnati
called him from their cars with cellular phones to complain they
couldn't parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Where do we park?' That's what everyone's saying,'' Thiel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati parking Supt. Chuck Cullen said parking problems
around Cinergy Field should be short lived. During most weekend and
night games, fans will find plenty of spots; spaces may be more
scarce during weekday afternoon games because fans will compete
with shoppers and other daytime downtown visitors, he said. But no
weekday game brings more fans downtown than the season opener, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening Day is always difficult,'' he said. ``As you get to
the playoffs and the World Series, you might have a problem. We'll
worry about those when we get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Completion of Paul Brown Stadium will mean up to an additional
7,000 parking spaces for the downtown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, parking lot owners cashed in.
</P>
<P>
   At the CitiCentre parking lot on Third Street, for example, the
owners raised the baseball game rate to $15 from $10 in 1998.
CitiCentre typically charges customers $40 per month to park at the
lot, which sits nearly one mile from Cinergy Field. Mary Knock, who
works for the parking lot, said she doesn't look for the price to
fall again.
</P>
<P>
   Parking shortages slowed the fans down but didn't keep them from
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in team shirts, jackets and ball caps, fans filed past
peanut vendors and ticket scalpers as they crossed walkways from
Third Street to the stadium. On the walkway, a saxophonist belted
out The Addam's Family theme, while outside the stadium a rock
group ground its way through grunge rock hits. Stragglers clutching
tickets wound their way through orange barrels along the Fort
Washington Way construction zone as Reds officials released a
barrage of red balloons in the stadium signaling the start of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said morning traffic into downtown Cincinnati remained
light because baseball fans filtered in at different times. In the
afternoon, however, motorists experienced 25-minute delays on the
10-mile stretch of Interstate 75 north between the downtown and
Paddock Road, said Linda Roll of Advanced Regional Traffic
Interactive Management and Information Systems, an independent
agency that which monitors Cincinnati-area traffic.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the I-75 slowdowns to fan traffic mixing with
daily commuter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really crawling,'' she said.

 &HT;    Miami Valley schools need improvement, report says
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ More than two-thirds of the Miami Valley's school
districts met or exceeded most of the standards set by state
officials to assess districts' performance.
</P>
<P>
   That simply means the schools have room to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Education released the state report cards
Monday, ranking 18 categories and placing heavy emphasis on
proficiency scores. The report cards were the last ``trial run''
before the standards take effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Of 60 school districts across the Miami Valley:
</P>
<P>
   _ 42 would need ``continuous improvement'' because they met
between 10 and 16 of the performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ 15 districts would have met six to nine standards and would be
on ``academic watch.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Three area districts _ Dayton, West Carrollton and
Trotwood-Madison _ met five or fewer standards and would be
designated ``academic emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   When the standards take effect, any school under academic
emergency must develop a three-year ``continuous improvement plan''
and could ultimately face the possibility of state intervention.
</P>
<P>
   No Miami Valley school district would have been designated
``effective,'' though four districts _ Centerville, Oakwood,
Franklin-Monroe and Fort Loramie _ came close, meeting 16 of 18
performance standards. Springboro and Tipp City followed that group
meeting 15 performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   The ``effective'' or best designation applies to schools that
meet 17 or 18 of the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The education department included in each district's report
cards comparisons to other districts in Ohio with similar
demographic characteristics, such as family income and racial
makeup The report cards also include data for individual school
buildings. That data allows parents to compare test scores and
attendance rates at their children's schools with other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Most local school districts mailed out their report cards to
parents Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reading and math portions of the Fourth Grade Proficiency
Test proved the biggest stmubling block for school districts in the
Miami Valley and across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The report cards rate area districts using standards that take
effect in 2000 and adjust actual proficiency test scores to reflect
how students would have done under more stringent testing criteria
slated for the same year. Many educators complained this would
lower their fourth-grade results and hurt their ratings overall.
</P>
<P>
   They were right. Not a single school district in the Miami
Valley met the state standard of having at least 75 percent of
their 4th graders pass the reading test. Statewide, only 19 school
districts _ about 3 percent _ met the fourth-grade reading test
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 60 area districts _ Fort Loramie and
Hardin-Houston, both in Shelby County _ met the state standard set
for the fourth-grade math test. Statewide, only 14 of 606 districts
had at least three out of four fourth-graders pass the math test.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-grade reading test will loom larger beginning July 1,
2001, when the ``Fourth-Grade Guarantee'' begins. The guarantee
prohibits school districts from promoting to the fifth grade
students who have not passed the reading portion of the proficiency
test, unless the students' principal and reading teacher agree the
student is academically prepared for fifth grade. Students who have
a disability that excuses them from taking the proficiency test
also would be allowed to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Durfee-Hidalgo, who oversees the report-card program for
the state, said the low fourth-grade scores will likely galvanize
parents, teachers and school officials to focus attention and
resources on reading in the early grade levels. Low scores on the
math portion of the ninth-grade proficiency test had a similar
effect a few years ago, and student performance on the test has
improved, Durfee-Hidalgo said.
</P>
<P>
   A school district's performance rating on the state report cards
will depend heavily on its students' proficiency test scores.
Sixteen of the 18 performance standards consist of proficiency test
scores in various subject areas in grades 4, 9, 10 and 12. Student
attendance rates and graduation rates make up the remaining two
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators argue that relying almost solely upon test scores
to determine a school district's effectiveness can be misleading,
because the scores may not accurately reflect the quality of
teachers and instruction occurring in a school district. But it's
the law: Ohio legislators passed the report-card proposal to ensure
greater accountability among school districts and to force schools
with low-scoring students to improve. Local superintendents say
they are searching for ways to do just that, but some aren't happy
with the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state wanted to design a report card to make school
districts look bad, it couldn't have done a better job,'' said
Charles Williams, superintendent of Wayne Local Schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were discouraged and disappointed last year when the report
cards were issued. We've been working all year to improve our test
scores, but won't see results until this year's test scores are
released,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   West Carrollton Superintendent Douglas Roby, whose district met
three of the 18 state standards, said he was surprised and
disappointed at the results, though district officials are
challenging the accuracy of some of the data on which its rating
was based.
</P>
<P>
   Roby said he and other school officials will work closely with
staff and teachers to place even greater emphasis on the importance
of the proficiency tests. School officials plan to produce a video
for the families of fourth-grade students that will include sample
test questions and suggestions on how parents can help.
Staff-development initiatives that will give teachers the
opportunity to learn new instructional skills are also planned, the
superintendent said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton City Schools passed one of the 18 performance
standards: the writing portion of the 12th grade proficiency test.
Only five other school districts in the state met just one
standard: Springfield, Youngstown, Warren, Dayton and Akron. Only
one district ranked lower: Cleveland, which failed to meet any of
the 18 criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Superintendent James Williams said the state's actions of
raising the score needed to pass some proficiency tests and
counting as failures those students who did not take the
proficiency test or a retest contributed to the district's low
ranking. But Williams said he will not offer excuses and accepts
the responsibility for the district to show growth and improvement
in proficiency test scores and other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton school district will focus efforts on K-4 reading
instruction and attendance to boost future report-card performance,
Williams said. This year, about 90 percent of the district's
kindergarten students are in all-day kindergarten classes, which
should pay academic dividends as those students move through upper
grade levels, the superintendent said. And he said the district has
put programs into place that will help deal with the social and
emotional needs some Dayton students and other urban school
children bring to school with them _ needs that can have a higher
priority than learning in some students' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In the adjoining Trotwood-Madison school district,
superintendent Samuel Brewer said district officials hoped they'd
climb out of the ``academic emergency'' category, but having met
five of the state's performance standards, fell one short.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said Trotwood-Madison officials are planning a town
meeting to discuss the district report card and discuss strategies
for improvement. The district has changed curriculum and provided
additional training to teachers and has launched a computer-based
instructional program geared toward students who have failed
portions of the proficiency tests.
</P>
<P>
   Oakwood Superintendent Judy Hennessey said Oakwood school
officials will use its district report card as a diagnostic tool to
help improve instruction, but will stop short of tailoring its
curriculum to the proficiency test alone. The district exceeded 16
of the 18 standards, falling short in fourth-grade reading and
math.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakwood's superintendent noted that the school district
sponsors enrichment activities for students in areas such as
literature, art and music that may not show up on state-mandated
exams, Hennessey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals go far beyond the proficiency tests,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: MORE STICKS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question we are wrestling with in Kosovo today is this: How
should America react when bad things happen in unimportant places?
</P>
<P>
   You need only watch the footage of refugees streaming out of
Kosovo, and believe just half of their chilling tales of Serbian
atrocities, to know that something really bad is happening there to
which America should not be turning a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
   But you need only ask your congressman to find Kosovo on a map _
and watch the blank stare that comes back at you _ to appreciate
how unimportant Kosovo is to any vital American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this dilemma, the Clinton strategy has been to use
NATO air power to try to reverse the bad things happening in
Kosovo. But the administration's unwillingness to commit ground
troops to actually expel the Serbs from Kosovo is an admission that
its liberation is not worth the loss of many, if any, U.S. lives.
To put it another way, the cruise missile is the Clinton team's
weapon of choice for combating evil in unimportant places.
</P>
<P>
   For that strategy to have any chance of working will require
much tougher sticks and much fatter carrots. On the sticks side, it
may turn out that the only way for NATO to get an acceptable
outcome in Kosovo is by sending in ground troops, but I believe it
is still too early to make that judgment. Give war a chance.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to change their minds and adjust their goals as they
see the price they are paying mount. We simply do not know how a
real, sustained air campaign will affect the calculations of a
modern European state. Twelve days of surgical bombing was never
going to turn Serbia around. Let's see what 12 weeks of sustained,
less surgical bombing does.
</P>
<P>
   As for the carrots, while NATO steps up the air war, it also
needs to step up its diplomacy. Remember, you can bomb, curse,
condemn and kill the Serbs, but there is just one thing you can't
do, and that's make peace in the Balkans without them. There are
too many of them. Let's dangle two options before the Serbs right
now _ either a modified Rambouillet deal that would give the
Kosovars internationally protected autonomy in a Kosovo still under
Serb sovereignty, or a partition of Kosovo. The Serbs would get the
northwest sliver, which contains their Orthodox monasteries and
holy sites, and the Kosovo Albanians would get the remaining 90
percent, with an international peacekeeping force separating them.
</P>
<P>
   NATO needs to combine unreasonable bombing with a reasonable
peace offer. For now, this strategy is preferable to a ground war,
for two reasons. First, once NATO invades Kosovo, it owns Kosovo.
Anyone who cares about the future of NATO does not want to see the
alliance managing the daily relations between Serbs and Albanians
in Kosovo. It would be an endless, debilitating task.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if we have to fight a ground war, let's at least fight
it in optimal political circumstances. As Michael Mandelbaum, a
foreign policy expert at Johns Hopkins, points out: ``George Bush's
great achievement in the gulf war was the broad backing he earned
from the American public and the allies, and the basic neutrality
he earned from the Russians, by making it clear that he had gone
the extra mile to get an acceptable diplomatic deal before
launching the ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   All the foreign policy experts say that now that the war in
Kosovo has started, ``We have to win.'' OK, but win what? When you
are trying to stop bad things in unimportant places your task is to
minimize the bad without making the unimportant into a sucking
chest wound that weakens NATO and diminishes America's overall
position in the world. I don't want NATO to win Kosovo or the
Kosovars. I want NATO to stop what was bad and get out. I want NATO
to win Serbian agreement either for the Kosovo Albanians to return
to their homes _ with an international observer-peacekeeping force,
including Russians, managing relations between Albanians and Serbs
_ or for a partition of Kosovo, with a peacekeeping force
separating the factions.
</P>
<P>
   We need to see if sustained, unreasonable bombing, combined with
sustained, reasonable diplomacy, can achieve such goals. Sure, it
will take time, but considering the decades NATO will have to spend
in Kosovo if this strategy doesn't work, I suggest we find the
time.

A DANGEROUS SCHEME IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are high costs and nasty risks associated with each of the
possible responses to Slobodan Milosevic's expulsion of a million
Albanian Kosovars from their homes. Nonetheless, one proposal being
bandied about by a cluster of senators, including John Kerry of
Massachusetts, &UR;  &LR; is too foolish to be considered seriously: a scheme
to avoid American casualties by arming the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Senator
Joseph Leiberman, Democrat of Connecticut, have proposed spending
$25 million to arm the guerrilla bands that call themselves the
Kosovo Liberation Army. In a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, McConnell described the KLA as ``a credible, capable, and
willing alternative to the deployment of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fighters are certainly willing to fight and to receive
US weapons. But until now they have been neither credible nor
capable.
</P>
<P>
   Their lack of credibility stems not only from the political
extremism of their Marxist and Islamic fundamentalist factions and
their connection to the heroin and cocaine trafficking centered in
Albania; it also derives from their willingness to sacrifice
Kosovo's civilian population to their delusional belief in the
talisman of armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic bears the guilt for the crimes against humanity being
committed in Kosovo. But if the impulsive young commanders of the
KLA had not brushed aside the realistic leadership of Ibrahim
Rugova, the pacifist who had been elected president of Kosovo's
shadow government, those refugee families sleeping in the rain
might still be in their homes, and their menfolk might still be
alive.
</P>
<P>
   If an American-armed KLA were able to seize power in Kosovo, it
could be counted on to expel Serb civilians and declare
independence, creating conditions for an expanded conflagration in
the Balkan tinderbox.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the KLA lacks the ability to defeat Serb military and
paramilitary forces without the overwhelming intervention of NATO
forces. If Milosevic is to be curbed militarily, NATO must do it,
and without carrying the KLA hotheads to power.

 &HT;    Drink lets Rover Rebound, but not all vets lapping it up
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What we're missing is Air Fidos, expensive sneakers to
allow your dog to reach its full athletic potential. Instead,
there's a new sports beverage _ for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound, developed and marketed by Atlanta-based National Pet
Supply, comes in two flavors _ Original (lemon-lime) and Ice Cool _
and retails for $1.99-$2.50 per 1.5-liter bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers of this Gatorade for dogs promise it will
replenish your canine's fluids lost in the heat of play and
invigorate older dogs _ all without a smidgen of caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like humans, dogs require essential nutrients to stay healthy
and strong,'' says Gene Reilly, CEO of National Pet Supply. ``It
was based on this belief that our team of veterinarians developed
Rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   The name was inspired by basketball players. The company tested
the product on dogs for a year and a half _ discarding a
meat-flavored drink (``Too much like soup,'' says Reilly) _ in
favor of a fat-free, mineral-rich, semisweet drink palatable to
humans and canines alike.
</P>
<P>
   No Rebound for cats, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a guy running with a cat, then somebody else can have
that market,'' says Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rebound was developed with the help of Dr. Scott Brown
of the University of Georgia veterinary school, some fellow vets
say it's a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Terry Terlep, a canine sports-medicine specialist in Fort
Myers, Fla., is skeptical. ``Unless you're taking your dog for a
run alongside a motorcycle for 13 miles, I don't think it's
necessary,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   According to Terlep, dogs get their energy from solid fats _
``not from drinks and carbohydrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Terlep's suggestion for refreshing a pooped pooch? ``Take him
into the shade and give him a bowl of cool water.''
</P>
<P>
   Terlep's advice notwithstanding, if you still want to try
Rebound, check these stores in Atlanta: the Pet Set, Pet Supplies
Plus and Three Dog Bakery.

LIBYA TURNS OVER TWO BOMB SUSPECTS; SANCTIONS QUICKLY EASED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Libya Monday surrendered two suspects to the
United Nations to stand trial for their alleged role in the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, ending more than a decade of US and
British efforts to bring the Libyans to justice for the murder of
270 people.
</P>
<P>
   The UN Security Council rewarded Tripoli by quickly suspending
an air embargo and economic sanctions imposed on the government
between 1992 and 1993 for its alleged role in harboring the two
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the end of a 10-year diplomatic stalemate,'' Britain's
foreign minister Robin Cook said Monday, characterizing the arrest
as an ``historic'' event. ``There will now be a criminal trial for
that act of mass murder.''
</P>
<P>
   It also set the stage for an unprecedented court case in which a
team of Scottish Judges, acting in Dutch territory, will decide the
fate of the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement drew mixed reactions from the relatives of the
victims of Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on
Dec. 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While some praised the hand-over as an overdue opportunity to
obtain justice, others said they feared that some compromise had
been struck that would shield senior Libyan authorities, including
leader Moammar Khadafy, responsible for ordering the terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hopeful that these men will be made to take
responsibility for what they have done,'' said Eleanor Bright, a
Boston-area woman whose husband, Nicholas, died in the bombing.
``But I'm concerned that at the end of the day we won't know any
more than we know today about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa
Fahima, were handed over to the UN's top legal adviser, Hans
Corell, in Tripoli Monday, at a ceremony attended by diplomats from
throughout the African and Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   They were flown in an Italian plane bearing UN markings to the
Netherlands. Through a highly unusual legal arrangement, Britain
will now request the formal extradition of the suspects from the
Dutch government to stand trial at an abandoned American airfield
to be placed temporarily under the control of a Scottish jurists.
</P>
<P>
   It could be several months before a trial begins.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the Libyans brought an end to a complex and often
frustrating diplomatic high-wire act by Secretary General Kofi
Annan, South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, and Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah. And it provided a rare example of a UN
economic embargo achieving its political objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country likes to be treated as an outcast,'' Annan said
Monday in explaining why Libya surrendered the two men. ``I think
Libya wanted to be able to deal freely with its neighbors and with
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that the deal could not have been closed without
the involvement of President Mandela. The South African leader has
maintained strong personal ties with Khadafy, a vocal critic of the
apartheid regime, since his days in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident right from the beginning that President
Khadafy would keep his words. I will not abandon a man who helped
when we were all alone,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, said that the
Libyan's arrest represented a triumph for US and British diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a combination of tough economic sanctions and a
willingness to entertain Libya's demand to try the case in a
neutral country, the Netherlands, led to the turnover. But he said
that a separate series of US sanctions designed to thwart Tripoli's
ability to finance international terrorism will remain in force.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyan suspects were indicted in 1991 by US and Scottish
courts and later placed on the FBI's ``Ten Most Wanted Refugees''
list.
</P>
<P>
   According to the US indictment, the suspects, both reputed
Libyan intelligence agents, placed a Semtex explosive into a
radio-cassette player and stashed it into a Samsonite suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The suitcase, carrying a New York destination tag, was allegedly
placed by one of the suspects on an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt,
Germany, where it picked up a connecting flight to London before
being placed on Pan AM 103. The explosive blew up over Lockerbie
after take off, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said Monday that he would deliver a report to the council
within 90 days assessing whether Libya has met a series of
obligations _ renouncing terrorism, cooperating with the court
throughout the trial and compensating families of the victims of
the Pan AM flight and of a French airliner allegedly bombed by
Libyan terrorists _ before sanctions can be formally lifted.
</P>
<P>
   For all practical purposes, UN and US officials privately
acknowledge that UN sanctions have already been lifted for good
since it would require a vote of the Security Council to re-impose
them, an unlikely prospect given the growing unpopularity of
economic sanctions.

VALENTIN GIVES RED SOX MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ His soul brother was on the left coast,
wearing Angelic colors and warming up for Tuesday's
Anaheim-Cleveland opener in the shadow of Space Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   And so John Valentin Monday stepped into the third spot in the
Boston batting order _ the slot where Mo Vaughn flexed his muscles
last year _ and delivered the key blows in the Red Sox' 5-3 Opening
Day victory over the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's Vaughnesque, 430-foot two-run shot onto the grassy
knoll in dead center field at Kauffman Stadium pulled the Red Sox
back from a 2-0 deficit in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo can't hit it that far,'' Valentin said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, he crashed an RBI double to left to provide an
insurance run for Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   This was a hard-fought win, one made more difficult by
Valentin's seventh-inning error that allowed the Royals to score
their third run. But after Day One of the 1999 season, Pedro
Martinez (nine strikeouts) is 1-0, Jose Offerman (4 for 5) is
hitting .800, Valentin has 3 RBIs, Flash Gordon is 1 for 1 in save
opportunities, and Dan Duquette has stopped the laughter.
</P>
<P>
   What else is there to say, Sox fans? (itals)Looks like the
pennant.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like this,'' said Valentin, traditionally a
slow starter. ``It's a pitching-and-defense type thing. Obviously,
we notice that Mo's not here. He's a guy that's going to knock in
100 runs and you can't replace what he does. We just have to have
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin is the senior member of the Sox in terms of continuous
service. He is one of the few who can remember spring training in
Winter Haven. He is one of only three remaining players (Trot Nixon
and Scott Hatteberg are the others) who was brought to Boston by
Lou Gorman rather than Duquette. He is a Sox player who actually
can remember Daddy Butch Hobson, and Roger Clemens getting mad at
Wade Boggs. And Jose Canseco's fashionably late appearances at
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin knows Mo like no other player knows Mo. Valentin played
with Vaughn at Seton Hall, then again at Pawtucket, and finally at
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hit only .247 with 23 homers and 73 RBIs last year, his
first season after signing a four-year, $25 million contract. He
pledged to get out of the gate more quickly this season and Monday
was a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know wy I'm so slow,'' he said. ``Maybe I just like
the hot weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather was a factor Monday. Early in the day, there was doubt
that this game would be played. There was a local tornado watch and
it was pouring until a pregame ceremony in which his Royal
highness, George Brett, emerged from the right-field bullpen,
riding in an old-timey convertible. After the emergence of George
(a first-ball tosser), the tarp came off, and the game started a
half-hour late.
</P>
<P>
   The immortal Joe Randa (nine homers last year with Detroit, 23
for his career) cranked a 3-and-2 Pedro pitch over the fence in
right with one out in the bottom of the first. KC cobbled together
another run in the first before Martinez settled down.
</P>
<P>
   It was still 2-0 when Valentin came up with Offerman on second
and one out in the third. Valentin connected with a 1-and-1 Kevin
Appier fastball and drove it high and far over the wall in center.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the memorable homers are the ones that go into
the waterfall, and the ones that stick into the side of the grassy
hills. This was one of the latter variety _ a Rawlings meteor crash
landing on the Missouri turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty windy, and that helped,'' said Valentin. ``I
think I've only hit one home run here. But I knew that one had a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Valentin booted a routine grounder (``I took my
eye off the ball'') by Rey Sanchez. The error helped KC close the
gap to 4-3. But in the ninth, after an Offerman triple, Valentin
cracked a double to the deepest part of left field, narrowly
missing another homer. Gordon had no trouble protecting the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Taken separately, the Red Sox and Royals are examples of
baseball's largest problem: the two-tier system. The Red Sox are
flush with money and have a $61 million payroll. The Royals feature
a $24 million payroll, which in part explains last year's 72-89
record.
</P>
<P>
   One of the myths of Opening Day is that every team has a chance
to win the World Series. In truth, half of the 30 major league
teams start this season with no chance to make it to postseason
play. Kansas City is one of those teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals went 22-9 and had the best winning percentage (.710)
in baseball this spring. There has been all kinds of enthusiasm
about the plucky, fundamentally sound, upstart Royals. But they
have no stars. And no chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox? We're still not sure. But a day like Monday makes Red
Sox Nation dream of another playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a good day,'' said Valentin. ``It wasn't
perfect. I gave one back, but Derek Lowe held them down. All in all
a good day. Maybe it's going to be a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't that be a surprise?

 &HT;    Daytona cops to get tough during black college spring break
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ After failing to clean up Black College
Reunion last year, city officials say they will use firm police
tactics if necessary to control crowds that are expected to top
100,000 this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Like Atlanta's Freaknik, scheduled for next weekend, the annual
gathering of African-American youth at Daytona Beach has been a
lightning rod for controversy. Revelers complain they aren't
welcome, while residents say the youths trash their town with
unruly behavior and mammoth traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   If traffic gets too bad this year, police will limit access to
the beach party zone to people with passes_ residents, workers and
visitors with hotel reservations. Everybody else will be diverted
to parking areas where they can catch free buses to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it took up to six hours to drive from one end of the
beach to the other and back,'' said Daytona Beach Police
spokeswoman Sherri Davis. ``The plan is for public safety, to allow
ambulances and fire trucks to have access in the event of an
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the tactics are heavy-handed at best, racist at
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just fearful of seeing a large number of blacks,''
said Daytona Beach City Commissioner Charles Cherry, who also heads
the local NAACP. ``There's a large number of whites over there
(during Spring Break) and nobody's paying attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Freaknik and Black Bike Week at Atlantic Beach, S.C., Black
College Reunion has been a long-running but unofficial April event
with a troubled history. In recent years, it has drawn crowds of
more than 100,000, spawning heavy criticism from residents fed up
with the gridlock, noise and behavior that has included public
drunkenness, littering and lewd acts.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the Atlanta University Center are predicting smaller
crowds this year for Freaknik. ``I don't think anyone is going to
come, because nothing has been planned,'' said Jackie Gayle, a
senior at Clark Atlanta University. ``No one is talking about it on
campus. I'm not going anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Freaknik-related Web sites list activities, but the city,
which in past years had a committee to help organize the event, has
yet to reveal how it will mobilize police officers and handle
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, city officials in Daytona Beach hoped to tame that
event by embracing it, sanctioning a promoter who scheduled
concerts and other events around town to try to break up the
traffic gridlock that seemed to generate the most criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort failed as the concerts and other events drew
almost no crowds, while the revelers once again turned Atlantic
Avenue, the main beach drag, into a virtual parking lot.

CARING CONCERN FOR SUPERVISOR'S MISTAKES HELPFUL

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I work in a library, and my supervisor,
whom I adore, has developed some rather serious accuracy problems,
such as when entering material on our database. I know she has
certain vision problems and temporary medical issues that are
probably responsible for this. Should I even broach the subject; if
so, how; or should I just keep going back correcting her mistakes?
B.G.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: If you were a supervisor whose work was becoming
increasingly inaccurate, how would you feel if one of your
employees, who adores you, came in and privately indicated that she
is concerned about you? She asks if you are aware of the growing
numbers of errors in your work, shows you a few, and then asks if
there is anything she can do to help.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, your supervisor is making some rather serious errors,
and you should seriously consider discussing this situation with
her. Although you believe that her slippage may be due to vision
problems or current health issues, that may not be the case at all.
A decline in accuracy could actually point to any number of causes.
</P>
<P>
   If your supervisor is unaware of the errors that she is making,
there is a real possibility that your positive, constructive and
caring feedback will help her to take some specific actions to
correct the problem. In fact, as a professional, she is likely to
appreciate what you are saying. Many of these types of problems
ultimately wind up with a supervisor saying, ``Why didn't you tell
me?'' Ultimately, you will be glad that you did, and she will too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband's company surveyed the employees to see how they
feel about their supervisors. He made a few comments, such as,
``Uses coarse language,'' regarding his immediate supervisor. There
are only four people in his department, and the human resources
manager printed out the verbatim comments and handed them to the
supervisor. The supervisor figured out who had written it and came
to my husband and asked, ``Did you write this?'' My husband was
extremely embarrassed. Care to comment? B.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: There could be some ``coarse language'' used to describe the
way this survey was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   In conducting this type of survey, the supervisors need to be
advised at the outset that they are going to be receiving feedback,
some of which will be raw data. This feedback should be accompanied
by discussion and follow-up developmental sessions. One ground rule
is that there are to be no reprisals or trying to figure out who
said what. In your husband's company, where were the meetings and
ground rules?
</P>
<P>
   Prior to printing and distributing verbatim comments, it is
essential to determine if doing so will compromise employee
anonymity. With this in mind, some surveys eliminate the verbatim
comments altogether, while others present them under companywide
headings, such as ``supervisory communications,'' ``supervisory
accessibility'' and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the best approach is to provide this type of
feedback in a private session with the individual supervisor, and
your husband's supervisor sounds like an individual who could use a
good deal of feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is one person I work with who has made insulting
comments to me many times over the past few months. She always
apologizes but then does it again. The last time this occurred, I
told her that I don't accept her apology. Her response to my
refusal is that I must have some kind of problem. What do you
think? C.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: You do have some kind of problem, and it is this insulting
fellow employee. She is obviously carrying more baggage than the
cargo-hold of a 747, and the only way she can make herself feel big
is by casting her little insults at you.
</P>
<P>
   Your refusal to accept her apology was absolutely correct. An
apology is not some sort of wild card that an insulting person can
play whenever he or she makes an out-of-line comment. An apology
not only is an expression of regret, but it implies that the person
will not engage in the same offensive behavior in the future. Your
fellow employee is not offering you a real apology, and, as a
result, it need not be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   If you must have contact with this person, you need to
assertively indicate that her insults must stop. Equally important,
you should let her know that if she offers you a real apology, you
will offer her a real acceptance. And, if she decides that she
would rather continue to insult you, then you should discuss the
situation with your supervisor.

does not withdraw his police units from Kosovo and work toward a

MIA FARROW FILLS BIG ROLE OFFSTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
 FARROW-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For most of her life, Mia Farrow has been content to
reveal herself through the camera's lens, or in fleeting public
appearances. Not her fault if the view is deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, she seems such a waif. A tiny, fragile thing with
bones that threaten to poke through the transparent skin that was a
gift from her Irish mother, and a wispy voice that thins out under
stress.
</P>
<P>
   On those rare occasions when she ventures onto a theater stage,
she doesn't seem much larger than her screen persona. At 54, she
still looks like an adolescent in need of a good hug.
</P>
<P>
   The image has served her in good stead in films like ``Death on
the Nile,'' in which she played a deceitful murderess, and in
``Rosemary's Baby,'' where she took on Old Nick himself in defense
of her child. Moviegoers were caught off guard by her strength and
determination.
</P>
<P>
   Looks aren't everything; in Farrow's case, they are almost
nothing. She always has known her mind, and usually followed it. At
19, against the advice of nearly everyone, she fell in love with
the much-older Frank Sinatra and married him, only to file for
divorce a few months later. After the failure of a second marriage
(to musician Andre Previn), she began a common-law relationship
with Woody Allen that dismayed many of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   How could this work, they asked? The neurotic Jewish guy with
the most famous ``me'' complex in world cinema and the fey Catholic
girl whose real career seemed to be taking in stray children?
</P>
<P>
   It did work; for 13 years, although in hindsight, it was largely
because Farrow made it happen. The couple still might be together
if Allen hadn't begun an affair with Soon-Yi Previn, one of
Farrow's adopted daughters. By the time Farrow finished with him in
court and in the pages of her autobiography, ``What Falls Away,''
Allen probably thought Old Nick had gotten off easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't raise 14 children without learning to hold your
own,'' she says obliquely, and that's as close as she will come to
commenting on her problems with Allen. She would rather spend the
interview talking about those kids, four of which are her
biological offspring and 10 of which she adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 10 have special needs; two, for instance, are blind;
another is a paraplegic; two more were born to crack-addicted
mothers. She will give a lecture Monday, part of the Unique Lives &AMP;
Experiences lecture series at Arizona State University, that will
focus on the joy she has found in loving and nurturing such
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the notion of adoption through the larger idea of
our common need to lead a meaningful life,'' she says. ``Not just
to survive, but to survive meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``My way certainly wouldn't be everyone's way. Adopting children
with special needs is a calling; it consumes my entire day, my
entire life. It is very, very demanding, and at the same time it is
very, very rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   A devout Catholic, she has no doubts as to where her calling
originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that anyone who does this will tell you that God
gives them a very special gift and grace to do it. I think that is
true of all parenting, but this is beyond that. What I try to
convey to people is how doable and how much fun it is, and how much
the parent receives from the child. My children have given me far
more than I have ever given them. There is no way I can repay my
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrow's brood has made her a grandmother three times over, and
part of the interview is devoted to the obligatory bragging. One of
her sons is a lawyer, another a computer expert. A couple of the
kids are in college, but seven remain at home. The youngest is 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Andre and I adopted our first child, Lark, it was during
the Vietnam War and we wanted to do something to help the many,
many orphans that came out of that carnage,'' she says. ``It never
crossed my mind that we would be adopting more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as Lark grew, she brought us such joy. She had been ill,
and to see her grow and be well was . . . I don't think the world
`fulfillment' is too strong. I felt fulfilled in a way that I never
had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Every adoption came as a result of family discussion, especially
as the younger children grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each new child would find his or her place in the family and
then an adoption agency would call and say, `Here is another one.'
We would discuss it among ourselves and, if all the children were
happy and it seemed possible, I would say yes. I didn't say yes to
every child, and with others I might say no for a year or two and
then the time would be right.''
</P>
<P>
   She ponders that word for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time it happened, it just seemed right. It was never `No,
that's too many,' because it only happened when the family felt it
could give the new child the kind of love and nurturing that was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People laugh when I tell them that it's much easier now. There
are only seven at home. That doesn't seem like a lot to me. I am
one of seven children myself and I don't have trouble handling that
many. But this is it for me. By the time I get the last one raised,
I will be ready to take on being a full-time grandmother. There are
always extra kids, anyway, with sleep-overs and everything. The
house is full.''
</P>
<P>
   By involving the children in the process, Farrow believes she
has created a strong family bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older ones come home every chance they get. They want to
be here for each milestone; this one lost a tooth, that one maybe
didn't get such a good grade. My oldest son, who is a lawyer in
Washington, is the closest thing my children have to a father. If
anything happens to me, I know he would take over the family. For
something that wasn't planned, it has all turned out remarkably
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrow's father was Australian film director John Farrow, whose
credits include ``Wake Island,'' ``The Big Clock,'' '`Hondo'' and
his masterpiece, the dark political allegory ``Alias Nick Beal.''
Her mother was the ravishingly beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, an
Irish actress who came to Hollywood when she was 19 and later
worked with Garbo, Laurence Olivier, the Marx Brothers and, most
famously, as the scantily-clad Jane opposite Johnny Weissmuller's
Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   John Farrow died in 1963, but O'Sullivan lived until 1998,
plenty of time to be astonished at the number of her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect she thought I was a bit daft,'' Farrow says,
chuckling, ``but she was always supportive. She was my bulwark
against everything. She had a sense of humor and wisdom and all the
survival skills. She was just a hilarious and wise friend that I
had in my corner all my life. I miss her terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before her mother died, Farrow lost another touchstone
in her life. She was starring in ``Peyton Place,'' one of
television's biggest hits in the '60s, when she met Frank Sinatra
on the 20th Century Fox back lot. She was so nervous she dropped
her purse. He bent to pick it up and when he straightened, she
found herself staring directly into those legendary baby blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at that moment that I started to fall in love with
him,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship was tabloid fodder from the first, but the
gossips overlooked one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I divorced him doesn't mean I didn't love him,''
she says. ``I never stopped loving him, and to this day, I don't
believe he is gone. He's just somewhere else, not too far away. I
talk to him and my mom a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra's widow, Barbara, and his children welcomed Farrow at
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I stayed at Nancy's house. It was extraordinary to
be there at that time. It was a house so full of love, so much
grief for him, so much trading of wonderful stories. Barbara and
the family allowed me to say goodbye. I will be forever grateful to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her romance with Sinatra, Farrow seemed poised on
the verge of one of the great film careers. She's had a good run,
but not a great one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I have compromised my career radically. It's a
miracle that I even have one,'' she says. ``But God has been good
to me. The phone still rings. And I must work because I'm also the
breadwinner. I just finished a film called ``Serving in Silence.''
It reminded me of how much I enjoy acting, but there always comes a
point in any shoot when I say, `Enough. Time to go home.' We all
have our fantasies, right? Mine is that someone will come along and
drop a bag of money on my head so that I will never have to leave
the children.''
</P>
<P>
   She may have no regrets about those kids, but the rest of her
life? Well, if she has any, she's come to terms with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one makes it through life without some bad things happening
to them,'' she says. ``I've had my share, I guess, but I don't feel
bitter. That's too big. I give that to God. All that anger would
weight you down and make you a prisoner, and I want to be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why having children is so important. Children force you
to turn your life to something good. You want to find God? Look at
a child. Children (begin ital) are (end ital) God. I am blessed by
my children and I thank Him every day.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ This capital stretches 40 miles from end
to end, spread across the desert like a landlocked Los Angeles. It
is said to be growing faster than any other city in the world, with
a population doubling every nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Riyadh has expanded out, not up. But that may be about
to change. Two gleaming multi-use towers will soon dwarf every
other structure in the kingdom. They are the progeny of rival
princes but may also send a more prosaic signal: that broader is
not necessarily better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the Michigan Avenue of Riyadh,'' Sabah Sammakieh,
manager of one project, said in describing a transformation that is
hard to envision in this horizontal city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as planners wrestle with Riyadh's future, many have been
asking how long the sprawl can continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare for the circumstances,'' said Drystian
Siebert, chief planner for the Riyadh High Commission, which is
trying to figure out how to accommodate an anticipated increase
from today's population of 3.5 million to a predicted 10.5 million
by 2021. Even that figure would require a slowing of the current
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert and others in Riyadh know the danger of underestimation.
In 1982, when the diplomatic capital was moved to Riyadh from the
Red Sea city of Jidda, there were sober projections that the
capital's population, then under a million, would hit 2.5 million
sometime about 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the population has been growing faster than anyone had
predicted _ at a rate of 8 percent a year. That is more than twice
even Saudi Arabia's sky-high overall rate; residents swear that
they can see the city's boundaries expand by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Riyadh today is larger in area than Paris and just slightly
smaller than greater London. While those cities have charms large
and small, Riyadh has few. Scarred by poor planning and haste, its
development has hopscotched, leaving low-slung office blocks
interspersed with vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   It has modern embassies and official buildings (the Interior
Ministry resembles a flying saucer). And its most beautiful
buildings, residential palaces, tend to be behind high walls.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it has sprawled, planners say, is that Saudi families
tend to be large. With an average of 7.2 people per household, even
more than in most other Muslim countries, most families want space.
That aspiration is intensified by the priority that conservative
Saudis put on privacy, with homes designed to guard women from
strangers' sight.
</P>
<P>
   Few Saudis of any class would feel comfortable living in an
apartment, with strangers above and below. And even among people
feeling the pain of Saudi Arabia's tight economic times, few say
they would be willing to settle for anything short of a spacious
two-story villa, on a large lot.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawl has compounded the problems posed by the population
increase, further straining efforts to build roads and deliver
services to homes in what is, after all, a desert. Riyadh has
little in the way of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's vast oil supplies are hundreds of miles away, and
limited electrical capacity means that brownouts are frequent.
Wells fed by deep aquifers provide one-third of city water; the
rest must come hundreds of miles by pipeline from desalination
plants on the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   That Riyadh is even a capital has nothing to do with comfort but
is tied to history. The city was seized in 1902 from the hands of a
rival tribe by the man who would become King Abdelaziz and unify
Saudi Arabia. It has remained the stronghold of the ruling al-Saud
family.
</P>
<P>
   And as the government center it has remained an irresistible
beacon, even with summer temperatures that routinely exceed 115
degrees. Its population has been swelled by Saudis from all over
the kingdom, drawn by hopes of securing royal patronage or
government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Riyadh has also lured hundreds of thousands of foreigners _
construction workers, servants, computer technicians and
consultants _ who account for some 25 percent of Saudi Arabia's
population of 20 million.
</P>
<P>
   No one, certainly not the developers, expects the opening of the
high-rises in Riyadh to attract more than a handful of residents.
Housing is not their main purpose. In fact they are as much icons
as buildings, each with a distinctive design and shape. They will
maximize their impact by standing some 60 stories tall _ even
though, to abide by legal limits, both structures have only 30
floors.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller, the Faisaliah Complex, is being built by the King
Faisal Foundation, Saudi Arabia's biggest developer, whose profits
are used for philanthropy, said its secretary-general, Prince
Bandar bin Saud. It will be 822 feet tall _ almost three times as
tall as the insurance building that is now the country's tallest _
and will eclipse the several 10-story buildings that until 1992
were the tallest permitted by law.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Kingdom Center, by Prince Walid bin Talal, a
financier. It is supposed to top 1,000 feet, which will make it the
second-tallest building in the Middle East _ behind one in Dubai _
and 23rd in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Both are to include malls, hotels (including a 242-room Four
Seasons), conference centers and a few residential condominiums _
meant, for now, to attract foreign business people.
</P>
<P>
   But in time, real estate experts here say, tower living may
become conceivable even to Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is growing so fast,'' said Talal al-Maiman, an
executive on the Kingdom Center project, ``that eventually there's
got to be an appetite for apartments.''

WHITE HOUSE OPENS DOOR TO ALLIED GROUND TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS lede to correct spelling of Milosevic; pickup 2ndgraf:
``Out plan)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, moving to deflect an anticipated
plea for a cease-fire from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
vowed on Monday an ``undiminished, unceasing and unrelenting''
allied air campaign against Yugoslav armed forces until Milosevic
meets tough conditions for ending the 14-day offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to persist until we prevail,'' Clinton declared as
he launched a stepped-up refugee relief effort dubbed ``Operation
Sustain Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``We are prepared to sustain this effort for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said allied bombing would continue until Milosevic
withdraws Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, ceases attacks on ethnic
Albanian Muslims in Kosovo, agrees to autonomy for the province,
permits an international security force and clears the way for
immediate repatriation of 505,000 refugees who have fled to
Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Milosevic does not do what is necessary, NATO will
continue an air campaign. It will be undiminished, unceasing and
unrelenting,'' the president declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as senior administration officials cracked the
door for the first time to the possible movement of allied ground
troops into Kosovo to protect stranded refugees there.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said troops could enter
Kosovo if Yugoslav forces posed no ``risk'' or as the result of
``some sort of deal'' with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have previously ruled out the
use of allied ground forces inside Kosovo without a signed
agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon laid the groundwork for possible creation of an
allied-protected refugee sanctuary in southern Kosovo with
preparations to send 24 Apache anti-tank attack helicopters and 18
long-range rocket launchers to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Both the helicopters and a long-range version of the rockets
launched by the Multiple Launch Rocket System have the range to
cover the entire territory of Kosovo to protect any allied troops
dispatched into the mountainous terrain to help refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman said Clinton anticipates a move for a
cease fire from Milosevic in coming days because Yugoslav forces
have made great progress toward achieving the Serbian leader's goal
of eliminating ethnic Albanian Muslims from the Yugoslav-run
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be a surprise to see in the coming days attempts
at half measures, hollow cease-fires,'' Lockhart said, adding:
``They will not be acceptable to stop the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon declared: ``Milosevic may think
he's finished. We will not be finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended administration preparations to deal with the
flood of refugees unleashed in the wake of the allied bombing
campaign that began 13 days ago. Clinton said that it had been
``impossible to prepare fully for the chaos'' that stemmed from
Milosevic's campaign of ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States was shipping 500,000 individual
daily rations to the estimated 244,000 refugees crowded into
Albania and would begin shipping 600,000 rations requested by
Macedonia to feed an estimated 136,000 Kosovar refugees there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said another 65,000 Kosovars continue languishing
without adequate food or shelter in no-man's land between Kosovo
and Macedonia _ the site of some of the most heart-rending news
photographs in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do all we can to aid the victims of Mr.
Milosevic's expulsion policy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration agreed on Sunday to provide temporary
refuge for 20,000 refugees as part of a NATO-wide effort to absorb
100,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania and Macedonia to free space for
additional Kosovar refugees still trying to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman said that the United States would
probably provide temporary housing to up to 20,000 Kosovar refugees
at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where some 45,000
Haitian refugees were housed during an earlier U.S. refugee crisis.

   KIGALI, Rwanda _ There is a stone jail with six windows on a
rocky hill in eastern Rwanda. All but four of the 221 prisoners are
charged with crimes related to the genocide, the very logical
madness, that broke out five years ago this week, when one group of
Rwandans tried to annihilate the other.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prisoners is Felix Ndayambaje, a man in his early 20s
who has confessed to raping his neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confessed because I was still young when I committed
that act,'' he said. ``I have confessed so that I may ask for
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away Salviana Mukagatare, 30, crossed a dirt road
through a banana grove. A triangular scar _ three chops from a
machete _ runs from below her right eye to her ear. Her right hand,
chopped twice, is a limp claw. She is the only member of her family
to survive the massacres in her village in April 1994. ``Forgive?''
she asked. ``No, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years after an event of singular evil, Rwandans are still
playing out a quiet drama _ person by person, village by village _
of regret, forgiveness and at times defiance. But while the wounds
are still fresh, as people re-imagine themselves and each other
after such horror, much of the change here since 1994 seems for the
good, if tenuously so.
</P>
<P>
   Hutu and Tutsi are again living side by side, as they did for
centuries. Rwanda is largely peaceful. Last week, the
Tutsi-controlled government held local elections, the first in many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wellars Rwagasore, a 45-year-old farmer in Nyarubuye district,
in the east, did not vote only for members of his own ethnic group,
the Tutsi. Of eight positions, he chose four Hutu, from the group
that rose up and killed at least half a million Tutsi and moderate
Hutu who stood in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government says to live together and be reconciled,'' he
said. ``We have to forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hope sits alongside a fair share of pessimism. Many say Hutu
and Tutsi are still far apart in their hearts. Intermarriage, once
so common it is hard to tell who is who, is now rare. There are
still some 125,000 genocide suspects in jail, and they are dying
from AIDS or tuberculosis faster than they can be brought to trial
to bring some sense of justice to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the ethnic conflict has shifted its battle ground
to the war in eastern Congo, fought largely between Rwandan
soldiers, mostly Tutsi, and the Hutu militias that carried out the
killings in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And while the government has won support from outside nations
for working to reunite the two groups, it faces criticism for
growing corruption and sometimes uneven distribution of property
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, who led the
army of exiled Tutsi who took power in 1994, admitted to some of
the worst of the accusations, including reports that his soldiers
had killed civilians in their fight against Hutu extremists. But
overall, he contended, the government has done its best to root out
excesses and recreate Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five years, there is a long way to go,'' said Kagame,
41, the vice president and the nation's real political power. ``We
can't overcome this complex situation in five years.''

CLINTON SEES CONTINUED BOMBING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fending off criticism that bombing alone would not
stop Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's aggression against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, President Clinton vowed Monday to
``persist until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not explicitly challenge US military leaders who
have said in recent days that they expressed their reservations to
the White House about the effectiveness of NATO's
missile-and-bombing campaign before the airstrikes were launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody agreed that, while there were problems with the air
campaign, including the weather, which all of you saw last week,
that this was the best available option for us to maximize the
possibility of achieving our mission of standing up against ethnic
cleansing, fulfilling NATO's commitment, getting the refugees to be
able to go back home, live in peace and security and have some
autonomy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 30 representatives of federal agencies and
humanitarian relief organizations in the Roosevelt Room of the
White House, the president asserted: ``In the end, everybody agreed
that of a bunch of bad options, our military campaign was the best
available option.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were seconded by Defense Secretary William S.
Cohen, who joined Clinton at the event. Cohen said after much
discussion and debate within the armed services, everyone ``came to
the conclusion unanimously that the only option available, other
than sitting on the sidelines, was to pursue the air campaign,
given its limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, returning from a weekend at Camp David, mounted a more
vigorous defense of his military strategy in Kosovo than in recent
days _ just as the outlook improved because clearing weather in the
Balkans enabled NATO forces to more effectively target Serbian
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and
other members of his national security team, the president
addressed criticisms that NATO was caught off guard by the mass
exodus of refugees from Kosovo. ``It is impossible to prepare fully
for the chaos that this kind of cruelty inevitably creates,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States would join Turkey, Norway and
other nations in providing temporary shelter to the refugees in
order to relieve the burden on Albania and Macedonia, but he did
not explain how they could be returned home if Milosevic fails to
accept a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear: The ethnic cleansing of Kosovo cannot stand
as a permanent event,'' he said. ``We cannot say, `Well, just take
all these folks and forget about their rights to go home.' I don't
believe anyone wants to do that. That's not what we're about.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said Brian Atwood, the head of the US Agency for
International Development, will lead an interagency task force to
coordinate relief efforts, including the 20,000 refugees whom the
United States will house in temporary shelter.
</P>
<P>
   At his urging, NATO has put 11,000 troops in Macedonia to work
on relief efforts and is planning to deploy several thousand to
Albania to provide aid and security for relief operations, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also ordered the US military to send 500,000 daily rations to
Albania and 600,000 to Macedonia. Tents, sleeping bags, blankets,
comforters and cots are also on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Along with those efforts, the president said the airstrikes
would continue until NATO achieves its political objectives of
getting Milosevic to sign a peace agreement or signficantly
undermining his military capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to sustain this effort for the long haul,''
Clinton said. ``Our plan is to persist until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Before slipping out a door in the Roosevelt Room, leaving Cohen
to answer reporters' questions about US military strategy, the
president said, ``We have a lot of tough questions to answer about
this operation, and I am quite sure that we cannot answer every one
to everyone's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would far rather be standing here answering these
questions, with these people, talking about this endeavor, than I
would to be standing here having you ask me why we were permitting
a wholesale ethnic slaughter and ethnic cleansing and the creation
of hundreds of thousands of refugees, and not lifting a finger to
do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I believe we will prevail.''

 KIGALI, Rwanda: five years.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some critics wonder how long the government can keep its
mandate, which rests on its having defeated the Hutu powers that
planned and carried out the killings. But there is no question that
the events that began on April 6, 1994 _ when the plane of the Hutu
President, Juvenal Habyarimana, was shot down and the organized
massacre of Tutsi erupted _ still seep into every corner of life.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Mujaway, 40, is one of only a few dozen counselors in
Rwanda. Two pictures hang on the wall of her home in Kigali: one of
her husband, Paul, reclining in a field; the other of her and Paul
drinking beer through straws at their wedding. Paul was killed on
the road outside the school where he taught. She helped start a
widows' support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning it was easy,'' she said. ``People let you
talk. Now they tell you, `Five years _ you should be getting on
with normal life.' But for you it never stops.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Rwanda remains a traumatized country. It has not
even cleared all its human debris. Bits of leg bone, a child's
sandal poke out from the rubble in two rooms on the church grounds
in Nyarubuye, where 10,000 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is: Exactly what is happening with all that
trauma? The government has emphasized again and again that people
must overcome the trauma and unite (even if such a program is aimed
partly at the government's own survival: Tutsi still represent only
about 15 percent of the population).
</P>
<P>
   And there is a sense here that people are trying to unite by
telling similar stories about 1994.
</P>
<P>
   From top Tutsi officials to Hutu opposition politicians to
farmers who scrape a living from sloping plots, an official version
has emerged:
</P>
<P>
   It was the Belgian colonists who divided Rwanda, issuing
identity cards that marked Hutu or Tutsi according to the
colonists' own ideas about race. They favored the Tutsi, seen as
tall, fine-featured cattle-drivers, over the Hutu, seen as short,
rough cultivators. At independence in 1959, the Hutu staged a
revolution against the Tutsi monarchy and hundreds of thousands of
Tutsi died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, this version goes, it was malevolent Hutu leaders,
worried about losing power to Kagame's Tutsi guerrillas, who
exploited that division and drove thousands of Hutu to kill their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This narrative, accurate in its basic outline, justifies the
government's policy of directing punishment at those who organized
the killings, arguing that many ordinary Hutu were caught up in a
calibrated hysteria. It also gives ordinary people _ Hutu and Tutsi
_ a way to live together again without blaming each other directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was due to our leaders,'' said Jean-Pierre
Kabuto, a 36-year-old Hutu who was briefly arrested after the
massacres but has gone back to his native village in Kibungo. ``For
us, we had always shared everything.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, both ethnic groups talk of ``genocide,'' though that
word pins guilt firmly on the Hutu. The words ``Hutu'' and
``Tutsi'' are heard only in whispers or tones of apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all Rwandans,'' said Jean-Baptiste Michombero, 26, a
Hutu living in a village of mixed ethnic groups built by the United
Nations in Kibungo, near the Tanzanian border. ``We all have the
same feeling in our heads _ Hutu, Tutsi, Twa,'' the 1 percent of
Rwandans who are Pygmies. ``It is not words only.''
</P>
<P>
   But this version does not say much about what remains deep
inside most Rwandans: whether reconciliation has truly taken root.
In scores of interviews, Rwandans seemed eager to embrace the
theory of unity. But when it came to specifics _ the dead family,
the husband in jail _ the picture looks less hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have is to live with the wives of the killers,''
said Ms. Mukagatare, the Tutsi woman who nearly died from machete
wounds. ``The women are against me, seeing me survive alone without
any family. Even the children tell me I should have died.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused and looked around at the children who stopped to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even afraid of these children's parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.N. genocide trials in Tanzania, some defense lawyers
argue that there was no genocide, that it was not an organized
effort to erase any ethnic group. While few people in Rwanda argue
that publicly, the idea remains divisive, and many Hutu are angry
about the number of Hutu killed, both when Kagame's group, the
Rwandese Patriotic Army, took control in 1994, and in the army's
continuing battle against Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Hutu being killed?'' asked Theogene Munyanshogoza,
47, a Hutu farmer in Nyarubuye. ``Why were Hutu being killed?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Karas, field coordinator in Kibungo for the International
Rescue Committee, a American organization that has built houses,
schools and water projects with the United Nations, said Rwandans
are trying hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think they are really aware of this tenuous
relationship,'' he said. ``I have staff come to me saying, you
know, Andy, if something happened tomorrow, you wouldn't even
recognize the people around you, the transformation that would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough people have convinced me that this is a real turning
point.''

BETTER WEATHER ENCOURAGES NATO BOMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Balkan skies clearing, NATO is hoping to
turn up the heat on Belgrade and turn around its flagging air
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the most powerful military in the world, with the most
technologically sophisticated armor and firepower at its disposal,
NATO forces have so far been powerless to overcome a simple fact of
nature: the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds, rain, and fog repeatedly have prevented the allied
forces from fully flexing their military muscle, grounding some of
their most effective planes and making it impossible to pierce
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's military structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is improving,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H.
Bacon announced Monday. ``As a result, (Monday night) we were able
to hit a substantially larger number of targets than the day
before, and that in turn larger than the day before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, however, noted that clear weather had also given NATO
sharpening images of military attacks on Kosovar villages.
</P>
<P>
   With scattered clouds and sunshine during the day, and mostly
clear skies during the night predicted by weather forecasters until
at least until Wednesday afternoon, NATO forces are likely to
increase their strikes by a ``quantum leap,'' said Chris Hellman, a
senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information, a
Washington-based military policy research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strikes so far have been a pin-prick compared to what is
coming with better weather,'' agreed Bill Taylor, director of
political-military studies at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the allies had
been able ``to make full use of all our assets,'' and sucessfully
blast oil refineries and storage areas, air defenses, ammunition
depots and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, planes such as the A-10 and the Warthog, a slow,
low-flying attacker that hits tanks, armored personnel carriers and
infantry with deadly accuracy, have not been used as bombers
because of inclement weather, say military analysts and Pentagon
officials.
</P>
<P>
   These planes _ plus those that fly high and rely on satellite
and other tracking systems to guide their bombs _ are likely to be
out in force this week, making it easier to strike the troops and
tank columns that reportedly are responsible for wreaking
devastation on Kosovar Albanian villages and their inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO would ``focus attention on fielded forces in
Kosovo,'' which many analysts have heralded as a welcome move,
albeit one that comes too late to halt ethnic cleansing operations
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts, such as Lawrence Korb, director of studies at
the Council on Foreign Relations, warn NATO forces may be more
effective, but they will also be more vulnerable to attack from
Serbian surface-to-air missiles. ``Your risks are increasing, and
that means some casualties,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of admitting the truth about the current Kosovo
conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has all gone
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, was supposed to stand by the Rambouillet peace
accords, force Slobodan Milosevic to accept limited autonomy for
Kosovo and end the slaughter and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Kosovo
Albanians. Then NATO troops were to move into Kosovo in order to
protect the Muslim Albanian and Serb populations.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened? Rambouillet is in ashes. Serbia is
refusing to budge after 13 days and nights of air raids. Those we
pledged to protect are being driven from their homes in the
greatest act of depopulation in Europe since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of admitting the truth, our leaders consistently
lie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were told that the Serb leader would be forced to
end his ``ethnic cleansing.'' The opposite has happened and now we
are told _ by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, no less _ that
Milosevic will be made to ``pay the price,'' which is not the same
thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised to attack only military targets and, for as long
as it thought it could crack the Serb military, that is what it
did.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is doing just what the Americans did in Iraq _
spreading the war to civilian targets, to bridges and electricity
stations and factories and refineries, under the spurious excuse
that these are also of use to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are _ just as roads and railway tracks and water
mains are of use to the military. And as we get more desperate,
they may well be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never an operation that was planned for only two or
three days,'' NATO's spokesman James Shea told us on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Really? So why were we not told this before we went to war? Why
were we not told of the possibility of weeks of air raids and the
wholesale abandonment of the Albanian civilian population of Kosovo
if Milosevic did not give in?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only now learn about the prospect of a ``long war,''
perhaps lasting four years?
</P>
<P>
   And why, for God's sake, did no one _ not President Bill
Clinton, not NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana, nor Robin
Cook, nor General Wesley Clark _ realize that bombing must be
supported by ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   How on earth did Clark come to believe that the Serbs would give
up so easily? Did he mistake the Yugoslav army for the Serb
militias of Bosnia? Did he think that bullies are always cowards
and will therefore give in? Did he not realize that only a real
threat of ground invasion might force Milosevic to agree to the
Rambouillet accords in time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, we have been told other lies: that it
would have been even worse if NATO had not bombed Serbia _ and that
we knew Milosevic had planned the total ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Kosovo Albanian population before we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the first statement _ from President Clinton himself _
is rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb paramilitaries butchering their way across Kosovo and
poised to drive out every last Albanian, it could not possibly be
worse. And if we knew that Milosevic had planned this, why did NATO
not provide fighting ground troops in those precious weeks
following the original Rambouillet conference?
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, our defense analysts have been hard at
work to explain the continued war. Not only is it intended to make
Milosevic ``pay the price'' for his brutality, but any faltering
now would damage the credibility of NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it would. Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone
to war to save the Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are
at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, NATO's 50th birthday was this weekend, marked by a
blazing oil refinery, an electricity station burning itself out in
northern Belgrade and hundred of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
freezing on the mountainsides of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised. We asked the Kurds and the Shia
Muslims of Iraq to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and, when
they did as they were told, we abandoned them to the torture
chambers of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This time, we asked the Kosovo Albanians to sign the peace
accords in Paris and praised the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Now they are on the run, we can do no more than bomb the
Serbs from the air. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a telling moment last week when a senior RAF officer
stood up at NATO's regular briefing to tell journalists that the
KLA ``has not been defeated'' but was ``regrouping'' in order to
``take up the armed struggle'' once again.
</P>
<P>
   What is this nonsense? That a NATO officer should seek to
support the KLA in such a way proved two terrifying things: to the
Serbs, that the KLA was a fifth column (and thus worthy only of
execution) and, to us, that NATO now regards this ragtag bunch of
ill-disciplined ex-Marxists as its foot-soldiers in Kosovo. The
substitute army for the NATO soldiers who will not be sent into
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO briefings become ever more sinister. At each one, a new
and ever more ghoulish story is produced for journalists _ the mass
execution of intellectuals one day, the rape of young women the
next, the killing of fathers and sons in front of their families,
the setting up of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   These stories may well turn out to be true _ I suspect the truth
may be worse _ but the effect is pornography-by-press-conference,
with spokesman ``Jamie'' Shea acting as the East End club doorman
touting the evening's horror story and his RAF colleague playing
the role of manager, promising us that the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will until every last Kosovo Albanian has been driven
from his home, or until MI5 or the CIA engineer the secession of
Montenegro or the overthrow of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the promises continue: ``We shall attack his
murderous forces in Kosovo: we shall strike at the nerve center of
his decision-making machine'' (British Armed Forces Minister Doug
Henderson).
</P>
<P>
   NATO is showing ``unflinching resolve'' in the battle against
the ``unbelievably brutal actions of Milosevic's special police and
army'' (Air Marshal Sir John Day). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is suggesting that the Serb leader may face a war
crimes indictment. Do they think Milosevic will be frightened by
all this?
</P>
<P>
   After his supporters killed and raped their way through far more
Muslims in Bosnia than they have in Kosovo, we treated him as a
peacemaker. He was invited to the Dayton conference, he was
regarded by Washington and by the Foreign Office as ``a force for
stability in the Balkans'' (as Saddam was in Iraq after he invaded
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was one of ``our'' dictators _ or at least a man with
whom we could do business.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has joined our list of ``beasts'' _ we remember
Saddam and Qaddafi although, oddly, Osama bin Laden has dropped off
our Satanic radar screens for the present.
</P>
<P>
   We believe Milosevic can be ``defanged'' or ``declawed,'' or
that we can, in the words of the Sun newspaper on the first day of
the war, ``Clobba Slobba.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, history is not like that. NATO thought that within three
days of its bombing campaign, it would have 200,000 Serbs on the
streets of Belgrade demanding Milosevic's removal. Instead, tens of
thousands of Serbs now gather on those streets for daily pop
concerts to demonstrate their hatred of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There are many words to encompass the events of the last two
weeks: brutality, vanity, arrogance. But above all, folly is the
word that comes to mind. Maybe we will find another persecuted
population to ``protect'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   They had better watch out. &QL;

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ With tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
fleeing Kosovo backed up in dismal conditions at the Macedonian
border, international relief officials accused Macedonia on Monday
of endangering lives by processing the refugees too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that Macedonians were deliberately delaying
the processing out of fear that a massive influx of Kosovo
Albanians would upset the country's ethnic balance. Albanians
account for about 20 percent of this country's population, while
Macedonians, who generally sympathize with Serbia in the current
conflict, make up about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, press officer for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, told a news conference in the Macedonian capital of
Skopje that Macedonian authorities were only clearing 5,000
refugees, while 65,000 were stuck on a muddy hillside at the
border, blocked by Macedonian police and army troops from entering
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not enough,'' Ms. Ghedini said. People were now dying
at a rate of 10 a day, she said, and ``this will increase if we do
not get people out from the open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get them out of the mud,'' she said. ``It is
extremely cold, it has been raining quite a lot, people are
weakened, fatigued and in a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has been flooded with 136,000 refugees, most of them
arriving in the last few days. In addition to the 65,000 believed
to be stranded at Blace, the main border crossing, another 30,000
people are thought to be on the other side of the border, in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A long trail of cars stretched back miles along the road, where
people have been queuing for nearly a week to cross the border. At
least one more train arrived Monday morning from Pristina, part of
the 5,000 people who had arrived over the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrivals came on foot from the towns of Urosevac and
even Vucitrn in northern Kosovo, fleeing Serbian forces and police
who have forced a mass exodus of ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   One official with the U.N. refugee agency, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said that Macedonian officials were barely
cooperating with the relief operation, and charged that the
Macedonians were intentionally putting brakes on the influx.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the foreign aid organizations that are providing
the food and supplies and those with NATO and the U.N. refugee
agency, which are jointly setting up camps to take the refugees
elsewhere in Macedonia, were clearly losing patience Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not want to move people into Macedonia, that is
incredibly clear,'' the U.N. refugee agency official said. ``They
do not like Albanians at all, and that feeling is incredibly
widespread among the population in Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has declined to give the U.N. agency a full mandate to
process, register and care for refugees, though the agency has
offered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the experience and ability to process 20,000 refugees
in one day. But they do not want us do it,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said the influx of refugees threatens
its economic and political stability. They have also expressed
anxiety about the immediate security of the border region, and have
brought in extra troops and police to secure the area and guard the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The policy appeared to have widespread support among ordinary
Macedonians, who did not conceal their antipathy for the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't your countries take them?'' asked one young
policeman, cradling an automatic weapon as he guarded the road at
the camp. ``We don't want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Skopje were even more outspoken against the ethnic
Albanian refugees. ``The government should not let them in,'' said
Niko, a 24-year-old dealer of spare car parts and an ethnic
Macedonian. ``As you see we have enough problems ourselves. They
are closing the factories because there is no money and if the
Albanians come in, things will be even worse. We will become a
minority here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian government's actions on the border also seem
aimed at forcing foreign countries to take a large part of the
refugees. U.N. officials agreed that other countries should help
share the burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one hour's flight from any European capital, and they
could offer safe havens to people,'' Ms. Ghedini said. ``They
should let them in on a temporary basis because most of these
people will want to go back to Kosovo when they can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several busloads of refugees were taken straight to the airport
Monday evening in an apparently uncoordinated move by the local
authorities, and five planes reportedly flew about 750 Kosovars to
Turkey. The U.N. refugee commissioner had expected only 90 people
to be flown out to Norway on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   European countries have pledged to take in some 36,000 refugees,
Ms. Ghedini said. But in the meantime, the refugees should be given
immediate help inside Macedonia, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one foreign aid agency, Doctors of the World, has been
allowed by Macedonian authorities to set up a medical tent inside
the sprawling camp at Blace. Only local aid workers are allowed
into the camp, to distribute food and gather up the sick. The
official reason given for preventing foreigners from working in the
camp is that it is a restricted border zone.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghedini said she worked all day and night at a transit camp
put up by NATO for the refugees. ``We were ready at 2 p.m.
yesterday. But there were no registration officials, no buses to
take the refugees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities only began transferring the refugees in the
middle of the night. By 3 a.m., some 5,000 refugees had been moved
to the transit camp. ``But there was no official at the camp, and
we have no information as to whether they will be processed. This
is quite frustrating,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of admitting the truth about the current Kosovo
conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has all gone
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, was supposed to stand by the Rambouillet peace
accords, force Slobodan Milosevic to accept limited autonomy for
Kosovo and end the slaughter and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Kosovo
Albanians. Then NATO troops were to move into Kosovo in order to
protect the Muslim Albanian and Serb populations.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened? Rambouillet is in ashes. Serbia is
refusing to budge after 13 days and nights of air raids. Those we
pledged to protect are being driven from their homes in the
greatest act of depopulation in Europe since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of admitting the truth, our leaders consistently
lie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were told that the Serb leader would be forced to
end his ``ethnic cleansing.'' The opposite has happened and now we
are told _ by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, no less _ that
Milosevic will be made to ``pay the price,'' which is not the same
thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised to attack only military targets and, for as long
as it thought it could crack the Serb military, that is what it
did.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is doing just what the Americans did in Iraq _
spreading the war to civilian targets, to bridges and electricity
stations and factories and refineries, under the spurious excuse
that these are also of use to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are _ just as roads and railway tracks and water
mains are of use to the military. And as we get more desperate,
they may well be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never an operation that was planned for only two or
three days,'' NATO's spokesman James Shea told us on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Really? So why were we not told this before we went to war? Why
were we not told of the possibility of weeks of air raids and the
wholesale abandonment of the Albanian civilian population of Kosovo
if Milosevic did not give in?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only now learn about the prospect of a ``long war,''
perhaps lasting four years?
</P>
<P>
   And why, for God's sake, did no one _ not President Bill
Clinton, not NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana, nor Robin
Cook, nor General Wesley Clark _ realize that bombing must be
supported by ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   How on earth did Clark come to believe that the Serbs would give
up so easily? Did he mistake the Yugoslav army for the Serb
militias of Bosnia? Did he think that bullies are always cowards
and will therefore give in? Did he not realize that only a real
threat of ground invasion might force Milosevic to agree to the
Rambouillet accords in time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, we have been told other lies: that it
would have been even worse if NATO had not bombed Serbia _ and that
we knew Milosevic had planned the total ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Kosovo Albanian population before we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the first statement _ from President Clinton himself _
is rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb paramilitaries butchering their way across Kosovo and
poised to drive out every last Albanian, it could not possibly be
worse. And if we knew that Milosevic had planned this, why did NATO
not provide fighting ground troops in those precious weeks
following the original Rambouillet conference?
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, our defense analysts have been hard at
work to explain the continued war. Not only is it intended to make
Milosevic ``pay the price'' for his brutality, but any faltering
now would damage the credibility of NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it would. Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone
to war to save the Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are
at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, NATO's 50th birthday was this weekend, marked by a
blazing oil refinery, an electricity station burning itself out in
northern Belgrade and hundred of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
freezing on the mountainsides of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised. We asked the Kurds and the Shia
Muslims of Iraq to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and, when
they did as they were told, we abandoned them to the torture
chambers of Iraq.

<P>
   This time, we asked the Kosovo Albanians to sign the peace
accords in Paris and praised the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Now they are on the run, we can do no more than bomb the
Serbs from the air. &QL;

<P>
   There was a telling moment last week when a senior RAF officer
stood up at NATO's regular briefing to tell journalists that the
KLA ``has not been defeated'' but was ``regrouping'' in order to
``take up the armed struggle'' once again.
</P>
<P>
   What is this nonsense? That a NATO officer should seek to
support the KLA in such a way proved two terrifying things: to the
Serbs, that the KLA was a fifth column (and thus worthy only of
execution) and, to us, that NATO now regards this ragtag bunch of
ill-disciplined ex-Marxists as its foot-soldiers in Kosovo. The
substitute army for the NATO soldiers who will not be sent into
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO briefings become ever more sinister. At each one, a new
and ever more ghoulish story is produced for journalists _ the mass
execution of intellectuals one day, the rape of young women the
next, the killing of fathers and sons in front of their families,
the setting up of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   These stories may well turn out to be true _ I suspect the truth
may be worse _ but the effect is pornography-by-press-conference,
with spokesman ``Jamie'' Shea acting as the East End club doorman
touting the evening's horror story and his RAF colleague playing
the role of manager, promising us that the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will until every last Kosovo Albanian has been driven
from his home, or until MI5 or the CIA engineer the secession of
Montenegro or the overthrow of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the promises continue: ``We shall attack his
murderous forces in Kosovo: we shall strike at the nerve center of
his decision-making machine'' (British Armed Forces Minister Doug
Henderson).
</P>
<P>
   NATO is showing ``unflinching resolve'' in the battle against
the ``unbelievably brutal actions of Milosevic's special police and
army'' (Air Marshal Sir John Day). &QL;

<P>
   Tony Blair is suggesting that the Serb leader may face a war
crimes indictment. Do they think Milosevic will be frightened by
all this?
</P>
<P>
   After his supporters killed and raped their way through far more
Muslims in Bosnia than they have in Kosovo, we treated him as a
peacemaker. He was invited to the Dayton conference, he was
regarded by Washington and by the Foreign Office as ``a force for
stability in the Balkans'' (as Saddam was in Iraq after he invaded
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was one of ``our'' dictators _ or at least a man with
whom we could do business.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has joined our list of ``beasts'' _ we remember
Saddam and Qaddafi although, oddly, Osama bin Laden has dropped off
our Satanic radar screens for the present.
</P>
<P>
   We believe Milosevic can be ``defanged'' or ``declawed,'' or
that we can, in the words of the Sun newspaper on the first day of
the war, ``Clobba Slobba.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, history is not like that. NATO thought that within three
days of its bombing campaign, it would have 200,000 Serbs on the
streets of Belgrade demanding Milosevic's removal. Instead, tens of
thousands of Serbs now gather on those streets for daily pop
concerts to demonstrate their hatred of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There are many words to encompass the events of the last two
weeks: brutality, vanity, arrogance. But above all, folly is the
word that comes to mind. Maybe we will find another persecuted
population to ``protect'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   They had better watch out. &QL;

ALBANIANS IDOLIZE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Some want to build a statue of him and put it
in the center of the capital. Others wish he could be their
president, or at least a kind of honorary president. His troubles
at home aside, Bill Clinton is very, very popular in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians have long been friendly toward the United States, a
country that many looked up to as a democratic model during
Albania's four decades of totalitarian rule by communist Enver
Hoxha, who died in 1985. Many Albanians have a family member who is
working in the United States and sending money home to their
relatives in one of Europe's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   But since the NATO bombing of Serbia, the popularity of the
United States _ and of Clinton in particular _ has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Next door in Serbia, people are burning American flags and
refusing entry to those with US passports. In Albania, US flags
appear to fly as commonly as Albanian ones _ on the backs of cars,
or the sides of city buses. Tirana and many small northern Albanian
towns have hotels and bars called ``Amerika.''
</P>
<P>
   At a pro-NATO rally a few days after the bombing of Yugoslavia
started, demonstrators carried signs painted with the US flag, and
saying, ``Clinton _ Protector or Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Albanian men at the rally argued about it. One middle-aged
man said Albania should construct a statue of Clinton shaking hands
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair; the other man, in his 60s,
vehemently disagreed. Clinton should have his own statue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A US passport has become the best calling card for a visitor to
Albania. If you're an American, you might get a hug, or the last
room in a booked hotel, or the best table in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without you, we would all be dying,'' said a travel agent,
arranging a trip for an American journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``America _ mire,'' said a taxi driver using the Albanian word
for ``good.'' ``Clinton? super mire!'' he said, gesturing
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity here has even surpased that of Bob Dole, a
longtime follower of Balkans politics and friend to the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sympathetic to Bob Dole,'' said a high-ranking member
of the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``But Clinton _ he is number one!''
</P>
<P>
   Could Clinton win a presidential campaign in Albania?
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't even have to run,'' said a KLA member.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of admitting the truth about the current Kosovo
conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has all gone
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, was supposed to stand by the Rambouillet peace
accords, force Slobodan Milosevic to accept limited autonomy for
Kosovo and end the slaughter and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Kosovo
Albanians. Then NATO troops were to move into Kosovo in order to
protect the Muslim Albanian and Serb populations.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened? Rambouillet is in ashes. Serbia is
refusing to budge after 13 days and nights of air raids. Those we
pledged to protect are being driven from their homes in the
greatest act of depopulation in Europe since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of admitting the truth, our leaders consistently
lie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were told that the Serb leader would be forced to
end his ``ethnic cleansing.'' The opposite has happened and now we
are told _ by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, no less _ that
Milosevic will be made to ``pay the price,'' which is not the same
thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised to attack only military targets and, for as long
as it thought it could crack the Serb military, that is what it
did.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is doing just what the Americans did in Iraq _
spreading the war to civilian targets, to bridges and electricity
stations and factories and refineries, under the spurious excuse
that these are also of use to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are _ just as roads and railway tracks and water
mains are of use to the military. And as we get more desperate,
they may well be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never an operation that was planned for only two or
three days,'' NATO's spokesman James Shea told us on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Really? So why were we not told this before we went to war? Why
were we not told of the possibility of weeks of air raids and the
wholesale abandonment of the Albanian civilian population of Kosovo
if Milosevic did not give in?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only now learn about the prospect of a ``long war,''
perhaps lasting four years?
</P>
<P>
   And why, for God's sake, did no one _ not President Bill
Clinton, not NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana, nor Robin
Cook, nor General Wesley Clark _ realize that bombing must be
supported by ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   How on earth did Clark come to believe that the Serbs would give
up so easily? Did he mistake the Yugoslav army for the Serb
militias of Bosnia? Did he think that bullies are always cowards
and will therefore give in? Did he not realize that only a real
threat of ground invasion might force Milosevic to agree to the
Rambouillet accords in time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, we have been told other lies: that it
would have been even worse if NATO had not bombed Serbia _ and that
we knew Milosevic had planned the total ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Kosovo Albanian population before we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the first statement _ from President Clinton himself _
is rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb paramilitaries butchering their way across Kosovo and
poised to drive out every last Albanian, it could not possibly be
worse. And if we knew that Milosevic had planned this, why did NATO
not provide fighting ground troops in those precious weeks
following the original Rambouillet conference?
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, our defense analysts have been hard at
work to explain the continued war. Not only is it intended to make
Milosevic ``pay the price'' for his brutality, but any faltering
now would damage the credibility of NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it would. Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone
to war to save the Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are
at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, NATO's 50th birthday was this weekend, marked by a
blazing oil refinery, an electricity station burning itself out in
northern Belgrade and hundred of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
freezing on the mountainsides of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised. We asked the Kurds and the Shia
Muslims of Iraq to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and, when
they did as they were told, we abandoned them to the torture
chambers of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This time, we asked the Kosovo Albanians to sign the peace
accords in Paris and praised the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Now they are on the run, we can do no more than bomb the
Serbs from the air. &QL;

stood up at NATO's regular briefing to tell journalists that the
KLA ``has not been defeated'' but was ``regrouping'' in order to

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Never have the relative costs of military hardware and
humanitarian aid been more graphically illustrated than in
Yugoslavia, where we spend billions of dollars to bomb the Serbs
but balk at finding a fraction of that to speed relief to the
thousands of Albanians who struggle for survival in their escape
from benighted Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While we fly B-1 bombers several thousand miles across the
Atlantic, we fail to sort out bureaucracy to let our soldiers move
rations five miles across a Balkan hillside to save the starving.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Europe _ that civilized territory _ watches wretched,
dirty and hopeless refugees fight for a loaf of bread even as eight
million dollars' worth of cruise missiles explode on nearby
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is indeed degrading the military resources of President
Slobodan Milosevic, but our failure adequately to support the
refugees degrades and demeans us all.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, in London, in Brussels, there is increasing
evidence of confusion at the heart of this military project;
confusion about the ultimate war aim; confusion about the
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   No one, it is now clear, anticipated a refugee problem on the
scale that has emerged, a humanitarian disaster undreamt of in
Europe since the end of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, fears about the fate of three American prisoners
of war threaten to eclipse concern about two million Kosovan
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels the EU politicians take their Easter break. In
London politicians repeat the necessity of action. But action to
achieve what?
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Independent of London last February, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ``One thing is certain: I will not
agree to deploy British troops into Kosovo itself without a clear
mission and clear objectives based on a political settlement agreed
by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk if not of a ground offensive _ though many
military observers believe that only a ground offensive can achieve
the aims of NATO _ then of NATO troops forming a protective cordon
to guard refugees in safe enclaves close to the Kosovan borders.
</P>
<P>
   The tactical debate goes on and the dispossessed will die in
front of us; die of cold, die of hunger, die of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter must be found now for those who have fled. Albania is
well disposed towards its own but has little enough to feed them;
Montenegro fears its own revolution; Macedonia will let in only
those refugees that it is sure will leave again.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the United Nations have begun talks with Macedonia
about funding temporary refugee camps in that country. But they
must not think that they have thus discharged their
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   They must back such support by guaranteeing a permanent home for
those refugees for whom there may be no future in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Populist headlines of recent months have complained of floods of
east European immigrants. Britain is always said to be a soft
touch. In reality, Germany has taken around a hundred times more
refugees from former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the ``flood'' to Britain was 7,000 Kosovars (a couple
of hours' worth of arrivals in Albania or Macedonia in recent days)
who applied to stay in Britain, 935 of whom were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   If the current rules had been applied in the 1930s, it would
have been well nigh impossible for Jews to be allowed into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Mike O'Brien, Britain's immigration minister, has acknowledged
that it is only ``with great difficulty'' that a Kosovar can lodge
a request to be a refugee in this country, let alone have it
granted.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly preferable for Kosovars to be able to stay in
the region if there is any chance that they will return to their
homes in the near future. But we cannot hide behind this
cozy-sounding rhetoric in order to do nothing now.
</P>
<P>
   If we care enough about Albanians' suffering to launch a
European war to save them, then there can be no excuse for failing
to shoulder responsibility for the suffering that war has helped to
bring about.
</P>
<P>
   One of the frightening euphemisms of modern warfare, brought
into vogue in the Gulf War, is ``collateral damage.'' The refugees
from Kosovo are the collateral damage of this NATO action, and we
must do whatever we can to support them. &QL;

   Never have the relative costs of military hardware and
humanitarian aid been more graphically illustrated than in
Yugoslavia, where we spend billions of dollars to bomb the Serbs
but balk at finding a fraction of that to speed relief to the
thousands of Albanians who struggle for survival in their escape
from benighted Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While we fly B-1 bombers several thousand miles across the
Atlantic, we fail to sort out bureaucracy to let our soldiers move
rations five miles across a Balkan hillside to save the starving.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Europe _ that civilized territory _ watches wretched,
dirty and hopeless refugees fight for a loaf of bread even as eight
million dollars' worth of cruise missiles explode on nearby
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is indeed degrading the military resources of President
Slobodan Milosevic, but our failure adequately to support the
refugees degrades and demeans us all.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, in London, in Brussels, there is increasing
evidence of confusion at the heart of this military project;
confusion about the ultimate war aim; confusion about the
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   No one, it is now clear, anticipated a refugee problem on the
scale that has emerged, a humanitarian disaster undreamt of in
Europe since the end of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, fears about the fate of three American prisoners
of war threaten to eclipse concern about two million Kosovan
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels the EU politicians take their Easter break. In
London politicians repeat the necessity of action. But action to
achieve what?
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Independent of London last February, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ``One thing is certain: I will not
agree to deploy British troops into Kosovo itself without a clear
mission and clear objectives based on a political settlement agreed
by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk if not of a ground offensive _ though many
military observers believe that only a ground offensive can achieve
the aims of NATO _ then of NATO troops forming a protective cordon
to guard refugees in safe enclaves close to the Kosovan borders.
</P>
<P>
   The tactical debate goes on and the dispossessed will die in
front of us; die of cold, die of hunger, die of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter must be found now for those who have fled. Albania is
well disposed towards its own but has little enough to feed them;
Montenegro fears its own revolution; Macedonia will let in only
those refugees that it is sure will leave again.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the United Nations have begun talks with Macedonia
about funding temporary refugee camps in that country. But they
must not think that they have thus discharged their
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   They must back such support by guaranteeing a permanent home for
those refugees for whom there may be no future in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Populist headlines of recent months have complained of floods of
east European immigrants. Britain is always said to be a soft
touch. In reality, Germany has taken around a hundred times more
refugees from former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the ``flood'' to Britain was 7,000 Kosovars (a couple
of hours' worth of arrivals in Albania or Macedonia in recent days)
who applied to stay in Britain, 935 of whom were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   If the current rules had been applied in the 1930s, it would
have been well nigh impossible for Jews to be allowed into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Mike O'Brien, Britain's immigration minister, has acknowledged
that it is only ``with great difficulty'' that a Kosovar can lodge
a request to be a refugee in this country, let alone have it
granted.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly preferable for Kosovars to be able to stay in
the region if there is any chance that they will return to their
homes in the near future. But we cannot hide behind this
cozy-sounding rhetoric in order to do nothing now.
</P>
<P>
   If we care enough about Albanians' suffering to launch a
European war to save them, then there can be no excuse for failing
to shoulder responsibility for the suffering that war has helped to
bring about.
</P>
<P>
   One of the frightening euphemisms of modern warfare, brought
into vogue in the Gulf War, is ``collateral damage.'' The refugees
from Kosovo are the collateral damage of this NATO action, and we
must do whatever we can to support them. &QL;

   We pampered Westerners are all very martial as long as we are
only dropping ordnance from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The air is thick with the stink of attitudinizing. Every
columnist, reporter, letter-writer, pub bore and backbencher knows
what should have been done, and what ought to be done now.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense the determination to be on the right side of
history when you hear them utter sentences beginning with words
like ``it was quite obvious from the beginning that...''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, disgracefully, I went back over past pieces that
I have written about Kosovo, hoping that they would show what a
prescient and clever fellow I am, and that they would defend me
from the various charges that those opposed to intervention now
level at those who support it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I disgust myself.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe about Kosovo _ that we had little alternative but
to intervene, and that we should now begin to deploy an army
charged with winning it back for its dispossessed people _ is not
the consequence of deep strategic and military insight. It is,
rather, a product of conscience allied to a deep worry about what
would happen elsewhere were we to fail this test.
</P>
<P>
   People on either side of this argument, who proclaim a clear and
almost infallible understanding of cause and effect in the Balkans,
are seeking to mobilize opinion rather than telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to be vindicated by events is particularly strong in
those currently in opposition in Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, I heard an interview with the Tory
Party chairman Michael Ancram in which he more or less said that
his support for NATO action was dependent upon its eventual
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the Republican front-runner for the 2000
presidential elections, George W Bush, answered the question about
action with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is: is it good for America?'' said the man from
Texas. ``Right now, as governor, I'm going to figure out how to get
a tax-cut through.''
</P>
<P>
   So if it turns out to be a success, then they are in favor of
it. If it is a catastrophe, then the weedy, liberal focus-groupies
in power in Washington and London will face the justified wrath of
the people.
</P>
<P>
   So far there has been surprisingly little wrath. In Germany,
opinion polls show more than 60 percent in favor of the air
strikes, while in France, there is 58 percent support, including
for the possible use of NATO ground troops. Here in Britain, there
is a big majority in favor of bombing, and a smaller one that
agrees to the use of the army.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic and his colleagues in Belgrade, however, may
well believe that such support is soft. We pampered Westerners are
all very martial as long as we're not taking any casualties and are
dropping ordnance from the sky (he may well tell his generals), but
like Corporal Jones's fuzzy-wuzzies, we don't like it up us, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   And Slobodan Milosevic has to look no further than the gung-ho
British newspaper, The Sun, for some proof. Slapped all over
Monday's page one was the banner headline: ``Don't send our troops
off to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us forget all this nonsense about how The Sun rules the
world. Its threat to Tony Blair to withdraw its support from the
war effort if ground troops were to be deployed should be treated
with total contempt. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the Press Gazette awards, the editor of The Sun
got so miffed that he sat for quite some time on the floor, unaware
that he had fallen off his chair. Beaverbrook he ain't.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that the argument should not be taken
seriously. Many soldiers' families read The Sun, I imagine. And
common sense suggests that, should we lose dozens of casualties in
a Balkans war, then that bit of opinion in Britain that hasn't
cared much either way so far may decide that this was never our
fight anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Central to The Sun's objection to the risking of British lives
in Kosovo is its perception of those who are not quite so
squeamish. ``Too many armchair generals and media commentators are
calling for force on the ground,'' it said, suggesting, somewhat
surreally: ``Maybe they should go and see the movie `Saving Private
Ryan' to see what a ground war is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Or El Cid, perhaps? This reproof to the supporters of action is
now one that is almost universally used.
</P>
<P>
   In its editorial, the New Statesman states: ``Whether those who
advocate a ground offensive have relatives in the services _ or
whether they would countenance the conscription that might be
required to sustain a long conflict _ is unknown. But the world has
never been short of those willing to send other people's sons to
war.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alan Watkins in The Independent's Sunday sister paper
observes: ``Those with some knowledge of warfare are members of the
Peace Party, whereas the War Party is composed largely of those who
have not even heard a popgun fired in anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't find it necessary to slap my weapon on the table
and compare it for size with that of Alan Watkins and the editors
of The New Statesman and The Sun, or anyone else for that matter.
Their jibes are cheap and obvious. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has been no glorification of war amongst those who have
called for action _ quite the opposite. Those in power in the U.S.,
Britain, Germany, France and Italy are not demagogues or right-wing
populists, but people who grew up opposing the war in Vietnam and
distrusting talk of ``collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one point that the antis make that must be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Is this cause, the cause of the Kosovar Albanians, a cause that
is worth suffering for? What would I myself be prepared to
sacrifice in order to stop the massacres and to strike an immense
blow against the politics of racial and ethnic nationalism?
</P>
<P>
   Would I fight, or (more realistically) would I countenance the
possibility that members of my family might die? Would I be
prepared to explain to the mother of a dead soldier why her son had
been killed? Would I accept my children's education being
disrupted, my comfortable lifestyle being altered?
</P>
<P>
   I think so. There are, indeed, some unlikely warmongers around
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, a Green member of the German government, spoke
for a generation of political activists this week. ``When you are
confronted by genocide and mass human suffering,'' he said, ``you
cannot sit with your hands folded and ignore the killing of
innocent civilians. There are certain human values more important
than pacifism.''
</P>
<P>
   So yes, for this cause, if the government asked me to, I'd do
what was necessary without complaining a lot. I can't live with too
much self-disgust. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Instead of admitting the truth about the current
Kosovo conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has
all gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone to war to save the
Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>

A WEEKEND AT THE KENNEDY COMPOUND: $100,000 TO THE DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just as memories began to fade of overnight stays
in the Lincoln bedroom and free rides on Air Force One, an alluring
new perk has emerged for the most generous Democratic campaign
contributors: a weekend getaway to the historic Kennedy compound in
Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new leadership of Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of
Rhode Island, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is
poised to invite $100,000 donors to a premier retreat in September
at his family's treasured vacation spot.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is part of Kennedy's quest to raise $50 million to
help Democrats take back the House in 2000, after six years of
Republican control. Although no details were released of the
weekend activities, contributors presumably will have access to the
full range of Kennedy lore, from the home where President John F.
Kennedy monitored the results of the 1960 election, to the lawn
where Robert F. Kennedy played touch football, to the boat that
Senator Edward M. Kennedy continues to sail.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal to $100,000 donors, which also features retreats in
Newport, R.I., Pebble Beach, Calif., and a ``spring training
weekend'' in West Palm Beach, Fla., marks the DCCC's first special
incentive program aimed at major contributors. The program, dubbed
``Team 2000,'' is modeled after fund-raising initiatives by
political groups aligned with both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Team 2000 campaign is ``specifically designed to work with
the leading Democratic supporters nationwide and strategically plan
how we, as a party, achieve our goals,'' Kennedy wrote in a
brochure that was co-signed by the House Democratic leader, Richard
A. Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   For $100,000, donors receive ``annual benefits'' that include
two dinners in Washington with Gephardt, Kennedy and other House
Democratic leaders. The list of retreats with Gephardt and Kennedy
also features a November getaway to Puerto Rico and a January ski
trip to Telluride, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Smith, a spokesman for Kennedy and the DCCC, said the
Kennedy family has held previous fund-raising events at the family
compound on Cape Cod. But there appeared to be little precedent, if
any, for using the location for such a major, national donor drive.
The program's emergence was first reported in Monday's edition of
Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said it was too early to determine what kind of activities
will be offered at the Kennedy compound for the contributors. But
chances are slim they will spend the night in the homes where four
generations of Kennedys have dwelled. ``People typically stay at
hotels in Hyannis,'' Smith said of contributors who have previously
visited the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for overhauling the campaign finance system seized on
the promotion as evidence of the need for change, particularly for
abolishing soft money, the kind of large, unregulated donations
that the DCCC and other political groups are seeking with such
incentive programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect illustration of the evils of the soft money
system,'' said Don Simon, executive director of Common Cause.
``What you have here is a blatant sale of access in exchange for
huge soft money contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have defended the practice by citing the major
disadvantage they would face if they stopped pursuing soft money
dollars while their opponents continued to rake it in by the
millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the everybody-does-it defense, which is a pretty weak
justification,'' Simon said. ``It shows the pervasiveness of this
kind of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee predictably
criticized their Democratic counterpart for thinking that ``selling
the Kennedy compound can fill the vacuum of ideas that currently
bankrupts their party.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats countered that Republicans have consisently
blocked efforts to overhaul the campaign finance system, while the
House Republican reelection committee has massively outspent the
Democratic team in the last two elections, by a total of $190
million to $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick's goal is to narrow that margin as much as possible,''
Smith said. He described the Hyannis Port retreat and other Team
2000 incentives as ``one element of how we can get there.''

   BELGRADE _ Instead of admitting the truth about the current
Kosovo conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has
all gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone to war to save the
Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.

   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the

 &HT;    HUD CHASTISED FOR EMPOWERMENT ZONES
 &HT;    EDS: Deletes 8th graf and subs comment from HUD spokesman.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Months after a federal audit criticized Atlanta and
three other cities for major flaws in their ``empowerment zones,''
an internal report says the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development failed to exert ``adequate controls'' over the program.
</P>
<P>
   HUD has yet to assess 1997 findings of misspent dollars in the
program, said an audit issued last week by the department's
inspector general. The concept of empowerment zones, which use
grants and tax breaks to boost the economies of low-income
neighborhoods, has become one of the most visible anti-poverty
initiatives of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton late last year ordered an expansion of the
five-year-old program to 15 additional urban neighborhoods and five
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general report said that the empowerment zone
staff was so ``busy planning for the second round of Zone
designations'' that HUD declined to assess problems at the four
earlier sites.
</P>
<P>
   An audit released last fall concluded that four cities were
making ``little or no progress'' in carrying out their strategic
plans for empowerment zones, or that their programs did not always
benefit the targeted residents.
</P>
<P>
   That report recommended that the Atlanta program repay $1.1
million in grants for activities such as relocating businesses from
other locations in the city. Chicago, Detroit and Philadelphia also
have been asked to return some of their funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new report called on HUD to review progress of the four
cities. ``If the Cities are found not making the necessary
progress, then HUD should issue warning letters to the Cities based
upon the lack of progress as required,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman Peter Ragone said late Monday: ``We strongly
disagree with the IG's allegations of misspending which, even by
their own admission amounts to less than one percent of funding in
the four empowerment zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, housing officials said they have contacted the four
cities, offering reassurances that if the cities can justify the
spending, they will not have to return the funds.

   KUKES, Albania _ Refugees pouring into Albania from Kosovo are
providing detailed firsthand accounts of mass killings and burned
corpses in villages where Serbs were forcing out ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees at widely scattered places and times have given
overlapping accounts to foreign journalists and relief workers of
several mass killings, including a massacre on March 26 of about
100 people gathered together in the adjacent villages of Velika
Krusa and Mala Krusa, known to Albanians as Kruse-E-Vogel and
Kruse-E-Mahde. The refugees said that the victims had been killed
with automatic weapons and that some bodies were later burned.
</P>
<P>
   The dead will probably number at least in the ``high hundreds,''
said Eugene O'Sullivan, chief of the observer team from the
Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe that is
monitoring the refugee crisis at the border.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of killing have been so frequent, and so repetitive
in their detail, he said, that the European organization has
brought in 60 specially trained investigators to interview refugees
and keep records for possible war-crimes indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee flow continued unabated Monday, with the long
miserable lines of sobbing people stretching some 40 miles back
into Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m. Monday, 19,246 people had crossed the border, in
addition to the 188,036 who had passed over the Morini crossing as
of Sunday. Some had been walking for seven days from the area of
Mitrovica, north of the empty capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, a badly burned 10-year-old boy, Dren
Caka, crossed the border and was being treated at the Medecins du
Monde tent. He said he had been hiding with his family and others
in the basement of their home in the city of Djakovica when the
Serbs came in and methodically shot several people in the head,
then set the building on fire.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about the refugees is that they are largely
women, children and old men. The young men, they say, are either
hiding in the mountains or have been separated out by the Serbs and
taken away to some unknown fate.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no way independently to verify the accounts of
killings _ foreign journalists have been expelled from Kosovo _
their similarity suggested that they were credible. Earlier Serbian
efforts to remove Muslims from parts of Bosnia were accompanied by
numerous massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep hearing the same story over and over from
different sources, you have to lend some credence,'' said Dorian
Vienneau, a member of the OSCE observer team. ``The sheer volume of
reports leaves me to believe this is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishar Juareka said that in the village of Balenica, ``They
surrounded us. They killed some and captured some and took them
away. They killed four children because their families did not have
money to give to the police. We have seen the bodies of the
children. They killed them with knives not guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Two bombs were dropped on the village of Negovac, and it was
shelled as well, said Skender Bici, 42. ``There were at least 25
people killed from the houses that were destroyed,'' he said.
``They threw gasoline over the bodies and burned them. There were
other people killed but we only know what we saw in our district.
</P>
<P>
   Afrim Elshani, 32, who said who took four days to drive the 21
miles to the border from Suva Rica said that last week the police
came and started to shoot people. ``I know of 10 people who were
killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of accounts have described a massacre in Kruse-E-Vogel
and Kruse-E-Madhe which lie south of the major town of Orahavac.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC has received an amateur videotape said to be have been
made in Kruse-E-Madhe, running 1 minute and 42 seconds, which shows
the crumpled bodies of several young men lying on the ground who
appear to have been shot in the head or throat. Two of the bodies
were charred and burned.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-year-old woman, Naxhije Zymi, who said 10 of her brothers
had been killed, gave this account of what had happened in
Kruse-E-Vogel:
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday, the police came early in the morning. They executed
almost 100 people. They killed them all, men, women and children.
They set a fire and threw the bodies in the fire and put car tires
on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Her account was similar to others given to foreign reporters and
OSCE observers. These accounts describe people being gathered near
a mosque and being mowed down by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, Enver Muharremi, told OSCE observers that in
Kruse-E-Vogel he had seen a truck carrying about 20 bodies driven
to a nearby river where the bodies were dumped on a bank then set
on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Shefret Begaj, 52, who was herded past Kruse-E-Vogel with a
group of villagers who had been gathered in Balenica, said he saw
the Serbs in Kruse-E-Vogel digging what appeared to be a big grave
with a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the mass killings, the OSCE records suggest, occurred a
week ago Friday as the Serbian drive was just beginning, possibly
in an effort to sow terror. In Sopine, in the Suharke district, the
observer reports say, about 50 policemen arrived that day and
killed 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   Other killings reported seem more random, with people shooting
individuals on the street. The accounts suggest that private armies
were particularly active in the streets of Djakovica, killing large
numbers of young men there.
</P>
<P>
   In one neighborhood of Djakovica, a group of 6 Serbs wearing
masks separated the men from the women and children, killed 11
people, and burned 50 shops and about 35 houses, said Mehdi
Halilaj, 27. They left the 11 bodies in the street to frighten
others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over the stories spilled out of the refugees,
impossible to verify, but each packed with specific detail. Islam
Ponik, 50, for example, said that he had seen 15 people, most of
them from the Rexhepi family, burned alive in the village of
Celina. Their shirts were stripped off, he said, gasoline was
thrown on them and they were set on fire. Hajrullah Kabashi, 36,
from the village of Ternse, said Serbs killed as many as 47 people
who had tried to stay in their houses, including two of the town's
teachers, Refki Rexhaj and Lulije Gashi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a story,'' said O'Sullivan, the OSCE observer
chief.
</P>
<P>
   A clear, well-organized pattern of driving the refugees out is
apparent from the accounts of their flight. People from smaller
villages and outlying hamlets are herded into larger central towns,
which become collection points, surrounded by infantry. Often they
are shelled with tanks, mortars and Katyusha rockets along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they are put in convoys of farm tractors or cars,
sometimes flying white rags, or forced on foot to the border
crossing point near here with police cars or tanks at their back.
Along the way they are systematically robbed of foreign currency,
jewelry and the better cars, and their identity documents and
license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees said the violence and humiliation did not end when
they had been expelled from their homes but followed them on their
journeys. Older men wearing the traditional white conical hat of
the mountain Albanians are beaten about the head, they said, and
people were forced to make the three-fingered Serbian sign or chant
``Serbia, Serbia.'' According to another account, two girls were
pulled out of their car at the Serbian border checkpoint the other
night and raped. And others said that Serbs along the way are
plunging long knives into the tires of the refugees' tractors and
cars, flattening them and making the journey even slower and more
painful.

PATRIOTIC HOLIDAY SIGNALS RETREAT FOR CALIFORNIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A solemn observance of the country's war dead?
</P>
<P>
   Or the clarion call of summer, an opportune time to make a mad
dash out of town and do something fun?
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of Memorial Day certainly has blurred in recent
years _ perhaps since 1971, when Congress moved it from May 30 to
the last Monday in May, thus watering down the holiday by affixing
the word ``weekend'' to it.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be possible to fuse the two points: The sacrifice
of service men and women for more than 100 years has helped create
a society in which people enjoy themselves nearly without
constraint.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on the last weekend in May.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there is no shortage of getaway opportunities for
those who live in Los Angeles, and now is probably a good time to
start planning. Beyond such obvious magnets as ocean, mountain,
desert ... and the gaming tables of Las Vegas and Laughlin, there
is a wide and somewhat quirky array of entertainment to be had at
organized festivals in California.
</P>
<P>
   Over those three days in May, depending on preference, travelers
may revel in merengue, mules, jazz, beer, rodeo and squid, among
other disparate delights.
</P>
<P>
   Just try not to stampede through any military cemeteries on your
way out of town. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ETHNIC GORGING
</P>
<P>
   There are 31 permanent cottages, representing different
countries, all clustered in a village in San Diego's Balboa Park.
And on May 30, their representatives will be bustling over stoves
and grills, preparing food from their homelands and hoping that
your nose will guide you to their doors.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 20th annual Ethnic Food Fair at the House of Pacific
Relations International Cottages in the park. There is no admission
charge to the village, which will be serving up this eclectic
feast, along with various types of entertainment on a stage,
between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The cottages are not allowed to charge more than $4 per plate of
food, said Louisa Lawson, who has been involved with the House of
Pacific Relations for 17 years. ``To put it in a nutshell,'' she
added, ``you can eat your way around the world for $20, if you want
to eat that much. You can eat German sausage, English whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   That last crack was delivered tongue-in-cheek: Lawson is first
vice president of the House of England.
</P>
<P>
   Spam-and-kidney pie, anyone?

CHALK ART
</P>
<P>
   It has progressed considerably since your childhood days of
drawing hopscotch courts in front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate chalk drawings on concrete will be celebrated as fine
art at the I Madonnari Street Painting Festival in front of the
Santa Barbara Mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject matter of the drawings ranges from classical
religious imagery to original works,'' organizer Kathy Koury said
of the free festival, which will be conducted all three days of
Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a broad range of artistic talent, too _ from
children to accomplished professionals. The event, in its 13th
year, is put on by the Children's Creative Project, a nonprofit
education program of the Santa Barbara County Education Office.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 artists are expected, producing 150 to 200 drawings
that will range in size from 4 by 6 feet to one 12-by-15-foot
creation. Another 25,000 people will likely be on hand to observe
the work and sample the cuisine and entertainment at a sprawling
Italian market on the mission lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Each evening at 6, a free concert will be held in the mission
church, and, according to Koury, it will be as refined as the
sidewalk art: opera, string quartet, choral ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Directions: 101 north, exit Mission Street, east to Laguna
Street, left to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   (If your Memorial Day plans can't accommodate this, be advised
that another I Madonnari festival will be held April 24-25 in front
of the San Luis Obispo Mission.)

<P>
   CELEBRATING STUBBORNNESS
</P>
<P>
   In Bishop, tucked into the eastern foothills of the Sierra
Nevada, Mule Days have been popular since they were established in
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50,000 people are expected this year for the three-day
event, which will feature hundreds of mules competing in more than
100 events.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be concerts, a western dance, a barbecue _ and
an all-mule-power parade; no motorized contraptions of any kind
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Organizer Carolyn Moore said that one of the most popular events
is the pack scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: Fourteen pack teams, featuring six mules per team,
assemble at the center of an arena. The packers remove all
supplies, saddles and tack from their animals and stack it on the
ground. Then the mules are shooed about the arena floor until
they're a hopeless jumble. At a signal, the packers must find their
six mules, herd them back to their supplies, and pack the animals.
First team to finish wins.

TENTACLE TREATS
</P>
<P>
   This ocean creature may not look particularly appetizing, but
give the cooks at the Great Monterey Squid Festival a chance to
impress you with their inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be squid cooked 30 different ways,'' festival
manager Bob Massaro said of the event, which will be held Saturday
and Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. ``It will be battered, fried,
barbecued.'' Massaro paused, perhaps accustomed to not being
persuasive on the point. ``There will be other kinds of food,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival, in its 15th year, was launched to bring attention
to the cephalopod mollusk, a major catch in Monterey Bay. Held at
the Monterey Fairgrounds, it will also have a strong educational
thrust with young visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate students from the Moss Landing Marine Lab, an arm of
Stanford University, will present a ``touch tank'' for young
guests. The grad students will dive for marine specimens each
morning, present them in the tank during the day, then return them
to the bay at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the kids won't be able to touch, oddly enough,
are squid,'' Massaro said, ``because they squirt ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, the ultimate squid movie, ``20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea,'' loosely based on the Jules Verne novel, was
screened at the first few festivals, but it was ditched when some
vendors complained that it was hurting their food sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even the name, Massaro said, ``conjures up all kinds of things,
from pleasant to squeamish. One of the most popular booths year
after year is one that sells deep-fried squid heads. They call them
heads, but they're actually tentacles. Fry them right up. Really
delicious.'' &QL;

ROPE, THROW, BRAND 'EM
</P>
<P>
   Calf roping, bull riding, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding
and barrel racing will be among the events at the Frontier Days
Rodeo in Temecula, north and inland of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy poetry and western music will also be presented at the
three-day weekend event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't rain or snow, it's normally a good response,''
said John Sterling, general manager of the Temecula Town
Association, which has been staging the rodeo for three years.
``Our bleachers hold 2,600, and they're pretty much full for each
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition, a sanctioned event of the Professional Rodeo
Cowboys Association, will be held Saturday (2 and 7 p.m.) and
Sunday (2 p.m.) at the Northwest Sports Complex near the corner of
Winchester and Diaz roads. Matinee admission is priced at $8, the
Saturday evening show at $10; children under 4 are free.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy poetry and western music will be presented Friday
evening at the Musicians' Workshop in Temecula's Old Town district.

BLUE NOTES
</P>
<P>
   After Duke Ellington's band recorded ``Flamingo'' in the 1940s,
it went on to sell 13 million copies. Herb Jeffries was the band's
vocalist on that record, and he'll be one of the featured
performers at the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee over four days (May
28-31) of Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The event celebrated its 25th anniversary last year, and it
continues to be enormously popular. Roger Krum, director of the
Sacramento Jazz Society, said this year's festival will feature 125
bands, some hailing from lands as distant as Europe, Asia and
Australia. An estimated 100,000 fans will be on hand to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   Performances will be held on 25 stages in five different areas
of the city; a free shuttle bus will connect them.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is not a competition. Jazz is simply presented as a
celebration of the popular music form. In addition to Jeffries, the
event will also feature John and Donald Mills of the Mills
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It will not, however, be offered in true purity. Swing dancing,
because of its burgeoning popularly, will be a prominent part of
the program, too.

</P>
<P>
   All will be available for tasting at Carnivale, a dreadfully
belated Mardi Gras celebration for which San Francisco, as usual
marching to a drummer only it can hear, makes no apology
whatsoever. ``It's too cold in San Francisco (to celebrate Mardi
Gras on schedule, 40 days before Easter); usually it's raining. So
we do it Memorial Day weekend,'' said Patricia Aguayo, executive
director of the Mission Economic Cultural Association, which puts
on the event.
</P>
<P>
   The May 30 festival, celebrating its 20th anniversary, will
feature a parade, food, dancing (including a samba contest), and
that wide variety of musical expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different than (the Mardi Gras in) New Orleans,'' Aguayo
said, ``because it's more reflective of the community here. We are
a community of Latinos from all over the world. This is very
exotic. It gives people an opportunity to express themselves any
way they wish. The costumes are just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade, which will start at 10 a.m., will thread from 24th
and Bryant to 24th and Mission, and from there to Mission and 14th.
A post-parade festival will be held from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on
Harrison Street between 16th and 22nd.

OFFERMAN DEBUT RATES AN .800 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Anybody laughing at the Sox for signing Jose
Offerman now?
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette was universally mocked for
giving Offerman a four-year, $26 million contract last winter. Even
Samuel L. Jackson took a shot on the ESPY Awards telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, playing against his former team, Offerman had four hits
in five trips _ a triple, a double, and two singles. He also stole
a base and scored two runs from the leadoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost enough to make you say, ``Mo Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty good, wasn't it,'' said Duquette, eschewing an
opportunity to be an I-Told-You-So. ``Jose's made himself a good
hitter. He's become much more patient. A couple of times ... he
fell behind, 0-and-2, but he was patient and came back and got
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first four-hit Opening Day by a Red Sox player since
Mike Greenwell in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman was booed loudly by the KC crowd. Apparently some felt
he didn't hustle here. Others may resent seeing him leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans was booing me, I really don't know why,'' said
Offerman. ``I played here three years and I always played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette has been ridiculed for saying that Offerman could
replace Mo Vaughn's ``on-base capability.'' Now, Offerman's batting
average is .800. So is his on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited today,'' he said. ``For us to win and for me to
get four hits, that is good.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring Offerman hit .257 with four homers, 16 RBIs, and no
stolen bases in three attempts. He played second base and first
base and appeared shaky at both positions. So the Sox have made him
a leadoff DH.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman christened the Red Sox season just after 3 p.m. (EST).
He came to the plate and was roundly booed by the polite
Midwesterners.
</P>
<P>
   He shut up the locals when he cracked a 2-and-2 pitch into
left-center for a leadoff double. Somewhere in Kauffman Stadium,
Duquette (who lasted the whole nine innings this year) had to be
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman was stranded as Kevin Appier retired Darren Lewis, John
Valentin, and Nomar Garciaparra on two easy flies and a ground out.
</P>
<P>
   There were still boos when Offerman came to the plate with one
out in the third, and he hit the first pitch on a line to right for
a single. Then he stole second base (Offerman had 45 thefts last
year; the Sox leader was Lewis with 29, and Mo had zero). Offerman
rode home on Valentin's 430-foot homer to straightaway center.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to the plate against Appier in the fifth, Offerman
ran the count to 3-and-2, then flied to right.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Offerman led with a single to left off Don
Wengert. In the ninth, he tripled to left-center. Offerman led the
majors with 13 triples last year; no Sox player hit more than
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans had a nice little preview of what he's gonna do,''
said Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman made no promises. But he knows this will help get the
Boston fans off his back about Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are two different players,'' he said, again. ``It's hard to
replace Mo. It's hard for me to do what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Jose. Boston fans will settle for an .800 batting
average any day.

US SEEKS SHELTER FOR 20,000 REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department scrambled Monday to give as
many as 20,000 Kosovar refugees emergency shelter on American
military bases from Guam to Guantanamo Bay, a humanitarian triage
that aid experts said was unprecedented in both its size and
mission.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other administration officials stressed
that the relocation of ethnic Albanians, who have fled in terror in
recent days from their homes, was a temporary relief measure and
would cease as soon as it was safe for the refugees to return to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees belong in their own homes on their own land,''
the president said Monday as he described the broad outlines of
``Operation Sustain Hope.'' ``Our immediate goal is to provide
relief. Our long-term goal is to give them their right to return.''
</P>
<P>
   But aside from pledging to do their share to ease the refugee
flood inundating Kosovo's neighbors, US officials offered few
details on how they intended to carry out the huge airlift
operation. The only thing that seemed clear was that no Kosovar
refugees were headed immediately to the American mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the most likely destination was the US
naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where some 7,000 Haitians and
Cubans were encamped at the height of boatlift activities in the
early 1990s. Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, a US island territory
3,800 miles west of Hawaii, is a second possibility. In 1996 and
1997 some 7,000 Kurdish refugees from Iraq were temporarily housed
there before being resettled in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesmen at Guam and Guantanamo said neither base was
large enough to accommodate 20,000 refugees, and it could take many
days to get the personnel and provisions, including tents, food,
and medical supplies, for even a fraction of the Kosovars. The base
at Guantanamo Bay has only 1,000 sailors and Marines now on active
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a situation like the Haitians and Cubans,'' said a
spokesman for the Navy at Guantanamo, noting that population was
largely young men seeking political asylum in the United States.
``This is a whole new show _ women, children, and old men forced at
gunpoint from their homes. They are hurt, sick, displaced, and
emotionally distraught people. ''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in refugee relocation expressed surprise that US
officials would consider airlifting broken families from the
Balkans to tropical islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented movement of people to, what is to
them, the other side of the planet,'' said Dan Detzner, former
director of the Refugee Studies Center at the University of
Minnesota. ``It is very unusual and very distressing that if the
United States expects these refugees to go home, it wouldn't try to
resettle them closer to the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Detzner said he suspects the Clinton administration is trying to
minimize the political fallout and avoid bringing the war in Kosovo
too close to home. ``This war becomes a lot less antiseptic to the
American people if suddenly 5,000 ethnic Albanian refugees try to
resettle in Boston or the Twin Cities,'' Detzner said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the legal question: Refugees brought to Guam, a US
territory, would have the right to seek asylum and resettlement in
the United States. The situation is not the same at Guantanamo, a
base leased by the US government from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Rizza, national refugee coordinator for Amnesty
International, said he expects the US government to restrict the
Kosovar refugees to military-run camps and stress their stay would
be short, even though the refugees appear to meet international
standards for gaining political asylum and permament resettlement
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   US officials Monday said they were not prepared to describe the
logistics of the operation _ which refugees would be chosen, how
they would be relocated, or what it will cost _ nor would they hint
at whether the refugees would be eligible for asylum in the United
States if the confinement turned out to be something other than
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said the US effort, which
could eventually involve more than 20,000 refugees, was aimed less
at resettlement than at galvanizing an international humanitarian
relief operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes much difference if you are going to fly
to a West European country or you're going to fly to some location
(like Guantanamo or Guam),'' Rubin said. ``You're going to be flown
out on a temporary basis and returned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a private group
that opposes more open immigration to the United States, Monday
urged the president to reconsider relocating the refugees, arguing
that it would only encourage dictators like Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to oppress and dislocate ethnic groups.

PICTURES OF REFUGEES STRENGTHEN RESOLVE IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, France, Germany)  (See also: KOSOVO-CLINTON, KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-BELGRADE,

 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The television images of refugees staggering out of
Kosovo are having a powerful effect on public opinion across
Europe, turning pacifists and anti-NATO activists of decades ago
and NATO critics of just a week ago into supporters of sustained
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, Spain, Francisco Sanchez, a 25-year-old construction
company office worker, has watched the coverage and felt a national
kinship with the refugees' suffering. ``Spaniards also have
emigrated when we were in need,'' he said as he waited at a bus
stop outside the Prado Monday, ``and we should accept them here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the images of Kosovars packed onto exile trains have
brought the war home with chilling reminders of moments from ``Life
Is Beautiful,'' the Holocaust tale by the Academy Award-winning
actor Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that for him the
pictures were ``scenes that belong to Europe's darkest hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Newscasts and front pages are filled daily with accounts of
brutality and suffering and deeply affecting pictures of people
stranded in border fields, streaming across frontiers in forced
marches and crowding around relief workers for food.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Hattersley, a former British Labor Party deputy leader and
government minister, wrote in Monday's Guardian: ``My own doubts
about the bombing _ expressed in this column last week _ have been
completely removed by seven days of pictures. A NATO victory is the
only real hope of permanent relief and decent resettlement for the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A NATO defeat would convince political psychopaths all over
the world that they, like Slobodan Milosevic, could tyrannize a
whole people and get away with it. Whether or not we should have
started the war, we clearly have to finish it. That must be obvious
to everyone who owns a television set.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier horror about seeing aerial combat return to Europe for
the first time in 50 years, anxiety about attacking a sovereign
nation without the sanction of the United Nations, and dismay at
appearances of bad planning and miscalculation in staging the
attacks are being overwhelmed by concern over the refugees and
revulsion at the way they have been coerced from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Daily now across Europe there are announcements of government
and private appeals to speed aid to the refugees, and even
countries like Britain and France with cultural reluctance to admit
foreigners have had to respond to public pressure to provide
temporary shelter for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has offered to take 40,000 Kosovars; the United States
and Turkey, 20,000 each; Norway, 6,000, and Canada and Greece,
5,000 each. Britain and France both said at first that they worried
that airlifting refugees out of the Balkans, even with the
understanding that they would one day return to Kosovo, would risk
abetting Milosevic's own desire to rid the province of its ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Blair conceded Monday that his government would accept an
unspecified number of refugees ``if necessary,'' adding that the
``ultimate objective'' must remain repatriating them to Kosovo. The
French defense minister, Alain Richard, said Paris did not want to
be seen taking a position apart from its allies. ``If the best
solution is to take a certain number of refugees into our
countries, France will not close its doors,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Blair and Richard twinned these moves with aggressive
statements about the need for NATO to persevere in the bombing.
Richard announced ``even more intense attacks'' by France's Mirage
2000-D fighter-bombers against the Milosevic regime, and Blair
said, ``People have to be prepared to go on, have to be prepared
for the longer haul in order to make sure that our objectives are
secured and successful.''
</P>
<P>
   In his military briefing Monday, the NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea,
stressed the alliance's commitment to caring for the exiles, saying
it was ``fully mobilized'' behind the refugee assistance effort,
building campsites and running what he called a ``humanitarian air
bridge'' ferrying aid into Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Though there has been acknowledgement of the historic menace of
Balkan instability to the other countries of Europe, the coming
together of a joint political will on the Continent has not been
based on a perceived threat to national political and economic
interests, the traditional threshold issue.
</P>
<P>
   What is driving the growing support for NATO is the sense of
responsibility for forestalling human rights abuses and punishing
those who commit them. A Guardian editorial said approvingly that
European policy was increasingly in the hands of ``humanitarian
hawks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Prime Minister Gerhard Schroeder, Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who were
stern critics of U.S. policy in Vietnam and the installation of
nuclear weapons in their country in the 1980s, are now taking
Germany into its first war in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   A recent German newspaper headline read, ``Dictators Look Out _
the 1968ers Are in Charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of Fischer's Green Party are content with the
government's unflinching backing of NATO's aerial strikes. Roland
Appel, a party leader in Duesseldorf, called it the party's ``most
difficult test'' and pleaded with members to avoid reflexive
pacifism that could split the party and force it out of the
country's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said Monday that he saw no reason to change the
strategy of relying primarily on military force rather than
diplomacy. Guenter Verheugen, a top Social Democrat within the
Foreign Ministry, was blunter. ``We are dealing here with one of
the most terrible criminals of this century,'' he said, ``and he
must be treated accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, where Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has given only
wavering support to the bombing and called for a return to
negotiations, public opinion has been swayed toward NATO through
the dramatic reports of Antonio Russo, a broadcaster for a
left-wing radio station. He stayed in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, after other Western journalists had left and managed to
spirit out dispatches from a hiding place that students had
arranged for him.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped on Friday and sent a detailed and impassioned report
to the daily La Repubblica recounting his odyssey hidden among
Kosovars in a sealed train.
</P>
<P>
   The detail that drew particular attention because it so closely
recalled ``Life Is Beautiful'' was the harrowing moment when
heavily armed Serbs forced women, children and the elderly, with
Russo among them, onto the freight cars. As they herded them on
board, the Serbs said, ``Come on, you've won a free train ride _ in
exchange for your homes.''

NATO WILL `PERSIST UNTIL WE PREVAIL,' CLINTON PLEDGES &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By GREG McDONALD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vowed Monday ``to persist until
we prevail'' as the NATO air campaign against Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic's forces entered its 13th day and the refugee
disaster from the Kosovo conflict worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, reaffirming the United States commitment to providing
humanitarian assistance for ethnic Albanians driven from their
homes, made it clear that Milosevic would be held accountable for
their plight and for killings in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `ethnic cleansing' of Kosovo cannot stand as a permanent
event,'' Clinton said at a White House appearance. He all but
declared that NATO's firepower would be used to force Milosevic
into accepting the resettlement of the refugees under
self-government in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Milosevic does not do what is necessary, NATO will
continue an air campaign. It will be undiminished, unceasing and
unrelenting . It will inflict such damage that either he will
change his calculations or we will seriously diminish his capacity
to maintain his grip and impose his control on Kosovo,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to sustain this effort for the long haul. Our
plan is to persist until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments marked a significant change in the allied
approach to dealing with Milosevic. Up until this week, NATO
leaders had held out hope of a negotiated settlement. But now,
given Milosevic's sustained effort to depopulate Kosovo of its
predominantly ethnic Albanian population, Clinton and other allied
leaders now seem intent on wiping out his military and then
treating him as war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments were reinforced by State Department spokesman
James Rubin, who told reporters that the international war crimes
tribunal at The Hague would be given ``all the help they need'' by
NATO in making a case against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a State Department report based on interviews with
refugees, Rubin said ``there is evidence'' that Serb forces under
Milosevic's direction are committing genocide and other war crimes
against Kosovo Albanians. He said the time for negotiations with
Milosevic has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks that in the coming days he can stand up and
declare this thing over through some action short of the objectives
that we have set forth, he's sadly mistaken,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies called on Milosevic again Monday to immediately
withdraw his army troops and security police from Kosovo, allow the
refugees to return to their homes under self-government, and to
accept a NATO peacekeeping force to guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was made as the United States prepared to intensify
its military commitment to the NATO campaign by dispatching 24
Apache attack helicopters to Albania along with 2,600 Army support
personnel and equipment. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the
Apaches will be used to attack Serb ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after his tanks, his armored units, his artillery,
those forces on the ground that are carrying out this horrific
`ethnic cleansing,' '' Cohen said. ``They are going to be targeted
now and taken out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government officially agreed Monday to serve as the
base for the Apaches and an additional contingent of 10,000 NATO
troops being sent in to help with the refugee relief effort. But
the Pentagon said that it could take a week or more to have the
Apaches in place and ready. NATO officials worry that by that time
Milosevic may be close to completing his goal of depopulating
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said even if
Milosevic ``think's he's finished'' and can simply declare for
peace at that point, ``We will not be finished.''
</P>
<P>
   That message was delivered in forceful attacks Monday by NATO
warplanes, as they continued to strike at Serb military positions
throughout Kosovo and Yugoslavia, including the capital of
Belgrade. Improving weather allowed NATO to conduct missions that
Monday focused on oil refineries and other industrial sites
critical to supplying the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will capitalize on the clear weather to attack strategic
and operational targets throughout the operational area. But in
particular we will focus our attention on fielded forces in
Kosovo,'' said NATO Air Commodore David Wilby of the Royal Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that taking out military targets in
Kosovo is ``no easy task'' because the Serbs have become fairly
expert at playing ``cat-and-mouse'' with NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking every advantage of deserted buildings and
terrain to camouflage their positions,'' Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Apaches, which fly fast and low, will provide a
level of close-in combat that NATO has not yet been able to engage
in because of Serb air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Apaches, the United States has sent in the
USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier battle group. The
nuclear-powered Roosevelt entered the Adriatic Sea Monday, along
with three other surface ships and a submarine armed with Tomahawk
cruise missiles. Pentagon officials said the Roosevelt's F/A-18
Hornets and other aircraft would likely start flying missions
today.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was intensifying its attacks on Serb military
positions, it also began airlifting thousands of Kosovar refugees
out of Albania and Macedonia to countries that have agreed to
provide temporary sanctuary. The United States has agreed to take
up to 20,000 of nearly 400,000 displaced Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that the refugees taken in by the United States
likely would be airlifted to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo,
Cuba, which has been used before as a refugee holding point.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the same point in his comments at the White House,
where he called on Americans to make financial contributions to
help in the relief effort. He said people interested in donating
should call 1-800-USAID-RELIEF.

MAN SENTENCED TO 2 CONSECUTIVE LIFE TERMS FOR MURDERING GAY
STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (eds.: Chasity cq) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ In a case that galvanized national outrage over
anti-homosexual violence, a 21-year-old roofer pleaded guilty on
Monday to kidnapping and murdering a gay college student and was
sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was
sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the
beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months
ago. The case propelled the issue of violence against gays onto
magazine covers and into family dinner conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are deserving the fullest punishment this court can mete
out,'' the judge said, after accepting a plea bargain agreement two
days before opening arguments were to begin in the case. In a sole
reference to Shepard's sexual orientation, the judge said the
murder was ``part because of his lifestyle, part for a $20
robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   During an emotion-packed hearing at the Albany County Courthouse
here, Henderson turned to Judy and Dennis Shepard and apologized
for murdering their 22-year-old son. In what may be a preview of
his testimony this August at the trial of a second man accused in
the case, Henderson described his former workmate, Aaron McKinney,
as the mastermind of the Oct. 6 kidnapping of Shepard from a bar
here.
</P>
<P>
   After listening impassively to this testimony, the judge turned
to Henderson and said, ``This court does not believe you feel any
true remorse in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that he faced an ``academic choice,'' Donnell chose
the harsher sentencing alternative, two life sentences to be served
consecutively, rather than concurrently. In his final comments
before the defendant was led away to spend the rest of his life in
jail, the judge told him, ``You are not a victim here, Mr.
Henderson, you are a perpetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming legal experts said on Monday there was virtually no
chance that Henderson would ever be eligible for parole. In recent
weeks, a Wyoming coalition of clergy and a national coalition of
gay groups spoke out against applying the death penalty in the
Matthew Shepard case, a position they said was in harmony with
their wider opposition to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Compressing an enormous amount of drama into a one-hour hearing,
the court proceedings included the Shepards telling Henderson of
their deep pain, the defendant giving his first public account of
the crime, and his grandmother telling a packed courtoom of a
loving young man who grew up in a household free of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed soberly in black pants, a gray shirt, and a black and
white paisely tie, Henderson had let his hair grow out, shunning
the skinhead look he favored at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 p.m., and me and Aaron decided to go out to a bar,''
Henderson testified, responding to question's by his lawyer, Wyatt
Skaggs. After drinking ``a few pitchers of beer'' at the first bar,
he said they went to a second bar, the Fireside. There, while
drinking another pitcher, he said McKinney noticed the college
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron had mentioned to me that he wanted to take him out and
rob him,'' Henderson testified in a clear if subdued voice. ``I
disagreed with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Painting his former roofing workmate as the author of the crime,
he said that McKinney told tim to drive the pickup truck borrowed
from McKinney's father, where to drive and where to park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard
to give him his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while
he drove his friend beat Shepard. After parking in an isolated
field near a subdivision where Henderson once lived, McKinney
``pulled Matthew out of the truck and continued to hit him,'' with
the pistol, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron told me to go get a rope out of the truck,'' Henderson
continued as the Shepards stared grimly ahead. ``Aaron told me to
tie his hands'' to a fence pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew looked really bad, I told him to stop,'' Henderson
continued. ``Mr. McKinney hit me above the mouth. I returned to the
pickup truck.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving away, leaving the beating victim tied to a fence
in temperatures that dropped below freezing, Henderson said that he
and his friend got into another fight. When caught by a Laramie
police man, he said that he lied about what he had been doing
earlier that evening.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, instead of calling for medical help for Shepard,
Henderson said that he and his girl friend, Chasity Pasley, and
McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen LeAnn Price, drove 50 miles east to
a truck stop in Cheyenne with his bloody clothing ``and put it in a
dumpster to cover up that I was out there when Matthew was
beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pasley pled guilty in December to being an accessory after
the fact to first-degree murder and faces sentencing. Ms. Price was
freed on bond in January and faces a trial on the same charges in
May.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Henderson spoke, it was the turn of Lucy Thompson, his
maternal grandmother who has raised him since he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts ache for the pain and suffering that the Shepards
have gone through,'' Mrs. Thompson, said turning to Matthew's
parents who sat in the front row of the courtroom. A devout Mormon,
she said, ``We have prayed for you many, many times. You have
showed us such mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thompson, who raised Henderson until he dropped out of
Laramie High School near the end of his senior year, described him
as ``a survivor'' whose ``mother was young and not ready to be a
mother.'' Three months ago, at age 40, Cindy Thompson Dixon,
Russell's mother, froze to death on a rural road outside of Laramie
after a night of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a ``loving and kind'' side to her grandson, she
recalled him playing on the floor with his young cousins. As his
aunts and other relatives hugged each other for comfort on a
front-row bench, she added, ``Even as a teenager, Russell was never
embarrassed to give me a hug or to kiss me on the forehead in front
of his peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to newspaper accounts of his grandson's expressionless
demeanor in court, she said, ``I have looked into his eyes, and I
know'' that he is in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``the case has developed into a hate crime,'' she
said that she never preached hatred in her household and that
``Russell has never been a hateful individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, she intimated, was a loyal follower, adding,
``Sometimes friends would take advantage of his loyalties.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing, she turned to the judge and begged him not ``to take
Russell out of our lives forever.'' Turning to Matthew's parents
again, she looked them in the eyes and said, ``I want to thank all
the Shepards. I love you even though I have never known you.''
</P>
<P>
   The packed courtroom had scarcely absorbed this appeal, when it
was the turn of Henderson, who hoped to earn a slim chance of one
day winning parole.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the same podium, he turned his back to the judge and
addressed Matthew's family, saying, ``Mr. and Mrs. Shepard, there
is not a day that doesn't go by that I don't see what happened that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I did,'' he continued, turning back to Donnell.
``I'm very sorry for what I did. I am ready to pay for what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the turn of Mr. and Mrs. Shepard, who had traveled
from their home in Saudi Arabia for the chance to address the court
in their native Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shepard spoke first, pausing at times to regain her
composure as she recalled her son's blossoming interest in theater,
politics and international cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't my son, my first born anymore,'' she said, recalling
hugs and late night talks. ``He was my friend, my confidante, my
constant reminder of how good life can be.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembered that the last time she saw him he was covered
with bandages and wired with tubes in an intensive care unit of a
Fort Collins, Colo., hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his eyes was partially open,'' she recalled. ``I could
see the clear blue of his eye. But the twinkle of his life wasn't
there any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the warm and trusting son she had known, she said
that touching his arm in the hospital provoked an involuntary
reaction, ``He began to shake and quiver.'' Referring to her son's
savage beating _ he was kicked in the groin and beaten 18 times
around the head _ she said in disbelief that ``such an act of
cruelty was unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress on the Shepard family was so great, she continued,
that within a month of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I don't think you are worthy of addressing,'' Mrs.
Shepard said, turning to the man who had just pled guilty to
murdering her son. Speaking slowly, but firmly, she vowed, ``We
won't allow you to kill our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, looking drawn, rose to speak, saying he had thrown away
remarks he had written on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was born blind,'' he said in an impromptu speech. ``Not
physically blind, but blind to people's differences _ short or
tall; black, brown or white; religion or ethnic backgrounds. His
friends included gays and so-called straights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I meet strangers and make small talk, they ask, `do you
have children?''' he continued. ``Now, I take a deep breath and say
`I have one son,' not two.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled bathing his young son, teaching him to sing ``Row,
Row, Row Your Boat,'' ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' and other
nursery rhymes. With anger in his voice, he turned to the defendant
and said, ``You, Mr. Henderson, helped to sink that boat, to shoot
Frere Jacques, and to shoot down that star.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his remarks to a 175-pound man who had helped to kill
his 105-pound son, Matthew's father said, ``It takes a brave man to
tie up another man, who did not know how to clench a fist until he
was 13 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Shepards, Cal Rerucha, the Albany County attorney,
kept his remarks brief. Turning to the defendant, he said, ``Mr.
Henderson you have created hell on earth _ for a family, for our
community, for the state.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dazed and battered American soldiers stare into a
camera, captives of an enemy power. Courageous rescue efforts are
mounted to retrieve missing pilots. The body of a lone soldier is
paraded down a Somali street.
</P>
<P>
   In post-Vietnam America, these vivid images personalize war for
a casualty-conscious public, one that has come to know conflict on
a first-name basis.
</P>
<P>
   Americans watched in anger as bruised Jeffrey Zaun, the downed
Navy flier, was exhibited on Iraqi television during the Persian
Gulf War. They cheered in relief at the rescue of Scott O'Grady
after he was shot down in the Balkans. They cringed in anguish as
pictures out of Mogadishu showed an American corpse dragged though
the streets as well as the bloody face of Warrant Officer Michael
Durant, a captured helicopter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   A string of U.S. military operations since the mid-1960s has
resulted in relatively low casualties when compared with the
carnage of Southeast Asia, allowing residents of the electronic
village to focus intently on the losses that have occurred. This
phenomena is visible once again as the fighting in and around
Kosovo continues.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were riveted to their televisions, following accounts
of the downing of the Stealth fighter and the return of the
still-unidentified pilot. They are absorbed in developments in the
capture of the three soldiers whose names are already familiar _
Steven Gonzales, Andrew Ramirez, Christopher Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casualties bring the war down to the personal level,'' said
Rep. Steve Buyer, the Indiana Republican who heads the House
Military Personnel Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   This single-minded attention to potential casualties is a major
factor for the Clinton administration as it considers adding
helicopter gunships to its arsenal. Strategists are aware that
support of the deployment can turn on public response to American
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is a sharp division of opinion over whether
a nation where many still shudder at the memory of body counts from
Vietnam is willing to accept any casualties at all or will
countenance conflict only if no American blood is spilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't have a stomach for casualties in a world in
which there is no clear vital threat to our security interests,''
said Larry Berman, a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Institute
and an expert on Vietnam-era politics. ``There is a very low
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mentality, the feeling is as a long as it is
bombing, the American public will accept it,'' Berman said. ``But
once those body bags start coming home, support ... is going to
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who have studied the issue say American resistance to
battle casualties is exaggerated and can be overcome by strong
leaders able to lay out a persuasive case for American involvement
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The public is ``neither trigger-happy nor gun-shy,'' said Bruce
Jentleson, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace who has
written extensively on public attitudes toward casualties.
</P>
<P>
   He said that U.S. acceptance of casualty risks typically hinges
on two chief perceptions _ that the main goal of an operation is to
thwart aggression and that those commanding it have a workable
strategy. If the two tests are met, he said, the public will not
balk at losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not know where these places are on the map or have
lots of information about them, but there is a common-sense quality
to the judgment that they make,'' Jentleson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jentleson and others point to the Persian Gulf War as a case
where President Bush and military leaders were able to convince the
public of the necessity of the mission. Polls at the time indicated
public backing would remain strong even if casualties ran into the
thousands, though the final toll of less than 150 killed in action
was a welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stakes are perceived to be high, when the prospects
for success are perceived to be good and when the costs are viewed
as being commensurate with the stakes, there can be robust support
in the face of casualties,'' said Eric Larson, an analyst at the
RAND think tank in California.
</P>
<P>
   Larson believes a key element of public support for a conflict
that brings casualties is consensus among political leaders;
division between the president and Congress, for instance, can lead
to cracks in public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say the appearance of uncertainty among the
political and military elite can cause support to rapidly crumble,
pointing to the push for withdrawal from Somalia after the military
suffered casualties and the Clinton administration struggled to
define the U.S. role there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are hesitating, doubtful, if the notion persists that
we're on the path that can't succeed, then the public mood could
swing more strongly,'' said Brent Scowcroft, national security
adviser in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft laid part of the blame for the emergence of a
``zero-casualty'' mentality in the media and the immediacy with
which modern warfare is covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as there is a casualty, you people go to the parents,
wives, relatives and shove a microphone in their faces,'' he told a
group of reporters. ``And the wife or mother says, `I don't know
why my boy is over there getting killed because people can't manage
their own affairs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is some sentiment that President Clinton has
thus far failed to adequately prepare the public for the
possibility of losses in Kosovo or made his best case for
involvement, putting his public support at risk should casualties
occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are very patriotic and most of them would
easily understand the stakes over there, our interests, if the
president would explain his objective with clarity,'' said Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said that the president could well be helped in building
U.S. backing for the operation by the dramatic footage of the three
captive servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that will stiffen the resolve of the majority of the
people,'' Shelby said. ``I know that it did to me.''

 &HT;    'CODE OF CONDUCT' GUIDES BEHAVIOR OF POW'S
 &HT;    610&AMP;add. With KOSOVO-MAIN.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia, the complicated world of multinational military
objectives has been reduced to a mission so simple the Army
summarizes it on wallet cards.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to keep fighting, and the weapon is the Code of
Conduct for the United States Military.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Pentagon confirmed that authorities in Belgrade
have said they will not follow through on threats to hold criminal
trials of Spec. Steven Gonzales and Staff Sgts. Christopher Stone
and Andrew Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The encouraging thing is that after a couple of days, the
Yugoslav government has announced that they will be treated as
POWs,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But becoming a prisoner of war doesn't end a service member's
obligation to fight, and the trio's status as captives to be held
until the end of hostilities highlights one of the most intangible
_ but significant _ aspects of America's military training program.
</P>
<P>
   While bombs and bullets are used by the rest of NATO forces,
America's three captured soldiers must fight Yugoslav authority by
refusing to participate in propaganda, by answering no questions
beyond name, rank and Social Security number, and by accepting no
special favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a physical task, it's a mind-set,'' said Maj. Shelly
Stellwagen (cq) of the Army's Office of Public Affairs. Fighting
the enemy through mental resistance ``becomes a part of you when
you're a soldier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance is based on a code of conduct adopted after the
Korean War that lays out a straightforward obligation of military
personnel:
</P>
<P>
   ``The duty of a (soldier) to continue resistance to enemy
exploitation by all means available is not lessened by the
misfortune of capture. Enemies whom U.S. forces have engaged since
1949 have regarded the POW compound as an extension of the
battlefield. The POW must be prepared for this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity of that preparation varies from job to job
within the military. While pilots and others who operate deep
behind enemy lines get extensive survival training for life as a
POW, those less likely to be captured rely almost exclusively on
their conviction to follow the Code of Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, Stone and Ramirez belong to the latter group. They
haven't attended one of the four Survival Escape Resistance Evasion
(SERE) schools run by the military branches at the direction of the
secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they've been trained repeatedly in the importance of
living by the Code of Conduct no matter what the circumstances. And
they, like all Army personnel, were given wallet cards with the
essence of the code summarized in 10 sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it enough? Good question,'' Stellwagen said. ``Based on the
experience of POWs in the past, it appears to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For retired Navy Capt. Mike McGrath, living by the Code of
Conduct was enough to keep him alive during six years as a POW in
North Vietnam. But he got his training on the code through the SERE
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said McGrath, 59, now an airline pilot. ``I
give it great credit for saving my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath was shot down June 30, 1967, and although badly injured
in the crash, he immediately was subjected to physical torture that
coerced him into signing a ``confession'' of war crimes. But in a
last act in defiance of his captors, and in the spirit of the Code,
McGrath misspelled his own name in the signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got mad,'' McGrath said, ``but they didn't make me go
back and change it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   American military personnel must strive to live by the Code of
Conduct while held captive by enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main points of the Code:
</P>
<P>
   _ A POW must ``think escape,'' must try to escape if able to do
so,
</P>
<P>
   and must assist others to escape.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States does not authorize any military service
member to sign or enter into any such parole agreement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Experience has shown that, although enemy interrogation
sessions may be harsh and cruel, it is usually possible to resist,
if there is a will to resist.
</P>
<P>
   _ The POW may never willingly give the captor additional
information, but must resist doing so even if it involves
withstanding mental and physical duress.
</P>
<P>
   _ However, understand that if taken past the point of maximum
endurance by the captor, the POW must recover as quickly as
possible and resist each successive captor exploitation effort to
the utmost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regardless of the type of detention or captivity, or harshness
of treatment, (soldiers) will maintain their military bearing. They
should make every effort to remain calm, courteous, and to project
personal dignity.

CLIPPERS' TAYLOR HURTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is not the balanced attack the Clippers had
expected from Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   No, they had expected points AND rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the only balance the power forward - who leads the team
in scoring, but missed-rebound opportunities -- has provided in
recent days is strain in each Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are tight,'' said Taylor, who didn't play in
Sunday's loss at Denver, but will attempt to perform in tonight's
game with Phoenix at the Sports Arena. ``They've been bothering me
a while. At first, I just thought it was from playing so many
games, but this has been going on too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzen Wright started in Taylor's place at Denver, and his 11
rebounds helped the Clippers overcome Danny Forston and Antonio
McDyess to win the backboard rumble, 42-40.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring, of course, was won by the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's defeat was the Clippers' 29th in 32 games, bad enough
for a winning percentage of .094. The worst percentage in league
history was the .110 turned in by the 1972-'73 Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Making another point
</P>
<P>
   Veteran playmaker Sherman Douglas scored 10 points, handed out
six assists and committed one turnover against Denver in his second
appearance since returning from the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, whose injured groin invited a subsequent thigh injury,
said his push for optimum fitness is ``about 90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He played 27 minutes vs. the Nuggets, with starter Darrick
Martin logging 18 and Troy Hudson - on his second, 10-day contract
after escaping from the CBA - on the court for only six.
</P>
<P>
   All three could be called upon to chase the Suns' Jason Kidd
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to do it,'' said Douglas, who signed a one-year
contract the day before the Clippers opened the season against
Phoenix. ``I'm more ready now than I've been since I got here.''

 &HT;    Magical season opener for one pitcher, a nightmare for another
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's opening day without bunting draped over the
wall? Without a governor or mayor throwing out the first ball?
Without tingling nerves and bridal anxiety? Who could be more edgy
than a rookie dressed out for his first major league game?
</P>
<P>
   First, consider the creative way the Braves handled the
first-pitch thing. Politicians need not apply. There was Andres
Galarraga and family on the big screen, and the first
baseman-on-sick-leave makes the toss. Eduardo Perez makes the
figurative catch at the plate. Ingenious! Who needs Roy Barnes?
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse, Kevin McGlinchy rose to his full stretch of
six feet, five inches and grinned happily. ``Can you believe it?''
he said. ``My first day in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season he was opening with the Danville 97s, named for a
train that wrecked, never the bottom of the minor league ladder.
``Nah, I never had any idea I'd be pitching in the big leagues this
season,'' he said. ``A lot of my people are here from Massachusetts
today.'' Such exhilirating moments come only once in a young
athlete's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy has ``easy power,'' as Leo Mazzone, the doctor of the
pitching arts, has said. He came out of high school in Malden,
Mass., worked his way along the Braves farm system as a starter
until someone saw a future in the bullpen for him. He was sent to
Puerto Rico for winter training, came to spring camp and so
impressed the braintrust that he now brings another large body to
the oft-suffering relief corps. There is a pressing need, as you
will see.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were opening against the Philadelphia Phillies,
managed by a young man who once shagged balls in the old stadium
when his dad played for the Braves. Terry Francona is a chip off
the old Tito Francona block. The Phillies have been a dawdling
operation these last few seasons. They did manage to sneak in a
pennant in 1993, when the Braves collapsed in the playoffs. But
overall, the Phillies own the most undesirable record in sports _
they have lost more games than any franchise _ any franchise _ in
history, 9,984. They had a chance to make it 9,985, but the Braves
wouldn't let them.
</P>
<P>
   April, usually his good month, deserted Tom Glavine, the Cy
Young Award incumbent, and the Braves opened the bullpen gate. Who
should pop out of it on the run but six feet, five inches of Kevin
McGlinchy. Reaching the mound, he surveyed the situation: Two men
on base, two out and Scott Rolen at bat, the Phillies' toughest
out. On the fourth pitch, Rolen raised a pop fly that Walt Weiss
pulled in. McGlinchy's stride was a deliberate one back to the
dugout, down the steps to a series of high-fives and all the good
words that go with a deed well done.
</P>
<P>
   That was it, his one-third of an inning. He was a confirmed big
leaguer, assured of his name appearing in ``The Baseball
Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mark Wohlers would make his appearance, to a cascading
ovation. Even the unoccupied seats seemed moved by the sight of
this tall young man whose career has become a municipal project.
Nervously, he kicked a little dirt around and went to work. It
would be a painful sight to watch, like death at twilight. He began
with promise, then lost it all, and with agonizing stride, Bobby
Cox went out to relieve him of further embarrassment. Maybe we had
been witness to the birth of a new career, but sadly the anguishing
sight of another fading away.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the 7-4 defeat this news bite appeared on
the big screen: ``Baseball fans will consume 26,000,000 hotdogs
this season.'' Let us not lose sight of the important matters of
life.

   RYE, Texas _ More than 700 people, some without water or
electricity, remained marooned Monday after heavy rains washed out
a dam that also provided the only access to their homes in a
subdivision northeast of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For the eighth time in five years, the dam across Mill Creek in
Big Thicket Lake Estates, a subdivision that straddles the
Liberty/Polk County line, was breached about 1 a.m. Sunday after 10
inches of rain fell in about three hours, said Dianne Walton,
president of the property owners' association.
</P>
<P>
   The dam was topped by a road that provided the only access for
about half of the residents of the subdivision off Texas 146.
</P>
<P>
   One street in the marooned area remained without electrical
power Monday and, because a pump broke down on a well, more than
100 homes also were without water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened on Easter weekend when a lot of residents had
visitors, some from out of state. All are left stranded now,''
Walton said. ``County officials did help us move some people out by
airboat until dark on Sunday, but it was a one-way trip, and those
people aren't allowed to return until we get our road back.''
</P>
<P>
   More residents were leaving with their own boats Monday, but
Walton said authorities were advising against it because of
fast-moving water. A boat was available for medical emergencies,
however, to ferry people to an ambulance if necessary, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dam was destroyed, one woman was evacuated Sunday by
Life Flight helicopter after suffering what was described as a
life-threatening allergic reaction to a wasp sting, Walton said.
Another woman was taken by boat to an ambulance after a serious dog
bite, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us feel very frustrated,'' said stranded resident Kay
McCoy, 53, a homemaker. ``I got enough supplies to keep me and my
3-year-old grandson for a week, but this gets tiring. County
officials have had a grant to build us a new exit for three years
but nothing seems to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk County received a $350,000 grant to build an all-weather
bridge and access road in the subdivision in May 1997, officials
said. It is to be built farther upstream and at a higher elevation
so that it won't wash out again, they said.
</P>
<P>
   County officials have decided not to pour any more money into
repairs for the access road that washed out Sunday. Instead, Cook
said, a temporary access road will be built where the new bridge is
to be located.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have been plagued by flood troubles since the original
dam was built decades ago. In 1994, after numerous washouts,
residents raised funds to build a new dam and access road that they
thought would withstand floods.
</P>
<P>
   That dam, however, was damaged repeatedly by floods, too.

SERB TV AGAIN SHOWS ALBANIAN LEADER CALLING FOR PEACE

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As Serbia tried to clean up Monday after
NATO's heaviest bombing raids so far, Serbian television once again
gave prominence to images of a moderate ethnic Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, showing him in meetings with a senior Yugoslav
official and the Russian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   State television said Rugova, who is living under Serbian police
protection in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, met there Monday with
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic and the Russian
ambassador to Belgrade, Yuri Kotov. The men were shown in a living
room with unidentified journalists and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova and Sainovic, the announcer said, called for an end to
the bombing in Kosovo and agreed to work for a peaceful negotiated
solution, with the safe return of all refugees. Rugova, who has
always favored a non-violent path to Kosovo's self-rule and
ultimate independence, was quoted as saying that he ``is prepared
to continue work here so everyone can see I'm still in Kosovo and
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugova was said to have confirmed that he met Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, and Belgrade television said Rugova's statement
Monday ``has caught NATO in a lie and revealed the propaganda war
waged against our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an intriguing follow-up, the television quoted Rugova as
saying he would like to go abroad. ``I am interested in going to
Skopje and other countries, because I am here without my
associates, and in Pristina I cannot contribute to the solution of
the problem,'' the announcer quoted him as saying. Skopje is the
capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there was no audio accompanying the video footage, and
no way to verify that Rugova had said any of the words ascribed to
him. NATO has said that Rugova is under house arrest and has no
freedom of movement, that he has not called for an end to the
bombing but for an end to violence in general and that footage of
the meeting with Milosevic, which Serb TV said occurred last
Thursday, was actually two years old.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav and Russian officials have said that the
Milosevic-Rugova meeting did occur, and the official news agency
Tanjug said Monday: ``Rugova himself used the occasion to reject
Sunday's statement of NATO spokesman Jamie Shea that he had not met
President Slobodan Milosevic, and that the pictures taken on April
1 could be two years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotov, Tanjug continued, confirmed that Rugova ``is safe and
alive, that he is free to move and that his house is not damaged,
thus rejecting the speculations of certain foreign media and NATO
officials that Rugova has been arrested and his house burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts Monday evening to reach the Russian Embassy for comment
were unsuccessful. Shea, for his part, said in Brussels: ``We are
going to have to wait until the end of this conflict in Kosovo to
learn all of the facts about Rugova and therefore I probably should
reserve judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials are concerned that Milosevic will suddenly
announce a political deal with Rugova for substantial political
autonomy for Kosovo, much along the lines of a Western-drafted
solution that Rugova signed in France, but without a role for the
Kosovo Liberation Army or NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has lost popularity and credibility to the fighters of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, but he has retained significant support
among civilian ethnic Albanians. If he is a willing participant in
a deal with Milosevic, many Albanians will regard him as a traitor
but others may welcome a chance to return home in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Yugoslav officials have said privately that Milosevic
still believes an internal political solution is possible in
Kosovo, while other officials who have his ear are pressing for a
form of partition that keeps the northern half of the province for
Serbia and effectively cedes the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO is unlikely to accept either option.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In widespread bombing early Monday morning, NATO struck at
military targets and civilian infrastructure that the military
might conceivably use for resupply. NATO destroyed the empty
Yugoslav air force headquarters in Zemun, a municipality of
Belgrade, and damaged surrounding buildings; in Nis, 125 miles
south, the headquarters of the 3rd Army was demolished, along with
an army barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, about 9:30 local time, Nis was hit again by ``six
or seven cruise missiles,'' television reported, but did not
specify the targets. The nearby town of Aleksinac was also struck,
as was Novi Sad, the largest city in northern Serbia, which has
been the target of earlier strikes.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, no figures for military casualties were released.
</P>
<P>
   But many government and military buildings are empty, and even
state television, expecting to be bombed, is said to have moved to
hardened bunkers and alternate transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also hit Belgrade's Surcin airport and Pristina's Slatina
airport, both of which have extensive radar facilities, and the
southern Belgrade suburb of Rakovica, which also has radar. NATO
also set a fuel depot on fire near Kragujevac, 40 miles south of
Belgrade, and damaged a bridge on the Ibar River.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was shown on television meeting aides and businessmen
and urging reconstruction of facilities damaged or destroyed by
NATO. He also awarded medals to several Yugoslav army officers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO dropped propaganda leaflets over the town of Subotica that
explained its bombing campaign and provided the frequencies of some
foreign radio stations, the Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subotica people, being wise and sound, will judge for
themselves how these NATO messages sound after all it has done to
our country,'' the local authorities told the agency.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb in Belgrade said the leaflets ``will only remind everyone
of the Nazis dropping propaganda leaflets during World War II.''

STRANGE DEPARTURE IN SAN JOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A player who is the seventh defenseman on the San
Jose Sharks would seem an unlikely candidate to be a participant in
one of the more bizarre episodes in the National Hockey League in
recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent decision by Andrei Zyuzin, a 21-year-old Russian,
to abandon the Sharks a month before the start of the playoffs has
cast an unsettling shadow over his team's impressive and somewhat
surprising drive to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuzin, the second player chosen in the 1996 draft, insists he
left the Sharks because he felt mistreated by Coach Darryl Sutter
and because the team's management had been unresponsive to his
complaints. If this were the entire story - disgruntled player
going AWOL and demanding a trade - there would be little unique
about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Zyuzin's abrupt action was accompanied by the decision to
fire his agent, Jay Grossman, and replace him with a Ukrainian
named Vitaly Shevchenko, who is not certified as an NHL agent and
reportedly is under FBI investigation. Shevchenko, whose previous
clients include former King Dimitri Khristich, lost his
certification a few years ago when he didn't pay his dues to the
NHL Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuzin has not been seen publicly since his departure, though he
did speak with reporters by telephone from Vancouver last week. His
current whereabouts are uncertain. There is concern in the Sharks'
organization that Zyuzin's decision was made under duress from
Shevchenko.
</P>
<P>
   There have been news reports in recent years about extortion
attempts by the Russian Mafia against players from the former
Soviet Union. The Zyuzin situation may have brought this problem to
a disturbing new level.
</P>
<P>
   GROUNDED ROCKET (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Panthers have a $58-million investment in
high-scoring right wing Pavel Bure, but the Russian Rocket
underwent reconstructive surgery on his right knee for the second
time in his career last week and is gone for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers officials say the 28-year-old Bure will be back in six
months, in time for the start of training camp. The Panthers had
better hope so, considering what they are paying him.
</P>
<P>
   Bure played in 11 games this season and made $3 million. If he
had been paid at that rate for an entire 82-game season, he'd have
been paid in excess of $22 million for the year. As it is, his
per-game salary this season was more than $272,000.
</P>
<P>
   SCARY SITUATION (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   As frightening as the collapsed right lung of Eric Lindros was,
the outcome could have been much worse for the Philadelphia Flyers
star, who will miss the rest of the regular season and also may sit
out the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros remains in a Nashville hospital and has been receiving a
morphine drip to quell the pain of an injury, the origin of which
remains uncertain. Half of the blood in Lindros' body bled into his
damaged lung.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, Lindros' injury was of a severity
commonly found in the victim of ``a car wreck.'' And reportedly,
had Lindros chosen to return to Philadelphia before seeking
treatment rather than going to the hospital in Nashville, he might
have died on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   MILE HIGH FLEURY (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Theo Fleury is enjoying life with the Colorado Avalanche, who
played host to the Kings on Monday night. Entering that game, the
prospective free agent had eight goals and 19 points in nine games
with the Avalanche, and he said he might like to sign with Colorado
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait to see what happens,'' Fleury said. ``The more days
that go by and the more the sun shines, I'm really enjoying it (in
Denver). It would definitely be a possibility at the end of the
year that I'd like to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   BAD INVESTMENT (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   How's this for an ominous statement on the financial state of
the NHL? Missouri billionaire Bill Laurie wants to buy Denver's new
arena, the Pepsi Center, from Ascent Entertainment Group. And he
wants to buy the NBA Denver Nuggets from Ascent.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal reportedly is contingent on Ascent finding a
separate buyer for its other sports property, the Avalanche,
because Laurie is concerned about the NHL's lethal combination of
escalating salaries and low broadcast revenues.
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE PUCKS (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Sun reported that Edmonton general manager Glen
Sather, whose contract expires after the season, will displace Dean
Lombardi in San Jose. The Sharks issued the anticipated denial. The
Sun also reported that Larry Robinson has been telling friends he
plans to take a year off and spend it on his farm in Florida,
assuming he isn't back as the Kings' coach. Robinson has declined
comment until after this season on his plans for next year. ...
When he was traded to New Jersey last week, Sergei Nemchinov became
the second player to play for the Devils, New York Rangers and New
York Islanders. The first was Pat Conacher, also a former King. ...
Phoenix reportedly would have fired Coach Jim Schoenfeld had the
Coyotes lost a pivotal game to the Mighty Ducks a few weeks ago.
The Coyotes, who began the season 17-2-2 but have been mediocre
ever since, beat the Ducks, apparently saving the coach's job. ``If
the coach is good, you don't say, `Oh, boy, if you lose this one,
you're toast,'' Schoenfeld said. ``If a coach is bad and wins three
in a row, you should still replace him. To me, the whole thing is
moronic, really. If I'm wrong for the job and the team has won five
in a row, get the guy who's right. Have the guts to make a
decision. Change the coach or change the tune, because I'm tired of
hearing the same old song.''

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Jones picks up where he left off
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers and Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The start to the 1999 season looks a lot like the
start to his 1998 for Andruw Jones, who went 0 for 4 on Monday
against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   That tacked on to his 0 for 19 streak to end spring training
spell out another spring slump for the young center fielder. Jones
finished the spring with a .169 batting average, which was actually
worse than last year's .200 spring average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated,'' Jones said after the game. ``Those
things are going to happen. You start the season 0 for 4 it doesn't
matter. You've got 161 more games to go. You just have to stay
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   One difference this year is Jones has hitting coach Don Baylor
to help get him going. After going 0 for 4 in the final exhibition
game against the Indians on Saturday, Jones went to batting cage
for some extra work with Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done his work all spring,'' Baylor said. ``He really has.
He's been a lot more dedicated, out early in the morning.``
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was looking for the positives to encourage Jones and
found one on Friday in the walk Jones took against the Orioles in
his 0 for 3 outing after Scott Erickson threw him a pair of sliders
out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jones problems stem from swinging at breaking balls out
of the zone, but Baylor said he's also missing the pitches he likes
up in the strike zone. But Baylor said Jones had been moving his
head in those situations, something they've addressed in their
hitting sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's pitch
</P>
<P>
   As planned Andres Galarraga made an appearance at Turner Field
Monday via video monitor, as he ``threw out'' the cermonial first
pitch via the matrix board in center field. He was being filmed at
his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. as he continues chemotherapy
treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with his two daughters Katherine (13) and Andria (7),
Galarraga said: ``I am so excited and so sorry I cannot be there
today. Anyway, I wish for the best good luck for all the players,
the Atlanta Braves and thank all the fans for all the support you
gave to me. I thank you for the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he tossed a ball toward the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Several Braves wore Galarraga's No. 14 in permanent white ink on
their caps as Tom Glavine did Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   El Presidente visit
</P>
<P>
   It would hardly have been opening day in major league baseball
without Dennis Martinez. And it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The retired elder statesman on the Braves pitching staff made an
appearance at Turner Field on Monday on his way to Birmingham, Ala.
to watch his son Gilbert play in a high school baseball tournament
for Westminster (Fla.) High.
</P>
<P>
   After 23 seasons in the major leagues, the 44-year-old Martinez
is now doing a little coaching with his son's team and may
eventually do that on the professional level, although he turned
down a coaching offer from the Braves this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do it, I'll do it at the big league level,'' Martinez
said. ``I don't have to go to the minor leagues to prove anything.
I'm enjoying my family right now. Next year, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he wasn't ready to quit playing after last year -
when he became the all-time winningest Latin American pitcher in
major league history with No. 244 last August 9. But eventually he
announced his retirement when nobody called. Martinez said he spoke
with Braves general manager John Schuerholz in January and
Schuerholz told him he'd heard Martinez was retired, even though he
hadn't made a formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I still had a chance to hook up with somebody,''
said Martinez, who only would have considered the Braves, the
Indians or the Marlins because he makes his home in Miami. ``That's
why I didn't make an announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he could still pitch, Martinez looked back at the
other end of the clubhouse where most of the players' lockers are,
smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role I did last year, I think I can do it again,'' said
Martinez, who was used primarily in relief. ``But I didn't like it
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez work
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the Braves were off on Sunday, rookie
left-hander Odalis Perez pitched six innings against Braves Class
AA and AAA hitters at the Disney spring training complex in
Florida. He allowed three hits, no runs, struck out 10.
</P>
<P>
   Perez will get his first major league start as the Braves fifth
starter on Friday against the Arizona Diamondbacks. While he said
his arm is in great shape, Perez said he'd like to build up his
strength. Perez, who is 6-0, 194, would like to get up to 200 for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work a little bit more now,'' Perez said. ``The
season is so long and you have to be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrible two's
</P>
<P>
   Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling led the National League in
strikeouts each of the last two seasons, but his inability to get a
third strike cost him dearly in the first inning. After going 0-2
on Chipper Jones with two outs and the bases empty, Schilling
walked the Braves third baseman. Brian Jordan singled to shortstop
on an 0-2 pitch. Schilling got ahead of Javy Lopez 0-2, then the
catcher fouled off three of the next four pitches before doubling
down the rightfield line to score Jones and Jordan. ``It's a
frustrating situation when you can't close the deal,'' Schilling
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fair warning
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth inning, the scoreboard issued a cautionary
note to fans which read: ``Stay alert! Bats and balls may enter the
stands rapidly.'' The addition of ``bats'' to the warning may have
been in response to a lawsuit filed by Sterling Lapinski against
the New York Mets. Lapinski sustained head injuries during a July
11, 1997 game at Turner Field when struck by the bat of Mets
catcher Todd Pratt. . . . Phillies backup outfielder Rob Ducey
nearly cold-cocked first baseman Rico Brogna during warmups in the
eighth inning. Ducey was warming up Yorkis Perez when his throw
back to the pitcher sailed wide. The ball missed Brogna, who was
jogging out to first base, by only two feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing upfront
</P>
<P>
   The top of the Atlanta lineup had a tough afternoon, with Otis
Nixon, Bret Boone and Chipper Jones going a collective one-for-11
and reaching base just twice in a dozen plate appearances. Nixon
was one-for-four, with a single to rightfield in the seventh
inning. Boone was hitless in four at-bats and Jones in three.
Jones, who struck out twice, drew a walk in the first inning. Boone
did hit the ball well in all four trips. He lined out to right
field in the first inning, grounded hard to shortstop in the third,
then flew out to right and center in the fifth and seventh,
respectively.

ANGELS FACE OUTFIELD QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- When the Angels open the 1999 season tonight against
the Cleveland Indians at Edison Field, Jim Edmonds will once again
be wearing periwinkle blue.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds is on the disabled list until April 15 with a groin pull
and sore shoulder, but it could've been a lot of worse. He could've
been wearing another team's colors.
</P>
<P>
   That would've eliminated the team's surplus of outfielders, but
at what price? We're talking about one of the top outfielders in
the league here.
</P>
<P>
   Thus as another season begins, the Angels remain faced with a
similar problem. Once Edmonds returns, how do they play four
outfielders in three spots?
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, there were rumors the Angels would trade
Edmonds for a pitcher. But it's safe to say nobody offered the
Angels two 20-game winners for Edmonds, or for Garret Anderson, the
other player named in the trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad and Tim Salmon were said to be untouchable, leaving
the Angels with four quality outfielders, one destined to serve as
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   How do you keep them all happy?
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins says he has a plan, but he won't say what
it is. If spring training is any indication, Anderson will be the
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad had 18 starts in left field and one at DH this spring.
Edmonds had 14 starts in center and two at DH. Salmon had 20 starts
in right and one at DH. Anderson had four starts in left, 11 in
center, three in right and three at DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what they want to do, I'll do it,'' Anderson said.
``They pay me to play baseball. I'm not one to rock the boat. I'm
most comfortable in left because I've been doing it for 10 years,
but I can play any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people wish they could do what I do (for a living). I
can't complain about where I'm playing. That's the least of my
worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds expressed his displeasure in the trade rumors last
winter. General manager Bill Bavasi, the one who could have helped
ease Edmonds' concerns, chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is, we've got four excellent athletes,'' Bavasi
said. ``None of them wants to DH, and that is understandable. I'm
not saying anybody's going to blame me for having too much talent,
but I'm not going to cut back on talent to make people happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys will find out over the course of the season,
whether it's aches and pains, an injury, a lack of performance, any
number of reasons, they're all going to play the outfield a lot. To
make a trade to improve our ballclub is always a priority. To make
a trade to improve players' happiness is never a consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the four wants to sit the bench or DH. Salmon did it for
all but two weeks of last season because of a foot injury and he
hated it. Each knows he is good enough to play in the field every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says he's not concerned about hurting anybody's
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the last thing we need to talk about,'' Collins
said. ``Each one will do whatever it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins won't deny that the outfield defense is best with
Edmonds in center and Salmon in right. So they'll be there most of
the time. Salmon says he expects to start 155 games in right field.
Edmonds, a two-time Gold Glove winner, can't make his
highlight-reel catches as a DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already served my time as a DH,'' Salmon said, referring
to last year. ``I want to be out there every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it's going to work out,'' Edmonds said.
``We'll find out soon enough.''

 Montgomery Chief Is Banking on New Tactics
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Talk about headaches. Consider what's happened to Lew Coleman since
he became chief executive of NationsBanc Montgomery Securities six
months ago:
</P>
<P>
   _Thomas Weisel, his former boss, started a rival investment bank
weeks after quitting Montgomery in a huff, taking with him all the
staff and clients he could spirit away.
</P>
<P>
   _More than 20 percent of Coleman's top managers jumped ship,
many of them joining Weisel.
</P>
<P>
   _The brokerage industry and trade press gossiped about a
meltdown at San Francisco's Montgomery, fueling the view that the
firm's investment banking business had all but collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of silence, Coleman has come out swinging. He
vows nothing less than to catapult what was a second-tier, regional
brokerage to the top of the investment banking world.
</P>
<P>
   He has already promoted several promising younger executives,
forced out a handful of old-timers and raided the nation's top
investment banks to fill high-level vacancies. And he boosted the
value of a partnership by taking the coveted status away from about
20 junior partners.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While commercial banks lend money, investment banks are the
clubby Wall Street firms that sell securities, organize mergers and
give strategic advice to corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by money and clients provided by BankAmerica, the North
Carolina bank that bought Montgomery 18 months ago, Coleman says
his firm will elbow its way within three years into the ``bulge
bracket,'' becoming one of the top five U.S. investment banks
alongside such firms as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to get there by doing business not just with &LR;   &LR; its
traditional client list of small- and midsize companies, but with
customers of BankAmerica, including most of the largest, best-known
corporations in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is growing away from the pure, little
boutiques,'' Coleman said in a recent interview. ``We're a company
with 2,000 people. It's a big food chain. We need to do business
with the companies institutional investors want to own,'' the
biggest corporations with the largest market value.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the odds are against Coleman. Companies tend to
stick with their traditional investment banks and don't readily
switch loyalties, they point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery's prospects of crashing the bulge-bracket in the
near term are remote,'' said independent brokerage analyst Michael
Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also wonder whether Coleman can re-energize a firm that
got its spark from Weisel's driving personality.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rivals claim the defection of top talent has taken
away Montgomery's competitive edge in such key industries as
technology and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Several traditional Montgomery clients that have sold stock
recently, including computer component-maker Hutchinson Technology
and hardware superstore Lowe's, have turned to other investment
banks. Montgomery said it declined to co-manage Hutchinson's recent
stock offering when the lead assignment went to another firm.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery has fallen from ninth place two years ago to 24th
place today in the value of stock offerings it led, said Securities
Data Corp. Montgomery said its calculations put it in 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said Montgomery's most important business, trading
securities for mutual funds, pension funds and other institutional
investors, is thriving. Thanks to its booming brokerage business,
the firm's revenue surged 80 percent in January from the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, BankAmerica's $45 billion in equity capital gives
Montgomery the financial backing to do far larger deals than it
ever could before.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery has recruited new managers to replace those that
left. ``While we certainly did not like to lose senior people, we
have replaced them with people just as good,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Coleman argued, Montgomery ''is changing, but it's not
apparent that there is any loss of value and there has been no loss
of market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, a shaggy-haired, fleshy-faced 57-year-old, is
relatively new to investment banking. Five years ago, he was the
No.2 executive at San Francisco's old BankAmerica, regarded as the
top contender for the bank's top job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, David Coulter, not Coleman, got the nod as BofA's CEO.
Coleman soon jumped to Montgomery where he played a key role in
negotiating the firm's 1997 sale to North Carolina's NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Weisel quit Montgomery after losing fights with
NationsBank for control of key business lines. Coleman was named to
replace him. Compounding the irony for Coleman, NationsBank also
bought BofA and took its name.
</P>
<P>
   To help rebuild Montgomery, Coleman relies on Carter McClelland,
his New York-based investment banking chief.
</P>
<P>
   McClelland, a longtime Wall Street power broker and the former
head of the U.S. investment banking operations for Germany's
Deutsche Bank, has been on a hiring tear.
</P>
<P>
   He's recently hired new section chiefs in health care and
technology, handing out huge paychecks and signing bonuses to lure
top talent, according to industry gossip. McClelland said he's
merely paying the going rate.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's investment banking chief is concentrating on wooing
BankAmerica clients while holding on to the firm's traditional
customers. Montgomery and the bank are testing joint sales teams to
call on certain customers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Putnam, managing director of San Francisco brokerage Putnam,
Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton, said Montgomery can make headway
if BankAmerica continues to bankroll its expansion. But he thinks
Montgomery's goals of serving big corporations while keeping
traditional clients happy can't be harmonized.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm skeptical,'' Putnam said. ``A few years from now, I think
they will have the same market share and won't be as profitable as
they are today.''  &LR;

 &HT;    Nigerian Cardinal, possible Papal candidate, visits Atlanta
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some came to the Cathedral of Christ the King to see
Cardinal Francis Arinze because he represents an important tie to
their native Nigeria. Some came because he provides a role model of
a powerful black leader in the international church. Others came
because they thought they might be seeing the next pope.
</P>
<P>
   Arinze, 66, presided over an evening prayer and benediction, a
brief service adoring the Eucharist, with about 200 worshippers at
the cathedral Monday night. African immigrants in native garb _
bright, long skirts and large colorful headdresses _ blended their
voices with people in business dress as they sang African hymns,
accompanied only by their clapping hands.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, he greeted a long line of well-wishers in the
church's fellowship hall.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal continues his visit to Atlanta with a Mass at 3
p.m. today at St. Catherine of Siena Church in Kennesaw, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Archbishop John F. Donoghue said the cardinal's visit
signifies the growth of Atlanta's Nigerian Catholic community.
Officials estimate there are about 2,000 Nigerian Catholics in the
archdiocese, which covers most of North Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main purpose is for him to come and see the Nigerians,''
said Joseph Ofili, a Nigeria native who has lived in Atlanta for
about eight years. ``We don't want any politics brought into his
visit''
</P>
<P>
   But other Atlantans were willing to address speculation that
Arinze could succeed Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard he's maybe the next pope,'' volunteer Mary Ann
Vorce, 34, a member of the Cathedral parish who was baptized and
confirmed into the Catholic church just Saturday night. ``I think
it's quite possible,'' said the archbishop. ``He's talked about all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptized into the Roman Catholic Church at age 9 from a family
that practiced traditional African religions, Arinze was archbishop
of Onitsha, Nigeria, before being called to serve at the Vatican by
John Paul II in 1984. He is one of five people charged by the pope
with pulling together the massive year-long celebration of 2000,
declared a Holy Year by the pope.
</P>
<P>
   And, as long-time president of the Pontifical Council for
Interreligious Dialogue in Rome, he represents the pope and the
Roman Catholic Church in reaching out to other faiths. As an
African, Arinze is reputed to be especially interested in the
church's relationship with Muslims, since Islam runs neck-in-neck
with Christianity as the majority religion in Africa. In his book
``Inside the Vatican,'' Jesuit scholar and Vatican-watcher the Rev.
Thomas J. Reese included Arinze on a list of possible papal
candidates. The growth of Catholicism in Africa and the increasing
influence of Third World men in the College of Cardinals increase
the chance that the next leader of the Catholic church could be
non-European.

 Web Site Lists Low-Rate Cards
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Is there any place on the Web where I can find out which
credit cards offer the lowest interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Try  &LR; www.bankrate.com &LR; , a comprehensive service
sponsored by Intelligent Life Inc. in cooperation with Bank Rate
Monitor. It won't cost you anything, but prepare to be deluged with
annoying advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for the best credit card deals by state, or scan
all offerings. There is a section showing the lowest introductory
interest rates and another with the best rates after the
introductory period expires. You can find out which credit card
issuers offer rebates, which offer the best platinum-card deals,
which offer the best gold-card deals and which provide the most
generous frequent-flier bonuses. There also is data comparing
annual fees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you can use this site to search for low-rate auto
loans, mortgage and home equity loans and more.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great source of information for people with a pressing
need to spend money they don't have.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can find some of the same information every
Monday in the Chronicle's Business section, on the Data Bank page.

<P>
   Chicken Lickin'
</P>
<P>
   Q: I own 40,000 shares of Boston Chicken Inc. I thought this
franchised restaurant chain was a promising speculation, but I have
lost the bulk of what I put into it. At one point, the stock sold
for more than $40 per share, but last year, the company filed a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy notice, and the stock now sells for less than
a dollar. I plan to hold it until I regain a profit on my shares or
until I die, whichever comes first. My question is: Why haven't I
continued to get quarterly reports from the company? I want to
monitor its progress, if any.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Your doleful experience is a useful reminder that hot
stocks don't necessarily rise forever. A lot of latter-day
investors seem to have forgotten that _ if they ever knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Chicken, which despite its name is based in Colorado,
filed for Chapter 11 protection last October and was delisted by
Nasdaq in December but continues to trade on the Over-the-Counter
Bulletin Board. It still files reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, but they haven't been useful lately because
the company's finances are in chaos. For copies, try calling the
company's investor relations department at (303) 216-5356.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston Chicken's latest report, filed last month, management
indicated that the company's independent auditor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked it to review and restate possibly
erroneous financial results it previously reported for 1997 and the
first three quarters of 1998. No report was ever issued for the
fourth quarter of 1998. Until the numbers are rejiggered _ which
could be quite a while _ it will be impossible for you to analyze
the company adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Management also said it has asked its investment banker to find
a buyer for the company. However, there is no guarantee that any
such savior will materialize.
</P>
<P>
   You say that you will hold your shares until they are profitable
again. That kind of die-hard attitude has been the ruin of many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Are you certain this is the most promising place for the $30,000
or so your investment is still worth? Perhaps Boston Chicken _ like
its cousin the Phoenix _ can rise from the ashes. But there doesn't
appear to be a rational way to appraise the company just now.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes on IRA Withdrawals
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have turned 70 and soon will be required to make my first
withdrawal from my Individual Retirement Account _ which means I
will have to pay taxes on the money. Some of my holdings are in
stock, which has appreciated considerably during the past few
years. Am I permitted to pay taxes on my long-term stock gains at
the capital-gains rate? That would save me a lot of money. Someone
told me that I can do this if I take possession of the stock rather
than selling it and removing cash from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Your informant got it wrong, unfortunately. When you use
your IRA to buy stock, any gain in the value, no matter how long
you held the stock, is taxed at your regular income-tax rate.
Someone in the 28 percent bracket, for example, would not be able
to take advantage of the 20 percent maximum rate on long-term
capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem unfair but remember: For as long as you maintained
your IRA, you were able to defer taxes on the assets in your
account. You were allowed to reinvest your dividends and any
capital gains from stock sales without forking over a chunk of the
proceeds to Uncle Sam each year. As a result, your assets grew
faster than they would have done if they had been kept in a taxable
brokerage account. Now it's time to pay the piper.
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation, Internal Revenue Service spokesman
Jesse Weller points out that if you withdraw stock from your IRA
rather than liquidating it, any future increase in the stock's
value will be taxable as capital gains. Only the gains you
accumulated before withdrawing the stock will be taxed as ordinary
income.

LUCILLE LORTEL, 98, PIONEER IN INNOVATIVE THEATER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring
innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights to the American
stage earned her the title Queen of Off-Broadway, died Sunday at
New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had
homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's career, which spanned more
than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich
Village and the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started
in Westport in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference
to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental
summer theater in the barn of the couple's summer estate in
Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it,
to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers
could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch
their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings,
mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero
Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene
Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan
theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding
anniversary gift. The first production in the house, then called
the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt
Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ``Threepenny Opera.'' The production ran
for seven years and put off-Broadway on the map.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Miss Lortel persuaded the American National Theater and
Academy to support a matinee series as a ``laboratory for
innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. Over
the years, the series offered ``Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a
dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge;
adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish,
W.H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by
O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and
presented actors like Richard Burton in ``An Afternoon of Poetry,''
Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of
Shakespeare and Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson in a joint
dramatic reading.
</P>
<P>
   She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences
with a production of ``The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at
Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American
production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright;
it was ``Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J.D. Cannon,
and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater in 1964. She
introduced many plays by Beckett, including ``Rockaby.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as
David Mamet's ``A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ``Buried
Child'''' Caryl Churchill's ``Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's
``Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel
Theater in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, five of
which _ ``As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ``Angels Fall'' by Lanford
Wilson, ``Blood Knot'' by Fugard, ``Sarafina!,'' an import from
South Africa, and ``A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing _ were
nominated for Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the
daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Her father was a manufacturer of
women's clothes. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied
at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Later, she studied
briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925. She met Schweitzer
in 1930. ``I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled,
but friends persuaded her to accept his marriage proposal. ``You
can always get a divorce,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The year after her 1931 marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage
with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ``The Man Who Reclaimed His
Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings.
His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 _
acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This
was followed by a temporary retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, I was getting bored,'' Miss Lortel said in a
1996 interview. ``I thought I'd go nuts, so I started readings at
Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award
and honor except a Tony. She received the first Margo Jones Award
(1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as
well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990).
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1971, and Miss Lortel leaves no immediate
survivors.

 Yahoo Trying To Move Itself Beyond PCs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Yahoo isn't just for personal computers anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara Internet company yesterday said it will extend
the reach of its top-rated Web ``portal'' site beyond personal
computers and to millions of handheld computing devices and
television-based Internet appliances like WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto startup Online Anywhere will provide the technology to
make the connections possible under a technology-sharing agreement.
The financial terms weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of a scramble by commercial Web sites to reach
a growing number of consumers who are expected to snap up non-PC
devices over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Market researcher International Data Corp. estimates the number
of handheld devices will soar to as many as 55 million in the
United States in 2002, rivaling the installed base of home personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our `Yahoo Everywhere' strategy. We are not bound to any
one computing device,'' said Ellen Siminoff, Yahoo vice president
of business development.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's popular portal site _ a one-stop destination where
consumers can converse, shop, get up-to-the-minute news and search
the Web _ is currently viewed by 50 million to 60 million people
monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo intends to reach even more of the computing masses by
employing technology from Online Anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-person company makes software that enables Internet
providers like Yahoo to quickly reformat and deliver their content
to TV set-top boxes, pagers, personal digital assistants, palm-top
computers and wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   Online Anywhere, founded in June 1997, is funded by Motorola
Ventures and venture-capital firm Draper Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help Yahoo users access their personalized content
and services everywhere _ PC or no PC,'' Online Anywhere chief
executive Mohan Vishwanath said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Yahoo is not exclusive, however. Online Anywhere
is discussing similar deals with other commercial Web sites,
including several Yahoo rivals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Nearly every major player in the Internet market, in fact, is
scrambling to make content available to anyone who owns a computing
device.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is already busy building its own ``AOL Anywhere''
service to link the Net to non-PC appliances. AOL eventually
intends to make its service available through high-speed cable
television, telephone and wireless connections.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Microsoft, which acquired WebTV in spring 1997, has also made
clear its plans to saturate non-PC devices with its Internet
content.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Yesterday, Yahoo shares surged $39.38, to $219.13, on news
that its first-quarter profits will surpass expectations and that
its purchase last week of Broadcast.com Inc. will ramp up
viewership and, consequently, sales. Yahoo is scheduled to announce
its results tomorrow.

 New Nasdaq Trust Off to a Fast Start
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
How would you like to be able to invest $100,000 in a single stock,
ignore it for 10 years, and wind up with more than $1.1 million?
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what would have happened if you had been able to
buy a stock representing the red-hot Nasdaq-100 index at the end of
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, back then there was no single stock representing
the Nasdaq 100, which is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial
companies traded on the Nasdaq market and is heavily weighted with
high-technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But now you can buy shares in a new entity called the Nasdaq-100
Shares Trust, which began trading on the American Stock Exchange
four weeks ago with the ticker symbol QQQ. Sponsored by the
recently merged Nasdaq and Amex, and administered by the Bank of
New York, it mirrors precisely the performance of the Nasdaq-100
index.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is priced at 1/20th the value of the index. The
index itself stands above 2,000, and most shareholders steer clear
of stocks priced that high. So Nasdaq and the Amex gave the trust a
per-share value that wouldn't frighten off most investors.
</P>
<P>
   The trust closed yesterday at $111, up $3.78.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq 100 has swung high and low over the years, but on
balance it has been a tremendous overachiever. Since the end of
1988 it has risen more than 1,000 percent, including an 85 percent
gain last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   That was far ahead of the 363 percent gain achieved during the
decade by the S&AMP;P 500 index _ the principal benchmark for money
managers. Another leading index, the Dow Jones industrials, has
gained 351 percent since the end of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of
fast-moving tech stocks such as Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and
MCI /Worldcom, you can amass one simply by purchasing one or more
shares of the trust through your broker.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways to invest in the Nasdaq 100 _ through a
number of mutual funds that also track it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nasdaq trust offers investors two important advantages
over the funds.
</P>
<P>
   First is flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   You can trade them in and out in a single day, and you can sell
them short.
</P>
<P>
   With mutual funds, you can't sell short or day-trade. You must
enter a straightforward buy or sell order, then wait to learn your
price at the end of the day, when the fund manager calculates the
closing net asset value of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Kinnel, an equity fund analyst with Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, says the Nasdaq trust should appeal to active traders who
want to take advantage of the Nasdaq 100's high volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the volume so far, active traders certainly seem to
have discovered the trust.
</P>
<P>
   The trust's turnover has averaged 3.4 million shares per day,
even though there are fewer than 5 million shares outstanding. Its
opening-day volume of 2.6 million shares on March 10 was the
biggest debut in the history of the Amex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleasantly surprised by the trading activity so far,''
says Amex spokesman Dan Noonan. ``We expected this kind of volume,
but not so early on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq trust also offers an advantage for long-term,
buy-and-hold investors.
</P>
<P>
   The trust administrators charge a low management fee _ just 0.18
percent of assets per year. By contrast, mutual funds that track
the Nasdaq 100 charge more than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That can make a big difference in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nasdaq 100 were to match its 10-year growth record during
the next decade, someone who invests $100,000 now would pay a
10-year total of about $14,000 in management fees at the 0.18
percent annual rate charged by the trust.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to pay 1 percent per year to a mutual fund under the
same scenario, your fees would amount to a hefty $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq-100 Shares Trust is modeled after a dozen or so other
index-based trusts that cropped up on the Amex starting in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent among these are the S&AMP;P 500 Depositary Receipt
Trust, which tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, and the
Diamonds Trust, which emulates the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq-100 trust already is producing greater daily trading
volume than any other index trust except the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   It invests in each of the 100 companies in the Nasdaq-100 index,
which are weighted in the index according to their total market
value (price per share times number of shares outstanding).
</P>
<P>
   Because high-technology stocks dominate the index, the trust is
more than 70 percent invested in tech. The 10 largest stocks in the
index account for more than half its value, and the largest of all,
Microsoft, accounts for 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco money manager Stu Pillette says the Nasdaq trust
could be a good choice for investors who want to bet on the future
of high tech but can't decide which stocks to pick.
</P>
<P>
   The diversification offered by the index ``ensures that people
aren't taking the ultimate risk of losing all their money,''
Pillette observes.
</P>
<P>
   But he warns that because tech stocks are so volatile, investors
in the trust could occasionally find themselves on a scary
roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks represent cyclical growth, and they have taken
their lumps from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   But financial planner Richard DelMonte, with the DelMonte Group
in Danville, says: ``You have to have the conviction that the
Nasdaq 100 is a good place to be _ and I happen to be someone who
does. Many of those firms in there are going to be the blue chips
of the future.''

 &HT;    AIR STRIKES CONTINUE AS MORE U.S. FORCES HEAD TOWARD BALKANS
 &HT;    EDS: OPTIONAL TRIMS THROUGHOUT; STORY MAY BE TOPPED WITH LATE
BOMBING INFORMATION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON With bridges, refineries, tanks and troops in their
crosshairs, U.S. and allied pilots used a second night of clear
Balkan weather to press a 13th day of air strikes against Serb
forces in Kosovo and their support systems across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO stepped up its attacks on Serb forces in the field, the
USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier arrived in the Mediterranean Sea,
and its 50 strike jets were scheduled to join the attacks on Serb
positions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those aircraft, and another 25 electronic jamming jets and other
support aircraft from the Roosevelt, will join the growing NATO
force. In addition, four warships and one attack submarine
traveling with the Roosevelt can fire long-range Tomahawk cruise
missiles, effectively doubling NATO's sea-launched missile
capability.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, NATO air forces included more than 400 warplanes
and support craft, roughly half of which are American, including
the supersonic B-1 heavy bomber, the B-2 long-range Stealth bomber,
the F-117 Stealth bomber and F-15 and F-16 fighter/bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will capitalize on the clear weather to attack strategic
and operational targets throughout the operational area. But in
particular, we will focus our attention on fielded forces in
Kosovo,'' NATO air commodore David Wilby told reporters at alliance
headquarters in Brussels. ``We are just starting to him them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton vowed to sustain
``undiminished, unceasing and unrelenting'' raids on Serb forces
and supply lines as the White House opened the door to the
possibility of sending ground troops to Kosovo without a peace
agreement with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted that there were no plans for
NATO ground troops to fight their way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They stressed further that the administration's goal is to
coerce Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
into signing a peace accord that calls for sending 28,000 NATO
troops into the Serb province of Kosovo to oversee the
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, however, there was open talk about the
possibility of sending in ground troops without the consent of
Milosevic, if the NATO bombing campaign brings about the collapse
of Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be one of two things that will happen,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ``He will agree, because of the
punishment that he is currently taking, and will continue to take,
from the air, or his military ability to impose his will on Kosovo
will be so degraded, and in some cases destroyed, that he will no
longer be able to impose his will.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart, ``We will continue this effort, if he doesn't
agree, until his forces are no longer a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart and other officials insisted that the proposed NATO
peacekeeping force which would include 4,000 U.S. troops would only
enter Kosovo in a ``permissive environment.'' In other words, the
administration does not intend to launch a ground war pitting NATO
against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally and officially, a permissive environment implies a
political agreement with Milosevic under which he consents, as he
did in Bosnia, to allow NATO peacekeepers into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly a permissive environment that we envision is one
where there is a political settlement,'' Lockhart told reporters at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a permissive environment could exist without such
a settlement, Lockhart hinted that it could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's an environment
</P>
<P>
   where the Serbs and Milosevic don't have the ability to impose
their will,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That comports with a statement made Sunday by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who told the NBC television network that there
are ``other ways to create a permissive environment,'' besides
striking a diplomatic deal with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said that he has no intention or plan of
sending in ground forces in anything but a permissive
environment,'' Albright said. ``There are other ways, however, to
create a permissive environment...What we are doing is
systematically diminished or degrading his ability to have that
kind of control over the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, Clinton's own statements Monday, while
a bit oblique, made clear that the United States is determined to
ensure NATO control over Kosovo, with or without agreement from
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he will change his calculation, or we will seriously
diminish his capacity to maintain his grip and impose his control
on Kosovo,'' said Clinton. ``Our plan is to persist until we
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL ADD
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With or without cooperation from Milosevic, NATO intends to
create the conditions necessary for the safe return of the more
than 800,000 ethnic Albanians who have been forced from their homes
by Serb terror roughly half of whom have fled Kosovo for the refuge
of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic may think he's finished. We will not be finished,''
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``I think it is clear that
cleaning out Kosovo is not the end of what's going on now it's the
return of refugees to their homes in Kosovo and the rebuilding of
Kosovo and the attainment of a safe, secure, self-governing
environment that is the end state
</P>
<P>
   we're working towards now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air campaign is designed to force the eventual collapse
of Serb military operations in Kosovo. In nearly two weeks of
bombing, the campaign has yet to halt Serb aggression in Kosovo,
but it has destroyed a long list of facilities essential to
maintaining that offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen key bridges had been destroyed by late Monday, as
well as more than a dozen fuel depots and refineries and more than
a dozen ammunition dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Key nerve centers the central headquarters for Serb army, air
force and special police forces have been destroyed, as have
extensive portions of the communications network these forces
depend on to coordinate their activities and order changes in
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative effects of such losses, NATO has said, will
eventually choke the Serb offensive and force a chronic collapse of
the military units conducting it.
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO be required to launch a ground operation in the face
of a Serb retreat, preparations underway to expand NATO forces in
the region would serve the alliance well.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11,000 NATO troops in Macedonia. That force has long
been intended as the vanguard of a NATO peacekeeping operation in
neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Another 8,000 NATO troops are en route to Albania, ostensibly to
assist with humanitarian efforts there.
</P>
<P>
   And the Pentagon is sending 24 Apache combat helicopters, along
with 18 battlefield rocket launchers, 2,000 troops and some Bradley
tanks all to Albania to add to NATO's combat capability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The reason given for the Apaches is to be able to knock out Serb
tanks and troops in support of the NATO air campaign. The Apaches
would be critical, however, to the support of ground operations,
should they be ordered. They were particularly effective in mop up
operations targeting tanks and troops that survived the massive air
campaign in the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches aren't expected to become operable in Albania for
another week, possibly another ten days, said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon stressed that deploying the Apaches does not signal the
introduction of ground forces to the NATO mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting troops into Kosovo right now would lead to vicious
assaults against the
</P>
<P>
   troops that would without doubt end up killing many of the
refugees trying to get out,'' said Bacon.

   Braves drop season opener to Phillies 7-4
</P>
<P>
   By Carroll Rogers
</P>
<P>
   Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves opening day game came complete with
82-degree sunshine, the sentiment of seeing Andres Galarraga
throwing out the first pitch via video, and early optimism.
</P>
<P>
   But what started with a two-run leg up on Curt Schilling and the
Phillies in the first inning came crashing down in the ninth. With
two runs, four Mark Wohlers walks, and a Ryan Klesko error, a tight
game unraveled into a 7-4 Phillies win.
</P>
<P>
   What had been billed as a pitching showdown between Schilling
and Tom Glavine played out like an offensive tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored twice as many runs off Schilling in the first
inning (two) as they did in two games against him last April (one).
Glavine gave up more runs in this start (five in 6 2/3 innings)
than he did all last April (four in 34 innings). After Scott
Rolen's two-run home run in the third inning to put the Phillies up
3-2, no lead was safe until Wohlers' struggles in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Anderson and Brave newcomer Brian Jordan had been dueling
all game for center stage before the Phillies rookie second baseman
eventually won out.
</P>
<P>
   He drove in the trying and go-ahead runs with a two-run
broken-bat bloop single off Glavine with the bases loaded in the
seventh inning and added insurance two innings later with a
run-scoring double off the center field wall. He was 3 for 4 with a
double, a run scored, and three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broken bat broke our backs,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
``Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also went 3 for 4, hit his first home run as an Atlanta
Brave, scored two runs and doubled up Doug Glanville after he
caught a Rolen line drive in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the tough outs didn't come for the Braves on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Glavine) pitched pretty darn good after the third inning,''
Cox said. ``Up until that point, his ball wasn't moving much. After
that, his ball was sinking like crazy. The old Glavine was out
there. He ran into some real bad luck in the seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Bobby Abreu stirring up trouble with an infield hit,
followed by Mike Lieberthal's second hit of the game. Glavine then
settled in and recorded outs on a Desi Relaford bunt and a pop up
by pinch hitter Kevin Sefcik, bringing Cox to the mound for a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine stayed in and intentionally walked Glanville to load the
bases and bring up the left-handed Anderson. Anderson made him pay
with a flare into left center field to score two runs and put the
Phillies up 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel better about my chances than anybody else's so
unless I'm absolutely out of gas and I wasn't,'' Glavine said. ``It
was just a matter of `Do you want to face Glanville?' or `Do you
play the odds and face the left-hander?' We did the smart thing
probably and I made a good pitch and he just blooped one in that
beat us.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring
innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to
the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off-Broadway, died
Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98
and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which
spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in
Greenwich Village, the still thriving White Barn Theater that she
started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New
York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and
the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also
leaves a veritable Who's Who of international theater _ playwrights
and actors, directors, composers and designers _ whose careers were
advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once
said. ``You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way
theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs
too much. The costs are lower off-Broadway, so you can afford to
take a chance, and you must take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference
to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental
summer theater in the barn of the couple's summer estate in
Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it,
to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers
could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch
their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings,
mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero
Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene
Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan
theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding
anniversary gift. The first production in the house, then called
the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt
Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ``Threepenny Opera.'' It caused such a
sensation that the production ran for seven years and put
off-Broadway on the map.
</P>
<P>
   As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ``Off Broadway:
The Prophetic Theater'': ``For thousands of theatergoers, a visit
to the de Lys was the authentic off-Broadway experience.
Off-Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical
experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. ... The de Lys, near
the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood
between the known residential part of the city and the open
seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the
pulsing underworld life of `The Threepenny Opera' and became
sinister, exotic, menacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ``Threepenny
Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so
she persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support
a matinee series as a ``laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran
for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan
Paton's novel ``Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture
of the series in 1956, followed that season by such groundbreaking
productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama
``Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation
of Maeterlinck's play ``Pelleas and Melisandre.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the series offered ``Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a
dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge;
adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish,
W.H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by
O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and
presented actors like Richard Burton in ``An Afternoon of Poetry,''
Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of
Shakespeare and Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson in a joint
dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among
the new writers whose works were presented.
</P>
<P>
   She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences
with a production of ``The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at
Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American
production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright;
it was ``Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J.D. Cannon,
and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in
1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ``Rockaby,''
on Theater Row on West 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as
David Mamet's ``A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ``Buried
Child'' and ``Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl
Churchill's ``Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ``Isn't It
Romantic.'' In recent years, the house, which was renamed the
Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, has been the setting for Larry
Kramer's ``Destiny of Me,'' ``Groucho,'' and ``Gertrude Stein and a
Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video
Award for historical biographies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 38th volume of John Willis' ``Theater World'' (1981-82) is
dedicated ``To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring
efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of
the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose
devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its
proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 Miss Lortel began presenting dramatic productions and
seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included
O'Casey's ``Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ``Last Days of Lincoln''
and Albee's ``Fam and Yam.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, five of
which _ ``As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ``Angels Fall'' by Lanford
Wilson, ``Blood Knot'' by Fugard, ``Sarafina!,'' an import from
South Africa, and ``A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing _ were
nominated for Tony Awards. Several were produced in Broadway
theaters and the others moved to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The Theater de Lys was only one of many unusual gifts that
Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A
chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette
papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to
find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He
had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town
and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his
namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't
transporting Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and
split the earnings with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400
years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally
gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission
to name his purchase ``Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry
passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors
used Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged
double. ``My friends can afford it,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a
houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off
Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants'
quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the
daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Her father was a manufacturer of
women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs
that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home
and although she said, ``I think I went to public school after
that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended
Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of
Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ``The Musical Leader'' of her
graduating class' production of D'Annunzio's ``The Honeysuckle''
described her as ``an exquisite little creature who seemed to be
inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild
production of George Bernard Shaw's ``Caesar and Cleopatra'' with
Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a
small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing
what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike
lines: ``No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed
to the line of men following her.
</P>
<P>
   She met Schweitzer in 1930. ``I wasn't interested in getting
married,'' she recalled. ``I was involved in the theater.''
Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France, he
telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would
get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept _ ``You can
always get a divorce,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that
banns, or official proclamations of their intended marriage, had to
be posted in church for several weeks before the marriage could
take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan
and were married by the captain. ``I wouldn't have anything to do
with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and
even then she waited for two more ceremonies, one at City Hall and
a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain
at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with
Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ``The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,''
but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His
unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 _
acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This
was followed by a temporary retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very
possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ``After a
while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts, so I started
readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from
the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by Canada Lee, the noted
actor, and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a
distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called
``The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed
by a request from Audrey Wood, the agent, who wanted a showcase for
a musical, ``No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened
with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and
board for the actors.
</P>
<P>
   She had a permanent stage built and brought in new and
innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford
University Players and Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe. She
also established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in
Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors,
designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what
off-Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' Eva Le Gallienne once
said. ``An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could
be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were
Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and
Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors
seeking challenges _ Mildred Dunnock, Mostel, Kim Hunter, James
Coco and Peggy Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the
idea of having actors around the estate during the summer. Later,
his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her
endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest
revived.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award
and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on
Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the
Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as
induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from
the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first
theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille
Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City
University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on
display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the
Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive
of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition
at the Westport Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the
League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding
achievements in the off-Broadway theater. Recipients have included
A.R. Gurney, the playwright, for ``The Cocktail Hour''; John
Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center
Theater for ``Woza Afrika!''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous
donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel
Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of
new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere
production was August Wilson's ``Fences''). The Lucille Lortel
Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in
Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual
Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to
dance and music groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater,
theater,'' she once said. ``I have no time for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled
midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived
after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays
she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a
voice calling out ``More! More!''
</P>
<P>
   Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring
role, she often sidestepped the matter of age by saying ``age is a
number, and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year
reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday,
Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will kill my love life,'' she said.

   European oil companies are preparing for an investment boom in
Libya after the nation turned over two suspects in the 1988 bombing

that a recovery could be swifter and stronger than initially
thought.

YUGOSLAVS DISPLAY THEIR ANIMOSITY TOWARD U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Anti-NATO and especially anti-American
feeling has grown steadily among ordinary Yugoslavs with the
bombing of largely civilian infrastructure targets like bridges,
fuel dumps and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than turning the people against their leader, President
Slobodan Milosevic, the attacks seem to have solidified support
behind him, as the commander-in-chief of a Yugoslav nation at war
with the world's most powerful country. While the NATO alliance is
the formal enemy, Yugoslavs seem to be reserving most of their
animosity for the self-styled leader of the alliance, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   An American photographer visiting Novi Sad was nearly taken
captive by infuriated citizens, who threatened to tie him to a
bridge there. Extra care must be taken in conducting random
interviews. One journalist was lightly beaten by some young men
because of his nationality, and another was slapped by an older
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Vicious posters have begun to appear, mocking both Clinton's
goals of a new world order and his purported sexual habits. A huge,
painted message on a billboard overlooking the Brankova Bridge over
the Sava River bears an obscene epithet toward NATO.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, university students and faculty members went
to the trashed premises of the American and French cultural
centers, the British Council and the Goethe Institute to salvage
the libraries there, so they can be returned once the war, and some
of the passion, has finally passed.
</P>
<P>
   As Bombs Fall, Who's Next?
</P>
<P>
   Now that NATO has extended its bombings to government and
military buildings downtown, there is a lot of speculation and fear
about what new targets will be hit.
</P>
<P>
   Misko, a denizen of the Ipanema cafe, says he lives near the
Defense Ministry and can barely keep down his food. ``We should all
go to Bermuda and wait for the year 2000,'' he said, noting in the
next moment that the government has banned all men ages 18 to 60
from leaving the country during this state of war.
</P>
<P>
   His small cosmetics factory has shut down, he said, mostly
because his employees are frightened to go to work during the 12 to
15 hours of daily air-raid alerts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love going to Italy,'' said another patron, 37-year-old
Aleksandar, sipping an espresso. ``I went first when I was 15. I
love the light, the food, everything. In a way, it's our culture,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But the war is isolating Belgrade and the Yugoslavs. Independent
radio and television stations are being shut down, all flights into
and out of the country have halted, most Western embassies are
closed, and most foreigners have fled. ``All of us will end up in
Jagodina,'' Aleksandar said, referring to a town in rural central
Serbia that is synonymous with provincial tedium.
</P>
<P>
   Dragana says she always imagined a life abroad. But now, she
says, she feels ``more and more Serb,'' held to the land here. ``I
can't leave my parents now or our people,'' she said. ``I feel like
a hostage. But in a way, I don't mind. I have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   When another customer ordered a Coca-Cola, Aleksandar reacted
with mock horror: ``That foreign drink!''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting Words
</P>
<P>
   While the Yugoslav government is rationing gasoline, oil and
diesel fuel, state television is having no difficulty finding ample
supplies of incendiary language.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO alliance and its members, by order of the Yugoslav
Information Ministry, are regularly called ``NATO aggressors,''
``beasts,'' ``criminals,'' ``villains,'' ``thugs,'' ``fascist
legions'' and ``hordes of murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's pilots are called ``pilot assassins'' and
described as ``ruthlessly cruel,'' or ``heartless and
unscrupulous,'' while they are said to carry out ``genocidal acts
and crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav citizens and officials widely complain of being
demonized by the Western media.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Yugoslav television has hardly sanctified
Clinton, who is variously called ``Bill Hitler'' or ``Adolf
Clinton'' _ or sometimes, for simplicity's sake, simply
``Fuehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also been given choicer epithets, like ``the
American pimp,'' ``war criminal,'' ``scoundrel'' and, most
elaborately, ``saxophone player, criminal and murderer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Choose Your Dictator
</P>
<P>
   It was not especially surprising that Yugoslav state television
would show the movie ``Wag the Dog'' _ or even ``Apocalypse Now'' _
in an effort to compare NATO's intervention in Kosovo to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But it did come as something of a shock, in a city where
Milosevic's widespread powers are undisputed, to see state
television broadcasting parts of the Charlie Chaplin film ``The
Great Dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns were soon allayed, however, when the newscast that
followed the film compared Clinton to Hitler and NATO to the Nazis,
who bombed Belgrade in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   One Silver Lining
</P>
<P>
   Milan Bozic, the deputy mayor of Belgrade, says the crime rate
here is dropping. The city had an enormous problem with criminal
gangs breaking into apartments, and there was concern that
robberies would increase because of the air-raid warnings, which
cause many people to spend entire days in the shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, felonies like robbery and murder have dropped about
60 percent,'' Bozic said. ``I suppose it's always like this in a
war. There's a sense of shared danger.'' But he also conceded that
another deterrent may be the harsh justice of military courts in
wartime.
</P>
<P>
   The Invisible American
</P>
<P>
   Serbs are a mordant race, and the war has produced both symbols
and posters. Graffiti on a wall says: ``Columbus _ damn your
curiosity!'' In a reference to the downed American F-117A stealth
fighter, one placard at a music rally read, ``The only good
American is an invisible American.''
</P>
<P>
   A postcard shows the plane and says: ``Greetings from Serbia,''
with an earlier bit of poster wit: ``Sorry, we didn't know it was
invisible.'' On the back, there is this injunction: ``If
undeliverable, please return to White House, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Her First Words
</P>
<P>
   Milan called to say hello and describe his life in the shelters,
and he was soon in tears. His 16-month old daughter, Dushanka, has
just begun to talk. ``Some of the first words she's said have been
`siren' and `bomb,''' he said, his voice cracking. ``What kind of
madness is this?''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo are going through
worse trials. ``I can see them,'' he said. ``But when you're under
attack, when you're at war, your world gets very small. There's not
always room for everyone else.''

CHILDREN'S SAFETY NET ON THE MEND IN TEXAS &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ By some accounts, there was only one true crisis facing
lawmakers when they convened in January _ mending the tattered
safety net for abused and neglected children known as Child
Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency appropriation of $8.9 million was signed by Gov.
George W. Bush last week, enabling the embattled agency to
immediately hire 220 new caseworkers and upgrade its lagging
technology. And now lawmakers are writing a state budget for
2000-01 that infuses the agency with millions more.
</P>
<P>
   But questions persist about the adequacy of the lifesaver being
tossed to the ``forsaken children of Texas,'' as one judge called
them in a 1998 plea to Bush and the 76th Legislature. Some
children's advocates say lawmakers, while belatedly applying money
to staffing and logistical support problems, are ignoring their
call for fundamental changes in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, District Judge Scott McCown of Austin said he's encouraged
that ``extremely significant'' sums of money are given to CPS in
both House and Senate budget proposals. The House plan would
authorize the 220 new caseworkers through 2001, but McCown is
rooting for the Bush-backed Senate version that assures an extra
$117 million for 380 caseworkers and an overdue computer upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The House is devoting most of its discretionary surplus money to
education. But if more-than-expected revenues materialize by May,
key House members said they would fund the 380 caseworkers,
computer upgrades, cellular phone acquisition and increased
compensation for foster care providers.
</P>
<P>
   In late April or early May, a House-Senate negotiating committee
will begin resolving differences in the two chambers' budgets. Key
lawmakers say there is a bipartisan resolve to address the CPS woes
that some blame for poor service to the public and even preventable
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Lending urgency to the situation was the recent disclosure that
in Texas last year, 176 children died as a result of abuse and
neglect, a 71 percent increase over the previous year, according to
the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services that
includes CPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked in concert with CPS and Judge McCown in addressing
the issues they raised,'' House Appropriations Committee Chairman
Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   His committee approved a budget that includes $1.1 billion for
child and adult protective services. The sum is based on
predictions the agency will investigate 135,218 reports of abuse or
neglect in 2000, and 143,655 incidents in 2001. The full House will
vote on the committee's recommendations on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems facing the agency, as verified by a
just-completed $100,000 consultant's report, is its high employee
turnover rate that workers blame on heavy caseloads and inadequate
logistical support, officials said. The agency has about 2,700
caseworkers statewide, including about 380 in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have vacancies. Their issue isn't needing more
caseworkers as much as it is keeping the ones they've got,'' Junell
said, adding that caseworker compensation also is an unresolved
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to single out a single agency and say we're going to
raise these folks' pay,'' Junell said. Caseworkers often make less
than $30,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Hine, the agency's executive director, agreed that the
Legislature is responding adequately to the crisis alarm sounded by
McCown and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognize not only the need but the urgency of it,'' Hine
said.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial objective of the budget is improving quality control
over casework by placing more experienced CPS workers in
supervisory roles to monitor the decisions of rank-and-file
caseworkers, Hine said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is hoping to reduce the 7-1 ratio between
caseworkers, who usually handle dozens of cases simultaneously, and
supervisors, he said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The agency is also doing more law enforcement-related training
for caseworkers to help police develop prosecutable cases when
necessary. And in a Tarrant County pilot project, CPS is trying to
increase involvement of treatment providers _ including counselors
and therapists _ in key decisions affecting children.
</P>
<P>
   Hine said the emergency appropriation act provides the agency an
immediate ``jump-start,'' even while final budget figures are being
negotiated for the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some children advocates, including Houston-based Justice
for Children, maintain the efforts are ineffective patchwork and
that for at least a decade, the agency and Legislature have failed
to address lethal flaws in the CPS safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Texas led the nation again with the record-highest
number of child fatalities due to abuse and neglect. Roughly 45
percent of them involved cases where CPS had a current or prior
case of abuse or neglect on that family. Every one of those
children should have been saved had they taken reasonable efforts
to protect the children,'' said founder Randy Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice for Children supports putting more people on the front
lines,'' he said, but ``far too many of their personnel resources
are being devoted to things that don't directly help to better
protect children. We're very concerned that they're throwing more
money at the problem without addressing these deeper issues. It's
going to be a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   Among the fundamental issues, he said, is that ``it's still a
central tenet at CPS that they place the preservation of the family
over the protection of the child.'' A former prosecutor, Burton
contends that approach _ and a reluctance of police to take a
stronger lead in investigations _ continually endangers children.
</P>
<P>
   While this may not be the year for any radical changes in CPS
functions, no overnight cures are in sight anyway, officials said.
The agency ``has been deteriorating over 15 years,'' McCown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one biennium ... nobody should think that what we're doing
is going to create an ideal world for children,'' the judge said.
``But what is being proposed is extremely significant. It's not a
matter of the glass being half full or half empty. They're putting
some real water in the glass.''

UNDER CLEAR SKIES, NATO SHARPLY INCREASES BOMBING MISSIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO directed its most ferocious air strikes yet on
Yugoslav armored forces operating in Kosovo, and struck Belgrade
and the country's two other largest cities Monday night in an
intensified attack made possible by two consecutive nights of clear
weather, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 13th day of the assault, American and NATO warplanes took
full advantage of the second night without the rain and clouds that
had inhibited NATO's earlier strikes, the officials said. The
allies sharply increased the number of bombing missions over
Yugoslavia because of the break. By mid-afternoon in Brussels
Monday, NATO officials said their warplanes had attacked 27 targets
just overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pentagon and NATO refused to specify their targets,
explosions rocked Nis and Novi Sad, the two largest cities after
the capital, Belgrade. Yugoslavia's official television broadcast
scenes of a huge fireball in Novi Sad. The city's mayor said a
power station at an oil refinery had been struck. And officials
said another bridge over the Danube River had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure building on the allies to take action that might
stem the Serb offensive against ethnic Albanians, the allies also
described what would be the first known allied raid against Serb
forces engaged in a specific drive to expel the Albanians from a
village in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the White House Monday with Defense Secretary
William Cohen, President Clinton promised a relentless bombing
campaign Monday and said the United States was committed ``for the
long haul'' to stopping what he said was Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's purge of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' Clinton said in brief comments to a handful
of reporters at the White House. ``The ethnic cleansing of Kosovo
cannot stand as a permanent event.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Our plan is to persist until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of refugees continued to stream out of Kosovo
into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, creating a humanitarian
crisis not matched in Europe for half a century. NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea said that since February 1998, Milosevic had displaced
at least 831,000 of the 2 million people who lived in the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it conducted its military operation, NATO began an
almost equally difficult humanitarian operation to feed and give
temporary shelter for many of the thousands of refugees. The first
five plane loads left Macedonia for Turkey Monday morning, carrying
800 refugees. Several NATO nations, including the United States,
have agreed to take in about 110,000 refugees, providing them homes
until they can return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Albania, where 240,000 refugees have fled, said
that despite that nation's extreme poverty, they did not want other
countries to take in the refugees because sending them away would
only further Milosevic's goal of ridding the region of them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said that his remarks Monday _ some of his
sharpest words yet _ were meant to warn Milosevic that a return of
the refugees was now a precondition of any end to NATO's assault on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``More empty promises and token half-measures won't do the
job,'' Clinton said, appearing at the White House with his national
security advisers. ``If Mr. Milosevic does not do what is
necessary, NATO will continue an air campaign. It will be
undiminished, unceasing and unrelenting. It will inflict such
damage that either he will change his calculation or we will
seriously diminish his capacity to maintain his grip and impose his
control on Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence assessments compiled here in Washington indicate
that Milosevic's forces might well be nearing the end of their
campaign to expel ethnic Albanians from their homes. Some officials
have speculated that Milosevic, armed with that advantage on the
ground, might then offer to end the fighting and return to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Clinton's comments Monday
were intended in part to pre-empt any gestures that Milosevic might
make that would not meet the conditions of the failed peace talks
in France, except for the return of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be a surprise to see in the coming days attempts
at half measures, hollow cease-fires,'' Joe Lockhart, the
president's spokesman, said. ``They will not be acceptable to stop
the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Monday, Clinton restated the goals of the
mission, saying that for the bombing to stop, Milosevic would have
to withdraw his police units from Kosovo, agree to an autonomous,
multi-ethnic Kosovo, accept the deployment of an international
security force and take steps toward a political settlement to help
the refugees return home.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair echoed that resolve Monday.
``We will drive them back to Kosovo,'' he said of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says that the refugee crisis was precipitated
by Milosevic, who has stepped up his repression of ethnic Albanians
in response to NATO's attack, which began on the night of March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's strikes destroyed the fourth bridge of the Danube, this
one near Sombar. The bridge is near Yugoslavia's northern border
with Hungary and far from the fighting in Kosovo. However,
officials have justified destroying bridges, saying they help
resupply Yugoslavia's military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   In raids overnight on Sunday, NATO and American warplanes
destroyed four separate bridges near Kosovo, including one over the
Ibar River at Raska, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also targeted a fuel depot near Sombar and sites at a coal
mining center in Aleksinca, southeast of Belgrade, according to
Yugoslavia's official television. Kursumlija, an industrial town
near Kosovo, was struck Monday night, as was the military
headquarters at Nis, the television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the targets reported by the Yugoslavs were
industrial sites in major cities, NATO officials said they were now
turning their attention to destroying the ground forces waging war
in Kosovo. In the first days of the campaign, some strikes had
destroyed staging areas, barracks and fuel and ammunition depots
directly supporting the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just starting to hit them,'' NATO's military spokesman,
Air Commander David Wilby of Britain, said Monday, before the
latest strikes began. ``The weather as you know, has only just
cleared, to give us a little more chance of hitting them hard.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN GOVERNOR IMPLICATED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING OUT OF OFFICE
AND SIGHT
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY Rumor has it he may have roared off into the
Caribbean in a speedboat _ or may even be dead.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure thing is that Mario Villanueva, ex-governor of
Mexico's Quintana Roo state, failed to show up Monday evening at
the inauguration of his successor in the state capital Chetumal.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva's conspicuous absence at the inauguration fueled
speculation that the tough-talking politician had outwitted Mexican
justice and fled the country before he could be indicted on drug
trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did leave the country, he did so because he thought his
defense would be easier to conduct in a foreign country than here
in Mexico,'' Raul Cardenas, Villanueva's lawyer, told a radio
station Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas claims not to know his client's whereabouts either.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor of Quintana Roo, Joaquin Hendricks Diaz, gave a
speech at his swearing-in, pledging that organized crime and drug
traffickers would be ``frustrated'' by his state's efforts to foil
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, who, like Hendricks, belongs to Mexico's ruling
Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), is not wanted on
trafficking charges _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been indicted, but until Monday he was the
highest-ranking Mexican politician to be investigated so closely on
corruption allegations while still in office.
</P>
<P>
   While he was governor, Villanueva enjoyed a measure of
constitutional protection against being arrested. Now he has none.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Villanueva, who says he's innocent, was interrogated
once by authorities but vanished last week after failing to show up
for questioning three more times.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva could face charges he laundered drug money and aided
some of Mexico's biggest cocaine traffickers _ allegations that
have embarrassed the PRI, which is struggling to overcome a
reputation as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   United States law enforcement authorities say that Quintana Roo,
home of Mexico's famed Cancun resort city, became a ``narco-state''
rife with corruption during Villanueva's six-year term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. authorities reportedly are investigating bank
accounts belonging to Villanueva in Switzerland, the United States
and the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mexico's La Jornada newspaper, protected witnesses
told investigators that Villanueva co-owns an agricultural business
in Panama with the vice-president of Panama and co-owns a ranch in
Belize with a politician in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is rampant that Villanueva may have fled to Panama,
perhaps with a judicial police commander from Quintana Roo.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican newspaper cartoonists are having a field day with
Villanueva's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon in La Jornada has Villanueva whispering into a
telephone from a palm-studded beach: ``Quick, I need something to
help me escape . . .,''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many grams?'' someone on the other end of the line asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I mean something to escape justice,'' Villanueva responds.
</P>
<P>
   If Villanueva is indicted, his arrest could be a coup for
Mexican justice and could please U.S. authorities who are critical
of Mexico's record in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But if Mexico's attorney general presents a persuasive case that
Villanueva is guilty _ but has fled _ the case will be chalked up
as another failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible they do know where he is and can't arrest him
yet because they don't have a warrant,'' said Jorge Chabat, an
analyst with Mexico's Center for Investigation and Economic
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think he's in another country now, and I think it will
take one, maybe two years to extradite him and get him back,''
Chabat told Cox Newspapers. ``That's my bet.''

MICROSOFT JOINS CONSUMER GROUP IN EFFORT TO ADVANCE ON-LINE
PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a step that could advance the cause of on-line
privacy, Microsoft and an influential consumer advocacy group
Tuesday plan to propose a universal standard for Web site operators
to disclose how they use personal information gathered about
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also plans to launch a free product that companies can
use to easily post privacy policies on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some web sites already post privacy policies, but the policies
envisioned by Microsoft and the Electronic Freedom Foundation would
be readable by computers, allowing consumers to automatically avoid
sites whose owners plan to sell their names or addresses, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   The company and consumer advocates envision that in the
not-too-distant future consumers will be able to use Internet
browsers and search engines to avoid those Web sites that do not
meet the consumer's own standards for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a privacy solution that is good for e-commerce,
because it builds trust and confidence, and it is good for civil
liberties, because it gives individuals control,'' said Tara
Lemmey, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an
organization advocating for on-line privacy. The group has in the
past been critical of Microsoft but is supporting the current
effort. ``This is a first step that has to be taken, but it is a
big one.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation and Microsoft plan to ask the body that oversees
Internet standards, the World Wide Web Consortium, to approve new
guidelines that simplify a mechanism for Web sites to post privacy
policies. The privacy policies would not only be readable by
consumers, but would contain coding so that browsers and search
engines could easily analyze a company's plans for the use of
personal information, such as a consumer's buying habits or credit
card number.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's ``Privacy Wizard,'' developed with the non-profit
privacy group TRUSTe, is supposed to help small businesses with few
resources comply with the new privacy standards. The product leads
business owners through a short questionnaire and then turns the
answers into a privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create an easy and simple way for the average
web site owner to create a privacy policy, by asking, `What kind of
information do you collect?' and `What kind of uses do you put it
to?''' said Saul Klein, group program manager of Web Platform
Services at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being very cautious to talk about this as something that
lays a foundation. It's not going to change the nature of privacy
on the Internet overnight, but it is an important catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein warned that if the software industry can not come up with
ways to improve privacy, there will be increasing pressure for
government regulation. He pointed to Europe, where the European
Union already is taking a tougher line on privacy than the U.S.
government, which has favored industry self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said Microsoft's own web pages already have privacy
policies, but they will have to be upgraded if the new standard is
approved, and Microsoft will also eventually have to make a browser
that recognizes the privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts briefed by Microsoft said the step is significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of steps that have to happen for the Web to
really succeed, and one is that the privacy issue has to be
addressed,'' said Kate Delhagen, director of the on-line retail
research group at Forrester Research Inc. ``As consumers realize
how much information is being passed back and forth, they will want
to regain control of that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Delhagen said Tuesday's proposal will make it easier for
companies to post privacy policies, but that companies will then
face the challenge of honoring their own policies.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lavin, research director at International Venture
Associates, also praised Tuesday's step. He said the privacy
movement got a jumpstart last week when IBM announced that it will
only advertise on Web sites that post a clear privacy policy
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this stuff is accepted, it could rush forward pretty fast,
so that you can eventually pop into Yahoo and say, `Find me the
sites that won't sell my name','' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin said the development is also a wise public relations move
for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Microsoft the imprimatur of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, which is important because they have a lot of
credibility and they've never exactly been in the Microsoft camp,''
Lavin said. ``And it certainly doesn't hurt Microsoft to have tight
privacy controls, because selling names is something they've never
done and they don't particularly need to buy any.''

STARBUCKS ADDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Starbucks Coffee Co. announced a new a consumer
products division for its specialty ice cream, bottled coffee
drinks and other products sold away from its own shops. It also
said it will share revenue with CARE from its first month's sale of
a new package of coffees from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new division will be headed by Paul Davis, 42.
Davis has spent 14 years at PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit, most recently
as head of Hostess Frito-Lay Canada. He becomes president of
consumer products for Starbucks, and will report to Starbucks'
president and chief operating officer, Orin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz said the move ``represents our
commitment to building a major consumer products business'' around
``an enduring global brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The new division will take over business that already brought in
$206 million last year, or almost 16 percent of the company's total
sales. Most of it has been joint ventures: the ice cream with
Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream; the bottled Frappuccino with Pepsi-Cola;
and the supermarket distribution of Starbucks coffee with Kraft
Foods Inc. The company has just introduced a line of premium
chocolates in its stores, but made no announcement about any other
channel of distibution.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz noted the company's success in extending the Starbucks
brand and said, ``We are in the early stages of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also continues in its commitment as a major donor to
CARE, for which it has helped to raise $1.4 million since 1991.
Tomorrow, it will begin offering a new package of of coffees from
Guatemala, Costa Rica and Brazil, and will donate $1 per package
sold through May 11. The money will be used to support community
organization in the highlands of Guatemala, as part of a ``civil
society'' project there; girls' education in Nyeri, Kenya, where it
has not been customary to send girls to school; and education in
hygiene and farming practices in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. All are
countries that grow coffee for Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   The new pack is also notable in that it is the first time
Starbucks has offered single-origin coffee from Brazil. Mary
Williams, senior vice president for coffee, said she had not been
impressed with the overall quality of coffee from Brazil, but that
it has been improving. She said this sample, a heavy-bodied,
low-acid variety called Ipanema Bourbon, represents the country's
best.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks also said Monday its revenue was up 27 percent in the
five weeks ended March 28 compared with a year earlier, or 6
percent on a same-store basis. On March 28, the company had 2,192
stores. It had opened 309 in the previous half-year.

BOEING ON TRACK FOR RECORD AIRPLANE DELIVERIES BY END OF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. delivered 148 commercial airplanes
during the first three months of 1999, which industry analysts said
Monday represented a good start toward the company's goal of a
record 620 deliveries by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing in those numbers to suggest Boeing can't do 620
for the year,'' said Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragen MacKenzie.
``This was in the ballpark of what I had expected them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Paul Nisbet of JSA Research, said he was
expecting Boeing to deliver only 139 commercial jets in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured Boeing would get of to a slow start since they
pretty much delivered everything on the tarmac at the end of last
year,'' said Nisbet, who raised his first-quarter earnings forecast
for Boeing from 40 cents a share to 47 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 559 commercial planes in 1998, but in
doing so had to push 191 planes out its factory doors in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jacobs, Nisbet thinks Boeing is well on its way to meeting
its 1999 delivery goal of 620 jets.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Boeing's stock was up .375, a share yesterday,
closing at 34 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The real measure of whether Boeing has turned things around in
its troubled Commercial Airplanes business will come at the end of
the month when the company posts first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing made zero profit on the 559 planes it
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the smallest profit on these planes (delivered in the
first quarter of 1999) will be better than last year,'' Jacobs
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they delivered 140, 150, or 160 planes, it all comes
back to how they are doing on profit margins.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Boeing's highest priorities is reducing the costs of
building airplanes and restoring commercial profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have acknowledged that for too long the
company went after market share at the expense of profits in the
heated battle with European airplane maker Airbus Industrie.
Executives have vowed that will change and they will make a
reasonable return on the planes Boeing sells.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing factories have not been very efficient. And becoming
more efficient will take time.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already warned analysts that commercial margins
will only slightly improve this year, to between 2 and 3 percent.
While that's better than 1998, it is well below the profits the
world's biggest airplane maker once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts will be looking closely at how well Boeing's commercial
margins for the first quarter compare with the 1.9 percent
commercial margins the company posted for the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That will indicate whether Boeing's performance is continuing to
improve, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is below 1.9 percent, then I would start to ask
questions. Are they really fixing anything? But if the margins are
better, that would bode well for the continuation of improvements
in the commercial group that started in 1998,'' Jacobs said
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's commercial production is expected to peak during the
first half of 1999 and will begin to fall off. The company has said
it expects to deliver only 490 planes in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter deliveries this year included 14 classic 737s; 61
next generation 737s; 14 747s; 17 757s; 11 767s; 23 777s, two
MD-80s, five MD-90s and one MD-11.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it delivered 24 military aircraft the
first three months of 1999, including two C-17s Air Force
transports, nine F-15 fighters, six F-18 Hornets; two F-18 Super
Hornets; two 767 AWACS surveillance planes and two T-45TS jet
trainers.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's largest
telecommunications equipment maker, said Monday it agreed to buy
Redmond, Wash.-based Mosaix Inc., which provides customer service
management software, for $145 million in stock,
</P>
<P>
   Mosaix has a staff of about 550 employees, including 300 in
Redmond, 100 in Alameda, Calif., about 60 in the United Kingdom and
the remainder scattered throughout the world, said spokesman Darren
Storedahl.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs or relocations are anticipated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will allow Lucent to expand in the fast-growing
area of ``customer relationship management'' and to increase its
portfolio of products that cater to companies using telephone
customer service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a leader in customer care solutions and technology and
we were looking for a partner to round out our products and
expertise,'' said Janice Anderson, Lucent's vice president for
customer care solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Mosaix's software creates a record of customer transactions,
preferences and buying patterns. Its list of business customers
includes some of the world's top telecomunications, banking,
financial and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also other sectors, and retail is one of them ...
looking for customer relationship management solutions, so that
probably will be an area that will be most active,'' said Nicholas
Tiliacos, Mosaix president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent has complementary products to our own, worldwide
positioning and reach ... and partnering with a company like Lucent
will allow us to access that all the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosaix's software, called ViewStar, allows companies to
stimulate business by indentifying customers' buying patterns and
then marketing products that match customer needs and preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Mosaix's customer relationship management software automates and
streamlines information about customer requests and the tasks
required to fullfill them, allowing companies to manage work
related to customer requests.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, a telecommunications and software giant based in Murray
Hill, N.J., has about 120,000 employees. It researches, designs,
develops and manufactures communications systems, software and
products, including telephone systems, through Bell Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still developing a structural plan but we consider this
acquisition by Lucent to be a real positive for the company and the
people here who have said, `I wish I had the backing and resources
to do what I want,''' Mosaix's Storedahl said.``Working with a
company like Lucent just opens doors for those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the merger agreement, each share of Mosaix will
be converted into 0.1927 shares of Lucent _ $10.77 per Mosaix
share, based on Lucent's April 1 close of $55.875.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange rate reflects the two-for-one split of Lucent's
stock effective April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, expected to be completed in the quarter ending June
30, is subject to the approval of Mosaix shareholders and other
customary conditions. Mosaix has not determined whether the
proposed issue of about 2.8 million shares will be made through a
public offering or a private placement.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent closed yesterday at 58 15/16, up 3 1/16. Mosaix closed at
10 3/4, up 2 3/8.

LIBYA HANDS OVER BOMBING SUSPECTS, AND U.N. LIFTS SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See sidebar, LOCKERBIE-FAMILIES)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTRECHT, Netherlands _ More than a decade after Pan Am Flight
103 exploded over Scotland, killing 270 people, the two Libyans
charged with planting the bomb arrived in The Netherlands on Monday
to face trial for the crime. As a result, the United Nations
immediately removed its severe sanctions on the Libyan government
of Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   The end of those sanctions, in place since 1992,
allowsinternational air travel and the sale of vital industrial
equipment to resume. The step will also release Libyan assets that
had been frozen in a number of countries. But separate sanctions
imposed by the United States in 1986 _ before the deaths over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 _ will not end until other conditions
are fulfilled, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of the suspects in a highly unusual arrangement of
trial in the Netherlands under Scottish judges followed years of
international pressure and months of diplomatic negotiations with
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Americans relatives of the dead expressed some bitterness at the
turn of events, arguing that Libya had won more than it lost. But
others expressed the hope that the extraditions would mark an
important turn on the road to exacting punishment for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa
Fahima, both assumed to be government agents, were brought here
under a complex arrangement that treats a former military base near
here as temporary Scottish territory, so the suspects can be tried
under Scottish law. It was this formula _ promoted by Britain _ of
holding the trial in a third country that finally broke the
deadlock and ended Libya's long refusal to cooperate with American
and British prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish judges presiding over the trial will have to weigh
the still secret evidence, provided by the United States and
Britain and decide whether the two Libyans are guilty of planting
the suitcase bomb. The judges will then face the more fundamental
questions of who gave the orders to blow up the plane and why. The
British and Americans have outlined the main conclusions of their
case, but have withheld the particulars.
</P>
<P>
   Libya handed over the two suspects this morning in Tripoli, the
Libyan capital, to Hans Corell, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
legal affairs, in the presence of envoys from half a dozen Arab and
other nations invited by Gadhafi. An Italian plane made available
to the United Nations took the two Libyans, each accompanied by a
relative and a lawyer, to the Dutch military air base, Valkenburg.
Dutch authorities at first took the two Libyans into custody after
they arrived this afternoon but an hour later formally extradited
them to Britain so the Scottish police could take over.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch military helicopters then took the Libyans to Camp Zeist,
a former military base a few miles outside the city of Utrecht.
Some of the camp's buildings are being converted to include a
detention unit for the suspects and a room for the Scottish court.
More than 100 Scottish officials, including prosecutors, police and
court employees have already arrived in recent days. The camp, once
used by American military and then taken over by the Dutch, is kept
under tight guard by Scottish police.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement Monday saying that he was
``gratified'' by the extraditions. ``Now, at last, the road to
justice has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Secetary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke with about 20 family members of the Lockerbie
victims in a conference call Monday reassured them that the
sanctions on Libya could be reimposed if the Libyan government
backed away from any part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who was deeply
involved in the diplomatic maneuvering leading up to the handover,
said Monday that this ended ``a 10-year diplomatic stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had over a year of hard diplomatic effort and tough
negotiations to get here,'' Cook said. ``There will now be a
criminal trial for that act of mass murder and the relatives of all
those who died will have their first opportunity to hear all the
evidence that we hold in open court.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the most difficult aspects of the case was that
the government had not been able to tell relatives of the victims
of the explosion ``what we know and suspect happened to their loved
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of those who died were on the ground in the village of
Lockerbie, while most of the passengers who died were Americans.
</P>
<P>
   British and American investigators concluded that a bomb was put
aboard the Pan Am flight on its way from Frankfurt to New York
during its stopover at Heathrow Airport. Less than an hour after
takeoff, the Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded in flames, killing its
passengers and crew members. In 1991, Britain and the United States
indicted the two Libyan government agents in connection with the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries, which have gone to great lengths to amass the
evidence for the crash, have insisted for years that the suspects
must face trial in either Scotland or in the United States. When
Libya refused, the two countries pressed the United Nations to
impose sanctions in 1992. The sanctions were toughened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   These sanctions have barred air travel to and from Libya as well
as the sale of arms and spare parts for aviation and for the oil
industry, which is vital to Libya. Although the sanctions were
suspended Monday, the Security Council must still vote to lift them
completely. It can do so within 90 days if the Secretary General
reports that Libya has met other conditions, such as cooperating
with France in its investigation of a UTA flight over Niger in 1989
in which 171 people died and committing itself to pay compensation
to the families of the crash victims in case its two agents are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock was broken last year when Washington and London
took up an old Libyan offer to have the two suspects face trial in
a third country. Libya had argued the two could not get a fair
trial in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's handover of the two follows months of mediation by South
Africa and Saudi Arabia and threats by the United States and
Britain that Libya could be subjected to even tougher sanctions.
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan involved themselves personally in the negotiations with
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the sanctions played a role in Libya's decision, Annan
said Monday, ``I prefer to think they played a role. No country
likes to be treated as an outcast.''He added, ``Libya wanted to get
on with its economic and society development.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the trial at Camp Zeist.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a few weeks ago, senior American officials
described U.S. fighter jet patrols over northern Iraq as critically
important. But when the air war over Kosovo began, those flights
were suspended in order to send combat and support planes to
southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has reassigned the Kitty Hawk, the only aircraft
carrier stationed in northern Asia, to the Persian Gulf to replace
the Theodore Roosevelt, now headed to the Adriatic Sea to help the
Kosovo operation. As a result, the Air Force is putting its combat
jets on alert in the Korean theater, where tensions have been high
since North Korea launched a missile over Japan last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies of cruise missiles are dwindling, and the Air Force is
scrambling to send enough fuel tankers to support both the Iraq and
Kosovo campaigns, according to Air Force officials.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the more striking examples of how the U.S.
military has had to juggle resources as it manages missions on two
fronts: the increasingly complicated military and humanitarian
operations in the Balkans and the low-level air war over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And they are just two smaller ``contingency'' missions which,
under current Pentagon policy, the armed forces should be capable
of handling while still remaining fully prepared to conduct two
major wars. In a four-year defense review completed in 1997, the
United States affirmed that it was ready to fight on two major
fronts, most likely in the Middle East and north Asia, as well as
to carry out ``multiple concurrent'' contingency missions on a
smaller scale _ like those now under way in Kosovo and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But as the air war over Yugoslavia continues with no end in
sight, military analysts are questioning whether this two-war
strategy is realistic. Some argue that the Defense Department has
put too great an emphasis on buying billion-dollar weapon systems
for major wars while failing to prepare sufficiently for the
dangerous missions that the military is actually conducting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does suggest there isn't enough money for these kind of
missions,'' said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution.
``Airplanes are being used so much, but we haven't been buying
enough spare parts, for example. As a result, the tactical fighter
fleet is at its lowest readiness level in this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department is feeling the strain of the Kosovo
mission, which has already cost hundreds of millions of dollars,
according to outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   The pinch is likely to be felt first in northern Asia, where the
departure of the Kitty Hawk, with all of the Navy's combat fighters
in that theater, has compelled the Air Force to put its combat
fighters on alert, meaning longer hours for the pilots and their
crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working 12 hours on and 12 hours off 7 days a week
here,'' said Cmdr. Tom Van Leunen, at U.S. European Command
headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. ``We've asked for extra people
to work with us, because if we don't, we'll get ourselves in the
position where people are too tired to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the Kosovo campaign, Rudy DeLeon, undersecretary
of defense for personnel and readiness, said the U.S. military was
more than ready to fight the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guidance is to deal with a number of contingency
missions,'' DeLeon said then in an interview. ``This kind of
operation is what the military have trained for _ they're using
their professional skills. One of the big challenges is to force
them to take some down time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the war heated up in Kosovo, the United States had to
scale back its mission in Iraq, which the national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, had said was critical to keep Iraq's leader,
Saddam Hussein, in check and prevent him from waging an offensive
war.
</P>
<P>
   The European Command moved 10 F-15 jets and 3 EA-6B prowler
electronic warfare aircraft from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to
bases in Italy and immediately suspended the air patrols over
northern Iraq, according to a military official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The United States and its allies have
continued patrols over southern Iraq, but at a slower pace, using
aircraft based in Saudi Arabia and aboard an American aircraft
carrier in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to juggling the northern Iraq mission, the Bosnia
peacekeeping mission and now the Kosovo air campaign, the European
Command will also be in charge of the military support for the
humanitarian mission under way to help refugees fleeing Kosovo into
Albania and Macedonia. More than 380,000 refugees have been
registered in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard enough with two contingency missions at the same
time out of European Command,'' said Van Leunen. ``Now we have the
humanitarian mission, and these operations are very
humanpower-intensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes are being flown at least two or three times more often
than in peacetime, according to Pentagon and Defense analyst
estimates, and that places greater stress on the equipment, leads
to more breakdowns, and requires more spare parts and more fuel.
The Defense Department has already had to acquire extra jet fuel to
replenish supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base, Ill. which
supplies all the air tankers for U.S. missions around the world,
has sent 53 tankers to Kosovo while keeping the Iraqi mission
supplied. The pace has been nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a busy, hectic time,'' said Lt. Col. Chuck Wynne at
Scott. ``There's more strain because of Kosovo _ on the crews that
fly this aircraft and on their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Some military analysts argue that American pilots are getting
good training, rather than being overworked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have lost a pilot by now if they all hadn't had
experience in the real world,'' said William Arkin, author of ``The
U.S. Military On Line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are overstretched, but it's a prudent use of
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious shortage is in supplies of air-based cruise
missiles after the first week of the war. U.S. B-52 bombers have
dropped roughly 50 such missiles, reducing the Air Force stock by
one-third, and it is unlikely that they can be replaced before the
war is over, Pentagon officials said.

OPTIMISM OVER THE INTERNET'S GROWTH LEADS SHARES HIGHER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market's torrid affair with technology and
Internet companies continued Monday, lifting the three main gauges
of stock market performance to records.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rallied in their first day of trading since the release
on Friday of mixed employment data for March. The news touched off
a strong rally in the bond market on Friday in an abbreviated
session. Stock exchanges were closed in observance of Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The employment report makes it increasingly unlikely that the
Federal Reserve will feel the need to raise short-term interest
rates in the near future, which is a positive for stocks. Still,
traders said that they were not expecting Monday's surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were kind of quiet at the end of last week, and the
positive tone during the morning was quite surprising,'' said
Andrew M. Brooks, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the biggest gains were concentrated
among the largest and best-known leaders of a select group of
industries, from IBM and Microsoft to Intel, Lucent and America
Online. Several financial-services stocks also soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong are getting stronger, and cash is going in to those
stocks that have done well recently,'' Brooks said. ``At some
point, the music is going to stop, but no one knows when that is
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index had all set
records. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was light,
with just fewer than 700 million shares changing hands. On the
Nasdaq, 977.8 million shares were traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are good, but there is no volume,'' said one stock
trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``What trading there
is is all in technology, Internet issues and some financial
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which closed above 10,000 for the first time last week,
did so again Monday. The gauge rose 174.82 points, or 1.8 percent,
to 10,007.33. The S&AMP;P 500 gained 27.40, or 2.1 percent, to
1,321.12. The S&AMP;P 500 gained 27.40, or 2.1 percent, to 1,321.12.

in two months. Bolstered by gains in stocks like Microsoft, 2\.

<P>
   The Dow was led higher by IBM and American Express, which
together accounted for nearly 40 percent of the rise in the gauge.
</P>
<P>
   IBM climbed 6 15/16, to 183 15/16. And American Express rose 4
7/16, to 125 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other Dow components did nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric gained 3, to 114|. And Hewlett-Packard, the
other computer company in the Dow, rose 3 9/16, to 71 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   America Online led the S&AMP;P 500 higher and was again the most
actively traded stock on the Big Board. It jumped 16 15/16, to 166
15/16. The gain propelled the company to ninth in terms of its
weighting in the S&AMP;P 500, ahead of companies like AT&AMP;T and Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, whose previously announced 2-for-1 stock split became
effective Monday, had a big day. It rose 3 1/16, to 58 15/16.
Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T's stock fell 1 1/16, to 77 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Online brokerage stocks soared after an analyst at Credit Suisse
First Boston said online trading rose 30 to 35 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the biggest online broker, gained 9[, to 103].
Ameritrade Holding, the sixth-biggest online broker, soared 29
1/16, to 91|. And Equitable's Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, which
owns a widely used Internet brokerage service, gained 4 5/16, to
71}.
</P>
<P>
   But the session also had some big losers.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen Technology saw its stock fall 3 5/16, to 9 15/16, after
the software manufacturer said it expected to report a significant
operating loss for the quarter ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of Aspect Development fell nearly two-thirds, losing
14 15/32, to 7 15/16, after the software maker said it expected
first-quarter revenue and earnings to be well below analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of the market's advance improved a bit Monday, a
development some analysts said was encouraging. On the New York
Stock Exchange, 1,695 stocks rose, while 1,318 fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last week, breadth has improved a bit, but this is a
very selective market, and it has been for over a year,'' said Al
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis.
``The bears just can't adjust to the kind of market we have right
now.''

<P>
   With consumers spending freely, Circuit City Stores Inc. looks
poised to cash in on a rebound in sales of televisions, cordless
telephones and other electronics, not to mention the growing
interest in all things digital.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a chink in Circuit City's armor: its gamble on
Divx, a technology that allows consumers to pay a small fee for
video movies that do not have to be returned. Each disk costs about
$4.50 and can be viewed for two days _ or longer with additional
payments. Circuit City is selling both the disks and Divx disk
players, which cost about $350.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company does not yet break out its Divx sales, the
product line has been a big drag on earnings so far. For the
quarter ended in February, Circuit City, which is based in
Richmond, Va., is expected to report Tuesday that it earned 85
cents a share, reduced a third by losses of about 31 cents from its
Divx unit, Digital Video Express, and about 9 cents from Carmax, a
subsidiary that resells used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and shareholders clearly wish the company would
just throw in the towel on Divx. Its stock would probably rise,
said David Strasser, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, and
investors would say ``good riddance.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital video disks provide better picture and sound than
conventional videocassettes, but consumers have not yet moved in
mass to the digital products. Even if they embrace the new
technology, they must choose between two competing formats: plain
DVDs that can simply be bought or rented and watched repeatedly,
and the Divx format that requires them to register their players
and hook up to a telephone line. Furthermore, many movie studios,
video-rental stores and electronics manufacturers have been
unwilling to move to Divx.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City is actively seeking another investor in Digital
Video Express and better distribution for the products. Speculation
that it will soon line up a big video rental company to distribute
the disks has driven Circuit City's stock price up recently. The
stock has gained more than 50 percent this year, on the heels of a
40 percent rise in 1998. It now looks expensive, trading at more
than 50 times estimated earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City initially invested $30 million in the Divx
technology after a presentation in 1995 by a Los Angeles
entertainment law firm, Ziffren, Brittenham, Branca &AMP; Fischer,
which still owns a third of Digital Video Express. Since then,
Circuit City's total investment has risen to about $200 million,
more than half of which is in the form of incentives promised to
studios that offer movies in the format.
</P>
<P>
   By most standards, the Divx investment is a small one for
Circuit City, which is the nation's second-largest
consumer-electronics retailer, with $8 billion in sales in the year
ended February 1998, trailing only Best Buy Co. Even if Circuit
City wrote off its entire Divx stake, it would amount to no more
than $100 million, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Divx gambles makes it harder for investors to place a
value on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divx just adds confusion to the Circuit City story,'' said
Brian Berghuis, manager of the $3.5 billion T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap
Growth Fund, a longtime shareholder who says he has recently been
adding to his stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divx has been growing, but the losses are fairly
substantial,'' he said. ``If people could focus on the core
business, Circuit City could get a much higher multiple.''
</P>
<P>
   At its closing price of $75.25 Monday, Circuit City trades at 20
to 21 times its earnings in its core consumer-electronics business,
but at 50 times its total expected earnings for 1999. Best Buy,
meanwhile, trades at about 39 times 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Circuit's share price could climb to 30 times earnings,
Berghuis said, or $90 to $93.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury is out on Divx's prospects. It is competing with
other formats, including basic digital video-disk players,
pay-per-view cable TV and the roughly 91 million videocassette
recorders already in homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Divx technology, which was introduced nationally in
September, is sold in about 720 stores, including chains like Good
Guys and Ultimate Electronics as well as Circuit City, and disks
are also sold over the Internet. In February, Circuit City said 1
million Divx disks had been sold. But some analysts estimate that
as many as half of those were given as bonuses to buyers of Divx
machines.
</P>
<P>
   So far about 800,000 digital video-disk players, including Divx
machines, have been shipped to retailers, according to the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association. Circuit City says it has
sold about 90,000 Divx players, which will play regular disks as
well as those with the Divx technology.
</P>
<P>
   Several big electronics manufacturers, Sony, Royal Philips
Electronics and Toshiba, make DVD players without the Divx
technology. In addition, Sony's film studio and Time Warner Inc.'s
Warner Brothers have said they will not release videos in the Divx
format. And while more than 400 Divx titles are available, there is
a lack of animated movies for children, typically a top
video-rental segment.
</P>
<P>
   A commitment from retailers would help. Viacom Inc.'s
Blockbuster unit, with more than 4,000 stores, and Tandy Corp.,
which has 7,000 Radio Shack stores, have been cited as possible
partners that could provide cash to the Divx subsidiary and that
could begin to carry Divx titles. All three companies declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, while an early detractor of Divx, might go along to
beat Tandy to the punch, some analysts speculate. But Circuit City
probably has some persuading to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many retailers do not want to line the coffers of their
archrival,'' Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer
Electronics Online News, an industry newsletter. With Divx,
consumers would no longer have to worry about video-rental late
fees _ a key source of revenue for rental stores. ``Dealers view it
as a threat to their business.''
</P>
<P>
   And for most consumers, Divx remains a mystery. ``I don't think
most consumers have a desire to have Divx,'' Ms. Costello said.
``It has to be sold to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers balk, she said, at having a telephone line hooked
up to their Divx player and at supplying a credit-card number,
which is used to bill customers who view a Divx disk again after
the initial two-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Berghuis of T. Rowe Price expects Circuit City to cut Divx loose
if things don't shape up soon. ``Either it will be making good
profits by sometime in 2000, or they'll sell it or joint-venture it
to get it off the income statement,'' he said. ``It's clearly a
wild card. I'm not betting on it at all, but it could surprise
us.''

BEIJING PROMPTS AIRLINE TO DIVERT DISSIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A prominent exiled dissident who tried to return to
China was diverted Monday by the airline he was traveling on after
it received a warning from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The plan by the dissident, Wang Xizhe, to test the Chinese
government was thwarted when Beijing warned the South Korean
airline he took from New York, Asiana Airlines, that it would be
held responsible for Wang.
</P>
<P>
   At a scheduled stopover in Seoul en route to Beijing the airline
put Wang, over his protest, on a flight to Bangkok, according to a
human rights group in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   After writing an anti-government petition in 1974, Wang spent 14
years in prison. Then in 1996, fearing arrest again, he went to the
United States. He remains a Chinese citizen, but has no passport,
only a refugee travel document issued by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wang was a close ally of two democracy advocates who remain
inside China, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongming. Last fall, these two
received prison sentences of 13 and 12 years for their part in
organizing an illegal political party.

TREASURIES ARE LITTLE CHANGED AS ECONOMY SHOWS STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities were little changed to slightly
lower Monday, as a rise in stocks removed some demand from the debt
market. Trading was light.
</P>
<P>
   There was minimal reaction to a report by the National
Association of Purchasing Management that its index of
nonmanufacturing business rose to 62.5 in March _ the highest since
May _ from a reading of 57.0 in February.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ablin, president of Colonial Asset Management Inc. in
Jacksonville, Fla., said, ``Last week's NAPM report on
manufacturing activity was so strong that it overshadowed today's
report.''
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 5.58 percent, from 5.59
percent on Friday, while its price, which moves in the opposite
direction, increased 4/32 to 95 5/32.
</P>
<P>
   Ablin said he thought the Fed policy makers were not likely to
be swayed by Monday's report, ``especially if they have yet to be
prompted into action by the 30 percent rise in oil seen over the
last few weeks.'' Monday, crude oil futures marched higher after
the United Nations said that one of Iraq's main pipelines, which
carries oil south to the Persian Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr, had
slowed to about 45 percent of its normal rate after weekend bomb
damage. Iraq blamed Britain and the United States, but the United
States denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   As the American economy continued to show signs of strength and
little deceleration, bond yields have climbed more than a half
percentage point in the first quarter of this year, as investors,
fearing inflation lies ahead, have demanded a greater discount in
price.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Englund, chief economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a
market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said the market
got the employment report it was looking for last week, although
there was limited room on Friday for Treasuries to rally because of
the holiday-shortened session. This week he expects a bullish bias
to trading, based on the employment data, a flight to Treasury
securities because of the events in Kosovo, the unwinding of
Japanese fiscal year-end effects and the attractive level of yields
available.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate debt sales in the coming weeks could limit gains
in Treasury securities, since corporation give investors a higher
yielding alternative to government securities, and firms arranging
these debt sales often sell Treasuries first as hedges against
losses in case rates rise before the sales are completed. Some of
well known corporate names include Conoco Inc.; Korea Development
Bank; Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., which is a General Motors
spinoff, and Union Pacific Resources Group.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the regular weekly Treasury bill auction was somewhat
mediocre. The three-month bills were awarded with a rate of 4.265
percent, a little better than expected, and the six-month maturity
came in at 4.345 percent. The number of bids for the six-month
issue was considered weak, with a ratio of 4.03 to 1.

FIRST-QUARTER ONLINE TRADING SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors executed more stock trades on-line than ever in the
first three months of the year, as the volume of trading via
personal computers rocketed 30 to 35 percent, according to an
influential analyst's report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a study that surprised industry observers and confirmed the
worst fears of traditional brokerages, Bill Burnham of CS First
Boston said on-line brokers processed a record 440,000 to 460,000
transactions daily in the quarter, up from 340,000 in the fourth
quarter of 1998, and double the June 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big, big number,'' said Bill Lauderback, a spokesman
for the Houston-based Electronic Traders Association. ``It's so
big, it's almost scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase was even higher than Burnham's earlier prediction
of 25 percent growth for the first quarter. And it was ``all the
more remarkable'' because it came while growth in all stock market
trades, including those made through traditional brokers, rose just
4.9 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures for on-line trading vividly illustrate the
sudden popularity of Internet investing, the report said, and
``indicate that the on-line trading industry continues to take
market share'' from traditional brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is booming, the market is booming and the Internet
is booming,'' said Lauderback. ``While that lasts, the trend is
going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 7.5 million Americans now use discount brokerages on
line to buy and sell stock, according to industry estimates. About
one in every seven trades, or nearly 14 percent, is executed
on-line rather than through traditional brokers. Drawn by low
commissions, free stock quotes and a wealth of research available
over the Internet, on-line investors have swarmed into the market
since 1997, when just in 14 trades, or 7 percent, were performed on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the recent growth, however, may be related to the manic
rise in Internet stocks themselves, some analysts say. A CS First
Boston report issued earlier in the year concluded that the
``on-line trading industry is a case of Internet users (often
working at Internet firms) using Internet brokerages to trade
Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-line brokerages themselves have been among the main
beneficiaries of the surge in computer trading. Indeed, shares in
the most popular on-line brokerages, like ETrade, Ameritrade and
Charles Schwab Corp., have risen at fantastic rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even the smallest on-line discount brokers are thriving. Earlier
this year, shares of New York-based Siebert Financial tripled in
four days, turning founder Muriel Siebert into a paper billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, shares of on-line brokerage firms soared to record
levels after Burham's report was released. Ameritrade Holding Corp.
rose 29 1/16, or 47 percent, to 91 5/8. ETrade Group Inc. gained 11
3/4, or 19 percent, to 72 5/8. Charles Schwab Corp., the biggest
on-line broker, rose 9 1/8, or 10 percent, to 103 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   The spectre of a vast and growing army of individual investors
hustling into the market with little more than a click of the mouse
has alarmed securities regulators and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying stock over the Internet is not like buying a can of
peas,'' said William F. Galvin, Massachusetts Secretary of the
State, whose office regulates securities trading in the state. ``If
you don't know what you're doing, you're not going to get your
money back. Not everybody is suited for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin's office has received an increasing number of complaints
from investors who say they lost money trading on-line. ``For
experienced investors, it's probably a good thing. But it isn't for
the first-timne investor,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that novice investors will strike out on their own _
without the advice of brokers bound by industry regulations to
limit investors to appropriate levels of risk _ four members of
Congress have asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to do
more to protect the rights of on-line investors.
</P>
<P>
   In response to ``a recent surge of customer complaints,'' the
New York Attorney General's office said in February it planned to
launch an inquiry into on-line brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traditional brokerage houses like Merrill Lynch and
Goldman Sachs said they will launch on-line services to compete
with the upstart on-line brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the wave of the future,'' said the Electronic tradig
Association's Lauderback. ``We're headed toward the day when
there's going to be trading 24 hours a day world wide. And a lot of
it's going to be done over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, the current trend won't last forever. ``As soon
as the economy turns, and it eventually will, you'll see a mass
exodus.''

BROWN MAKES IMPRESSION WITH SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM INGHRAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Take a look around the Phoenix Suns' locker room
before a game or the autograph line after one and it's easy to spot
the big names, the superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Few can pick out Gerald Brown, the former Pepperdine standout.
He prepares for games quietly and alone, while reporters hover
around Jason Kidd and Tom Gugliotta. Afterward, it's the same
routine.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Brown doesn't mind. That's his nature. Quiet,
unassuming. He speaks in a near whisper, almost embarrassed to be
receiving attention for playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Gerald,'' said his mother Wendelene. ``He doesn't
bother anybody and he goes with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of five brothers, Brown has never been the outspoken
type. He was a team leader for the Waves as their shooting guard
from 1993-98, but even then he preferred letting his play do the
talking _ not his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any problems with Gerald,'' Wendelene said,
``except chores. He hated doing the dishes. I had to keep him home
from a game once (during the Arizona state basketball playoffs with
Carl Hayden High in 1993), because he didn't get his stuff done.
The coach understood, but other than that Gerald was a perfect
gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown made sure he finished business at home after that. He also
led the Falcons to a state title in the 5A division, the state's
largest, in 1993. He was the Arizona Republic's 5A Player of the
Year in 1993, earning him a full scholarship to Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 17.1 points and shot 80 percent from the free-throw
line in his final three years in Malibu. He was an All-West Coast
Conference selection in each of those seasons. Impressive enough,
but it didn't earn him one of the NBA's coveted 58 draft selections
last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if Gerald got an opportunity, someone would be glad
they gave him a chance,'' said Lorenzo Romar, Brown's coach at
Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Brown himself didn't expect a chance. So, instead of giving up
on his dream of playing pro basketball, he went to work. Brown
played in the L.A. Summer Pro League and the NIKE Desert Classic in
Arizona. He averaged 19.7 points, seven assists and five rebounds
in the Summer Pro League and eight points and more than four
rebounds at the Desert Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling that I would at least get invited to a camp,''
Brown said. ``And if I did, I would show them how serious I was
about making myself better. All I really wanted was just a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's lockout postponed any moves teams could make. The wait
for a phone call was agonizing. Finally, in late January, Brown
received a call from the Suns _ his hometown team. He went to the
team's abbreviated training camp and signed a contract on Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting,'' Brown said, ``having the opportunity to
play in front of my parents, family and friends for a team I grew
up watching.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown knew the real work was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a rookie and trying to fit in,'' he said. ``Just
being on an NBA roster isn't enough for me. I want to be here for
more than a year.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be enough for almost anyone else, playing with and
guarding some of the world's elite athletes, but Brown constantly
works on his game. An hour before tipoff, when most players are
relaxing, one can find Brown sweating with some of the reserves and
coaches: setting picks, playing defense, taking jump shot after
jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be satisfied with where you are,'' Brown said. ``The
guys in the NBA are the best players in the world and you always
have to be prepared. When you're a rookie, you have to do even
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Romar: ``Gerald is the type of player you have to really
watch to appreciate how good he is. He's not going to be doing all
those high-flying dunks, but he is mentally tough. You can't rattle
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers tried in a recent game. Brown stole a rebound from
Dennis Rodman and was heading for an easy layup before being fouled
hard by Rick Fox. It knocked Brown to the court, and Rodman met him
as he rose. The two exchanged words and a push. Rodman received a
technical. Brown went to the free-throw line and coolly sank both
his free throws. It pulled the Suns within five points and changed
the complexion of a game Phoenix eventually won.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big play,'' Suns coach Danny Ainge said afterward.
``Gerald showed great poise.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, typical of his style, was just happy his team earned a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that big a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It did, however, make an impression on his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerald showed he won't be pushed around,'' said Kidd. ``He
hung in there.'' &QL; 
Never nervous
</P>
<P>
   The first time Gerald Brown ran onto the court at America West
Arena he admitted to some major-league jitters, which calmed once
the game started.
</P>
<P>
   They resurfaced, though, when Ainge pointed and told him to
check in.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was make sure I didn't make a fool of
myself,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Said fellow rookie Toby Bailey: ``It was probably the same for
him as it was for me in L.A. He didn't look nervous, but Gerald
never does.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, born in Los Angeles, lived in the Jordan Downs apartments
in Watts until 1985, when the family decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area was getting worse and worse,'' Wendelene said. ``It
wasn't very safe, and when they are shooting people near your
doorstep, it's time to get out. Even with all that, Gerald never
got in trouble. He didn't get in fights and he watched out for his
younger brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown took to his new hometown, even switching his allegiance
from the Lakers to the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what is so weird,'' Brown said. ``Playing for a team I
used to always watch. . . . I feel fortunate to be playing for the
Suns.'' &QL; 
Getting more time
</P>
<P>
   Brown saw limited action at first and missed about two weeks in
late February with chondromalacia (a roughening of the cartilage
under the kneecap) in his left knee. He's seen more significant
action recently. He averages 8.1 minutes and 2.8 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a career-high 10 points in Portland on Friday in 11
minutes. At 6-foot-4 and a sturdy 210 pounds, he can match up with
big guards. With his deft ballhandling and superb decision-making,
he can also fill in at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try and improve myself every game,'' Brown said. ``You have
to be willing to do whatever it takes. Those few minutes you go in,
you have to play well and not hurt the team. I'm feeling a little
more comfortable, but I have a lot to learn and I hope that if I
keep working hard, I'll get to be around to do that.''

FAMILY MEMBERS TELL OF ORDEAL FOR ALBANIANS STILL IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week, Ismer Mjeku managed to call his uncle in
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, a few times to find out just how
much life had deteriorated in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Food was perilously low, his uncle said. Dozens of people were
huddling in tiny apartments without electricity, afraid to venture
outside. And always _ always _ staccato bursts of gunfire
reverberated in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Mjeku, a Bronx businessman, lost that tenuous
connection to Kosovo, one of a very few reported with people who
are still there. There was no answer at his uncle's house, no hint
of where everyone had gone.
</P>
<P>
   Did Mjeku's uncle move to another hiding spot in the city? Did
he join the exodus of ethnic Albanian refugees streaming out of
Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' said Mjeku, who publishes the
Albanian Yellow Pages Business Directory. ``I can't sleep. I'm not
able to do anything right now. It's like we're in darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   For days now there has been a torrent of testimonials about the
horrors of ethnic cleansing from Kosovo's ethnic Albanians who have
reached refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia. But the stories
from Mjeku's uncle and a few others are unusual, because there have
been so few accounts from people still in Kosovo since the Yugoslav
government expelled foreign journalists and aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Given their secondhand nature, these stories may well be
impossible to confirm independently. And the voices from Kosovo are
likely to grow fainter, because much of the province's
telecommunications network no longer works. At the least, though,
these accounts offer a view on a human scale of the struggles and
fears of daily life there.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Pristina resemble a ghost town, according to several of
the accounts. Running water remains available in some
neighborhoods, but several buildings have been charred or
destroyed. Many stores owned by ethnic Albanians have been looted.
Acrid smoke blankets the area. Nonstop gunfire is the soundtrack to
life.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the days when Pristina was the epitome of a
small, bustling Balkan city of 250,000, with drab high-rise
buildings, small houses with red-tiled roofs and vibrant outdoor
cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, during daylight hours, a few brave souls, usually older
women, occasionally dart outside, running to the few state-owned
stores that remain open. On Friday, cigarettes were available for
the first time in a week. And in the neighborhood where Ibrahim
Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader, lives, a few children
even played ball outside, according to an Agence France-Presse
dispatch with information from Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Some families are staying behind because they feel that it is
the right thing to do, they have said in their phone calls. Kosovo
had two million residents before the war, 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   It is the poorest and least developed part of Yugoslavia, but it
is also a proud place, filled with people who have long embraced
the struggle for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is dangerous to stay, but Albanians are making a statement,
that this is where they belong,'' said one Albanian-American who
has been touch in the last few days with relatives in Pristina,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to estimate how many people remain in the city.
Over all, about one million people are believed to be within
Kosovo's borders, even though many may be en route to Albania or
Macedonia, or confined to places other than their own homes, said
Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   At night now, Pristina is dark and eerily still, say those who
have spoken with people there. There is no electricity after 6 or
so, and those in hiding usually remain in the dark. A few, though,
light small candles while closing the curtains and covering the
windows with blankets to avoid detection by the Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine that you have a city full of life and lights,''
said Isuf Hajrizi, the managing editor of Illyria, an
Albanian-American newspaper based in the Bronx, who had been in
telephone communication with people in Pristina. ``Then picture
that everything goes dark, with smoke and explosions and flames.
It's like Dante's Inferno within 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Hajrizi last spoke to someone in Pristina on Friday, a family
that was hiding in a basement and had a cellular phone. They told
him that no one had slept or changed clothes for days. Food was
running out. And they did not know what was happening even a block
away, or what would happen if they heard the dreaded knock on the
door from troops.
</P>
<P>
   By several secondhand accounts, the troops who have stumbled on
ethnic Albanian families in Pristina have typically given them as
little as five minutes to leave. Some soldiers have demanded money
as well, said Fred Abrahams, the Kosovo researcher at Human Rights
Watch in New York, and some of those who got through by phone.
</P>
<P>
   So those who are trying to remain have been in hiding or have
moved from apartment to apartment, neighborhood to neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, though, more and more people leave. The wait for a
train ticket out of town is now two or three days, the reports say,
even for those forced to leave by the Serbs. And Serbs are
departing, too, on buses or trains destined for Belgrade or other
parts of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Kosovo's other cities and towns remains even
sketchier. Some rural areas appear to be wastelands, with destroyed
crops, burning haystacks and unclaimed livestock wandering through
the fields, said an Albanian-American, speaking on condition of
anonymity, who talked on Saturday with a friend hiding in a rural
area.
</P>
<P>
   Sulejman Gashi, a New York-based correspondent for a Kosovo
newspaper now being published in Switzerland, spoke to relatives in
Kline, a small town 32 miles from Pristina. They told him that they
had been hiding for a few days last week when they were joined by
some unwanted guests: a group of young Serbian soldiers who said
they, too, were afraid of the war.
</P>
<P>
   So together, these strangers waited, Serbs and ethnic Albanians,
united by paralysis, united by fear. That was the last, anyway,
that Gashi had heard; he has since been unable to contact his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is changing from hour to hour, minute to
minute,'' said Elez Biberaj, chief of the Voice of America's
Albanian service, in Washington, who after days of failure finally
made contact on Monday with someone in Pristina _ someone who was
leaving for Macedonia and whom he did not want to name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's under the impression that the police have gotten much
nastier, and she sees no future there,'' he said. ``People are
scared to death.''

NATO SAYS AERIAL PHOTO SHOWS YUGOSLAV FORCES CLEARING VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO officials released a surveillance photograph
Monday that showed Yugoslav forces herding residents from a village
in Kosovo, and said other photographs depicted their homes being
destroyed, in what they called concrete evidence of President
Slobodan Milosevic's campaign to remove ethnic Albanians from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph _ taken on Sunday and shown at NATO's
headquarters in Brussels on Monday _ was one of three that
officials said showed Yugoslav forces clearing the small village of
Glodane with grim efficiency. NATO bombed areas near the village
Monday morning, saying they had aimed at a concentration of armed
forces nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain,
called the photograph ``damning confirmation'' of the terror that
has driven thousands of ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was harrowing evidence of how the Serbian military units
are being employed to force villagers from their homes,'' he said
at Monday's briefing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the United States and NATO have turned more of
their significant aerial surveillance ability to trying to find and
photograph evidence of the reports of atrocities being brought out
of Kosovo by the columns of refugees reaching Albania and
Macedonia, military and intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, none of the photographs taken have shown mass
graves or concentration camps, as some refugees have reported
seeing, the officials said. But intelligence officials cautioned
that most of the surveillance so far has been devoted to finding
targets and assessing damage, not seeking evidence. And the aerial
surveillance, like the bombing campaign, has been hampered by
clouds and rain, which have blocked clear views of events on the
ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Glodane is no more than 10 miles from Kosovo's
border with Albania, an area with some of the most intense fighting
in recent days. The photograph released Monday showed four circles
on the image pointing to armored vehicles arrayed through the
village. In fields across a main road, there appear to be large
groups of people and civilian vehicles, apparently in preparation
for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said the second photograph showed that people and cars had
left the village, while the third showed the village's buildings in
flames. However, he did not release either of those photographs,
citing security considerations without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bosnian civil war, the Clinton administration used aerial
photographs to show the world evidence of the massacres of Muslim
men that took place at Srebrenica in 1995. Officials here in
Washington said NATO would do all it could to provide similar
evidence to the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague, which
is investigating war crimes throughout Yugoslavia and its former
republics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make arrangements to make whatever information
we have available to the tribunal,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said in an interview.

POWER PLANT POLLUTION ON RISE IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After years of progress in the war on smog and acid
rain, air pollution from New England power plants has jumped
significantly since 1996, as the region's electricity generators
increasingly burned cheap oil instead of the natural gas that is
gentler on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report, the sharp increase in power plant
releases of three major pollutants _ including a 41 percent rise in
emissions of a key ingredient in acid rain _ dims hopes that a new
generation of plants that burn natural gas would quickly clear the
region's air by forcing old plants to close.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, oil-burning power plants with an average age of 25
years have been the big winners in the electricity industry, fueled
by oil prices that reached a 12-year low in late 1998. Many of
these plants, derided as ``old dirties'' by environmentalists, are
exempt from federal pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any plant that has a choice of whether they burn oil or
natural gas will burn oil,'' said Cindy Lupi of Clean Water Action
in Boston, part of the environmental coalition that released the
federal pollution figures. ``The only surprise is that (the
emissions increase) is this dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Power plants and motor vehicles are the leading sources of
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, air pollutants that cause
summertime smog, which makes breathing difficult, as well as acid
rain, which can kill aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, New England power plants made general progress
against air pollution, adding pollution controls, closing older
facilities, and burning more natural gas instead of coal and oil.
Sulfur dioxide releases from Massachusetts plants alone dropped by
60 percent from 1989 to 1995, according to the US Energy
Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the results released by the Massachusetts Campaign to Clean
Up Polluting Power Plants show that sulfur dioxide releases in New
England rose 41 percent from 1996 to 1998, and nitrogen oxides
increased by 23.9 percent. Releases of carbon dioxide, believed to
cause global warming, rose by 37.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Setbacks at nuclear power plants, which release no conventional
pollutants, partly explain the increase. Long-term closures or
shutdowns of five reactors plagued the region in 1996 and 1997,
though one reactor in Connecticut reopened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the pollution jump also reflects the slow pace with which
developers have built the many natural gas plants proposed for the
region. Despite years of talk about natural gas emerging as New
England's leading fuel, relatively few new plants are complete, and
a major new gas pipeline from Nova Scotia is still under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   With few gas plants to turn to, a handful of older oil-burning
power plants _ in Sandwich, Everett, and Salem, Mass.; Newington,
N.H.; and Freeport, Maine _ shouldered more of the energy demand,
increasing the region's air pollution in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Canal plant in Sandwich, visible from the Bourne Bridge to
Cape Cod, illustrated the way cheap oil has blunted the rush to
natural gas even at existing plants. Former owner ComElectric shut
down one of Canal's turbines in 1996 to make it able to burn
natural gas, but since the turbine reopened it has burned oil
almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   ComElectric spokesman Michael Durand said that the company ``had
an obligation to the customers who bought electricity from that
plant that we produce it and sell it at the least possible price.''
He stressed that the Canal plant never exceeded state emissions
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the region's energy picture could change drastically as
increased competition comes to the power industry. Under
Massachusetts' industry-restructuring law that took effect last
year, regulators no longer guarantee a profit for power plants,
meaning a plant might close if it loses money.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, such as the Conservation Law Foundation of
Boston, backed the law in the belief that new gas plants would
provide cheaper electricity than the ``old dirties,'' eventually
forcing many of them to close.
</P>
<P>
   So far, almost all the state's major power plants have changed
hands, but the new owners are not closing them down. Southern
Company of Atlanta, which now owns the Canal plant, wants to build
a gas plants at the site, too, but they plan to run their existing
facilities as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we believe that gas is the future,'' said Southern
spokesman Chuck Griffin, predicting that their proposed gas plant,
which could go into operation as early as 2001, would help clean up
the air by replacing power from dirtier plants.
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Sargent of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group, part of the coalition that released the federal pollution
results, said the increase in pollution ``should send up some red
flags'' for anyone who is counting on deregulation of the power
industry by itself to clean up the air.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, deregulation has been ``an ally to cheap and
dirty power.'' In 1998, he said, older plants exempted from the
1977 Clean Air Act rules increased their output by 11 percent in
1998, the first year of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent called on Governor Paul Cellucci to stick with a plan he
announced last fall to impose new limits on older plants, saying,
``These emission increases reinforce the need to have tight
emissions caps for the state's oldest and dirtiest plants.''

SPY PHOTOS SHOW ETHNIC CLEANSING, US SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US military officials said Monday they have
gathered the first clear photo images of ethnic roundups, including
pictures of Kosovar Albanians being herded onto Yugoslav roads and
marched out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the first wave of refugees was being airlifted to Turkey
and Norway, President Clinton deflected questions about the NATO
strategy, saying he did not ignore warnings that air strikes might
speed the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Clinton said he preferred a
critique of his military tactics over ``having you ask me why we
are permitting wholesale slaughter . . . and not lifting a
finger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to prepare fully for the chaos that this kind
of cruelty creates,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the 13th day of NATO airstrikes, the sounds of
explosions rocked Novi Sad, the second-largest city in Serbia, and
the mayor said the power station at the oil refinery had been hit,
according to a report from the private news agency Beta. A bridge
between Kosovo and the western Yugoslav republic of Montenegro was
demolished, the Serb news agency Tanjug also reported. And five
explosions were heard in the southern Serbian town of Nis.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the bombing campaign enjoyed greater success
Monday thanks to a break in foul weather conditions, with officials
reporting successful hits on army barracks, bridges and fuel
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Increased tensions over the bombings, coupled with growing
pressure on the adminstration to detail how it ultimately hopes to
resolve the crisis in Kosovo, were felt as NATO quickened the pace
of airstrikes and fresh US military forces drew closer to the
region, defense officials said. Clinton had approved dispatching 24
Apache helicopters armed with laser-guided antitank missiles, but
it could take as long as two weeks for them to arrive in Kosovo,
and their use in battle still requires another round of approvals
from Clinton and NATO, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With the helicopters, officials expect to be better equipped to
combat a political maneuver from Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, who is expected to propose a peace deal after having
driven out the entire ethnic Albanian population. Milosevic could
``think he's finished,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said.
``We will not be finished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic had hinted during conversations with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov last week that he might try such a
strategy, an administration official said. But the Yugoslav
president has not made any formal offers of peace since Primakov's
visit to Belgrade, in which Milosevic offered to withdraw Serbian
troops from Kosovo only if NATO bombing stopped at once.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic stood defiant in the face of the latest round of
bombings, repeating his accusation that NATO officials are
``aggressors'' and ``criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to warn the Yugoslav leader: ``A Kosovo denied
its freedom and devoid of its people is not acceptable. Our plan is
to persist until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as the Pentagon announced it had obtained its
first set of clear images of ethnic Albanians under siege from Serb
troops on the ground. The images _ which appear to have been taken
by satellite, outside military analysts said _ showed Kosovars
being herded into groups and being marched in procession along
Yugoslav roads.
</P>
<P>
   The aerial shots are not detailed enough to show any atrocities
themselves, Bacon said. But coming on the heels of a report by US
war crimes ambassador David Scheffer, the photographs seem to
confirm the most gruesome of tales relayed by refugees as they left
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In his report to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright,
Scheffer said that after numerous interviews with ethnic Albanians
who had crossed the border, he noticed a ``remarkable consistency
in the refugees' accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said, ``The large and
growing number of consistent reports by the refugees is too
significant to either ignore or understate. Kosovars are shaken
down for their cash, money and their jewelry. Those Kosovars who
resist expulsion from their homes are killed. The basic message is:
`You leave or you die.' Killings and beatings are common.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Scheffer's report, people who had been executed
were left in the streets of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, ``with
no apparent effort to remove them.'' Refugees told tales of
paralyzed Kosovars being shot or pushed out of town in
wheelbarrows. Thousands were reportedly marched from the town of
Podujevo to the train station in Pristina, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe these reports, coupled with what we are learning
from other sources of information, clearly demonstrate that ethnic
cleansing, war crimes, crimes against humanity are occurring in
Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``The widespread and systematic character of
the criminal conduct of Serb military, paramilitary and police
units in Kosovo points to many of the indicators of genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The reported atrocities, combined with increased confidence
among military officials that the infrastructure of the Serb
military was in shambles, buffeted NATO's decision to turn to
high-risk helicopter missions. NATO Air Commodore David Wilby said
his pilots ``will focus our attention on fielded forces in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will disrupt Serbian military operations on the ground,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said, ``They are now open and
vulnerable to this kind of an attack. The Apaches are a very

   NATO estimates that some 831,000 Kosovars _ out of an original
population of 1.9 million _ are believed to have been displaced

ANGELS' COLLINS GOES ALL OUT TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Terry Collins' managerial style isn't meant to
win friends.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless one considers an intense, aggressive, in-your-face
approach friendly.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only Collins' managerial style, it's who he is.
Collins, about to begin his third season as the Angels' skipper,
was taught at at early age that playing hard was the only way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just my style,'' he said. ``My mother told me a story
about how when I was growing up as a little boy, one of the
neighborhood mothers called and said she didn't want me playing
with her son because I played too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins smiles when he relays that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all I ever did. My dad taught me, if you're going to
play, play all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has made that style work as a manager. In five major
league seasons (three with Houston, two in Anaheim), Collins' teams
have had a winning record every season. However, those teams have
never won a division -- he's finished in second place each time.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fault Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the years we've finished second here, we've definitely
overachieved, especially with the injuries we've had,'' Angels
right fielder Tim Salmon said. ``In Houston, every year he was
behind the Atlanta Braves. You can't blame him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' approach can rub players the wrong way. He wore out his
welcome in Houston, and not all the players in Anaheim like him
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough job,'' Salmon said. ``You have to manage 25 guys,
25 egos. You're not going to have 25 guys like you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Terry is he's aggressive and intense and he
wants to get down and dirty. Play hard. If it rubs you the wrong
way, what does it matter? Just do your job. ... Does he always say
the right things? Probably not. But it's easy to throw darts at the
guy in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was hired prior to the 1997 season after the Angels
conducted an exhaustive search for a new manager. It came down to
two finalists -- Sparky Anderson and Collins. The Angels liked
both, but because Collins is younger and the Angels were looking to
the future, he was the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has operated exactly as I had expected,'' Angels general
manager Bill Bavasi said. ``We interviewed a lot of managers, we
did a lot of work. Terry was no exception. We thought we had a good
handle on what we were getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``His intensity has been channeled well. He runs a game great.
He's very organized and thinks ahead. He understands and works with
the media well. He understands and works well with the front
office. He understands and appreciates not only his situation, but
other people's. And he attracts good coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization got the right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Collins became a coach, he was quite an athlete. At
Midland (Mich.) High School, he lettered in football, basketball
and baseball. He had various scholarship offers, but figured -- at
5-foot-8, 160 pounds -- his best bet was to play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He chose Eastern Michigan University, where he played shortstop.
He led the team in hitting in his freshman and senior seasons and
led the team in steals all four. He was inducted into EMU's Hall of
Fame in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted by the Pirates in 1971, he was traded to the Dodgers in
1975, which put him on a course to the big leagues. But not as a
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to coach,'' said Collins, who has a degree in
Education. ``If there was no chance in professional baseball, I
would have coached some place. I love sports and enjoy teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins reached the triple-A level with the Dodgers, but never
got out of Albuquerque as a player. He noticed a trend in the late
1970s of triple-A player-managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `I'd like to try this,' '' Collins said.
``(Coaching) would be another way to get to the big leagues. In
triple-A in those days, they only had 21 players on a team, so they
needed somebody who could play a lot of spots, and it was me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started playing attention to other positions. I listened
to Wes Parker talk about playing first base. I listened to Del
Crandall, I listened to Johnny Roseboro talk about catching. Dixie
Walker was the hitting coach. I wanted to listen to not only what
they taught me, but what they taught other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins began managing in 1981 at Lodi, went to Vero Beach in
'82, San Antonio and then Albuquerque in '83. He was a
player-manager for Albuquerque in '84 and stayed as manager in
Albuquerque through the 1988 season.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' career with the Dodgers hit a road block, however. It
became apparent to Collins that then-Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda
had no plans to bring Collins in as a major league coach, so
Collins approached Dodgers general manager Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred and I talked about it,'' Collins said. ``I was the
triple-A manager for the Dodgers. ... Do I really want to leave the
best triple-A job in baseball? But I decided it was time to make a
change and it was the best move I ever made. Not leaving the
Dodgers so much, but because I started to meet other people. Until
then, I was always known as a `Dodger guy.' Nobody else knew
anything about me, my skills or my knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins took the job as the Pirates' triple-A coach in Buffalo,
where he stayed for three seasons before Jim Leyland made Collins a
coach with the Pirates in 1992. He got the manager job with Houston
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Collins is with a team that has the talent to win. But if
he doesn't win, don't expect Collins to run and hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a kid I lost a game. I was devastated,
crushed,'' he recalled. ``I went down to my room and hid. My dad
came down and asked, `Did you try?' Yeah. `Did you try as hard as
you could?' Yeah. `Then get your (rear) upstairs. There's nothing
to cry about.' ''

 &HT;    Young and no love
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ And now it is as clear as an empty peroxide bottle
why Dmitri Young bleached his hair and his pointy goatee a golden
hue . . . gold hair, Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed me no love,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The `they' in Young's sentence referred to the San Francisco
Giants, who took liberties on the basepaths against the Cincinnati
Reds new right fielder on Opening Day Monday and discovered it
isn't wise to fool with The Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mammoth miscalculation on the part of the Giants,
because they twice tried to take extra bases on Young and twice
looked up to see an umpire throwing up the out sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they thought I was just an infielder (former first
baseman) moved to the outfield and I couldn't throw,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Giants showed him no love, but the 55,112 in Cinergy
Field showed him adulation and adoration after his second assist of
the day. First, he threw out Rich Aurillia at home when he tried to
score from second on a shallow single. Then, Jeff Kent tried to go
from first to third on J.T. Snow's single and Young wiped him out,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd exploded and thunderous applause turned into a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made my day and the only thing better would have been if
we won the game,'' Young said of the standing `O' and his team's
11-8 defeat. In response, Young flung his hands into the air to
acknowledge the accolades. ``After the first assist, I felt great.
After the second one, I even said, `Whoa, now.' On the second one,
I was just going to throw the ball to second baseman Pokey Reese,
but out of my peripheral I saw (Kent) heading for third and told
myself, `No way, Love . . . and I threw it . . . pfffuuummm.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that isn't the entire story. Even though he dropped 15
pounds in the offseason, Young still isn't a commercial for
Metabolife 356. Yet, he beat out three infield hits Monday . . .
one that glanced off the pitcher's leg and two slow rollers to
third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just call me the Golden Flash,'' Young said with a broad-beam
smile. ``What makes people .300 hitters is beating out infield
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would have thought if somebody told him before
Opening Day that he would have three infield hits and two outfield
assists, Young said, ``You're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   What Young is doing in the outfield is the residual of hard,
hard work every day with coach Dave Collins _ hours of it every day
during spring training. And it didn't stop when spring training
ended. Young was out with Collins early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he wants to get to the point where he can play nine
innings,'' Collins said. ``He doesn't want taken out in the seventh
for defense. What makes me so proud of him is that he works so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   People questioned manager Jack McKeon's sanity when he decided
to switch Young from left field, where he played most of the time
last season, to right field because newly acquired Greg Vaughn is a
left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody remembers Young's comical excursions in right field
the few times McKeon played him there last season. More than once,
Young slipped on the wet turf as the baseball skidded to the wall
and McKeon asked him if he needed a skateboard out there, or maybe
a pair of roller skates.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit is all Dmitri's,'' McKeon said. ``He has worked his
tail off . . . hours and hours out there. He reminds me of Tony
Gwynn and how hard he worked to make himself a Gold Glove
outfielder. And he certainly put on a display today.''
</P>
<P>
   Young isn't afraid to tell people that not only did he spend
hours making himself a better fielder, they were hard, hard hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning, it was work, work work . . . and I let it all
hang out, as hard as I could go,'' Young said. ``Some of my
teammates kept telling me, `Slow it down, slow down.' But I'm a man
on a mission. What you saw today is only the beginning. Get used to
it. You're gonna see a lot of it.

generally considered a less severe form of autism. ``We can learn
to pretend to be normal,'' says Ms. Willey, a 39-year-old writer
who describes herself as having ``residual'' Asperger's. ``We just
don't get the point of it the way you all do.'' (Don Ipock/New York

EXTRADITION DEAL DRAWS MIXED REACTION FROM VICTIMS' FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
   (With LOCKERBIE-LIBYA) 
(sw) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the relatives of those killed in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, the extradition of two Libyans suspects brought a
heated mix of reactions on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Aphrodite Tsairis of Franklin Lakes, N.J., saw the
extradition as a positive step in their crusade for justice. But
others, like Stephanie Bernstein from Bethesda, Md., considered the
extradition an insult. She worried that the deal made by the United
Nations to win the extradition would strengthen the Libyan
government and its leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi. Many relatives
hold Gadhafi responsible for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, U.N. sanctions against Libya were
immediately suspended. And after a 90-day review by the
secretary-general, the sanctions could be removed permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libya is victorious,'' said Ms. Bernstein, who lost her
husband in the bombing. ``This is a terrible precedent for how to
handle state-sponsored terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The extraditions marked a turning point in the relatives'
efforts. Through quarterly meetings, monthly conference calls,
newsletters and trips around the world, the relatives have fought
tirelessly to see those responsible brought to trial. They have
also lobbied to make skies and airports safer for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing occurred on Dec. 21, 1988, as Pan Am Flight 103 flew
over Lockerbie, Scotland. All 259 people on board the plane were
killed _ including 189 Americans _ and 11 people on the ground died
from falling wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   So much time has passed, said some relatives, that they had
begun to lose hope of ever seeing the leading suspects in court.
For them, the extraditions brought relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come to really believe that Gadhafi was never going to
turn them over,'' said Peter Lowenstein of Morristown, N.J., who
lost a son in the bombing. ``I would have bet money on it. I think
what happened today was an important step.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lowenstein, others who expressed support on Monday said
their reactions were more practical than heartfelt. Support in the
United Nations for maintaining the sanctions against Libya seemed
to be fading, they said, and Washington was under increasing
pressure to accept the deal or lose any chance of getting Gadhafi
to turn the suspects over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he is put on trial is secondary to me,'' Lowenstein
said of Gadhafi. ``I think if there is evidence during the trial
that he is responsible for this bombing, then it would be his
downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tsairis, whose 20-year-old daughter was killed in the
bombing, said the extraditions brought her closer to ``intellectual
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have emotional closure,'' she said. ``But once
you find out the who, what, why and how of things, it helps give
some intellectual closure _ something you can put away and never
have to worry about again.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who criticized the extraditions said they were
concerned that the United Nations would lift the sanctions without
conducting a full investigation into the Libyan government's
alleged associations with terrorists. And they were concerned that
the two men charged would be given special treatment in jail and by
the court.
</P>
<P>
   They expressed these concerns to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in a conference call on Monday. In criticizing the
extradition agreement, the relatives called the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 ``an act of war'' and ``the worst act of terrorism
against the United States in history.'' And they said they were
disappointed that the American government had given up on pursuing
those who ordered the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a very high price was paid for this trial because the
person who is behind it, Moammar Gadhafi, has negotiated a deal so
that he is protected no matter what happens in the trial,'' said
Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J. ``He's about to become
richer. He's about to have more weapons. And his image has been
rehabilitated by the Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen, whose 20-year-old daughter died in the bombing, said,
``I am going to be in pain and suffering all my life over the loss
of my daughter. And now I have to watch this. Where is the justice
for us?''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives who participated in the conference call on Monday said
Albright told them the United States could veto the U.N. resolution
to lift the sanctions against Libya, if Washington determined that
Gadhafi's government had not complied with U.N. conditions to
renounce terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   And, the relatives said, Albright assured them that if evidence
in the trial against the two suspects in custody implicated
Gadhafi, the United States would be able to pursue charges against
him under international law.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein, however, said she had expected much more. The
U.S. government settled for an expedient end to the investigation,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to think that if something happens to you as you
travel in the world that your government would stick up for you,''
she said. ``Justice is not always swift. There are some principles
worth standing up for. This was one, and our government did not do
it.''

 &HT;    Reds pitching gives way to Giants bats
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It was a day when anybody who lists their
occupation as Major League Pitcher would have been better off
spending the day on the Ohio River in a canoe, especially those
wearing the new black-trimmed Cincinnati Reds uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   For them, black was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot for which to cheer for among the 55,112 in
Cinergy Field who were Reds fans on Opening Day, but pitching
wasn't one of them during an 11-8 loss to the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko, John Hudek and Gabe White were not on their best
behavior and on this day the rest of the Reds couldn't overcome the
slipshod pitching work.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko, standing in on Opening Day for Pete Harnisch, gave up
three runs in the first, then when the Reds came back to within 3-2
in the second, Tomko gave up three more in the fourth to put them
behind, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   More than three hours later, Tomko sat at his locker with his
head buried in his hands, distraught and embarrassed over the six
runs, eight hits, three walks and a hit batsman he surrendered in 3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous about Opening Day, but that wasn't it,'' Tomko
said. ``I was off. Something is not clicking right. My pitches are
not going where I want. Something is wrong and I have to iron it
out. It isn't physical. The ball is not doing what I want it to do.
I'm missing by a foot. It's embarrassing to go out and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Dennys Reyes checked the Giants on no runs over 2
innings and the Reds scored six times in the sixth to bolt in
front, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Hudek on this day was Hudek The Horrible. He gave up a
two-run game-tying home run to Ellis Burks in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating to let the guys down when they come back
the way they did and we have an opportunity to win,'' Hudek said.
``Burks is strong and today wasn't my day. Every pitch I made was
up in the zone. You can't throw bullpen fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudek started the eighth, too, but walked Rich Aurillia. White
replaced Hudek and walked pinch-hitter F.P. Santangelo. The game
went bye-bye for the Reds when Charlie Hayes crushed a home run,
turning an 8-8 tie into an 11-8 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get the ball down and pitched up,'' White said.
``Every ball was over the middle of the plate and you can't pitch
that way up here. It hurt more because of the way the club battled
and came back. I let 'em down and I'm not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one Hayes hit a strong wind blowing in wouldn't have kept
it in the park,'' White added. ``When you make pitches over the
middle of the plate and up, you're going to get hit . . . bad
things are going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The good things were on the offensive side.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Mike Cameron carries no stigma over his defensive
abilities, but there are questions about his offense. So he hit a
two-run home run in the second, showing power.
</P>
<P>
   Then he showed flying feet during the six-run sixth. He was hit
by a pitch, stole second, took third on a wild pitch and scored the
run that tied the game, 6-6, on a grounder to third when he knocked
the ball out of catcher Brent Mayne's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be labeled as just a defensive player,''
Cameron said. ``I want to be known for offense, too. I can hit
.280, .290, .300 and hit 20 to 30 home runs if given a chance to
play and be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, general manager Jim Bowden leaned on the
batting cage watching Sean Casey. When somebody said they thought
Casey would win a batting championship in the next three years,
Bowden said, ``I believe that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey got a good start Monday with three hits _ a double, a
single and a two-run home run in the sixth that snapped a 6-6 tie
and gave the Reds their only lead, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney's first appearance in a Cincinnati
uniform resulted in a three-run home run during the six-run sixth.
The Reds had only two pinch-hit home runs last year _ both late in
the season (Willie Greene on Aug. 5, Tony Tarasco on Sept. 21).
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do my part to get us back in the game and
things almost worked out,'' Sweeney said of the inning that brought
the Reds from 6-2 behind to 8-6 in front. ``In a sense, it didn't
mean anything because we didn't get the `W.' When you get a two-run
lead like that, you gotta shut 'em down. Maybe next time I can hit
one that will end the game with a `W.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As manager Jack McKeon said, ``We saw some positives, that's for
sure. We're going to be all right scoring runs . . . we will score.
If we don't get behind 3-0 in the first, we probably win the game.
Our pitching will be better than what the fans saw. It better be.''

RACIAL DIVERSITY GETS ROLE IN WIRELESS-PHONE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In perhaps the first major telecommunications acquisition to be
described as a ``step forward'' for racial diversity, Ameritech
Corp. on Monday announced a deal to sell roughly half of its
wireless telephone business to a venture led by GTE Corp. for about
$3.3 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   For Ameritech's pending $62 billion acquisition by SBC
Communications Inc. to win regulatory approval, one of the two
companies had to sell a big piece of its wireless operation.
Federal rules prohibit companies from owning multiple wireless
phone licenses in a single market. Because SBC and Ameritech's
wireless units overlap in the Chicago and St. Louis areas,
eliminating the conflict was a clear prerequisite to completing the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   GTE said Monday that it would join with a private investment
firm that has no telecommunications experience: Georgetown
Partners, which is run by Chester C. Davenport, a former federal
government official, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Monday's deal said that SBC wanted to bring
a company run by members of one or more minority groups into the
wireless transaction at least partly to curry favor with William
Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming chairman in 1996, Kennard has said that one of
his main priorities is to increase racial and ethnic diversity in
the communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is deciding whether to challenge SBC's deal to
acquire Ameritech on the grounds that is does not serve the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, SBC said: ``Creating more diversity within the
telecommunications industry is an important goal for a number of
parties, not the least of which is the FCC, which has repeatedly
urged the industry to identify these opportunities. Since we
announced the SBC-Ameritech merger last May, we recognized that the
sale of the overlapping wireless properties would create an
opportunity for us to do well by our shareowners and good by
achieving the goal of expanding diversity within the ranks of
industry ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Notebaert, Ameritech's chairman, said in a statement:
``This sale demonstrates that the SBC-Ameritech merger will bring
substantial new competition into the Midwest, broaden the ownership
of these properties to include greater diversity from the community
and provide customers the benefits of growth and robust
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Monday's deal said that Georgetown Partners
first expressed interest last year in the Ameritech properties that
were up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became clear that Georgetown Partners could not
complete the transaction on their own, we suggested that they
consider a number of other potential partners,'' the SBC statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Davenport said SBC had no direct involvement in
his company's aligning with GTE, which itself has agreed to merge
with Bell Atlantic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in the
wireless industry before it totally takes off,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown Partners will put up about $60 million of the $3.3
billion purchase price. GTE executives said that represented a 7
percent equity interest in the new operation that will run the
former Ameritech operations. The new venture, the executives said,
would have a total equity value of $817.5 million, and Davenport
would be its chairman, reporting to the president of GTE's wireless
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said GTE would raise at least $2.5
billion in debt to fill out the purchase price. Davenport said that
Georgetown Partners would pay market interest rates on the portion
of the debt that it was responsible for.
</P>
<P>
   A GTE statement said that in addition to capital, Georgetown
Partners ``will provide the GTE subsidiary with marketing services
designed to capture demand for wireless products and services in
high-potential but under-served ethnic markets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Davenport, who was an assistant secretary of transportation in
the Carter administration, said he had no special marketing acumen.
Until last year he was chairman of Envirotest Systems Corp., which
tests vehicle emissions. Envirotest was acquired last year by Stone
Rivet Inc. for $266 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a financial player,'' he said. Referring to marketing, he
added: ``I don't have any expertise in doing that, and I never said
that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Monday that he had met with
Ameritech and SBC executives in recent months to help them draft a
list of minority-owned companies that could participate in the
wireless sale, which was coordinated by Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   One of the initiatives of Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the
Wall Street Project, is aimed at encouraging diversity in the
business world. Georgetown Partners was a sponsor of the gala at
the project's annual conference in January, an event where
Davenport said he met with executives involved in Monday's deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' Jackson said of Georgetown Partners'
participation in Monday's deal. ``Since Alexander Graham Bell,
there has never been an African-American qualified to own a
telephone company, because of historical patterns of exclusion.
Never before.'' Referring to the pending Ameritech-SBC merger and
the need for the companies to divest some wireless properties, he
added, ``Given the requirements of the merger, this was a strategic
moment to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition endorsed the Ameritech-SBC merger
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, SBC said: ``The bottom line is that this is a
good business deal for the companies. We also believe the fact that
Georgetown Partners is part of this transaction is a step forward
for diversity and inclusion in the telecommunications industry.''

sites, airfields, air defenses, ammunition depots and bridges,
Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
   In those raids, Yugoslavia's air defenses put up a significant
fight, having held back on previous nights. Pilots encountered
ferocious anti-aircraft artillery and several SA-3 surface-to-air
missiles. However, all NATO aircraft returned safely on Sunday and
did so again by Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes also stepped up the propaganda war. An Air Force
EC-130 broadcast radio and television signals into Yugoslavia,
trying to undercut Milosevic's grip on the official media by
detailing the campaign against the ethnic Albanians and saying that
NATO did not oppose the Yugoslav people, only Milosevic's
government. Other planes also dropped leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   The United States announced plans to boost its relief efforts as
it prepared for the temporary resettlement of at least 20,000
Albanian refugees onto American territory, probably at the
Guantanamo Naval Air Station in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is undertaking a vast relief effort, flying in
10 missions a day from Italy to Tirana, the Albanian capital, at a
rate of more than 65,000 meals per day, or enough to feed 500,000
people for three months. It is also sending tents, sleeping bags
and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the relief effort was so huge that it threatened to
overwhelm the already crowded skies in the Balkans. A Pentagon
spokesman said the deployment of 24 Apache helicopters to Albania
was being complicated by the large number of relief flights already
entering Albania's capital, Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   The relief effort and the deployment of the Apaches is deepening
the American commitment on the ground in the Balkans. The first 40
of 500 Air Force personnel have arrived in Albania, while the
Apaches and a rocket system to back them up will involve nearly
2,800 soldiers, according to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance was part of a near-daily public-relations
campaign to explain and justify NATO's bombing and the American
contributions to it. He has struggled to simplify his message over
time as he tries to prepare the American public for what looks
increasingly like a lengthy and dangerous ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's use of the phrase ``cannot stand'' implied the kind of
drawing a line in the sand that President Bush used to muster
public support against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush said in his 1991 State of the Union address: ``The
community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel
lawless aggression. Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion, his
ruthless, systematic rape of a peaceful neighbor, violated
everything the community of nations holds dear. The world has said
this aggression would not stand, and it will not stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as political pressure builds in Congress over concern
that the United States is becoming more enmeshed in the Balkans
than it initially planned, Clinton has refrained from a
full-throated call to arms, and public opinion remains ambivalent
toward the mission.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress on recess and lawmakers spread around the globe,
it is impossible to gauge the prevailing view of the conflict in
Serbia, but at least some Democratic senators who voted last month
to support the NATO airstrikes seem now to be having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who is
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, warned
Clinton that many senators had voted in favor of the bombing
``against their better instincts'' and that a majority would
probably oppose sending in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not get my vote,'' Torricelli said. Largely because
of strong Democratic support, the Senate endorsed the bombing by a
vote of 58-41.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli also said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, ``had best be
holding their hat in their hands'' because of their optimistic
predictions about the effectiveness of the air campaign.

 &HT;    POW code of conduct 'a mind set' for soldiers
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia, the complicated world of multinational military
objectives has been reduced to a mission so simple the Army
summarizes it on wallet cards.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to keep fighting, and the weapon is the Code of
Conduct for the United States Military.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Pentagon confirmed that authorities in Belgrade
have said they will not follow through on previous threats to hold
criminal trials against Spec. Steven Gonzales and Staff Sgts.
Christopher Stone and Andrew Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The encouraging thing is that after a couple of days, the
Yugoslav government has announced that they will be treated as
POWs,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   But becoming a prisoner of war doesn't end the obligation to
fight, and their status as captives highlights one of the most
intangible but significant aspects of America's military training
program.
</P>
<P>
   America's three captured soldiers must fight Yugoslav authority
by refusing to participate in propaganda, by answering no questions
beyond name, rank and Social Security number, and by accepting no
special favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a physical task, it's a mind set,'' said Maj. Shelly
Stellwagen in the Army's Office of Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting the enemy through mental resistance ``becomes a part of
you when you're a soldier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's based on a code of conduct adopted after the Korean War
that lays out a straightforward obligation of military personnel:
</P>
<P>
   ``The duty of a (soldier) to continue resistance to enemy
exploitation by all means available is not lessened by the
misfortune of capture. Enemies whom U.S. forces have engaged since
1949 have regarded the POW compound as an extension of the
battlefield. The POW must be prepared for this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of that preparation, however, varies from job to
job within the military. Pilots and others who operate deep behind
enemy lines get extensive survival training for life as a POW, but
those less likely to be captured rely almost exclusively on their
conviction to follow the Code of Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, Stone and Ramirez fall into the latter group. They
haven't attended one of the four Survival Escape Resistance Evasion
schools run by the military branches.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they would have been instructed repeatedly in the
importance of living by the Code of Conduct no matter the
circumstances. And they, like all Army personnel, were given wallet
cards with the essence of the code summarized in 10 sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it enough? Good question,'' Stellwagen said. ``Based on the
experience of POWs in the past, it appears to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For retired Navy Capt. Mike McGrath, living by the Code of
Conduct was enough to keep him alive during six years as a POW in
North Vietnam. But he got his training through the SERE school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said McGrath, 59, now an airline pilot. ``I
give it great credit for saving my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath was shot down June 30, 1967 and although badly injured
in the crash he immediately was subjected to physical torture that
coerced him into signing a ``confession'' of war crimes. But in a
last act in defiance, and in the spirit of the Code, McGrath
misspellel iis own name in the signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got mad,'' McGrath said, ``but they didn't make me go
back and change it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the Code of Conduct American military personnel must
strive to live by while held captive by enemies:
</P>
<P>
   A POW must ``think escape,'' must try to escape if able to do
so, and must assist others to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The United States does not authorize any military service member
to sign or enter into any parole agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Experience has shown that, although enemy interrogation sessions
may be harsh and cruel, it is usually possible to resist, if there
is a will to resist.
</P>
<P>
   The POW may never willingly give the captor additional
information, but must resist doing so even if it involves
withstanding mental and physical duress.
</P>
<P>
   However, understand that if taken past the point of maximum
endurance by the captor, the POW must recover as quickly as
possible and resist each successive captor exploitation effort to
the utmost.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the type of detention or captivity, or harshness
of treatment, (soldiers) will maintain their military bearing. They
should make every effort to remain calm, courteous, and to project
personal dignity.
</P>

 (Subs for Gotti-Trial, which is KILLED)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not ``The Godfather.'' It's not even ``The
Sopranos.'' And, Monday night, it looked like ``The Gang That
Couldn't Shoot Straight.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, alleged boss of the Gambino crime
syndicate, pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges Monday
night _ on the eve of his trial, which was to start this morning,
and just hours after his lawyers insisted, once again, that he was
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old son of John J. Gotti, the most flamboyant Mafia
don of recent times, made the plea in exchange for a prison
sentence of six to seven years _ even after turning down a similar
deal last December. Had a jury found him guilty, he would have
faced 18 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers said Gotti changed his pleas after learning federal
prosecutors in Brooklyn were about to indict him for tax evasion
and loan sharking, meaning he would have faced two separate trials.
The deal he struck applied to both cases.
</P>
<P>
   For those who enjoy crackling good stories about the giants of
organized crime, this surprise twist might be just as well. For the
trial of ``Junior'' Gotti would have provided yet another dribble
of proof that the Mafia has seen grander days.
</P>
<P>
   The charges told much of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   When Gotti's father _ the fierce, elusive, and elegant crime
boss, known as ``Dapper Don'' and ``Teflon Don'' _ was sent up the
river in 1992, it was for a raft of felonies, including the murder
of his predecessor, Paul Castellano.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's son _ known to law enforcement agents as ``Junior'' and
in the New York tabloids as ``Dumbfella'' _ was charged with
shaking down an upscale strip joint, running a gambling ring,
robbing a drug dealer, and fibbing on a home-mortgage refinancing
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Mob does today is kids' stuff, it's like a street
gang,'' James Kallstrom, former director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's New York office, said in a phone interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still has a lot of bad characters,'' Kallstrom added, ``but
these are different people, different times.''
</P>
<P>
   The infamous ``five families'' that ran organized crime in New
York once had enormous power. They controlled major unions, were
major players in the concrete and construction industries, the
commercial-garbage hauling service, and the fish and produce
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You paid a certain percentage of your money to the Mob, no
matter who you were,'' Kallstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, the FBI's current New York director, said Monday
that, as recently as 1988, the elder Gotti was raking in $100,000 a
month from construction-industry shakedowns _ personally.
</P>
<P>
   Then the FBI became adept at using the anti-racketeering RICO
statutes, passed by Congress a decade earlier, which allowed agents
not only to arrest individuals but to confiscate their assets and
bust up the whole hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the heads of all the organized crime
families in New York were indicted, convicted, and locked up.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the Giuliani administration stepped in and
imposed licensing requirements on certain industries _ especially
the Fulton Fish Market and the garbage pickup business _ that the
Mafia once monopolized.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gotti passed the titular leadership of the Gambino
family on to his son, there wasn't much left to control.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Mafia's activities today, Kallstrom said, involve
bits and pieces of the economy's dark underside: gambling,
prostitution, and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said that the syndicates still have a hand in
construction, cement, and the garment trade, though much less than
in the past. Some crime families, he said, are expanding into
``nontraditional activities,'' such as penny-stock fraud,
health-care fraud, and telephone-card scams.
</P>
<P>
   While none of this is trivial, it in no way resembles the vast,
pervasive empire that the Mob bosses once oversaw.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the crime families has shrunk as well, to ``maybe
one-fifth'' their size a quarter-century ago, Kallstrom said.
``Even in the '80s,'' the former agent said, ``some families had
300 to 400 members and another 1,000 or so associates that did
their bidding. You just don't find anything like that today.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, it is only natural that, at the end of the century, one
of the top Mafia gangs has been run by the likes of John A. Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents, the past several months, have painted a pathetic
picture of ``Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   When he visits his father at the maximum-security prison in
Marion, Ill. _ or so the videotapes reportedly show _ he spends
practically the whole time sulking in his chair while the former
don yells at him.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate business ventures he has started have all
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The other crime-family bosses are said to dislike him.
</P>
<P>
   He had to call on his sister, Victoria, the author of
best-selling romance novels, to bail him out of jail last
September.
</P>
<P>
   The bail terms were so stiff _ including house arrest and
$24,000 a month to pay for private security guards to watch over
him _ that, last week, he asked the judge to put him back in
prison, on the grounds that he couldn't make the payments. (Monday,
before pleading guilty, he changed his mind, telling the judge he
would somehow manage, after all.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in stylistic terms, he appears the polar opposite of
his father _ overweight, poorly dressed, and driving a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the mobsters today,'' Kallstrom said. ``They're not
Carlo Gambino. They don't have the discipline, the organization,
the code of silence. I'm not saying we respected the old dons _ we
despised them _ but they were different from these young guys
today.''
</P>
<P>
   When his case first came up, ``Junior'' Gotti was going to be
one of 22 defendants _ but in the months since the number dwindled
to two. The others pleaded guilty, chose to cooperate with the
prosecutors, or had charges dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Gotti, too, was about to cop a plea, in exchange
for a reduced sentence. But his sister, mother, and father all
talked him out of it, telling him the federal prosecutors had a
weak case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday night, he had pleaded innocent to all charges and
denied accusations he had any involvement with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, however, Gotti admitted in court in White Plains
that he had ``conspired with a group of individuals forming an
association'' _ the requisite legal language of a mob confession.
</P>
<P>
   The trial would have featured at least one vestige of the
old-style Mafia _ a cast of ex-mobsters with colorful names,
testifying against the defendant, among them, John ``Jackie Nose''
D'Amico, Dominic ``Fat Dom'' Borghese, and Willie Marshall, who
once referred to himself as a ``two-bit leg-breaker.''

ANDERSON LEFT HOME FOR `BEHAVIORAL' FOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Long before the Celtics were scheduled to depart
Boston to come here Sunday, Rick Pitino had made up his mind about
Kenny Anderson. The coach told him not to pack his bags for Central
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Celtics played the Magic at Orlando Arena Monday
night, they were missing their starting point guard, who was more
than 1,000 miles away. Pitino would not get into specifics about
the decision, but he did say there was a standard for how the
players should behave as professionals and Anderson did not meet
that standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did is not real serious by nature,'' Pitino said.
``It's going to be completely forgotten by me (Tuesday). I just
want him to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is not injured, and Pitino wouldn't say whether he had
been fined or suspended. But he did say, ``If I don't stop certain
types of behavior now, it will have negative effects on the team
later.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the behavior of which Pitino spoke took
place during a 91-79 loss to the Nets Sunday at the FleetCenter.
Anderson believed he was playing well when Pitino took him out of
the game. He asked why he was taken out and reportedly told the
coach, ``I want to play.'' Pitino didn't like being questioned and
told Anderson about it. Before the team left the arena, the
decision to keep him off the trip had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said Anderson hadn't done anything that any other player
hadn't done but during a season in which his team has been booed at
home and lost more than most expected, Pitino told his players a
month ago to stay together. That included staying positive and
maintaining professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson released a comment through the team, saying that he has
no bitterness and that it ``was Coach's decision.'' Jeff Wechsler,
Anderson's agent, said that he couldn't comment on specifics
because, ``I haven't talked with Kenny about all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the first disagreement between Anderson and
Pitino. The coach made a point of saying Monday night, ``Kenny is
one of my favorite people _ off the court.'' On the court, the two
have had philosophical clashes that have led to verbal
confrontations. Pitino would like his point guard to set up the
offense as he did in 1997-98 and defend as he never has in his
career. Anderson would like to have more control over the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Pitino have had disagreements on the past two
Sundays. During halftime of the nationally televised game against
the Pacers, Anderson reportedly bristled at Pitino's comments about
his defense (Mark Jackson had posted him up repeatedly in the
half). Anderson opened the third quarter guarding Chris Mullin, who
is 6 inches taller and about 60 pounds heavier than Anderson.
Mullin had a 16-point third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino dismissed suggestions that he and Anderson cannot
coexist, and when asked about a Sports Illustrated report that said
Anderson had tired of Pitino's style, Pitino said, ``I haven't
talked to Sports Illustrated in seven years, so how would they
know?''
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson and Pitino don't get along, cold numbers suggest
that they had better learn fast. This season, Portland owner Paul
Allen is paying Anderson's contract. Next year, the Celtics take
over payments on a deal that does not expire until 2003. The
Celtics will be responsible for nearly $30 million if they don't
trade the 28-year-old guard.

 &HT;    Breastfeeding lawsuit takes aim at Wal-Mart
 &HT;    By Rob Modic
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dana Derungs says she wants a little ``justice''
for herself and her 2-year-old son, Devin, from the nation's
biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Derungs said Monday that an apology and a company-wide
``breast-feeding, friendly policy'' are in order for the
interference, ``humiliation,'' and ``harassment'' she said she
suffered from a female Wal-Mart employee two years ago when she
tried to breast-feed her newborn at a store in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Derungs' attorneys also said the lawsuit they filed last week
could cost the company some money, if it loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is dispensed in terms of money and the question is,
How much is it going to cost Wal-Mart?'' attorney Susan Brasier
said. The lawsuit does not seek a specific amount of damages.
</P>
<P>
   Derungs, of Lebanon, said she was beginning to breast-feed her
young son in the store when a female employee told her to move into
the restroom. Derungs said she refused and left the store. She said
she has never been stopped at other places, including shopping
malls and retail businesses. He said she has not tried to
breast-feed her child at a Wal-Mart since the April 7, 1997,
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Derungs later picketed the store with about 80 others and she
filed a complaint with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. Her
attorneys said a settlement was never reached.
</P>
<P>
   Derungs said she wanted a breast-feeding-friendly policy adopted
at all Wal-Mart stores.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Brown, speaking for the Bentonville, Ark., retailer,
said Monday, ``We do allow mothers to breast-feed at our stores. We
train our associates on this.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Derungs's attorneys, Brasier of Dayton and Robert Stein
of Cleveland, said they believe Wal-Mart has a policy against
breast-feeding in its stores. Besides Derungs, they represent
Jennifer Gore, of New Lebanon, who has said she received similar
treatment at a Wal-Mart store in Trotwood in November 1997. Gore,
who recently gave birth to her fourth child, a girl, did not attend
a press conference at Brasier's law office Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Brown declined comment on the incidents involving Derungs and
Gore because of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said Wal-Mart stores with in-store food courts or snack
bars fall within Ohio's ban on discrimination in places of ``public
accommodation.'' The law covers discrimination against
breast-feeding mothers, Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Derungs' supporters, Linda J. Smith, a certified local
lactation consultant, noted that businesses in Montgomery County
can obtain window stickers that say: ``Breastfeeding Welcome Here''
from the WIC (Women Infants and Children) program at the Combined
Health District of Montgomery County. Georgette Hall, breast
feeding coordinator at WIC, has a list of 29 establishments that
have requested stickers.

FORMER REPORTER NAMES SOURCE IN ENQUIRER-CHIQUITA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ A closely watched case involving crime and the
ethics of journalism took an unusual turn Monday when a former
investigative reporter disclosed in court the identity of one of
his confidential sources for a stinging collection of articles last
year about Chiquita Brands International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The former reporter, Mike Gallagher, 42, testified at a pretrial
hearing that protecting a confidential source was ``one of the
highest responsibilities a journalist has.'' He then proceeded to
say that George Ventura, a former lawyer for Chiquita, had been a
crucial source for his articles about the huge banana company.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was indicted last fall on 10 counts of helping Gallagher
obtain illegal access to the voice-mail system at Chiquita. In a
bargain with prosecutors, Gallagher pleaded guilty to two counts of
stealing voice-mail messages and, court papers show, testified
against Ventura before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's trial is to start later this month, and the hearing
Monday dealt with an effort by his lawyers to suppress tapes and
other evidence provided by Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Among other legal issues, defense lawyers are trying to bolster
Ventura's case by invoking Ohio's ``shield law,'' which is intended
to protect reporters from having to reveal their sources. Ventura's
lawyers maintain that the law is aimed at benefiting not just
journalists but also the public that they serve. Independent
experts, however, say they can find no court precedent in which
shield statutes have been successfully invoked to protect a source
rather than a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony provided new details and the latest twist in
developments that drew the attention of many here and in journalism
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those events were rooted in an 18-page special section that The
Cincinnati Enquirer, the city's dominant newspaper, published on
May 3 challenging the business practices of Chiquita, one of
Cincinnati's most influential corporations. Many of the
accusations, much of them alleging unfair labor practices in the
company's Central American operations, were backed up by quotations
from internal voice-mail messages between lawyers and executives at
Chiquita.
</P>
<P>
   But less than two months later, The Enquirer, owned by Gannett
Co., published a front-page apology, agreed to pay Chiquita more
than $10 million and fired Gallagher, its star investigative
reporter. The apology said the newspaper's assertion that the
voice-mail messages had been provided by a high-ranking Chiquita
official was false and that Gallagher had misled his editors.
</P>
<P>
   A special county prosecutor was appointed to investigate, and by
September Gallagher had agreed to provide prosecutors the names of
his sources and tape recordings of conversations with them, and to
testify at any resulting trial. In exchange, he was allowed to
plead guilty to lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on Sept. 16, Ventura, who had worked as a Chiquita
lawyer in Ecuador and Honduras from 1991 to 1996, was indicted on
charges that he had provided Enquirer reporters the access codes to
the voice mail of two Chiquita lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher's decision to identify his sources struck a raw nerve
among some journalists. Steve Weinberg, an investigative reporter
and former executive director of Investigative Reporters and
Editors, a journalism organization, said in an affidavit filed by
Ventura's lawyers that the disclosing of sources threatened the
ability of journalists to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If investigative journalists violate those contracts and word
gets around, journalists everywhere are harmed,'' Weinberg said.
``In the end, so is the larger citizenry that depends on
investigative journalists to publicize wrongdoing within the public
and private sectors of society.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism, said the Enquirer situation was so unusual
that Gallagher's actions might not serve as a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disclosing a source is certainly an extraordinary breach, but
this fact situation is so convoluted and so odd that there may be
no precedential value,'' Goldstein said in an interview.
``Gallagher had been hung out to dry by his employers and found
himself in an untenable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning Monday by Marc Mezibov, Ventura's lead lawyer,
Gallagher said he routinely tape-recorded conversations with his
sources without their knowledge or consent. (Such taping is legal
in Ohio and some other states so long as one party to the call
consents.) He testified that he destroyed as many as 30 tapes of
conversations with confidential sources the day before the articles
were published, in order to protect the sources' identity in case
Chiquita sued the newspaper. Six to eight of those destroyed tapes,
he said, were of his conversations with Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   But court records and the testimony show that when he was fired
and faced indictment, Gallagher turned over names, notes and
remaining tapes to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Breyer, who is prosecuting the case, said outside the
courtroom Monday that Ventura had come to the attention of
investigators before Gallagher agreed to cooperate. Ventura's
lawyers are nonetheless fighting to exclude the information
provided against their client by the former reporter.
</P>
<P>
   In another detail, Gallagher testified that he informed his
editors at The Enquirer in October 1997 that he had gained access
to Chiquita's voice-mail system. Lawyers for the paper told him, he
testified, that this was a potential misdemeanor under federal law,
but he continued to invade the voice-mail system without the
knowledge of his editors.
</P>
<P>
   The other reporter on the Chiquita series, Cameron McWhirter,
testified that the newspaper's editors had been adamant that
Gallagher never again gain access to the voice-mail system and that
he not use any of the material obtained in the later articles.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently to conceal his actions from the editors, Gallagher
maintained that he had been given copies of the voice messages by a
senior Chiquita executive with authority over the voice-mail
system. Chiquita officials said no one had that authority.
</P>
<P>
   McWhirter said he had never gained access to the voice-mail
system, and he has not been charged with any wrongdoing. In the
corridor outside the courtroom during a break, he spoke angrily of
his former colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gallagher sold out everybody,'' said McWhirter, who now works
for another Gannett paper, The Detroit News. ``He sold out his
colleagues at The Enquirer. He sold out his sources. And worst of
all, he sold out the truth of those stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, who has not spoken with McWhirter since last summer,
was sitting around the corner in the hallway. He said that he could
not discuss his motivations. ``My lawyer's calling the shots now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will be sentenced after Ventura's trial and faces up to two
and a half years in prison.

 &HT;    Six Flags installs metal detectors at entrances
 &HT;    By Kelly Simmons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A TLANTA _ Parents take heart: The only heat your kids should
encounter this season at Six Flags Over Georgia will be from the
summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   New this year to the south Cobb County, Ga. theme park are 18
walk-through metal detectors, similar to those at major airports.
The security devices aren't a response to any trouble at the park,
Six Flags officials say, but rather a precaution for the security
of visitors _ including the thousands who will stream through the
park gates during this week of spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something some of our other parks have rolled out over
the last few years,'' said Terrie Ward, public relations manager
for Six Flags Over Georgia, one of several Six Flags theme parks
nationwide. ``It will ensure that things are not coming into the
park that might cause damage to our guests.''

<P>
   Six Flags parks in Dallas and Los Angeles also have metal
detectors installed at their gates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Guns, sharp items like knives or scissors, and chains that could
be used as weapons are confiscated at the gate and held for guests
until they're ready to leave the park, said Josh Rainwater, a Six
Flags security officer.
</P>
<P>
   Even police officers have to give up their weapons while they're
in the park. Since Six Flags opened for weekends in March, security
officers have collected knives and chains from visitors, including
a gun carried in by a Georgia Bureau of Investigation officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much for everybody,'' said Rainwater, who points
out that even park security officers don't carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials are quick to defend the safety of the
nations's top parks, like Six Flags, and credit them for taking
advantage of the heightened security measures available.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are availing themselves of the latest technology,'' said
Joel Cliff, a spokesman for the International Association of
Amusement Parks and Attractions in Alexandria, Va. ``You can never
be too sure.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ward said no one at Six Flags has objected to the new
policy _ least of all parents bringing their children to the park
for a day of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Collins resident Delores Williams,
who was visiting the park Monday with her husband Ronnie and son
Garron, ``just because of all the things you hear on the news.''

ANALYSIS: JAPAN'S ECONOMY UNDERGOES A REVOLUTION _ BY DEGREES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Since March, a number of Japanese companies have
unveiled extensive overhauls, job cutbacks and internal
realignments previously considered taboo in corporate Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1 alone, four major Japanese companies _ Marubeni,
Sogo, Taisei and Hitachi _ pledged to reform their business
practices, following similar announcements earlier this year by
Sony, NEC and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, investors would have regarded the string of
announcements as a bad April Fool's joke. Everyone regarded
Japanese promises to restructure balance sheets and streamline
operations as little more than lip service to gain a few more
months of goodwill until the economy picked up and sales growth
erased obvious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring implied job cuts, whether outright, through
attrition or by eliminating excess capacity, and job cuts were
socially and politically unpalatable. Therefore, Japanese companies
did not ``risutora,'' or restructure.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, however, more than 25,000 jobs were slated for
elimination at big corporations, and companies promised to
reconsider their investments in money-losing businesses and pare
their notoriously bloated management hierarchies.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been plenty of grumbling from analysts and
investors that many plans fall short of a revolution, they are at
least considered a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   The government's quarterly poll of business confidence showed a
slight improvement in the first three months of this year, and the
stock market has marched ahead, largely on the enthusiasm of
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs of political will,'' said Scott Hartz, global
head of management consulting services at PricewaterhouseCoopers
Management Consulting Services. ``I feel more encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the government's extensive fiscal stimulus packages and
the profitability crisis at corporations as reasons for enthusiasm.
``I think these things do sow the seeds of change,'' Hartz said.
``The big organizations we deal with are talking far more about
Western issues like return on equity that we just didn't hear much
about a number of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true. When Mitsubishi Electric Corp., widely regarded as
one of Japan's more conservative concerns, announced plans last
week to improve its profitability by paring away jobs and
unprofitable businesses, it said the aim was to push its return on
equity above 10 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd.,
considers many of the new plans genuine, compared with a similar
but short-lived spate of restructuring that began in 1993. She
estimates that average return on equity could improve as much as 7
percent from the current 1.4 percent based on the reforms companies
have announced so far.
</P>
<P>
   But the benchmark Nikkei stock index has already soared past
16,000 yen, the level at which stocks would be fairly priced in
anticipation of such a return, according to Ms. Matsui's research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that the gap between perception and reality is
getting too wide too fast,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent
economist. ``That means another kind of mini-bubble is being
created in the stock market _ and we all know what happens to
bubbles in the Japanese stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakamae and others, including some government officials, believe
that the government is getting in the way of corporate reform,
working to stimulate demand to support sales growth that will paper
over problems like excess labor and capacity rather than force
companies to address them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government is doing everything it can to encourage its wary
citizens and businesses to spend. It has launched more large-scale
public works programs, issued shopping coupons, cut taxes and
increased its loan guarantee program.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan has lowered short-term interest rates
effectively to zero percent, which allows overextended corporate
borrowers to maintain that condition rather than take steps to
radically overhaul their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is trying to stop these restructuring programs
from being too aggressive,'' said Craig Chudler, the equity
strategist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. ``These credit
guarantees, the bank bailout, they're all an effort to get
companies to survive rather than having them fail and making way
for new types of business.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others argue that the government is simply unprepared for
the social costs from unemployment and bankruptcies that would
accompany a major overhaul of the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the job cuts that have caught the eyes of investors are,
at a closer glance, often merely promises to restrict employment
and encourage early retirement. Only a handful of companies in
extreme distress have announced plans to close factories or
production lines.
</P>
<P>
   Chudler said his analysis suggested that despite all the
cost-cutting that has been announced, costs as a percent of sales
would rise again this year _ having already posted an all-time high
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are nonetheless buying into the promises.
</P>
<P>
   Take Mitsubishi Electric's pledge to eliminate 14,500 jobs in
three years, which has helped push its stock price up more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the cuts will be achieved by the time-honored
Japanese practice of shifting workers to the company's affiliates
and universities _ in other words, by passing the problem on.
``They're concentrating the profit in the part of the company
that's visible and shoving the problems into the part that's not,''
said Scott Foster, who follows the company for ING Barings in
Tokyo. ``There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not what they're
painting it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the company noted that it would evaluate its
consistently unprofitable businesses for the next fiscal year with
an eye toward spinning them off, closing them or otherwise getting
out of them. ``You'd think they'd already know which businesses
have problems,'' Foster said. ``This is just more playing for
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also identified several ``core'' businesses that
analysts would prefer to see it exit, like home electronics and
automotive electronics. It remains committed to cell phones, for
example, after having sold a cell phone manufacturing plant in the
United States to Selectron, from which it now buys cell phone
units. ``That suggests that Selectron is the lower cost
manufacturer,'' Foster said. ``If they've been forced out of the
cell phone business in the U.S., the business should be considered
a candidate for some kind of divestiture, but it doesn't appear
they're thinking that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Electric is only one recent example of the type of
restructuring that Chudler compares to a Noh play, a rigidly
stylized, traditional form of Japanese drama. ``In Noh,'' he said,
``it can take an actor 35 minutes just to get from one side of the
stage to the other, and that's what I think of when I hear about
many of these plans.''

ANTI-TUMOR AGENT MAY ALSO GAIN ROLE AGAINST HEART DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Endostatin, a compound that has been in the news for its
promising ability to cut off the blood supply to tumors in animals,
has now been shown to reduce the buildup of plaque, the fatty
deposits that clog the heart's blood vessels. The finding could
open new approaches to treating coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
   Plaque is a layer of cells, interspersed with cholesterol
deposits, that accumulates underneath the inner lining of arteries.
When the plaque gets thick enough, a network of fine blood vessels
known as capillaries sprouts up to feed the cells oxygen and
nutrients. Large arteries have their own blood supply system, from
which the plaque-feeding capillaries arise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen S. Moulton and colleagues at Children's Hospital in
Boston and other institutions have now shown that in a strain of
mice prone to develop plaque-laden arteries, the usual rate of
plaque growth is sharply reduced both by endostatin and by another
substance, TNP-470, which also inhibits the growth of capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, published in Monday's issue of the journal
Circulation, establishes that growth of plaque in mice can be
limited by restricting its blood supply, and raises interesting
possibilities for treating heart disease in people. But the
implications are far from straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Capillary growth is only one of several factors involved in
plaque accumulation. And any treatment that made a target of the
plaque-nourishing capillaries would have to avoid inhibiting
another kind of blood vessel: the new collateral vessels that the
body tries to build in order to allow blood flow to get around
coronary blockages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of a seminal publication is that it raises more
questions than it answers,'' Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner said of Dr.
Moulton's work, writing in an editorial in Circulation. Isner, at
St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, and other researchers
have recently had promising results in treating coronary artery
disease by spurring the growth of collaterals. He introduces the
gene that makes an agent known as VEGF, for vascular endothelial
growth factor, which has the opposite effect of endostatin's.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Moulton said the two diametrically opposed treatments might
in practice prove reconcilable by being useful at different stages
of heart disease. Capillary-inhibiting substances might help retard
or prevent plaque buildup early in the course of the disease, she
said. Collaterals tend to appear at an advanced stage of heart
disease, when a coronary artery is more than 90 percent obstructed,
and that would be the time to use vessel-enhancing substances like
VEGF.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll have to learn a lot to find out how these two
somewhat paradoxical treatments can be applied to the same
disease,'' Dr. Moulton said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Moulton works in the laboratory of Dr. Judah Folkman, who
has pioneered the exploration of capillary-inhibiting substances
like endostatin for treating tumors. Folkman said Dr. Moulton's
work provided some reassurance that if in the future endostatin or
its relatives should be approved for treating cancer, patients
could receive the drug without making worse any heart disease they
might have.

MEXICO HUNTS FOR GOVERNOR IN DRUG CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHETUMAL, Mexico _ Mario Villanueva Madrid, the governor of the
state of Quintana Roo who disappeared last month after authorities
announced that he was the target of a drug investigation, failed to
appear Monday at a swearing-in ceremony for his successor. It was
the final day of Villanueva's six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   His absence shattered protocol and decades of Mexican political
tradition and strengthened speculation that Villanueva may have
decided to flee underground to avoid possible arrest, since his
constitutional immunity from criminal prosecution ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican authorities did not immediately issue an arrest
order, and they made no attempt to clarify the status of the
criminal investigation they have been attempting to assemble
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they dished up a series of indignities for Villanueva
on Monday, signaling that he will be treated as a pariah now that
he has left office.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, federal authorities said they intended to audit
Villanueva's books. Here in Chetumal, the new governor, Joaquin
Hendricks Diaz, who is also from President Ernesto Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, said he intended to conduct his
own separate audits. He also criticized Villanueva obliquely in his
inaugural speech in a baseball stadium here before hundreds of top
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its important for all authorities to obey the law,'' Hendricks
said. ``And let it be clear that the efforts of the narcotics
trafficking organizations to establish themselves in Quintana Roo
will be frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the party president said the party will not defend
Villanueva if he has committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any case in modern Mexican history in which an
outgoing governor has failed to appear at his successor's
inauguration because he is fleeing the law,'' said Jorge Chabat, a
political scientist. ``Governors have never faced this kind of
investigative scrutiny before. Clearly some rules of the political
system are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. officials have repeatedly accused Villanueva of
protecting the drug traffickers who have turned Quintana Roo, the
sun-washed Caribbean state that includes Cancun, into a major
cocaine transshipment center. But he has not been charged with any
crime, and he is not a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, however, Villanueva has ignored several
citations to appear before federal anti-drug prosecutors, and his
associates have said he feared legal and political persecution
after he left office.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pursue an investigation of Villanueva, which
would focus on accusations of common graft rather than narcotics
corruption, suggests that Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, Mexico's attorney
general, may have been unable to assemble an airtight drug case.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Andrade, Villanueva's spokesman until Monday, said in an
interview that Villanueva's wife, Isabel Tenorio, and his two
children, ``are leading a normal life here.'' But he said he has
not seen Villanueva since March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario is going to surprise us all,'' Andrade said. ``I know
him well. He doesn't flee from his problems.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ In a case that galvanized national outrage over
anti-homosexual violence, a 21-year-old roofer pleaded guilty on
Monday to kidnapping and murdering a gay college student and was
sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was
sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the
beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months
ago. Police said Henderson and another man had pretended to be gays
to lure Shepard to his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are deserving the fullest punishment this court can mete
out,'' the judge said, after accepting a plea bargain agreement two
days before opening arguments were to begin in the case. In a sole
reference to Shepard's sexual orientation, the judge said the
murder was ``part because of his lifestyle, part for a $20
robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   During an emotion-packed hearing at the Albany County Courthouse
here, Henderson turned to Judy and Dennis Shepard and apologized
for murdering their 22-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson then turned on his former friend, Aaron J. McKinney,
saying that McKinney was the mastermind of the Oct. 6 kidnapping of
Shepard from a bar here.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers observing the case speculated that prosecutors had
dropped their bid for a death sentence in return for Henderson's
testimony at McKinney's trial this August on the same charges.
After listening impassively to this testimony, the judge turned to
Henderson and said: ``This court does not believe you feel any true
remorse in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that he faced an ``academic choice,'' Donnell chose
the harsher sentencing alternative, two life sentences to be served
consecutively, rather than concurrently. In his final comments
before the defendant was led away to spend the rest of his life in
jail, the judge told him, ``You are not a victim here, Mr.
Henderson, you are a perpetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming legal experts said on Monday there was virtually no
chance that Henderson would ever be eligible for parole. In recent
weeks, a Wyoming coalition of clergy and a national coalition of
gay groups spoke out against applying the death penalty in the
Matthew Shepard case, a position they said was in harmony with
their wider opposition to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Compressing an enormous amount of drama into a one-hour hearing,
the court proceedings included the Shepards telling Henderson of
their deep pain, the defendant giving his first public account of
the crime, and his grandmother telling a packed courtoom of a
loving young man who grew up in a household free of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed soberly in black pants, a gray shirt, and a black and
white paisely tie, Henderson had let his hair grow out, shunning
the skinhead look he favored at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 p.m., and me and Aaron decided to go out to a bar,''
Henderson testified, responding to question's by his lawyer, Wyatt
Skaggs. After drinking ``a few pitchers of beer'' at the first bar,
he said they went to a second bar, the Fireside. There, while
drinking another pitcher, he said McKinney noticed the college
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron had mentioned to me that he wanted to take him out and
rob him,'' Henderson testified in a clear if subdued voice. ``I
disagreed with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Painting his former roofing workmate as the author of the crime,
he said that McKinney told tim to drive the pickup truck borrowed
from McKinney's father, where to drive and where to park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard
to give him his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while
he drove his friend beat Shepard. After parking in an isolated
field near a subdivision where Henderson once lived, McKinney
``pulled Matthew out of the truck and continued to hit him,'' with
the pistol, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron told me to go get a rope out of the truck,'' Henderson
continued as the Shepards stared grimly ahead. ``Aaron told me to
tie his hands'' to a fence pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew looked really bad, I told him to stop,'' Henderson
continued. ``Mr. McKinney hit me above the mouth. I returned to the
pickup truck.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving away, leaving the beating victim tied to a fence
in temperatures that dropped below freezing, Henderson said that he
and his friend got into another fight. When caught by a Laramie
police man, he said that he lied about what he had been doing
earlier that evening.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, instead of calling for medical help for Shepard,
Henderson said that he and his girl friend, Chasity Pasley, and
McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen LeAnn Price, drove 50 miles east to
a truck stop in Cheyenne with his bloody clothing ``and put it in a
dumpster to cover up that I was out there when Matthew was
beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pasley pled guilty in December to being an accessory after
the fact to first-degree murder and faces sentencing. Ms. Price was
freed on bond in January and faces a trial on the same charges in
May.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Henderson spoke, it was the turn of Lucy Thompson, his
maternal grandmother who has raised him since he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts ache for the pain and suffering that the Shepards
have gone through,'' Mrs. Thompson, said turning to Matthew's
parents who sat in the front row of the courtroom. A devout Mormon,
she said, ``We have prayed for you many, many times. You have
showed us such mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thompson, who raised Henderson until he dropped out of
Laramie High School near the end of his senior year, described him
as ``a survivor'' whose ``mother was young and not ready to be a
mother.'' Three months ago, at age 40, Cindy Thompson Dixon,
Russell's mother, froze to death on a rural road outside of Laramie
after a night of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a ``loving and kind'' side to her grandson, she
recalled him playing on the floor with his young cousins. As his
aunts and other relatives hugged each other for comfort on a
front-row bench, she added, ``Even as a teenager, Russell was never
embarrassed to give me a hug or to kiss me on the forehead in front
of his peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to newspaper accounts of his grandson's expressionless
demeanor in court, she said, ``I have looked into his eyes, and I
know'' that he is in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``the case has developed into a hate crime,'' she
said that she never preached hatred in her household and that
``Russell has never been a hateful individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, she intimated, was a loyal follower, adding,
``Sometimes friends would take advantage of his loyalties.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing, she turned to the judge and begged him not ``to take
Russell out of our lives forever.'' Turning to Matthew's parents
again, she looked them in the eyes and said, ``I want to thank all
the Shepards. I love you even though I have never known you.''
</P>
<P>
   The packed courtroom had scarcely absorbed this appeal, when it
was the turn of Henderson, who hoped to earn a slim chance of one
day winning parole.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the same podium, he turned his back to the judge and
addressed Matthew's family, saying, ``Mr. and Mrs. Shepard, there
is not a day that doesn't go by that I don't see what happened that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I did,'' he continued, turning back to Donnell.
``I'm very sorry for what I did. I am ready to pay for what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the turn of Mr. and Mrs. Shepard, who had traveled
from their home in Saudi Arabia for the chance to address the court
in their native Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shepard spoke first, pausing at times to regain her
composure as she recalled her son's blossoming interest in theater,
politics and international cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't my son, my first born anymore,'' she said, recalling
hugs and late night talks. ``He was my friend, my confidante, my
constant reminder of how good life can be.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembered that the last time she saw him he was covered
with bandages and wired with tubes in an intensive care unit of a
Fort Collins, Colo., hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his eyes was partially open,'' she recalled. ``I could
see the clear blue of his eye. But the twinkle of his life wasn't
there any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the warm and trusting son she had known, she said
that touching his arm in the hospital provoked an involuntary
reaction, ``He began to shake and quiver.'' Referring to her son's
savage beating _ he was kicked in the groin and beaten 18 times
around the head _ she said in disbelief that ``such an act of
cruelty was unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress on the Shepard family was so great, she continued,
that within a month of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I don't think you are worthy of addressing,'' Mrs.
Shepard said, turning to the man who had just pled guilty to
murdering her son. Speaking slowly, but firmly, she vowed, ``We
won't allow you to kill our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, looking drawn, rose to speak, saying he had thrown away
remarks he had written on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was born blind,'' he said in an impromptu speech. ``Not
physically blind, but blind to people's differences _ short or
tall; black, brown or white; religion or ethnic backgrounds. His
friends included gays and so-called straights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I meet strangers and make small talk, they ask, `do you
have children?''' he continued. ``Now, I take a deep breath and say
`I have one son,' not two.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled bathing his young son, teaching him to sing ``Row,
Row, Row Your Boat,'' ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' and other
nursery rhymes. With anger in his voice, he turned to the defendant
and said, ``You, Mr. Henderson, helped to sink that boat, to shoot
Frere Jacques, and to shoot down that star.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his remarks to a 175-pound man who had helped to kill
his 105-pound son, Matthew's father said, ``It takes a brave man to
tie up another man, who did not know how to clench a fist until he
was 13 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Shepards, Cal Rerucha, the Albany County attorney,
kept his remarks brief. Turning to the defendant, he said, ``Mr.
Henderson you have created hell on earth _ for a family, for our
community, for the state.''

SPORTS COLUMN: DOUBLEDAY SILENT ON SALE OF METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Nelson Doubleday, the Mets' co-owner, was smiling. The
Mets had not yet fallen behind the Marlins, 3-0, in the first
inning of what would be a sad 6-2 loss in Monday's season opener,
and when he was asked to assess his team's future, he gushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chemistry is great,'' he said. ``Lots of charisma.
Lots of power.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that the Mets will need another dependable
starting pitcher if they are to draw the wild card in the National
League playoffs, Abner Doubleday's great nephew nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how Jason Isringhausen works out down there,'' he
said, referring to the young right-hander down on the Norfolk farm
in the International League. ``He could be that pitcher for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Doubleday was asked about what was happening in
Cablevision's reported attempt to purchase the Mets for $500
million from him and the co-owner Fred Wilpon, he silently shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how that story had developed, Doubleday said, ``No idea.''
And when asked what would happen eventually, he said, ``I don't
negotiate in the newspapers.'' Then he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   That's Doubleday double talk. He apparently is negotiating
somewhere with someone, presumably Charles F. Dolan, the
Cablevision impresario. As the season progresses, it remains to be
seen how long the Mets, with all that ``chemistry'' and
``charisma,'' will remain the Mets as owned by Doubleday and Wilpon
for nearly two decades with only 1986 World Series rings to show
for it.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains to be seen if Doubleday and Wilpon invested $155
million in signing catcher Mike Piazza, the left-hander Al Leiter
and third baseman Robin Ventura during the off season to drive the
franchise's price tag up to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's opener, Piazza, Leiter and Ventura weren't worth
anywhere near that $155 million against a Marlins team not much
different than that which won only 54 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   But in the right-hander Alex Fernandez, who missed the entire
1998 season following rotator-cuff surgery, the Marlins had the
better starting pitcher and in baseball, that is usually all that
counts. Leiter, considered the Mets' ace after his 17-6 record last
season, never recovered from that first inning when the Marlins put
together three runs with mostly fluky singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down, 3-0, you scramble, you scratch,'' Leiter
said later. ``The feeling was, you can't give up any more runs. But
when the season starts, people don't want to hear about pitches.
Bottom line is, we lost and I didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   During the pre-game introductions, Leiter, who started Game 7 of
the 1997 World Series that the Marlins won, and Bobby Bonilla, then
the Marlins' third baseman, were saluted with standing ovations
from the 38,983 at Pro Player Stadium who remembered the Marlins
team that was dismantled by the former owner H. Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marlins were getting the hits, we weren't,'' said Bobby
Valentine, the Mets' manager. ``That'll turn.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, it must turn quickly, starting tonight, if the
Mets are to take advantage of what appears to be a relatively soft
schedule in their first 13 games _ two more here, four in Montreal,
three more against the Marlins beginning with Monday's home opener
at Shea, then three more at Shea against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the teams on the schedule,'' Valentine said. ``I
never insult the other teams, that we're supposed to beat 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the two teams that finished last and next to last in
the NL East last season, the Mets couldn't have asked for a better
schedule at the start of the season, although last season they were
a frustrating 11-13 against the Expos and the Marlins. But for the
Mets, their start has recently been an omen.
</P>
<P>
   With an 11-6 start last season, the Mets soon settled into
second place in the NL East before finishing one game behind both
the Cubs and the Giants for the wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   But in both 1997 and 1996, the Mets staggered to a 4-10 start
before finishing third and fourth, respectively. In 1995, they had
a 6-11 start. Those numbers won't be acceptable this season,
especially against the Marlins and the Expos. And especially after
investing $155 million in Piazza, Leiter and Ventura. &QL;

 Deal-Making in the Digital World Occurring at Lightning Speed
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Samuel Osborn is a 21-year-old college dropout.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a former stockbroker and currently is chief executive
of an Internet subsidiary owned by a publicly traded
media-distribution company, Take Two of New York. The San Francisco
native sold his fledgling electronic commerce firm, DVD Wave, to
Take Two just about a month ago. Now he and his five-person company
find themselves at the helm of Take Two's online distribution
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Is it just me or was it not that long ago when kids lumbered
through four or more years to get their degrees and then took a
year off to traipse around Europe before sullying their hands with
business cards? Not so in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently not so with the likes of Osborn.
</P>
<P>
   Twentysomething entrepreneurial success stories aren't new to
the Silicon Valley, but that doesn't make the achievements of Sam
and company any less impressive. The story of how quickly he
launched and sold his Internet startup may serve as a metaphor for
the frenetic pace of deal making in the digital world.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Osborn clearly demonstrates the kind of zealous
initiative and tireless drive that is requisite for most any
successful entrepreneur, regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, as a sophomore at the University of
California at Berkeley, Osborn landed an internship at the
brokerage Bear Stearns. Liking what he saw and learned, it wasn't
long before he became a fully licensed stockbroker, spending half
of his days peddling investments from 5:30 a.m to 1:30 p.m. before
commuting over the bay to campus for a full slate of classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good time to work in the stock market,'' Osborn
recalls. ``I saw the Dow (Jones industrial average) break two
milestones while I was working there.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborn also researched stocks for clients, scouring company
prospectuses for clues on how to build companies. In addition, his
equity research efforts provided him with the opportunity to visit
companies and their top brass.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, these exercises provided the dual benefit of
being the research and development for his own company. ``I was
always thinking about what I could do on the Internet,'' Osborn
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet definitely was on his mind. Since the early 1990s,
Osborn had been tapping into Mosaic and other early incarnations of
the Web. He even started a Web-design business in the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, we (kids) were the only ones who could do it,'' he
notes. The question was: What would be the next big thing on the
Web?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Digital Video Disc) was something that was new, and nobody
was really selling it online,'' Osborn recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a little more than a year ago, Osborn quit both Bear
Stearns and school to start one of the early e-commerce sites
devoted to selling and renting digital video discs, or DVDs,
online. He recruited a couple of childhood friends, Jeff Tyler and
Dave Wallerich, and the longtime pals holed up in Osborn's Berkeley
condominium to plan the launch of DVD Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Using just $10,000 of the partners' own cash, Osborn set about
finding a distributor of movies that might provide his fledgling
startup with the products it hoped to sell.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the prospectus of CDNow, an online seller of music
and movies, Osborn targeted major DVD fulfillment houses _
companies that supply DVDs to traditional retailers. Some already
were aligned with CDNow and Amazon.com, which were starting to
dabble in DVD sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he focused on Baker and Taylor Entertainment, a
suburban Chicago distribution house that has direct relationships
with record companies and movie studios, which he and his cohorts
pestered endlessly until it gave them a deal to market their discs.
</P>
<P>
   With absolutely no credit history, Baker and Taylor extended a
$500 credit line. Yep, a whole five-hundred bucks. ``So they set us
up,'' Osborn remembers.
</P>
<P>
   That was June, 1998. The site ( &LR; www.dvdwave.com &LR; ) went live a
month later. The first order came in about two weeks later. Osborn
remembers it well: a three-disc order from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   They were off to the races. Using its relationships and
knowledge of the Web, DVD Wave built myriad relationships with
other sites to spread the word. High-touch customer service was
stressed. Business soared. Baker and Tayler extended the credit
line to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then just a few months ago, he hit pay dirt. An anonymous
customer was so impressed by DVD Wave's easy-to-use site, personal
service and competent delivery, he requested a meeting with Osborn.
The customer happened to be an executive of Jack of All Games, a
computer game distributor owned by Take Two.
</P>
<P>
   In just three weeks, Take Two was hammering out a deal with
Osborn to buy his nine-month old company for 50,000 shares of Take
Two stock, which currently is trading at about $8 a share. The
principal shareholders also received cash bonuses and kept their
jobs, which by the way, now pay a salary.
</P>
<P>
   Not having enough in the budget for a corporate attorney,
Osborn's father, John, a San Francisco estate-planning lawyer and
author of ``The Paper Chase,'' was drafted to represent his son's
firm. The deal was sealed over a weekend in early March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking to get into the Internet business, and we
thought that Sam's company could get it done,'' says Nicholas
Alexander, chief executive of Jack of All Games in Cincinnati, the
nation's largest distributor of video games.
</P>
<P>
   And now that Osborn is chief executive of an online unit of a
publicly traded company, are he and his schoolyard chums in a hurry
to re-enroll in medieval-history class? ``We have no interest in
going back to school any time soon,'' Osborn says.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPERVILLE, Ill. _ It was not until the summer of 1996 that
Edward Paschke, a 54-year-old chemist working at the Amoco Research
Center here, realized that his life might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a rare form of brain cancer had been found in two
researchers with whom he had shared lab space. Amoco investigated
and found that a third lab worker had had a similar tumor in 1986.
And then in 1996, a malignant brain tumor had been discovered in
one of Paschke's closest colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made four brain tumors within 150 feet of where I was
working,'' Paschke said recently, as he sat stiffly on a couch in
his home here, 25 miles west of Chicago. ``It was terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   When Paschke went for a checkup in summer 1996, doctors found a
benign brain tumor. And he was not alone. Over the next three
years, say officials at the company, now known as BP Amoco, at
least 20 brain tumors were found in current and former employees of
the center.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company began the nation's most ambitious
corporate investigation into a cluster of cancer cases in an effort
to learn if they were work-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very unusual pattern of brain cancer here,'' said
Jim Lowry, who heads a task force on the brain tumors at BP Amoco,
the oil giant based in London that was created when British
Petroleum acquired Chicago-based Amoco last year. ``You essentially
have this puzzle, and it points to a certain space and a certain
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer clusters are rarely found to have a common cause.
Epidemiologists say that in large populations it is statistically
inevitable that clusters of similar cases will show up in one place
or another. In addition, cancer can develop over such long periods
that much of the evidence may be buried in the deep past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track record in these cases is not very good,'' said Peter
Inskip, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Md., who studies brain tumor cases. ``More often than
not, people have not come up with a convincing answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Amoco, after consulting with the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and other agencies, found the circumstances
at Naperville so striking that it brought in experts from Johns
Hopkins University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20 brain tumors, which have caused five deaths so far,
seven were a rare malignant cancer called glioma, which strikes
only five of every 100,000 people each year. And five of the
gliomas occurred among chemists and lab technicians who worked over
many years in the same laboratory on the same corridor handling
toxic chemicals, including some known as heavy metal catalysts.
</P>
<P>
   In that lab, the brain cancer rate was eight times higher than
in the general population, the medical experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a two-year investigation costing millions of dollars,
BP Amoco officials hope that a comprehensive report due just weeks
from now will provide some answers. If nothing else, it may sort
out the thousands of chemicals found in the labs, to identify for
further study those used in common by the cancer victims.
</P>
<P>
   If the cause is determined to be work-related, officials say,
the company will ``do the right thing'' by compensating victims.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a number of brain tumor victims have sued BP
Amoco, arguing that the company knowingly exposed its employees at
Naperville to toxic chemicals and unsafe conditions for years by
ignoring complaints about a faulty ventilation system.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco officials dispute the accusations, and say the medical
investigators have largely ruled out the ventilation system as a
cause of the brain tumors. But the officials also say there are no
opposing ``sides'' in this case. The company says it wants nothing
more than to resolve the situation and determine the cause of the
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Kastory, a BP Amoco spokeswoman, said the company had
hired the best experts, reviewed the work histories of more than
8,000 employees, taken apart laboratories and buildings, and
counseled and aided employees and former employees in what the
company acknowledges has been a ``terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has gone to unusual lengths to uncover new brain tumor
cases, despite the threat of litigation, and has voluntarily shared
much of its information with the public and even the lawyers who
have filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is frustrating for us,'' said Lowry, the head of the BP
Amoco task force. ``We want to get to the bottom of this. I
personally knew five of the people with gliomas. Naturally, these
people want closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Amoco closed the third-floor laboratory of Building 503, where
five of the seven glioma victims worked, in 1996, after the fourth
cancer case was found there. Investigators said the victims
sometimes worked on the same experiments, researching polymers and
heavy metal catalysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is that five of them worked in the same general
area, and all of them crossed paths in the 1970s and 1980s, and
they were all long-term employees,'' said Michael Wells, a BP Amoco
manager on the brain tumor task force. He noted that the pattern of
benign tumors was not as unusual as that of the Glioma cases.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the floor was closed, Amoco says, Building 503 and
the entire 180-acre research campus were thoroughly tested and
deemed to be safe. Researchers tested the water, the walls for
radiation, the soil, even a microwave tower outside.
</P>
<P>
   While chemicals have not been proved to cause brain cancer, and
the mechanism by which they would cause cancer is not known,
either, the investigators hired by Amoco believe that if the brain
tumors are work-related, the most likely cause was contact with
toxic chemicals in Building 503.

 NAPERVILLE, Ill.: Building 503.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several brain tumor victims, however, say the investigators are
overlooking the old ventilation system as a contributing factor. In
pending lawsuits, the plaintiffs say that toxic chemicals were
often stored in unventilated hallways and closets and that there
were noxious fumes in the hallways and corridors soon after
Building 503 opened. Amoco, they say, ignored repeated complaints
about the odors and failed to protect employees from exposure to
toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were literally splashing our hands in known carcinogens,''
said Paschke, a researcher found to have a tumor in 1996, who spent
24 years in Building 503. ``We stored many toxic chemicals. At one
point, I stored mustard gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Amoco officials say that the medical experts have ruled out most
of those scenarios. The ventilation system was upgraded in the
early 1990s. A more likely culprit than than poorly ventilated
fumes, Amoco says, is the actual lab experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims concede that in the 1970s and 1980s, even
they doubted that the ventilation system or the lab experiments
posed a serious health risk.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1989 after two researchers who worked in
the same lab were found to have glioma within a month of one
another. Amoco commissioned a study, but a group of outside medical
experts concluded that the event was probably ``serendipitous.''
The company was advised to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly seven years, Amoco did. Then in early 1996, Nicholas
Karayannis, a 64-year-old chemist, was found to have glioma,
prompting a more comprehensive investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The illness of Karayannis, who was retired, shocked many of his
co-workers. It was discovered in January 1996 after he passed out
while having breakfast with some Amoco staffers.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery for the cancer, Karayannis knew his chances of
survival were slim, but his family says he kept up his routines. He
continued to visit his colleagues during lunch hour. He would
arrive with a huge scar on his skull, and a swelling that made it
difficult for him to wear his glasses.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Marios Karayannis, said Karayannis believed the tumor
had something to do with the chemicals he worked with. As his
condition began to deteriorate, he asked his son, a lawyer, to look
into the case.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Karayannis spent long hours in the basement of
his home, compiling lists, which the family found only after he
died in early 1998. There were lists of operas he had seen,
restaurants he had visited, and chemicals he had worked with. His
memory began to fail within a year of his surgery, and his son
believes he was trying to challenge himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his surgery, he'd go down in the basement and compose
lists for hours,'' Marios Karayannis said. ``But then he must have
gotten confused. You'd read about him going to see `Aida' or
`Carmen,' and then there'd be a list of chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Karayannis filed suit against Amoco on behalf
of his father and several others with brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Paschke is part of that suit. Though his tumor was benign, he
said, it was growing on a bundle of nerves and when it was removed,
he lost his sense of balance and hearing in his right ear. The
right side of his face is paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Paschke continues to work as a researcher at BP Amoco, and he
says he loves the work. But he says the company is playing down the
ventilation questions because it would leave BP Amoco open to
questions of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now paying the price for loose safety policies at Amoco
in the 1970s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry, BP Amoco's task force director, says nothing is being
ruled out by investigators. The situation, he said, has left
everyone frustrated. Because BP Amoco's research has been
comprehensive, many have lost patience waiting for answers that
even he acknowledges may never come.
</P>
<P>
   There is still some chance, he says, that investigators will
conclude that the brain tumors are not work-related, or that many
of the cases simply constitute a random cluster of cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lowry drew a chart on the board. At one end
were the words ``work-related'' and at the other the word
``unrelated.'' That is the spectrum. The answer, he says, may lie
somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was absolutely work-related I think we'd know by now,''
he said grimly. ``I don't think there's a definitive answer.''

RACIAL DIVERSITY GETS ROLE IN WIRELESS-PHONE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct year in graf 5 to 1997.)  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In perhaps the first major telecommunications acquisition to be
described as a ``step forward'' for racial diversity, Ameritech
Corp. on Monday announced a deal to sell roughly half of its
wireless telephone business to a venture led by GTE Corp. for about
$3.3 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   For Ameritech's pending $62 billion acquisition by SBC
Communications Inc. to win regulatory approval, one of the two
companies had to sell a big piece of its wireless operation.
Federal rules prohibit companies from owning multiple wireless
phone licenses in a single market. Because SBC and Ameritech's
wireless units overlap in the Chicago and St. Louis areas,
eliminating the conflict was a clear prerequisite to completing the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   GTE said Monday that it would join with a private investment
firm that has no telecommunications experience: Georgetown
Partners, which is run by Chester C. Davenport, a former federal
government official, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Monday's deal said that SBC wanted to bring
a company run by members of one or more minority groups into the
wireless transaction at least partly to curry favor with William
Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming chairman in 1997, Kennard has said that one of
his main priorities is to increase racial and ethnic diversity in
the communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is deciding whether to challenge SBC's deal to
acquire Ameritech on the grounds that is does not serve the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, SBC said: ``Creating more diversity within the
telecommunications industry is an important goal for a number of
parties, not the least of which is the FCC, which has repeatedly
urged the industry to identify these opportunities. Since we
announced the SBC-Ameritech merger last May, we recognized that the
sale of the overlapping wireless properties would create an
opportunity for us to do well by our shareowners and good by
achieving the goal of expanding diversity within the ranks of
industry ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Notebaert, Ameritech's chairman, said in a statement:
``This sale demonstrates that the SBC-Ameritech merger will bring
substantial new competition into the Midwest, broaden the ownership
of these properties to include greater diversity from the community
and provide customers the benefits of growth and robust
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Monday's deal said that Georgetown Partners
first expressed interest last year in the Ameritech properties that
were up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became clear that Georgetown Partners could not
complete the transaction on their own, we suggested that they
consider a number of other potential partners,'' the SBC statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Davenport said SBC had no direct involvement in
his company's aligning with GTE, which itself has agreed to merge
with Bell Atlantic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in the
wireless industry before it totally takes off,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown Partners will put up about $60 million of the $3.3
billion purchase price. GTE executives said that represented a 7
percent equity interest in the new operation that will run the
former Ameritech operations. The new venture, the executives said,
would have a total equity value of $817.5 million, and Davenport
would be its chairman, reporting to the president of GTE's wireless
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said GTE would raise at least $2.5
billion in debt to fill out the purchase price. Davenport said that
Georgetown Partners would pay market interest rates on the portion
of the debt that it was responsible for.
</P>
<P>
   A GTE statement said that in addition to capital, Georgetown
Partners ``will provide the GTE subsidiary with marketing services
designed to capture demand for wireless products and services in
high-potential but under-served ethnic markets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Davenport, who was an assistant secretary of transportation in
the Carter administration, said he had no special marketing acumen.
Until last year he was chairman of Envirotest Systems Corp., which
tests vehicle emissions. Envirotest was acquired last year by Stone
Rivet Inc. for $266 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a financial player,'' he said. Referring to marketing, he
added: ``I don't have any expertise in doing that, and I never said
that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Monday that he had met with
Ameritech and SBC executives in recent months to help them draft a
list of minority-owned companies that could participate in the
wireless sale, which was coordinated by Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   One of the initiatives of Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the
Wall Street Project, is aimed at encouraging diversity in the
business world. Georgetown Partners was a sponsor of the gala at
the project's annual conference in January, an event where
Davenport said he met with executives involved in Monday's deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' Jackson said of Georgetown Partners'
participation in Monday's deal. ``Since Alexander Graham Bell,
there has never been an African-American qualified to own a
telephone company, because of historical patterns of exclusion.
Never before.'' Referring to the pending Ameritech-SBC merger and
the need for the companies to divest some wireless properties, he
added, ``Given the requirements of the merger, this was a strategic
moment to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition endorsed the Ameritech-SBC merger
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, SBC said: ``The bottom line is that this is a
good business deal for the companies. We also believe the fact that
Georgetown Partners is part of this transaction is a step forward
for diversity and inclusion in the telecommunications industry.''

   NEW YORK _

<P>
   &UR; Understated Cerruti &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _``It's halfway between 57th Street and the Whitney Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   _``I thought people might like a friendly place on Madison where
they can just stop by _ a place where it's calm and comfortable,
and the salespeople will be nice to them, and they can just have a
seat if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   _And ``Madison Avenue has good bus service.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the letter does O'Brien say how big the store is
(4,000 square feet) or how much fabulous limestone was imported to
cover the floors. ``Nino wanted something more lighthearted,'' he
explained. As for the bus tip, O'Brien, said, ``My richest friend
loves to take the bus, and that made me realize that taking the bus
was actually a luxury, because it takes so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerruti will celebrate his new store the conventional way, with
a party, next Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Christine Ganeaux's Start &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What happens to an unknown designer who gets the full-court
press during New York fashion week? Does she wilt, or wind up
selling to Bergdorf's? Neither.
</P>
<P>
   After Harper's Bazaar gave a fete in February to introduce her
label, Ms. Ganeaux sold a lot of clothes at her boutique on Crosby
Street in SoHo, particularly sexy trousers and motocross leathers.
She also scored some big-league media coverage. ``Elle, Travel &AMP;
Leisure, Paper, the E! channel,'' Ms. Ganeaux said, pausing. ``Who
else? Oh, Elle Decoration in England. They liked the store's
interiors.'' It was designed by Randy Hoffman, Ms. Ganeaux's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   But no retailers placed orders, and in any case, Ms. Ganeaux
isn't sure she's ready to sell wholesale. ``I've had lots of
interest from small stores, but for now I want to concentrate on my
business and grow it slowly,'' said Ms. Ganeaux, who produces
clothes exclusively for her boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she's begun to produce some things herself, like
sleeveless leather tops for spring, in the room behind her
boutique. Even if it means pushing her husband's projects and
motorbikes further to the back. As Ms. Ganeaux spoke on the phone
from her workroom, Hoffman could be heard piping up in a small
voice in the background, ``I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Denim With a Difference &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With fashion in a revivalist mood, it stands to reason that one
of the newest looks right now in Los Angeles is something old.
Since Christmas, Ron Herman, the Hollywood trend king, has been
selling vintage denim and corduroy pants, as well as vivid football
jerseys and zip-front vintage sweatshirts, studded with rhinestones
and metal beads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been amazing,'' said Alonzo Ester, a buyer
who worked on the idea with Nina Garduno, the vice president of Ron
Herman's men's division.
</P>
<P>
   Ester said the idea originated last year during buying trips to
Japan, where vintage denim and corduroy jeans, to say nothing of
American sports jerseys and '70s airbrushed T-shirts, have found a
rapacious following. New denim is everywhere for fall. Last
October, Tom Ford of Gucci brought out his feather-strewn jeans,
which Ester admitted added heat to the trend. ``It's helped,'' he
said, ``but it's not where our idea came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Studded vintage jeans and cords sell from $135 to $400, while a
zip-front sweatshirt is about $140. Ester emphasized that each item
is hand-picked for individuality. ``They all have this feeling of
something home-grown,'' he said. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO directed its most ferocious air strikes yet on
Yugoslav armored forces operating in Kosovo, and struck Belgrade
and the country's two other largest cities Monday night in an
intensified attack made possible by two consecutive nights of clear
weather, NATO and Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 13th day of the assault, American and NATO warplanes took
full advantage of the second night without the rain and clouds that
had inhibited NATO's earlier strikes, the officials said. The
allies sharply increased the number of bombing missions over
Yugoslavia because of the break. By mid-afternoon in Brussels on
Monday, NATO and Pentagon officials said their warplanes had
attacked 27 targets just overnight and planned to hit at least that
many again Monday night if the weather held.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and NATO refused to specify their targets,
including their new pursuit of ground forces. Explosions rocked Nis
and Novi Sad, the two largest cities after the capital, Belgrade.
Yugoslavia's official television broadcast scenes of a huge
fireball in Novi Sad. The city's mayor said a power station at an
oil refinery had been struck. And officials said another bridge
over the Danube River, where three other bridges had already been
knocked out, had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, NATO released a surveillance photograph
Monday that officials said showed Yugoslav forces herding residents
from a village in Kosovo, and said other photographs depicted their
homes being destroyed. While describing the surveillance as
offering concrete evidence of President Slobodan Milosevic's
campaign to drive ethnic Albanians from the province, NATO and
Pentagon officials would not release the other photographs in the
series, and would not elaborate on their reasons for withholding
them.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the White House Monday with Defense Secretary
William Cohen, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry H. Shelton, President Clinton promised a relentless bombing
campaign Monday and said the United States was committed ``for the
long haul'' to stopping what he said was Milosevic's purge of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' Clinton said in brief comments to a handful
of reporters at the White House. ``The ethnic cleansing of Kosovo
cannot stand as a permanent event.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Our plan is to persist until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of refugees continued to stream out of Kosovo
into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, creating a humanitarian
crisis not matched in Europe for half a century. NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea said that since February 1998, Milosevic had displaced
at least 831,000 of the 2 million people who lived in the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it conducted its military operation, NATO began an
almost equally difficult humanitarian operation to feed and give
temporary shelter for many of the thousands of refugees. The first
five plane loads left Macedonia for Turkey Monday morning, carrying
800 refugees. Several NATO nations, including the United States,
have agreed to take in about 110,000 refugees, providing them homes
until they can return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Albania, where 240,000 refugees have fled, said
that despite that nation's extreme poverty, they did not want other
countries to take in the refugees because sending them away would
only further Milosevic's goal of ridding the region of them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said that his remarks Monday _ some of his
sharpest words yet _ were meant to warn Milosevic that a return of
the refugees was now a precondition of any end to NATO's assault on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``More empty promises and token half-measures won't do the
job,'' Clinton said, appearing at the White House with his national
security advisers. ``If Mr. Milosevic does not do what is
necessary, NATO will continue an air campaign. It will be
undiminished, unceasing and unrelenting. It will inflict such
damage that either he will change his calculation or we will
seriously diminish his capacity to maintain his grip and impose his
control on Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence assessments compiled here in Washington indicate
that Milosevic's forces might well be nearing the end of their
campaign to expel ethnic Albanians from their homes. Some officials
have speculated that Milosevic, armed with that advantage on the
ground, might then offer to end the fighting and return to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Clinton's comments Monday
were intended in part to pre-empt any gestures that Milosevic might
make that would not meet the conditions of the failed peace talks
in France, except for the return of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be a surprise to see in the coming days attempts
at half measures, hollow cease-fires,'' Joe Lockhart, the
president's spokesman, said. ``They will not be acceptable to stop
the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Monday, Clinton restated the goals of the
mission, saying that for the bombing to stop, Milosevic would have
to withdraw his police units from Kosovo, agree to an autonomous,
multi-ethnic Kosovo, accept the deployment of an international
security force and take steps toward a political settlement to help
the refugees return home.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair echoed that resolve Monday.
``We will drive them back to Kosovo,'' he said of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says that the refugee crisis was precipitated
by Milosevic, who has stepped up his repression of ethnic Albanians
in response to NATO's attack, which began on the night of March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's strikes destroyed the fourth bridge of the Danube, this
one near Sombar. The bridge is near Yugoslavia's northern border
with Hungary and far from the fighting in Kosovo. However,
officials have justified destroying bridges, saying they help
resupply Yugoslavia's military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   In raids overnight on Sunday, NATO and American warplanes
destroyed four separate bridges near Kosovo, including one over the
Ibar River at Raska, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also targeted a fuel depot near Sombar and sites at a coal
mining center in Aleksinca, southeast of Belgrade, according to
Yugoslavia's official television. Kursumlija, an industrial town
near Kosovo, was struck Monday night, as was the military
headquarters at Nis, the television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the targets reported by the Yugoslavs were
industrial sites in major cities, NATO officials said they were now
turning their attention to destroying the ground forces waging war
in Kosovo. In the first days of the campaign, some strikes had
destroyed staging areas, barracks and fuel and ammunition depots
directly supporting the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just starting to hit them,'' NATO's military spokesman,
Air Commander David Wilby of Britain, said Monday, before the
latest strikes began. ``The weather as you know, has only just
cleared, to give us a little more chance of hitting them hard.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the strikes directed against the ground forces
would soon ``severely disrupt'' the Yugoslav offensive. Other NATO
and Pentagon officials acknowledged that the rout of the remaining
Albanian rebels was nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, NATO warplanes had the first clear night in a week
and struck 27 targets including gasoline production and storage
sites, airfields, air defenses, ammunition depots and bridges,
Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
   In those raids, Yugoslavia's air defenses put up a significant
fight, having held back on previous nights. Pilots encountered
ferocious anti-aircraft artillery and several SA-3 surface-to-air
missiles. However, all NATO aircraft returned safely on Sunday and
did so again by Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes also stepped up the propaganda war. An Air Force
EC-130 broadcast radio and television signals into Yugoslavia,
trying to undercut Milosevic's grip on the official media by
detailing the campaign against the ethnic Albanians and saying that
NATO did not oppose the Yugoslav people, only Milosevic's
government. Other planes also dropped leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   The United States announced plans to boost its relief efforts as
it prepared for the temporary resettlement of at least 20,000
Albanian refugees onto American territory, probably at the
Guantanamo Naval Air Station in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is undertaking a vast relief effort, flying in
10 missions a day from Italy to Tirana, the Albanian capital, at a
rate of more than 65,000 meals per day, or enough to feed 500,000
people for three months. It is also sending tents, sleeping bags
and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the relief effort was so huge that it threatened to
overwhelm the already crowded skies in the Balkans. A Pentagon
spokesman said the deployment of 24 Apache helicopters to Albania
was being complicated by the large number of relief flights already
entering Albania's capital, Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   The relief effort and the deployment of the Apaches is deepening
the American commitment on the ground in the Balkans. The first 40
of 500 Air Force personnel have arrived in Albania, while the
Apaches and a rocket system to back them up will involve nearly
2,800 soldiers, according to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance was part of a near-daily public-relations
campaign to explain and justify NATO's bombing and the American
contributions to it. He has struggled to simplify his message over
time as he tries to prepare the American public for what looks
increasingly like a lengthy and dangerous ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's use of the phrase ``cannot stand'' implied the kind of
drawing a line in the sand that President Bush used to muster
public support against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush said in his 1991 State of the Union address: ``The
community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel
lawless aggression. Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion, his
ruthless, systematic rape of a peaceful neighbor, violated
everything the community of nations holds dear. The world has said
this aggression would not stand, and it will not stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as political pressure builds in Congress over concern
that the United States is becoming more enmeshed in the Balkans
than it initially planned, Clinton has refrained from a
full-throated call to arms, and public opinion remains ambivalent
toward the mission.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress on recess and lawmakers spread around the globe,
it is impossible to gauge the prevailing view of the conflict in
Serbia, but at least some Democratic senators who voted last month
to support the NATO airstrikes seem now to be having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who is
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, warned
Clinton that many senators had voted in favor of the bombing
``against their better instincts'' and that a majority would
probably oppose sending in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not get my vote,'' Torricelli said. Largely because
of strong Democratic support, the Senate endorsed the bombing by a
vote of 58-41.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli also said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, ``had best be
holding their hat in their hands'' because of their optimistic
predictions about the effectiveness of the air campaign.

GOTTI PLEADS GUILTY TO RACKETEERING ON EVE OF TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds., this is an added starter on NYT Page 1, later editions)  
(ac) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Less than a day before his trial was to
begin, John A. Gotti, accused of being the acting boss of the
Gambino crime family, pleaded guilty Monday to being part of
criminal racket that involved bribery, extortion and the threat of
violence. In return, he faces a maximum sentence of seven years and
three months in federal prison and a $1-million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the sentence is much less than the 20 years Gotti
might have received if convicted in a trial, prosecutors contend
that the plea will further damage the power of both the Gotti
family and its interests and the larger Gambino crime family that
his father John J. Gotti led for many years until he was convicted
in 1991 and imprisoned for life.
</P>
<P>
   Although plea negotiations have been an on-again, off-again
proposition for months, Gotti's lawyer, Gerald Shargel, said his
client made a firm decision to accept a deal after learning that
federal prosecutorswere about to indict him on tax charges and
realizing that he would be the endless target of prosecution unless
he submitted to a criminal plea.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel said that Gotti, 35, wanted ``closure and finality'' so
he could eventually return to his Oyster Bay home to raise his four
children before they are grown. ``It was a no-win situation,''
Shargel said after emerging from an unusual nighttime hearing at
which Gotti made his plea. ``If he won at trial, every prosecutor
with a gun would be out looking for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, wearing a dark brown suit, light brown shirt and a brown
and tan tie, took off his glasses and spoke softly and solemnly as
he recited the crimes that he had arranged to plead guilty to.
</P>
<P>
   He first admitted to conspiring with members of an association
to commit criminal offenses. That was not as much as the government
had hoped, since he did not specifically admit to being the acting
boss of the Gambino crime family, an admission that would have
violated one of the cardinal rules of the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   For a reputed mob commander, Gotti looked unusually humble as he
replied to questions put to him by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been inducted to plead guilty by any promise?'' Judge
Barrington D. Parker Jr. asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No your honor,'' Gotti said, his hands folded in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been induced to plead guilty by any threat of force,
and do you plead guilty voluntarily?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do you honor,'' Gotti replied.
</P>
<P>
   In his plea, Gotti admitted to four acts of racketeering. He
said ``it was part of my pattern of racketeering'' that in 1996 he
had paid bribes to an officer of a labor organization, which the
government identified as an officer of Local 445 of the Teamsters
Union. Federal officials said later that the bribe was an attempt
to win a contract worth $5 million to $10 million for construction
at Stewart Airport in New Windsor, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti also said that in 1996 he ``conspired with others'' to
extort money through ``threatened force'' from a construction
project in Mount Vernon, N.Y., supervised by DeFoe Corp. The
government said the amount of money he extorted was $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other two racketeering acts, he said, were running an
illegal gambling operation in Connecticut and understating his
income on an application to refinance his mortgage. Although he did
not specify the amounts of money involved, Carol L. Sipperly, the
lead prosecutor, said the operation took in $5,000 to $6,000 a week
and that the loan was was $338,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti also pleaded guilty to two additional crimes that were not
part of the original federal indictment in January 1998 but were
put into three guilty plea as a result of a new investigation by
the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. One of these _ making loans between
January 1990 and September 1994 at usurious interest rates _ Gotti
described to the judge as ``loansharking.'' The second charge was
that he understated his income on a 1994 tax return.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the guilty pleas involved Scores, the Manhattan
topless club, that was originally the center of the case against
Gotti, who was accused of extorting money from the club's owners
and employees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's plea deal is only the latest in what the government
contends is a series of damaging blows to the power of organized
crime in New York and other major cities. In New York, the
conviction of Gotti comes on the heels of the July 1997 conviction
of Vincent ``the Chin'' Gigante, then the head of the powerful
Genovese crime family, for conspiracy and for an unsuccessful plot
to kill the elder Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Nicholas Corozzo, the designated successor
to the elder Gotti at the top of the Gambino family, pleaded guilty
in federal district court in Brooklyn to loan sharking,
racketeering and other charges, in exchange for a 10-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the efforts of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau have reduced the mob's
influence at the Fulton Fish Market, in the city's commercial
garbage hauling industry and at the Javits Convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's unusual court session, which began at 6:40 p.m.,
was attended by dozens of lawyers and investigators in the office
of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District. Gotti was
accompanied only by his three lawyers and his brother, Peter Gotti.
Judge spent roughly an hour making sure that Gotti understood each
charge to which he was pleading guilty and that the plea was not
the result of force or threats of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after reciting the crimes that he committed from a sheet
of yellow legal paper, Gotti faced the clerk of the court, who
asked him how he pleaded to three different categories of crimes.
Gotti pronounced ``guilty'' three different times.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti will be sentenced on July 8, though the boundaries of his
sentence were outlined by an agreement reached by Gotti's lawyers _
Shargel, Bruce Cutler and Sarita Kedia, and the prosecutors, Ms.
Sipperly and Marjorie Miller. The agreement is not binding on the
judge, but judges typically go along with such requests.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Parker could sentence him to anywhere from
5 years, 10 months to 7 years, 3 months. He also would be forced to
forfeit the $358,000 in cash that investigators seized from his
house, an 89-acre property in Pennsylvania and one additional
property. And he will pay a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection for Gotti's trial was supposed to start on
Tuesday morning, with 500 residents of Manhattan, the Bronx,
Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Dutchess Orange and Sullivan
counties summoned for what would have been at least a two-week
screening process. Gotti's lawyers appeared in court on Monday
morning to spell out some of the procedures for that screening and
to withdraw a request that Gotti be returned to jail so he could
save on the $24,000-a-month for the private guards he was required
to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   That mini-drama was supplanted later in the day by what appeared
to be secret negotiations between prosecutors and defense lawyers.
Richard Rehbock, a lawyer who has known Gotti for more than 15
years but was not permitted to represent him, emmerged at 5:30 and
told three reporters that the negotiations concerned questions on
the questionnaire. The reporters returned to their offices. What
almost gave his ruse away was that he was smoking a cigarette for
the first time in four months, an indication that something more
ominous was being discussed.

LIBYA HANDS OVER BOMBING SUSPECTS, AND U.N. LIFTS SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to insert ``on paper, that is'' in 7th graf.)  (See sidebar, LOCKERBIE-FAMILIES) 
(ac)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTRECHT, Netherlands _ More than a decade after Pan Am Flight
103 exploded over Scotland, killing 270 people, the two Libyans
charged with planting the bomb arrived in The Netherlands on Monday
to face trial for the crime. As a result, the United Nations
immediately removed its severe sanctions on the Libyan government
of Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   The end of those sanctions, in place since 1992, allows
international air travel and the sale of vital industrial equipment
to resume. The step will also release Libyan assets that had been
frozen in a number of countries. But separate sanctions imposed by
the United States in 1986 _ before the deaths over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988 _ will not end until other conditions are
fulfilled, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of the suspects in a highly unusual arrangement of
trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law followed years of
international pressure and months of diplomatic negotiations with
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Americans relatives of the dead expressed some bitterness at the
turn of events, arguing that Libya had won more than it lost. But
others expressed the hope that the extraditions would mark an
important turn on the road to exacting punishment for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa
Fahima, both assumed to be government agents, were brought here
under a complex arrangement that treats a former military base near
here as temporary Scottish territory, so the suspects can be tried
under Scottish law. It was this formula _ promoted by Britain _ of
holding the trial in a third country that finally broke the
deadlock and ended Libya's long refusal to cooperate with American
and British prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish judges presiding over the trial will have to weigh
the still secret evidence, provided by the United States and
Britain and decide whether the two Libyans are guilty of planting
the suitcase bomb. The judges will then face the more fundamental
questions of who gave the orders to blow up the plane and why. The
British and Americans have outlined the main conclusions of their
case, but have withheld the particulars.
</P>
<P>
   Libya handed over the two suspects this morning in Tripoli, the
Libyan capital, to Hans Corell, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
legal affairs, in the presence of envoys from half a dozen Arab and
other nations invited by Gadhafi. An Italian plane made available
to the United Nations took the two Libyans, each accompanied by a
relative and a lawyer, to the Dutch military air base, Valkenburg.
Dutch authorities at first took the two Libyans into custody after
they arrived this afternoon but an hour later formally extradited
them to Britain _ on paper, that is _ so the Scottish police could
take over.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch military helicopters then took the Libyans to Camp Zeist,
a former military base a few miles outside the city of Utrecht.
Some of the camp's buildings are being converted to include a
detention unit for the suspects and a room for the Scottish court.
More than 100 Scottish officials, including prosecutors, police and
court employees have already arrived in recent days. The camp, once
used by American military and then taken over by the Dutch, is kept
under tight guard by Scottish police.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement Monday saying that he was
``gratified'' by the extraditions. ``Now, at last, the road to
justice has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke with about 20 family members of the Lockerbie
victims in a conference call Monday reassured them that the
sanctions on Libya could be reimposed if the Libyan government
backed away from any part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who was deeply
involved in the diplomatic maneuvering leading up to the handover,
said Monday that this ended ``a 10-year diplomatic stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had over a year of hard diplomatic effort and tough
negotiations to get here,'' Cook said. ``There will now be a
criminal trial for that act of mass murder and the relatives of all
those who died will have their first opportunity to hear all the
evidence that we hold in open court.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the most difficult aspects of the case was that
the government had not been able to tell relatives of the victims
of the explosion ``what we know and suspect happened to their loved
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of those who died were on the ground in the village of
Lockerbie, while most of the passengers who died were Americans.
</P>
<P>
   British and American investigators concluded that a bomb was put
aboard the Pan Am flight on its way from Frankfurt to New York
during its stopover at Heathrow Airport. Less than an hour after
takeoff, the Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded in flames, killing its
passengers and crew members. In 1991, Britain and the United States
indicted the two Libyan government agents in connection with the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries, which have gone to great lengths to amass the
evidence for the crash, have insisted for years that the suspects
must face trial in either Scotland or in the United States. When
Libya refused, the two countries pressed the United Nations to
impose sanctions in 1992. The sanctions were toughened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   These sanctions have barred air travel to and from Libya as well
as the sale of arms and spare parts for aviation and for the oil
industry, which is vital to Libya. Although the sanctions were
suspended Monday, the Security Council must still vote to lift them
completely. It can do so within 90 days if the Secretary General
reports that Libya has met other conditions, such as cooperating
with France in its investigation of a UTA flight over Niger in 1989
in which 171 people died and committing itself to pay compensation
to the families of the crash victims in case its two agents are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock was broken last year when Washington and London
took up an old Libyan offer to have the two suspects face trial in
a third country. Libya had argued the two could not get a fair
trial in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's handover of the two follows months of mediation by South
Africa and Saudi Arabia and threats by the United States and
Britain that Libya could be subjected to even tougher sanctions.
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan involved themselves personally in the negotiations with
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the sanctions played a role in Libya's decision, Annan
said Monday, ``I prefer to think they played a role. No country
likes to be treated as an outcast.''He added, ``Libya wanted to get
on with its economic and society development.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the trial at Camp Zeist.

MURDOCH COMPANIES SCORE WITH INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rupert Murdoch had to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the Los Angeles Dodgers took the field to start
the season Monday, Wall Street closed a session that saw a major
boost to stocks of its parent companies Fox Entertainment Group and
News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, analyst Richard Bilotti of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter reiterated his ``strong buy'' rating on the stock of
Murdoch's News Corp. _ which owns 81 percent of Fox Entertainment _
pushing shares up $3.3125 to $33.875, for a gain of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The price was the highest for News Corp. in recent years,
surpassing the 52-week high of $33.50 last July. Bilotti said
shares have been undervalued compared with its entertainment
industry rivals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's strategies of aggressive acquisition and heavy debt
load have kept the price of News Corp. shares depressed in recent
years as the stocks of Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. have
soared. The News Corp. chief decided last year to split the company
in two, creating Fox Entertainment Group through a $2.8 billion
offering that left 18.6 percent of the new company in public hands.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Fox Entertainment rose $1.3125 to $28.375 on Monday.
Fox Entertainment, which went public in November at $22.50 a share,
owns the Dodgers, 20th Century Fox, the Fox Network and investments
in cable-television channels.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, the Dodgers beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks 8-6 in the 11th inning even though high-profile
pitcher Kevin Brown, who signed a seven-year contract worth a
stunning $105 million in the off-season, performed poorly in his
debut with Los Angeles.

DVD RACKS UP GAINS IN UNITS, DISCS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fledgling DVD format has received another
boost to its status as an industry trade group reported
first-quarter shipments of 390,000 players and sales of 10 million
discs.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the DVD Video Group on Monday shows that the
2-year-old format has shed its flash-in-the-pan status, based on
the strength of first-quarter activity. During that 90-day period,
24 percent of the current ``installed base'' of 1.6 million players
was shipped along with 33 percent of the 30 million discs shipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``These impressive shipment numbers for first quarter 1999
indicate the overwhelming consumer demand,'' said Emiel N. Petrone,
chairman of the trade group and an executive with Philips
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group also estimated that there are 2,500 titles
available in the format and projected that that figure will hit
4,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kim, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, said the
format's gains are not a surprise due to the rapid decline in
player prices _ now under $300 for bare-bones machines _ and the
increased supply of titles. ``We think there will be about 4million
players sold this year,'' he added. ``It's part of the growing
trend toward digital entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   DVDs debuted in March 1997 with a few dozen titles and and the
first players selling for at least $700. The discs are the same
size as compact discs and offer digital clarity, six-channel sound,
instant rewind and massive amounts of information such as movie
trailers, screenplays, interviews and foreign-language soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Stock of Los Angeles-based Image Entertainment, a wholesaler
converting its core business from laserdisc to DVD, rose 25 cents
to $6.9375 a share Monday following a gain of 81.25 cents in the
previous session. Despite the growth of the DVD business, the issue
has been hammered in recent weeks and hit a 1999 low of $5.875 on
March 31 before rebounding during the past two sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Image had traded above $12 following reports of
strong sales gains during the holiday season. Analyst Steven Hart
of Commonwealth Associates, who has a $20 price target for the
stock over the next 12 months, said the absence of new developments
since then has caused the stock to drift downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not performed the way I thought it would,''
Hart said Monday. ``Nothing has changed with the company and I
still expect the stock to reach the target. There was a lot of DVD
growth in the first quarter of this year and the format is taking
off just as expected.''

   NEW YORK _ Michael Kors was at Bergdorf Goodman a couple of
weeks ago to meet customers, and was reminded of a day early in his
career when he went to a store in Minneapolis where Bill Blass _
one of his idols, then and now _ was making a personal appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the Peter Frampton look, long curly blond hair and
scruffy jeans,'' Kors said, ``and this saleswoman said to me, `If
you clean yourself up, you can be just as good as Bill Blass.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he hasn't yet reached the iconic stature of Blass, but
Michael Kors now has a crew cut, wears cashmere sweaters and, more
important, has been named the 1999 women's wear designer of the
year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Both the
signature collection he shows on Seventh Avenue and the one he
designs for Celine in Paris have been winning high praise from the
fashion press, retailers and customers. And now that LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns Celine, has bought one-third of
his business and infused the company with money and opportunities
for expansion, Michael Kors is poised to become a global brand
name.
</P>
<P>
   When he appears at a store these days, loyal customers flock to
see him. He enthusiastically combs the racks, pulling out pieces he
likes and showing the women how to put them together in different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing trunk shows,'' he said in the midst of a recent
one at Saks Fifth Avenue. ``It shows me who the customer is and
what she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   His customers are like Sue and Sally Spiegel from Chicago, a
mother and daughter, who were at the Saks event in New York and
have both been wearing his clothes for years. ``When you find
something you like, you stick with it,'' Sally Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you really Michael Kors?'' her mother asked, as she paid
for a white pants outfit of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm really Michael Kors,'' he answered, ``and I was in
Chicago last week and where were you?'' She was charmed.
</P>
<P>
   There are also celebrity customers like Claire Danes, Lauren
Hutton, Barbara Walters and Bebe Neuwirth (who first met him in the
elevator of their apartment building in Greenwich Village). And
then there are the young New York social types like Aerin and Jane
Lauder, Samantha and Serena Boardman, Lulu de Kwiatkowski and
Brooke de Ocampo, many of whom have become his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Michael 8 or 10 years,'' Ms. de Ocampo said. ``A
lot of time I'll see him out and about at different parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wearing his clothes as long as I've known him. In my
age group right now, in between the stage of slouching-around
clothes and ladies-who-lunch clothes, he's perfect. It's how the
young American well-dressed woman likes to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Kors, 39, says he thinks about his customers when he designs.
``I think, `This is for so-and-so to wear to the beach.' And my
sample sales always turn into personal shopping sessions. I hate to
see things sitting on a rack. I'll say `Send this to so-and-so and
tell her she has to buy it.''' And she does, because she trusts his
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   This connection with his customers is one reason for his
longevity in the fashion business. Like the steady-Eddie supporting
actor who finally gets his chance in the spotlight, Kors is
enjoying the fruits of 18 years of toiling to build his business.
There were some shaky times: he had to close down his lower-priced
Kors line for three years (it is now licensed to Onward Kashiyama),
and some stores dropped him. But those stores and more are now
clamoring for his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nordstrom kind of dabbled with Kors over the years,'' said Sue
Patneaude, the store's vice president for designer apparel, ``but
we became vitally interested in the Michael Kors line this year and
will carry Celine this fall for the first time. He seems to have
matured and become very focused. All the talent he's been trying to
harness all these years has come together. He's all of a sudden
ended up front and center. It's cosmic.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip B. Miller, the chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, who gave a
cocktail party in February for Kors in the store and a dinner
afterward at Chow, considers him ``one of the designers of
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents a big growing business for us,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kaner, the senior vice president and fashion director of
Neiman Marcus, agrees that it's a Michael Kors moment. ``He's at
the top of his form and seems more secure than ever,'' she said.
``He's able to do two collections, each with its own identity, and
both strong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After his recent public appearance at Bergdorf's, relaxing over
a Coke and cookies (no cigarette, he gave up smoking last
November), Kors ruminated on the reasons for his sudden success
after 18 years. ``I think I've been consistent,'' he said. ``I've
stuck to my guns. Fashion to a certain degree is a roller coaster,
and I've held a steady course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sum up this time in fashion,'' he continued, ``it's
casual luxe. It's what we've always done, which was for a cult and
is now more mainstream, for more people. It's not just the press
and retailers, but a broader group of customers who are saying,
that's the way to dress right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been very much about the customer,'' he added.
``What never changes is that everyone wants to look tall and thin
and young. When everyone from Claire Danes to Courtney Love to
Barbara Walters all wear the same clothes, that's when I know I'm
doing my job well.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the criticism from some quarters that what he does is
just sportswear, not high fashion?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to Paris last year to do Celine,'' he said,
``people said, `You're a sportswear designer.' I said, Two of the
most legendary names in French fashion _ Chanel and Yves Saint
Laurent _ both had a sportswear attitude. And I think the two
greatest garments designed in the world are the T-shirt and jeans.
They're ageless and sexless and they came from America.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that what Kors stands for is sportswear.
There is nothing chichi about the sweaters, skirts, pants, jackets
and coats he designs, but they do carry a sense of luxury with rich
materials like cashmere, silk, leather and fur.
</P>
<P>
   His three lines _ Michael Kors, Kors by Michael Kors and Celine
_ all share a design sensibility that stamps them as his work. No
mean achievement considering the simplicity of the designs.
</P>
<P>
   But don't call him a minimalist, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear `minimalism,' I think `pretentious,''' he said.
``I think of a room so minimal you're afraid to sit in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He sprinkles his evening wear with glitter and isn't reluctant
to use exuberant colors like orange, red and cerulean blue, playing
them against basics like camel and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says I use blue because my eyes are blue and I use
camel and brown because I'm blond,'' he said. ``But people expect
those colors from me. If I don't show something blue, women ask for
it.'' Indeed, a woman approached him at Bergdorf's and complained
that there was nothing blue in the spring collection.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signatures, which he refers to as Michaelisms,
that are in some form in all his collections. These are the
turtleneck (``The turtleneck thing you have to blame on my
mother,'' he said. ``She's turtleneck-obsessed, even living in Los
Angeles.''), the white shirt and the strapless black dress.

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two big agency companies are on the acquisition trail
again in deals that underscore the urgency with which the global
giants are seeking to expand their services.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to broaden its offerings in retail marketing _ and
add more glue to a relationship with a big automotive client _
Omnicom Group, the world's No. 1 agency company, has agreed in
principle to acquire Zimmerman &AMP; Partners Advertising in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., which specializes in local auto dealer
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   And to increase its expertise in data base marketing, Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc., the world's No. 5 agency company, is buying Knowledge
Base Marketing Inc. in Chapel Hill, N.C., which specializes in the
so-called customer relationship services that are at the heart of
electronic commerce and other targeted marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions like this, said Edward H. Vick, chief operating
officer at Y&AMP;R in New York, are meant to ``extend our capabilities
and our marketing expertise to better help our clients achieve
results in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R is acquiring Knowledge Base, a leader in data base
marketing, in a cash and stock deal valued around $175 million; it
is the largest acquisition made by Y&AMP;R since the company went
public last May. Terms of the agreement between Omnicom and
Zimmerman, which is still being completed, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman had been a major local dealer agency for Mitsubishi
Motor Sales of America, handling dealer groups in markets like
Baltimore, Dallas and Miami, until losing those assignments in the
last year to Deutsch Inc. in Los Angeles and New York. The losses
came after the collapse of a deal calling for Zimmerman to be
acquired by Grey Advertising in New York, the world's ninth-largest
agency company, and for a team of Zimmerman and Grey to handle
those duties.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Zimmerman, which also has regional offices in cities like
Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco, is to become the agency for
local dealers selling cars and trucks for the North American
operations of another Japanese automaker, the troubled Nissan Motor
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the second instance in a month that Omnicom has
made significant efforts to strengthen ties with a large, important
automotive client, coming after a decision to have Merkley Newman
Harty in New York handle the Mercedes-Benz of North America account
for DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is the largest worldwide client of TBWA Worldwide, an
Omnicom agency, representing about half of the agency's $1.6
billion in global billings. Under the agreement, Zimmerman will
become an agency dedicated to the dealer account of Nissan North
America, with billings estimated at $200 million. That assignment
would be shifted from the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of TBWA.
</P>
<P>
   TBWA/Chiat/Day will continue to handle the national brand, or
so-called factory, advertising for Nissan along with the national
brand and local dealer advertising for the sibling Infiniti
division. Those billings are estimated at $400 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   TBWA/Chiat/Day is preparing to create campaigns for several 2000
model year vehicles considered crucial for a comeback of Nissan,
which was recently given a substantial financial infusion by the
French automaker Renault SA. Those products include the Xterra
sport utility vehicle and the Maxima sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, executive vice president at Omnicom in New York,
confirmed a report of the acquisition this week in the trade
publication Adweek. The seven regional offices of TBWA/Chiat/Day
that had handled local dealer advertising are likely to become part
of Zimmerman, he said; they are in cities like Chicago, Dallas and
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman will report to Omnicom rather than TBWA, he added, as
part of efforts to give Nissan dealers a voice deemed more
independent from the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Zimmerman, chairman and president at Zimmerman, referred
telephone calls to Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R's acquisition of Knowledge Base, a privately held company
with revenue estimated at $40 million to $50 million, will bolster
the offerings of its direct-marketing arm, Wunderman Cato Johnson
in New York. Knowledge Base will operate as an autonomous unit
under current management, reporting to Jay Bingle, chief executive
at Wunderman Cato in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this combination with Young &AMP; Rubicam enhances
our ability'' to help clients achieve ``the most effective and
efficient execution of marketing programs,'' said Tim Toben, chief
executive at Knowledge Base, who will continue in that post.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Base develops and manages data bases for more than 200
clients in various fields, including energy, financial services,
health care, retailing and technology. Among them are CDNow, the
online music retailer; Ford Motor; Mellon Bank; Microsoft, and
United Healthcare. Knowledge Base has more than 280 employees in
offices in Chapel Hill and seven other cities, including Chicago,
Houston, Mexico City and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R will ``continue to look for acquisitions'' like the deal to
buy Knowledge Base, Vick said. Shares of Y&AMP;R fell 12.5 cents
Monday, to $40.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.

ON BASEBALL: MCGWIRE LOOKS AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The cheers for him rock the stadium. It is opening
day of the baseball season here, and there is always a full house
for this event, but this one is special. Because of him, because of
what he has done. And Monday night in Mark McGwire's first time at
bat in the 1999 season, he received a standing ovation from the
50,000-plus fans, with flashbulbs sparkling in a light drizzle, and
the fans remained standing as he walked on a 3-2 pitch from the
Milwaukee left-hander Rafael Roque. Then they booed the pitcher for
his, to them, lack of fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has been in demand. He was ushered in to kiss the pope's
ring when the holy father visited here over the winter. He even got
a cameo on a television sit-com. He is rich, he is famous, he is
adored. One might imagine that he needs a psychiatrist like a hole
in the head. Not true. He sees one regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone does'' need one, he said before Monday night's
opening game at Busch Stadium. ``Just some people don't want to
admit it. Everyone has problems _ maybe not problems, but issues.''
</P>
<P>
   To the question _ the most asked question in sports at this
moment _ ``Can you top last year?'' McGwire has a reply, one that
presumably grew out of therapy. ``That's living in the past, it's
what's been done,'' he said. ``Last year means nothing. You have to
turn the page.'' It is a way of relieving whatever psychological
burdens one may place on oneself.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, 35, is huge _ 6 feet 5 inches, 250 pounds, 17{-inch
biceps. He is our Atlas, our Tarzan, our Captain Marvel, our Sultan
of Swat. He is the guy who did the unthinkable, bashing 70 home
runs for the St. Louis Cardinals last season _ breaking Roger
Maris' sanctified record by nine homers, beating Babe Ruth's by a
big, fat 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look in awe at Mac in batting practice,'' said the veteran
outfielder Darren Bragg, who joined the Cardinals as a free agent
from Boston this spring. ``We're all men, but he's five or six
levels beyond the rest of us. When we try to hit a homer, we try to
hit it over the fence. When he tries to hit a homer, he tries to
hit it out of the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   But appearances, and statistics, can be deceiving. In a society
in which some still perceive it a weakness of some kind to seek
help or support mentally, McGwire has been up-front about visiting
a psychiatrist. ``I've been seeing somebody since November of
'91,'' he said. He looks at a visitor directly, no pretense in his
blue eyes, an easy smile glimpsed within his red goatee.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1991, McGwire was not on top of the world. In
fact, he felt as if he was sinking deep into it. In his fifth full
season in the big leagues, as a first baseman for Oakland, he had
batted just .201 and had fallen to 22 homers, well down from his
league-leading 49 as a rookie. His marriage was falling apart, and
he was separated from his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I needed help then,'' he said, ``and I felt I
couldn't get out of this by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The next season McGwire improved to a .268 batting average and
42 homers. Then he suffered debilitating injuries and got down
again. ``I thought about giving up baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire talked with his psychiatrist and eventually decided not
to leave baseball.
</P>
<P>
   His physical health improved and so, apparently, did his mental
health. ``His concentration and intensity grew stronger,'' said
Tony La Russa, the Cardinal manager who also managed McGwire in
Oakland. ``I watch him in the dugout as he gets ready to go to the
on-deck circle. He's focusing, he's grinding. He seems oblivious to
anything else that's going on. You can actually see the power of
his mind rippling.''
</P>
<P>
   And what issues, as McGwire termed them, might be bothering him
at other times? Personal ones, he says, ``like everybody else.''
Business? Family? Pressure? ``Sure,'' he said. He has said that if
he doesn't hit 70 homers this season ``some people will say I
failed.'' He won't, he said. To hit 50 or more, that's his goal.
</P>
<P>
   He says he can handle whatever pressures might develop. ``My
mind is too strong _ nothing is going to get in my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he continue to see a psychiatrist? McGwire nodded. ``The
day you stop learning,'' he said, ``is the day you're 6 feet
under.''

SCHOLAR'S STORMY LIFE WITH MORGAN'S GHOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are not a perfect couple: J. Pierpont Morgan,
the inarticulate, unreflective and unofficial central banker of the
United States before there was a Federal Reserve, and Jean Strouse,
a former Radcliffe English major whose analytic gifts were
previously focused on a biography of Alice James, a powerless
invalid.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last 15 years, Ms. Strouse has lived nearly
full-time, on paper and in her head, with Morgan, the titan who
gave birth to industrial America and many of New York's most
important cultural institutions. She has pored over Morgan's ledger
books, investigated his mistresses and found pressed violets in the
diary of his first wife. Even now, she has yet to move the
Morganalia out of her one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side.
``Morgan takes up more space than I do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, no one alive knows him as well. Evidence: her 796-page
``Morgan: American Financier,'' published this month by Random
House, in which Ms. Strouse is part detective, part novelist, part
psychologist. Reviewers are in awe that Ms. Strouse has found a
human being underneath the rapacious robber baron (the view of the
left) or the financial Moses (the right). For her part, Ms. Strouse
spent her first five years with Morgan eyeing him with a
prosecutor's disgust. ``It was as if I had my hands on my hips
saying, `Oh, sure,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Strouse liked Morgan but didn't excuse him _ and
felt she had forged an intimate connection. ``But it took years to
feel that,'' she said in an interview at the Morgan Library, the
same place where Morgan famously locked up the nation's bankers
during the financial panic of 1907 and ordered them to sign a
bailout package. ``Because he's such an alien character to me. He
didn't want to know any of the things I wanted to know.''
</P>
<P>
   And what, if Morgan were alive and down the hall (he died in
1913), would she ask him?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strouse hesitated. She is a journalist-turned-scholar, with
a serious reputation. ``I don't think I want to say,'' she said.
Which makes it all the more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she relented, there was the matter of his first wife,
Amelia _ Memie _ his true love, who was already so sick with a
serious cough when he married her in 1861 that Morgan had to hold
her up at the altar. He then insisted on taking Memie to the
Mediterranean for a cure, only to be told in Europe that Memie had
tuberculosis. Morgan nursed her obsessively and carried her up and
down seven flights of stairs in Paris. But Memie died four months
after the wedding, when Morgan was 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether that marriage was ever consummated,'' Ms.
Strouse said, a little embarrassed by her admission. It is not, she
admitted, a historically important question, just the human
curiosity of someone who knows Morgan, and cares. ``Because he
really loved her,'' Ms. Strouse said. ``I don't know if he ever got
over her death.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These days Ms. Strouse, 53, is enjoying that moment when the
private life of a scholar becomes the public life, however
fleeting, of just-published biographer. There will be a party for
her at the Morgan Library next week, a book tour, plus her re-entry
into the 20th century. (Ms. Strouse knew it was time to move on
from Alice James, the sister of Henry and William, when she began
writing ``Dec. 12, 1878'' on her own correspondence.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I want to do this again,'' she said of big
biography. ``It was too long and hard. A friend of mine says that
biography is a little like marriage _ you only have room in your
life for one or two. Well, I've had two.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strouse has never married, was involved with a man until
recently and travels in the gossipy intellectual world of what
people sometimes call The New York Review of Each Other's Books.
Ms. Strouse grew up in Los Angeles, where her father was an
internist, came to New York after graduating from Radcliffe in 1967
to work as an assistant to Robert B. Silvers, the co-editor of The
New York Review of Books, left in 1975 to write her 1980 Alice
James book (which won the Bancroft Prize), spent four years as a
book critic at Newsweek, then started working on Morgan in 1983.
She plays squash and dresses well, but otherwise lives a very
un-Morganesque life.
</P>
<P>
   When her 1983 advance payment from Random House ran out _ she
describes it as ``in the low six figures'' _ Ms. Strouse put
together academic grants, teaching jobs, money from her mother and
additional payments from Random House. ``I've been living like a
graduate student, and I've had it,'' she said. ``Especially writing
about somebody who lived the way Morgan did _ it was comical.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through, she nearly gave up when she began waking up at
4 a.m., convinced she would would never understand the 19th century
financial data. ``But I couldn't pay back the advance, and I also
couldn't admit failure,'' she said. A friend who runs a hedge fund,
Roger Alcaly, talked her through it, and today Ms. Strouse is a
trustee of some family investments. ``I've been educated,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She has no idea what she'll do next, but well remembers when she
finished the book _ Aug. 19, 1998. Two days later she took a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so light,'' she said. ``It was the first vacation I'd
taken without J.P. Morgan in 15 years.''

BRAZIL, THOUGH STRUGGLING, PROVES SURPRISINGLY RESILIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ When the price of imported wheat rose more
than 50 percent earlier this year, Lawrence Pih, the president of
Brazil's largest flour mill, anticipated the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected many of our clients to go bankrupt so we prepared
ourselves legally to get anything we could from them, like
machinery,'' said Pih, whose company, Moinho Pacifico, caters to a
range of companies from the corner bakery to large food processors.
To his surprise, clients have shown unexpected willingness and
creativity to negotiate ways out of such outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Pih, a naturalized Brazilian from Shanghai, took legal
action to recoup losses against only seven insolvent bakeries,
fewer than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brazil has had far fewer bankruptcies and business
closures than analysts expected, even as the country struggles with
its deepest recession since the early 1990s. In Sao Paulo, the
nerve center of the economy, there were 1,035 court-ordered
requests in March to close companies, in a process similar to U.S.
bankruptcy. That's up only slightly from 982 in the same month last
year, said the Sao Paulo Commercial Association, a trade group. In
March 1996, the number totaled a record 1,455.
</P>
<P>
   These figures, combined with other data on inflation, foreign
trade and industrial production, produce a picture of the Brazilian
economy a lot less bleak than that painted by economists a month
ago, when the country was ostracized after the chaotic devaluation
of the currency, the real. Now, instead of cautioning investors of
the possibility of a domestic debt default, economists are working
to convince people that a recovery could be swifter and stronger
than initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after shrinking at a 3 percent rate in the first
quarter compared with the last quarter of 1998, the gross domestic
product should grow by half a percent in the second quarter and by
as much as 2 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, said
Alexandre Azara, an economist at Banco BBA Creditanstalt.
</P>
<P>
   As predictions of a return to hyperinflation and of an exchange
rate spinning out of control have given way to slower price
increases and a strengthening real, Brazilian stock and bond
markets have responded with rallies over the last several weeks
unmatched by markets anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations vary for this turnaround in mood, which is rooted
in better-than-expected economic indicators. Emilio Alfieri, the
economist for the Sao Paulo Commercial Association, said many
companies had been made resilient by a history of recessions that
have winnowed the weaklings and made survivors wary of taking on
risky levels of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the Southeast Asians, we're used to repeated, traumatic
recessions and high interest rates,'' Alfieri said. ``Surviving
these crises has resulted in Darwinian selection.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the recession of 1999 comes after a year in which
the economy barely grew. This recession is the fourth large
contraction in Brazil since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   One other perspective on why Brazilian companies have survived
this latest bout with a rough economy may have to do with what is
known in Portuguese as the ``jeito'' (pronounced JAY-too), a term
that describes the ability of Brazilians to find clever solutions
to legal, bureaucratic or financial quagmires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jeito provides more space for negotiating,'' said Roberto
da Matta, an anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame who is
considered an authority on the subject. ``It is a bridge between
two worlds, one in which old ways and common sense hold sway and
another in which the new framework of society isn't just or
rational.'' Held virtually as a national characteristic in Brazil,
a country with a large and intricate bureaucracy, the jeito, or its
diminutive ``jeitinho,'' is now being employed by many companies as
their only means of survival.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Pih, the president of the flour mill, cited the
example of a jeito in which his company, because of the tough
economic climate for many of his clients, allows them up to 28 days
to pay for bread that would otherwise be sold on a cash basis. By
sometimes stretching out the payment period by an additional week,
a decision taken on a case-by-case basis, his company in effect
extends an interest-free loan to customers. Smaller, cash-strapped
companies can use this time to cover immediate expenses while
companies in a more comfortable position could use the money for
other purposes _ such as investing in high-yield government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Although complicated, this scheme has its advantages. Pih's
company keeps most of its clients, and thanks to the higher price
of wheat, its revenue is expected to increase this year in local
currency terms to about 130 million reals, or about $76 million,
from 100 million reals last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the brunt of such an operation could fall on the
government, which has to pay high interest on the notes purchased
by some of Pih's savvy clients. A larger debt load, in turn, fuels
concern over the growth of the government's budget deficit. The
failure by authorities to cut spending at the end of 1997 was cited
by critics of government policy as a leading reason for the attack
by speculators on Brazil's currency, which culminated in the
January devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the government has been forced to renegotiate with
the International Monetary Fund to obtain new loans of $9.8 billion
to help strengthen confidence in the country's finances. The first
$4.9 billion installment of these loans was approved last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Brazil can make progress in narrowing its budget deficit
will be watched closely. Even government officials have expressed
some surprise at the improving signals of Brazil's economy, while
cautiously warning that much hard work lies ahead in trimming
spending. So far, the government has won approval in Congress for a
tax on financial transactions, which will provide more revenue,
while other watered-down changes will provide additional relief.
</P>
<P>
   However, the impact of the currency devaluation has worried
economists, with some expecting the deficit, including interest
payments, to reach more than 13 percent of gross domestic product
in January and perhaps 14 percent in February and March, compared
with 8 percent at the end of 1998.

IT'S A NEW DAY, BUT THE METS AGE QUICKLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The New York Mets spent the off-season spending money to
keep their top players and making trades to become potential
postseason contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But on opening day the Mets could not beat the Florida Marlins,
the worst team in the National League last season. The Mets'
revamped offense left 14 runners stranded, including the bases
loaded twice, and went 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position in
Monday's 6-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Al Leiter pitched at Pro Player Stadium was as the
Marlins' starter in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series. Leiter, who
struggled all spring, allowed three first-inning runs, five
overall, in five innings Monday. He threw 124 pitches, surrendered
nine hits and two walks and had five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   His first-inning troubles provided a quick reminder that no
matter how improved the Mets look on paper, they are still
struggling against a team that finished last year with 54
victories, the fewest in the league. In 1998, the Mets were only
7-5 against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets hope to get off to a quick start this season, the
schedule maker did not do them any favors. The first 13 games of
the season will be against the Marlins and the Montreal Expos. The
Mets, who won 88 games last season, were 4-8 against an Expos team
that won 65.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' starter, Alex Fernandez, recovering from rotator
cuff surgery, had not pitched since Oct. 8, 1997, but Monday he
pitched five strong innings.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura, one of the vaunted off-season acquisitions, did
not have an auspicious debut. He flied out to leave the bases
loaded in the first inning and in the bottom of the frame did not
look like a five-time Gold Glove winner. He got a late jump on Luis
Castillo's leadoff Baltimore chop that led to a single and he was
unable to glove Derrek Lee's hard smash to third with one out and
runners on first and third, turning a potential inning-ending
double play into a run-scoring single and opening the way for the
Marlins' three-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dunwoody lined a run-scoring single to center, Mike Piazza
committed a passed ball to allow the runners to move to second and
third. Preston Wilson, who was part of the trade that brought
Piazza to New York last May, delivered a sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the Mets were down, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura atoned for his transgressions with a third-inning
sacrifice fly. But through their first three at-bats, the Mets had
left six runners on base, including four in scoring position,
against Fernandez, who left after 95 pitches to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   And then Florida added two more runs in the fifth off Leiter to
make it 5-1 when Wilson singled Lee home with two out, then stole
second and scored on Kevin Orie's double off the left field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Marlins, the Mets are built to win now. Their
starting lineup averages 31 years of age, their starting rotation
34; their closer is 38. Phillips had talked before the game about
his only expectation being that his players perform to their
average capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the general manager was asked, is this a
playoff team? ``It should be,'' Phillips said, well aware that the
Mets have not qualified for the post-season since 1988. ``It better
be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the Mets looked a lot more like the team that had
trouble beating the Marlins and the Expos last season.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Refugees pouring into Albania from Kosovo are
providing detailed firsthand accounts of mass killings and burned
corpses in villages where Serbs were forcing out ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees at widely scattered places and times have given
overlapping accounts to foreign journalists and relief workers of
several mass killings, including a massacre on March 26 of about
100 people gathered together in the adjacent villages of Velika
Krusa and Mala Krusa, known to Albanians as Kruse-E-Mahde and
Kruse-E-Vogel. The refugees said that the victims had been killed
with automatic weapons and that some bodies were later burned.
</P>
<P>
   The dead will probably number at least in the ``high hundreds,''
said Eugene O'Sullivan, chief of the observer team from the
Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe that is
monitoring the refugee crisis at the border.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of killing have been so frequent, and so repetitive
in their detail, he said, that the European organization has
brought in 60 specially trained investigators to interview refugees
and keep records for possible war-crimes indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee flow continued unabated Monday, with the long
miserable lines of sobbing people stretching some 40 miles back
into Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m. Monday, 22,000 people had crossed the border, in
addition to the 188,036 who had passed over the Morini crossing as
of Sunday. Some had been walking for seven days from the area of
Mitrovica, north of Pristina, the depopulated capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, a 10-year-old boy, Dren Caka, who had
been shot in the arm, crossed the border and was being treated at
the Doctors of the World tent. He said he had been hiding with his
family and others in the basement of their home in the city of
Djakovica when the Serbs came in and methodically shot several
people in the head, then set the building on fire.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about the refugees is that they are largely
women, children and old men. The young men, they say, are either
hiding in the mountains or have been separated out by the Serbs and
taken away to some unknown fate.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no way to verify independently the accounts of
killings _ foreign journalists have been expelled from Kosovo _
their similarity suggested that they were credible. Earlier Serbian
efforts to remove Muslims from parts of Bosnia were accompanied by
numerous massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep hearing the same story over and over from
different sources, you have to lend some credence,'' said Dorian
Vienneau, a member of the observer team. ``The sheer volume of
reports leaves me to believe this is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishar Juareka said that in the village of Balenica, ``They
surrounded us. They killed some and captured some and took them
away. They killed four children because their families did not have
money to give to the police. We have seen the bodies of the
children. They killed them with knives not guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Two bombs were dropped on the village of Negovac, and it was
shelled as well, said Skender Bici, 42. ``There were at least 25
people killed from the houses that were destroyed,'' he said.
``They threw gasoline over the bodies and burned them. There were
other people killed but we only know what we saw in our district.
</P>
<P>
   Afrim Elshani, 32, who said who took four days to drive the 21
miles to the border from Suva Rica said that last week the police
came and started to shoot people. ``I know of 10 people who were
killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of accounts have described a massacre in Kruse-E-Vogel
and Kruse-E-Madhe which lie south of the major town of Orahavac.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC has received an amateur videotape said to be have been
made in Kruse-E-Madhe, running 1 minute and 42 seconds, which shows
the crumpled bodies of several young men lying on the ground who
appear to have been shot in the head or throat. Two of the bodies
were charred and burned.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-year-old woman, Naxhije Zymi, who said 10 of her brothers
had been killed, gave this account of what had happened in
Kruse-E-Vogel:
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday, the police came early in the morning. They executed
almost 100 people. They killed them all, men, women and children.
They set a fire and threw the bodies in the fire and put car tires
on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Her account was similar to others given to foreign reporters and
the European observers. The accounts describe people being gathered
near a mosque and being mowed down by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, Enver Muharremi, told OSCE observers that in
Kruse-E-Vogel he had seen a truck carrying about 20 bodies driven
to a nearby river, where the bodies were dumped on a bank and then
set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Shefret Begaj, 52, who was herded past Kruse-E-Vogel with a
group of villagers who had been gathered in Balenica, said he had
seen the Serbs in Kruse-E-Vogel digging what appeared to be a big
grave with a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the mass killings, the European security organization's
records suggest, occurred a week ago Friday as the Serbian drive
was just beginning, possibly in an effort to sow terror. In Sopine,
in the Suharke district, the observer reports say, about 50
policemen arrived that day and killed 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   Other killings reported seem more random, with people shooting
individuals on the street. The accounts suggest that private armies
were particularly active in the streets of Djakovica, killing large
numbers of young men there.
</P>
<P>
   In one neighborhood of Djakovica, a group of six Serbs wearing
masks separated the men from the women and children, killed 11
people, and burned 50 shops and about 35 houses, said Mehdi
Halilaj, 27. They left the 11 bodies in the street to frighten
others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over the stories spilled out of the refugees,
impossible to verify, but each packed with specific detail. Islam
Ponik, 50, for example, said that he had seen 15 people, most of
them from the Rexhepi family, burned alive in the village of
Celina. Their shirts were stripped off, he said, gasoline was
thrown on them and they were set on fire. Hajrullah Kabashi, 36,
from the village of Ternse, said Serbs killed as many as 47 people
who had tried to stay in their houses, including two of the town's
teachers, Refki Rexhaj and Lulije Gashi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a story,'' said O'Sullivan, the observer team's
chief.
</P>
<P>
   A clear, well-organized pattern of driving the refugees out is
apparent from the accounts of their flight. People from smaller
villages and outlying hamlets are herded into larger central towns,
which become collection points, surrounded by infantry. Often they
are shelled with tanks, mortars and Katyusha rockets along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they are put in convoys of farm tractors or cars,
sometimes flying white rags, or forced on foot to the border
crossing point near here with police cars or tanks at their back.
Along the way they are systematically robbed of foreign currency,
jewelry and the better cars, and their identity documents and
license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees said the violence and humiliation did not end when
they had been expelled from their homes but followed them on their
journeys. Older men wearing the traditional white conical hat of
the mountain Albanians were beaten about the head, they said, and
people were forced to make the three-fingered Serbian sign or chant
``Serbia, Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   According to another account, two girls were pulled out of their
car at the Serbian border checkpoint the other night and raped. And
others said that Serbs along the way are plunging long knives into
the tires of the refugees' tractors and cars, flattening them and
making the journey even slower and more painful.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO on Monday gave its military commander
the authority he sought to send 24 U.S. Apache helicopter gunships
to Albania, with surface-to-surface missiles and about 2,000
American soldiers who will use them to attack Serbian forces across
the border in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, also got approval for
the deployment from the Albanian authorities Monday evening,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache anti-tank helicopters and their missile systems are
expected to be in position in about a week, supplementing a bombing
campaign that the allies say has only begun to get seriously under
way now that the weather has cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's top commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, asked for the helicopters, along with the 12 additional
Stealth F-117A fighters and the scores of attack planes based on
the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the aircraft to bolster the bombing campaign that has
so far failed to stop Serbian forces in Kosovo from driving ethnic
Albanians out of the province in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just starting to hit them,'' said Air Commodore David
Wilby, a British officer who is the spokesman for the allied
military command. ``I think you will find very direct results
coming in shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday more refugees kept pouring out of Kosovo, and 34,000
of them arrived in Albania and 10,000 in Macedonia on Sunday alone,
allied officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   Allied transport planes flew 31 missions on Sunday to bring in
200 tons of food and medical supplies to the refugee camps along
the Macedonian border, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Direct allied air attacks against the Serbian forces were
hampered until Sunday night by clouds and rain, military officers
here said. They said they hoped that the Apache helicopters, which
can fly at low levels at night and in any kind of weather, would
stop the attacks on civilians where higher-flying planes could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very grateful to the United States for making available
this extremely important capability,'' said the alliance's
spokesman, Jamie Shea. He said the allies would view any threat to
Albania from the Serbian forces under Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic with extreme seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Clark asked for the Apache helicopters to improve the air
campaign's ability to attack individual Yugoslav Army units and
heavily armed paramilitary police units that have been surrounding
ethnic Albanian villages with tanks or other armored vehicles,
driving out all the inhabitants at gunpoint and then herding them
onto buses and farm vehicles for expulsion to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches fly close to the ground at more than 150 mph and can
launch up to 16 laser-guided Hellfire missiles at targets like
tanks from more than three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the helicopters, President Clinton decided to send 18
rocket launchers that fire ground-to-ground missiles used to attack
radar systems and anti-aircraft weapons that could pose a threat to
the anti-tank helicopters. The rockets, M-39s, have a range of 100
miles and warheads that explode and disperse 950 deadly grenades
apiece over a wide area, sending lethal metal fragments that can
kill soldiers and disable or immobilize their anti-aircraft
missiles or guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches use laser guidance systems and night vision devices
that let a two-member crew zero in on armored personnel carriers
and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the most effective anti-tank weapons the NATO
campaign has been able to use against the marauding Serb units are
the two-engined A-10 aircraft that became known as ``tank killers''
in the Gulf War of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers said A-10s were in the air Monday as the
allies took advantage of improved weather over the Balkans to bomb
27 targets, including an oil refinery on the northwest outskirts of
Belgrade overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets hit overnight, Wilby said, were Serb tanks
ringing the Kosovo village of Glodane _ one village among hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   He showed photographs of the tanks, and said that later pictures
the command did not make available showed that the Serbs had set
fire to the village after forcing the inhabitants out. He said he
could not release photographs of the damage done to the Serb tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we want to stop the violence in Kosovo immediately,
as soon as we possibly can,'' Shea said Monday. ``The most
important thing is that at the end of the day we should be able to
reverse this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in the Apache helicopters posed ticklish problems for
Washington _ where their involvement was seen as taking the United
States one step closer to sending in ground troops to help the
refugees go home to Kosovo _ and for allied countries who do not
want to widen the war by bringing on attacks against Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Italy, wary of NATO actions that could increase the
flow of refugees across the Adriatic, and in Greece, where public
opposition to the bombing runs strong, have called for an end to
the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Italy nor Greece, nor any other country, raised
objections Monday to a proposal to let Solana negotiate the Apache
deployment with the Albanian authorities, diplomats said.

DODGERS MAKE OPENING STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was New Hampshire, minus the apathy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at Dodger Stadium there was the red-white-and-blue
bunting, the pageantry and all the promise you'd expect from an
opening primary.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 NL West race was formally launched in front of a
sellout crowd, with the upstart Arizona Diamondbacks playing
Elizabeth Dole to the pedigreed Dodgers' George W. Bush. At the end
of the long and winding campaign, each side hopes, is a date in the
Fall Classic against the incumbent New York Yankees, the American
League's answer to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The first of 13 regular-season meetings between the two teams
was such a slice of heaven, they played 11. In a game that saw both
teams parade pitchers to the fore like stump speakers, the Dodgers
eked out an 8-6 win that delivered a message, loud and clear, to
anyone in the crowd of 53,109 who stuck around long enough to hear
it:
</P>
<P>
   Never count these Dodgers out.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Raul Mondesi on this day could do no wrong. His
three-run blast in the bottom of the ninth sent the game into extra
innings and his two-run homer in the 11th settled it.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Mondesi found himself ahead of Mark McGwire's
single-season record pace of a year ago (McGwire hit one homer off
the Dodgers' Ramon Martinez in the 1998 season opener at St.
Louis). Three-hundred-and-twenty-four homers, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi also drove in the Dodgers' first run, in his first
at-bat. It was one heck of a declaration, coming from a player who
batted just .224 with runners in scoring position last year.
</P>
<P>
   So was the patience he showed at the plate. Notorious for
swinging at the first pitch, Mondesi passed on every initial
offering in his six at-bats. He came to the plate in the bottom of
the ninth with two men on and two outs and proceeded to lay off
reliever Gregg Olson's first three pitches, all balls.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, first-year manager Davey Johnson decided it was
time to make a statement that some surely would view as slightly
left of center. He gave Mondesi the green light to swing on the
next pitch. Olson made Johnson look like a genius by throwing a
high fastball that the high fastball-loving Mondesi crushed into
the left-center field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi later would say he couldn't decode Johnson's hand
signals so he made a unilateral decision to swing away. It was that
kind of day for Mondesi and the Dodgers, who skirted certain
cataclysm twice in the early innings before staging their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching ace Kevin Brown, making his much-anticipated Dodgers
debut, retired the Diamondbacks in order in the first, though it
would require a dozen pitches. From the first pitch (a ball) to the
111th (which Jay Bell sent into the bleachers to drive in three
runs) it was a pockmarked performance for the man who aims for
perfection every time he throws to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona loaded the bases in the second and again in the third,
which put the pressure firmly on the Dodgers' softest spot. That
would be the infield, which was a minefield last year.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Eric Young let it be known early on that we can
expect things to be different in 1999. He deftly avoided a sliding
Tony Batista and turned the double play to save Brown in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   And shortstop Mark Grudzielanek _ he of the 33 errors in 1998 _
gobbled up a grounder by Luis Gonzalez and flipped the ball to
Young for the force that defused Arizona's charge in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Young also made it clear the broken right foot he suffered in
September is sufficiently healed by stealing twice off Diamondbacks
starter Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who very nearly was traded to the Dodgers from Seattle
last June before being dealt to Houston, signed a ludicrously
lucrative deal with Arizona last fall. His four-year, $52 million
contract was part of a $119 million spending spree by Diamondbacks
owner Jerry Colangelo aimed at upgrading the team's talent. If
Arizona doesn't become the first second-year franchise to post a
winning record since the 1962 Angels, it won't be for any lack of
trying on Colangelo's part.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days after the Diamondbacks landed Johnson, the Dodgers
signed Brown to the mother(lode) of all deals _ $105 million over
seven years, thus setting up the most compelling showdown this side
of Gore vs. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one could have have foreseen that Brown would give
up three home runs _ two to Bernard Gilkey and one to Bell. Not
after he allowed only eight in 257 innings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could anyone have predicted a gamer like Dodgers catcher
Todd Hundley striking out four times, an enigma like Mondesi
driving in six runs and a former Diamondback, Devon White, knocking
in more runs than Arizona's resident slugger, Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was just one game in 162, but for the Dodgers it was a
powerful opening statement. &QL;

`JUNIOR' GOTTI SEEMS MORE SON THAN BOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ His father was the man who worked himself
up the company ladder and transformed himself into the Dapper Don,
the one with the expensive suits and agile criminal mind, the big
man around town who instilled fear and respect. He was, of course,
John J. Gotti, the head of the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   The son, on the other hand, was the quiet, shy neighborhood guy
with his plebian tastes, the one who was thrust into the spotlight.
He was John A. Gotti, better known, in an affectionate and
belittling way, as Junior.
</P>
<P>
   They came from wildly different backgrounds, but now, they'll
end up in the same place: behind bars in a federal penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, John Gotti, 35, agreed to plead guilty to six charges
of federal racketeering and false information. So instead of facing
a trial that had been billed as one of the most important, and most
anticipated, mob trials of the last decade, Gotti will now face a
sentence of between five years, 10 months and seven years, 3
months.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been convicted, Gotti would have faced a possible
sentence of 20 years. So, on one level, the deal seems to make
sense, because it means he will still be a young man when he
completes his sentence and returns to his wife and four children in
Oyster Bay on Long Island _ unlike his father, who is serving a
life term.
</P>
<P>
   But on another level, the deal almost seems bitterly apropos for
a man who never seemed very comfortable, or proficient, stepping
into the very large shoes of his legendary father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to be Henry Ford; it's another to be Edsel
Ford,'' said Aaron Rosenthal, a retired New York City assistant
police chief who is now an adjunct professor at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice. ``In no way, shape or form, from the day he was
allegedly made the boss, did I expect him to have a long run. He
wasn't in the wars. He didn't come up through the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's father grew up on the tough streets of the East New York
and Brownsville sections of Brooklyn, dropping out of high school
at age 16 and logging nine arrests and several brief jail sentences
for street fighting, public intoxication, stealing cars,
burglaries, bookmaking and gun possession by the time he was 24. He
then scratched his way up, through guile and street smarts, to the
top of the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, by contrast, grew up in the tight-knit, middle-class
neighborhood of Howard Beach, Queens, graduating from the New York
Military Academy, a private boarding school. He never went to
college, but he is an avid reader, friends have said, and he has
amassed a large collection on American Indian history, in part
because he sees parallels between Italian-Americans and American
Indians, believing that both groups have been oppressed by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   As a young businessman, his lawyers say, he organized legitimate
trucking and truck-leasing companies and a real estate firm. But
eventually, he, too, fell into the organized-crime world, law
enforcement officials have charged.
</P>
<P>
   And after his father was convicted of murder and racketeering
charges in 1992, the younger Gotti was later anointed acting don _
a role that reportedly made his mother very unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that he lapped up, according to law enforcement
officials. But he never quite fit the bill, in appearance or in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti is a stocky man, 5 feet 9 inches tall, who keeps fit by
lifting weights. And until recently, he was the sartorial opposite
of his father, preferring jogging suits or jeans, a Windbreaker and
a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti proved to be a mediocre businessman, investigators said,
frittering away his father's legal and illegal businesses, which
included loan-sharking and gambling interests.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Gotti seemed eager to portray himself not as
the swaggering, swashbuckling celebrity that his father had
created, but rather as a suburban joe with a minivan who showed up
to parent-teacher meetings and delivered cookies and cupcakes to
school parties. He began to spend more evenings with his family in
his 14-room, $700,000 home than with the reputed mobsters that he
had previously surrounded himself with at bars and dance clubs.
</P>
<P>
   And there were questions about whether he possessed the
requisite toughness of a traditional wiseguy. After his indictment
in January 1998 on federal racketeering charges, it was widely
reported that he was tantalizingly close to several plea deals with
prosecutors, only to pull back at the last moment at the behest of
his defiant parents.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Gotti decided to cut the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you grow up in the system, and you've been brainwashed,
you become like a rock in the Ganges: You've been washed over, and
you take the shape,'' Rosenthal said. ``But when that life doesn't
seem so charming anymore, you're going to have a whole lot of
thoughts, and one of them might be, `This might not be worth it.'''

COMMENTARY: MORE STICKS AND FATTER CARROTS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS grafs 5-6, It is too early ..., to recast. ) 
 (HLW)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question we are wrestling with in Kosovo today is this: How
should America react when bad things happen in unimportant places?
</P>
<P>
   You need only watch the footage of refugees streaming out of
Kosovo, and believe just half of their chilling tales of Serbian
atrocities, to know that something really bad is happening there to
which America should not be turning a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
   But you need only ask your congressman to find Kosovo on a map _
and watch the blank stare that comes back at you _ to appreciate
how unimportant Kosovo is to any vital American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this dilemma, the Clinton strategy has been to use
NATO air power to try to reverse the bad things happening in
Kosovo. But the administration's unwillingness to commit ground
troops to actually expel the Serbs from Kosovo is an admission that
its liberation is not worth the loss of many, if any, U.S. lives.
To put it another way, the cruise missile is the Clinton team's
weapon of choice for combating evil in unimportant places.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say this strategy will not achieve an
acceptable outcome in Kosovo, and that troops will have to be sent
in. What one can say now, though, is that for this strategy to work
will require much tougher sticks and much fatter carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the sticks, I wouldn't underestimate the impact on a
modern European state of sustained NATO air bombardments, which
should be intensified once the weather clears. People tend to
change their minds and adjust their goals as they see the price
they are paying mount. Twelve days of surgical bombing was never
going to turn Serbia around. Let's see what 12 weeks of less than
surgical bombing does. Give war a chance.
</P>
<P>
   As for the carrots, while NATO steps up the air war, it also
needs to step up its diplomacy. Remember, you can bomb, curse,
condemn and kill the Serbs, but there is just one thing you can't
do, and that's make peace in the Balkans without them. There are
too many of them. Let's dangle two options before the Serbs right
now _ either a modified Rambouillet deal that would give the
Kosovars internationally protected autonomy in a Kosovo still under
Serb sovereignty, or a partition of Kosovo. The Serbs would get the
northwest sliver, which contains their Orthodox monasteries and
holy sites, and the Kosovo Albanians would get the remaining 90
percent, with an international peacekeeping force separating them.
</P>
<P>
   NATO needs to combine unreasonable bombing with a reasonable
peace offer. For now, this strategy is preferable to a ground war,
for two reasons. First, once NATO invades Kosovo, it owns Kosovo.
Anyone who cares about the future of NATO does not want to see the
alliance managing the daily relations between Serbs and Albanians
in Kosovo. It would be an endless, debilitating task.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if we have to fight a ground war, let's at least fight
it in optimal political circumstances. As Michael Mandelbaum, a
foreign policy expert at Johns Hopkins, points out: ``George Bush's
great achievement in the gulf war was the broad backing he earned
from the American public and the allies, and the basic neutrality
he earned from the Russians, by making it clear that he had gone
the extra mile to get an acceptable diplomatic deal before
launching the ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   All the foreign policy experts say that now that the war in
Kosovo has started, ``We have to win.'' OK, but win what? When you
are trying to stop bad things in unimportant places your task is to
minimize the bad without making the unimportant into a sucking
chest wound that weakens NATO and diminishes America's overall
position in the world. I don't want NATO to win Kosovo or the
Kosovars. I want NATO to stop what was bad and get out. I want NATO
to win Serbian agreement either for the Kosovo Albanians to return
to their homes _ with an international observer-peacekeeping force,
including Russians, managing relations between Albanians and Serbs
_ or for a partition of Kosovo, with a peacekeeping force
separating the factions.
</P>
<P>
   We need to see if sustained, unreasonable bombing, combined with
sustained, reasonable diplomacy, can achieve such goals. Sure, it
will take time, but considering the years NATO will have to spend
in Kosovo if this strategy doesn't work, I suggest we find the
time.

TALK ABOUT A ONE-WOMAN SHOW! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev., Idaho, N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEATH VALLEY JUNCTION, Calif. _ This town, a cluster of
buildings at a crossroads, can be seen from miles away, where the
highway bends and swoops down to a slightly lower elevation.
Lonely-seeming on the vast desert floor, with the mountains
towering and dim in the distance, this is a place where a tree
could fall and no one would hear it, if there were a tree. The
temperature climbs to near 120 degrees in the summer, and the wind
actually whistles when it blows, which is nearly all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The population is 10. The nearest restaurant is seven miles
north, at the casino on the Nevada border. The nearest gas station
is 16 miles beyond that. There's no post office or general store.
But amazingly there is a working theater. It has been here for 31
years, since a former Broadway dancer and aspiring painter named
Marta Becket was stranded nearby with a flat tire and somehow
envisioned her future in an abandoned and dilapidated social hall.
</P>
<P>
   The 120-seat theater is now known, somewhat grandiosely, as the
Amargosa Opera House, and though the stucco building is modest on
the outside, inside it has become a remarkable shrine, built by a
singularly determined woman to herself. On its small stage, Ms.
Becket, who is 74, continues to create the dance and mime shows she
has been putting on, alone or with a partner, for three decades.
She creates two new shows a year and puts on some 50 performances
between October and May. She makes her own costumes, designs the
scenery, chooses the music (she's particularly fond of Johann
Strauss), writes the narration and occasionally composes songs.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the theater are alive with elaborate murals, a
complex and skillfully rendered series of panels depicting the
audience at a 16th-century Spanish opera house performance, a
complete caste system from royalty to rabble. Ms. Becket created
the murals over four years in the early 1970s, when few people were
coming to watch her dance, and she was only renting the building.
Without a real audience, Ms. Becket explained, ``I said, `I will
paint an audience on the walls, an audience of the past.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though she still operates on a shoestring and worries about
expenses, things are hardly so desperate now. Her performance work
_ which mixes movement, narration, classical music and the
presumptuous spirit of a diva _ is idiosyncratic and earnest. But
like the plays staged by the teen-age hero of the film
``Rushmore,'' it is compelling in its serious effort.
</P>
<P>
   And the opera house continues to draw audiences from the
tourists at the Furnace Creek Inn, on the floor of Death Valley,
some 30 miles away; from the city of Pahrump, Nev., a 55-mile drive
away, and even from Las Vegas, over 100 miles away by road. One
Monday night a performance of her latest creation, ``The
Dollmaker,'' a fable about a baron who falls in love with a doll,
drew about 80 people, at $10 a head, including many who were
cheering Ms. Becket for the umpteenth time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our sixth visit,'' said Pamela Krajnik, who with her
husband, Gary, was taking their annual vacation from the family
farm in Nampa, Idaho. ``It's just phenomenal that there's something
like this here.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Robinson, who is making a documentary film about Ms.
Becket, said: ``There's something really wonderful about the fact
that she picked the most desolate spot in America to do this. It
says you can have your life on your own terms, but you'll have to
sacrifice. It says the process is the point. And people come away
from there inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   There is indisputably a whiff of eccentricity about Ms. Becket's
enterprise. And if one might expect the woman herself _ dark
haired, trim, with the visible sinews of a dancer _ to carry an
eccentric air, she doesn't, though there is a faint haughtiness of
the artiste about her. Ms. Becket is self-aware, perfectly willing
to admit that her shows and her painting have been her obsessions.
In explanation of what amounts to her self-imposed exile, she said,
``I couldn't have created another world anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I eccentric?'' she asked. ``Is it eccentric to love your
work so much that you would go anywhere in the world to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Like theater people everywhere, Ms. Becket knows a good story,
and she's savvy enough to understand that her best story is her
own. It is recounted at length in a glossy pamphlet for sale at the
opera house, and in abbreviated form it is told aloud at the start
of each production. And she doesn't mind telling it herself. In any
version the sense that her destiny lay in Death Valley is resonant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Becket was born in Greenwich Village and grew up largely in
New York City. A child dancer, she quit high school during World
War II and began performing in nightclubs. Eventually she won jobs
at Radio City Music Hall and in Broadway shows like the 1946
revival of ``Show Boat'' and ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' a
musical starring Shirley Booth. But for two decades she led the
itinerant life of a dancer, auditioning, going on the road, living
with uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   She found work as an illustrator and even had art dealers
express interest in her paintings, but on the two occasions she was
to have had gallery shows, fate intervened. She said the first was
Nov. 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated, and the
second was Nov. 10, 1965, the day after New York City lost
electrical power and blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile she was developing a repertory of solo dance-mimes, as
she called them, and by the mid-'60s she was touring, performing in
community centers and on college campuses, gigs booked by her
manager and husband, Tom Williams. It was during a break on such a
tour that they camped in Death Valley and awoke one morning to find
their trailer had a flat. To repair the tire, they had to nurse the
three-wheeled trailer the 30 miles to Death Valley Junction, where
there was then a filling station.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband repaired the tire, Ms. Becket explored the
village, most of which had been built by Pacific Coast Borax Co.
between 1923 and 1925 to serve as company offices, employee
dormitories, a dining room and a hotel. The company sold the town
in the late '40s. What Ms. Becket saw the day she arrived was more
or less what the company built and what still exists today: a
Mexican-style collection of adobe houses dominated by a low-slung,
three-sided structure surrounding a courtyard, with a long
colonnade at its center. At the end of one wing was an abandoned
two-story building once used as a social hall but that Ms. Becket
immediately envisioned as something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a theater! I couldn't believe it,'' she wrote in her
biographical pamphlet. ``It seemed to be the only unused building
in Death Valley Junction.'' Peering through a hole in the door at
the rubble inside, she wrote, ``I had the distinct feeling that I
was looking at the other half of myself. The building seemed to be
saying, `Take me, do something with me, I offer you life.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And so she did, and so it did. She and her husband rented the
place and left New York for good, refurbished it, renamed it the
Amargosa Opera House _ amargosa, Spanish for bitter, was the name
of the town before 1907, when Borax Co. arrived _ and created a new
life there. She hasn't been back to New York since 1970, when her
father died.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York it was like door after door was closing in my
face,'' she said. ``When I came here, there was no door to close.
All along I knew all I needed was a space, a place where I could
say, `If people come, good, but if they don't, I'm going to do my
work anyway.' The first three years I danced whether anyone was
here or not. The effort is the joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then she has formed a nonprofit corporation that owns the
opera house, the hotel (Ms. Becket's trompe l'oeil paintings adorn
the lobby walls and 14 guest rooms) and the buildings around them.
The former gas station is now leased by a mining company; gold
speculation is persistent around here.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage eventually failed. Ms. Becket now shares much of
her time, if not a romance, with Thomas Willett, 71, a former
mailman and factory worker who arrived at the Amargosa as a
maintenance man in 1983, shortly before Ms. Becket's husband left
town. When he did, Ms. Becket asked Willett to step in as stage
manager, ticket taker, MC and general amanuensis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought him a nice velvet suit and sent him up there,'' Ms.
Becket said. ``Jan. 14, 1983, was our first performance together,
and he was scared stiff.'' But Willett got over his stage fright.
With his lumbering gait, wry manner, growly voice, thick features
that are reminiscent of the actor James Gammon and a willingness to
parade around on stage in peculiar robes and funny hats, he soon
ended up in a variety of supporting roles in Ms. Becket's shows.
He's found it suits him; he now performs under a stage name:
Willget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Dawson City in the northern Yukon, and I was
recognized,'' Willett said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Becket lives with 10 cats in a large house near the theater
with a dance studio downstairs and a painting studio upstairs and
enough property for horses, chickens and peacocks to run free and
still come around to be fed. She said she'd like to see the town,
which has buildings on only five of its 268 acres, be officially
designated a refuge for wild horses.
</P>
<P>
   She's not a hermit; she has five employees, and she knows some
dancers in Las Vegas who have come to see her shows. Still, she has
more or less renounced the company of other artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known other artists who are obsessed as I am, that
would be interesting to me,'' she said. ``But I've never met any.
I'd dance on one leg if the other didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Her health is good; business is good enough. Still, she thinks
cautiously about the future. She said she'd like the Amargosa
complex, after she's gone, to become a retirement community for
dancers. ``But so many dancers would rather live where the lights
are,'' she said.

NO. 1 AND ONE THAT GOT AWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the final day of last year's Masters, David Duval appeared on
the verge of victory.
</P>
<P>
   He reached the 16th tee holding a three-stroke lead. Even after
making a bogey at No. 16, Duval made pars at both No. 17 and No. 18
to stay in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   After he left the 18th green, Duval and several close friends
were whisked into a private cabin to watch Mark O'Meara and Fred
Couples finish. At worst, Duval figured his final-round 67 had
secured a playoff spot. But the next few minutes became the most
disappointing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   With birdies at No. 15 and No. 17, O'Meara tied Duval. And as
O'Meara stood over his 20-foot birdie attempt at No. 18, Duval sat
helplessly on a couch, watching on television as the Masters title
slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, David, nobody makes that putt,'' Duval recalled
hearing from Jack Stephens, former chairman at Augusta National,
before O'Meara struck the ball.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara sank the putt. Duval's heart sank.
</P>
<P>
   After congratulating Duval for his fine play, Stephens left to
find O'Meara, the new Masters champion. Duval was left trying to
grasp what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock, but in a way, it wasn't a surprise, not with
Mark putting,'' Duval recalled. ``How could I be bitter? I shot
five under par Sunday at the Masters. That's nothing to scoff at.
And I proved to myself that I could handle that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Duval is ranked No. 1 in the world and playing
better than anyone. On Sunday, he won his fourth event of the year
and his second straight start _ the BellSouth Classic _ and has
already won more than $2.5 million to break the earnings record he
set last year.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Masters begins Thursday, Duval, in his quest to win
his first major championship, will try to right what went wrong for
him last year. The lack of a major is the one glaring hole in the
resume of the 27-year-old Duval, and he intends to correct that
sooner, not later.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters ends a three-week stretch that has special
significance for Duval: The Players Championship was held a few
miles from where he grew up; the BellSouth was his first
professional tournament and played in front of many friends from
his Georgia Tech days, and the Masters is the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view it as intimidating,'' he said Sunday about trying
to win three weeks in a row. ``I think it is helpful to win the
week before you go somewhere. It makes you realize that what you
are doing is right, and I know I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure at the Masters is different. No one has ever
won the Players Championship and at Augusta in the same year. And
other players are just as motivated as he. O'Meara is the defending
champion, Tiger Woods is the 1997 winner who has been supplanted by
Duval as the world's top player, and Couples is the 1992 Masters
champion who tied Duval for second last year, just a stroke from a
playoff. Throw in the mix a long list of contenders who have won
majors but never the Masters: Davis Love III, Ernie Els and Justin
Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   But after his impressive string of victories, Duval is the
favorite. And his one-stroke loss last year only bolstered the
confidence of a player who doesn't need more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be surprised if 10 years from now, I still haven't won
the Masters?'' asked Duval, repeating a question. ``Yeah, I might
be. I feel I have the game for that golf course. I would anticipate
that before I'm done, I'll get one.''
</P>
<P>
   After last year's ending, Duval hardly needs motivation. While
O'Meara was basking in victory, Duval left Augusta National Golf
Club and returned to the house he had rented for the week. He was
greeted by friends and well-wishers, all of them trying to cheer
him up. But before long, Duval couldn't take any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to console me,'' Duval announced to the crowd. ``I
appreciate it. But there simply is no consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a few days for Duval to recover. But since then, he has
returned to doing what he does best: playing world-class golf. He
has won 11 times during the past 18 months, one of the most
impressive streaks of this decade. In two years, he has made a
meteoric rise from being a player knocked for not winning to being
a player who people expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Duval has put together a great year in a little more
than three months. In addition to winning the Players Championship
and the BellSouth Classic, he won the Mercedes Championships and
the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. He became only the third player in
PGA Tour history to shoot a 59, which happened during the final
round of the Hope. And he won the Players Championship on the same
day that his father, Bob Duval, won the Senior Tour Emerald Coast
Classic, making them the first father and son to win tour events on
the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's talent is obvious, but his hunger and his ability to
focus separate him from the crowd. His game face has become
familiar: a stoic demeanor behind Oakley sunglasses, a player who
makes plenty of birdies while showing little emotion. Opponents who
are paired with Duval marvel at his concentration, watching him hit
quality shot after quality shot, almost expecting batteries to fall
out of his back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, those close to Duval describe the native of Jacksonville
Beach, Fla., as a person unchanged by success. He has the same
circle of friends, a down-to-earth nature and a giving heart.
During the Christmas holidays last year, Duval saw on television
that a local toy drive for children was running short on cash.
Duval called the phone number for donations, and told the person on
the other end that if someone came to his house the next morning,
he would write a check to cover everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's David,'' said Puggy Blackmon, who coached Duval at
Georgia Tech. ``I'd be shocked if success ever changed him. That's
what I'm most proud of, not only his success, but how he has
handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few players seem more equipped than Duval to handle Augusta,
where the keys to victory are putting coupled with accurate
approach shots into Augusta's lightning-quick, undulating greens.
And Duval feels much more comfortable at Augusta than he did in
1997, when he missed the cut, making a 9 on the par-5 No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was complete inexperience,'' Duval said. ``I had laid up
left, a pretty good place to lay up, with the cup on the front left
side. But I dumped the next one into the water. Then I watched Nick
Price play the hole, and he played it way right of the pin. That's
Augusta. There's a lot of local knowledge you need to have, and
I've picked up a tremendous amount.''
</P>
<P>
   With his great power off the tee, Duval has the advantage of
hitting shorter irons into greens than most players. His pinpoint
precision with short irons and wedges leaves him with many birdie
opportunities. His solid putting stroke holds up under pressure.
And his intelligence and course management help him avoid the
double-bogeys and triple-bogeys that ruin rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Duval has as complete a package as anyone in the
game, and the final piece was learning how to win on the tour.
Duval finished second seven times before his first victory at the
1997 Michelob Championship at Kingsmill in Williamsburg, Va. During
his string of runner-up finishes, people questioned his confidence
under pressure. Those close to him knew better.
</P>
<P>
   ``David never doubted himself, and now that he's winning, he's
enjoying it,'' said Julie McArthur, his longtime girlfriend.
``People are seeing that he's a wonderful player. He is letting his
play speak for him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name Duval's biggest strength, Blackmon did not
hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No weaknesses,'' said Blackmon, now the men's golf coach at
the University of South Carolina. ``For a young guy who has been
successful, David didn't have instant success. He had some hard
knocks along the way, and it seems like he was always overshadowed
by somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, it was Phil Mickelson. Then David had to spend a
year on the Nike Tour. Then after a great rookie year on the PGA
Tour, Woody Austin won rookie of the year instead of David. Then
came all the questions about why he wasn't winning. Even last year,
Mark O'Meara won player of the year. And of course, there's Tiger
Woods. But when Tiger came along, I figured it would be the
greatest thing for David. I know David is really impressed by the
way Tiger is always, always in contention. And now, those two guys
can really stoke each other's fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Duval has made sure to take time for himself, despite the
growing demands on him. He took three weeks off before the Players
Championship to prepare himself for the three-week stretch, which
ends with the Masters. He didn't practice Monday, and he may only
play one practice round before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fine line I have to walk now,'' he said Monday, ``to
make sure I get prepared then also make sure I am rested.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Mercedes, he went on a snowboarding and skiing
vacation with McArthur.
</P>
<P>
   ``David never brings golf home with him, and his life has
balance,'' McArthur said. ``I could be wrong, but I don't see David
playing on the Senior Tour. He has a lot of things he wants to
accomplish, but once he is done, I could see him opening up a
coffee shop, enjoying life. Money hasn't changed him. Don't get me
wrong, he enjoys the fact that money allows him to do certain
things. But he plays golf because he loves the game, and the
competition, and he loves to win.''
</P>
<P>
   So this week, Duval will focus his intensity on the Masters, the
one that got away last year. For the past 18 months, Duval has been
the best player in the world. But will he be the best player this
week?
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get one shot a year to do it,'' Duval said. ``Who
knows what will happen. But I intend to be ready.''

MLICKI REMAINS ON TRADING BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Mlicki didn't think he'd make it to opening
day in a Dodgers uniform. He did, but now there's questions of
whether the right-hander will make it to the Dodgers' second
homestand later this month.
</P>
<P>
   When right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna comes off the disabled
list, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he wants to keep two
lefties in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like two lefties. I love two lefties,'' Johnson said before
the season-opening 8-6 win against Arizona. ``In my scheme of
thought, I'd go with two lefties.''
</P>
<P>
   It will most likely mean one of the starters being traded.
Mlicki, pushed into the bullpen because of the Dodgers' overflow in
starting pitching, remains the overwhelmingly candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things are pointing toward Mlicki,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, on the mend from elbow surgery last fall, is eligible to
come off the disabled list Friday. But Malone said Osuna is 10 days
to two weeks away from returning. The plan is to have Osuna make a
few rehab appearances with Single-A San Bernardino before returning
to the Dodgers. Meanwhile, Mlicki is forced to sit, wait and try to
adapt to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought something would have happened by now, if not with
the pitching maybe with (utility infielder Jose) Vizcaino,'' Mlicki
said. ``I didn't think I'd still be here, but I'm glad I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question is, how long? Johnson said the status of lefty
relievers Onan Masaoka, a 21-year-old rookie, and Pedro Borbon
wouldn't be affected by Osuna's return. Malone echoed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see (sending down Masaoka or Borbon) as probable,''
Malone said. ``Davey likes to have two lefties in the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen bullies: Johnson's top priority during spring training
was to get the bullpen set. Against the Diamondbacks, the quartet
of Mel Rojas, Masaoka, Alan Mills and Jeff Shaw pitched five
hitless innings of relief. It allowed the Dodgers to rally from a
6-2 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep it like that, we can win a lot of games,'' said Rojas,
who struck out two in his inning of work. ``I needed a 1-2-3
inning. Come tomorrow I'll be more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on the bullpen was the run Borbon yielded in
relief of starter Kevin Brown, but that was a sidelight. It was
Borbon's first appearance in the majors since Aug. 22, 1996, when
he suffered a career-threatening elbow injury. ``The results
weren't that good, but it feels awesome to be out there again,''
said Borbon, who gave up two hits in one-third of an inning. ``It's
hard enough to pitch there when you're healthy. Imagine going
through the hell I had to go through to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hundley watch: This could be the last unofficial installment
of the ``Hundley Watch.'' He caught all 11 innings but spoke with
Johnson afterward and said he would catch again today. Hundley said
his legs were tired after the nearly four-hour game, but his
surgically repaired elbow was dandy.
</P>
<P>
   His three at-bats against the Big Unit were a different story.
Hundley (1 for 5, 4 strikeouts) whiffed in his three plate
appearances against hard-throwing lefty Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my Lord. He was nasty,'' Hundley said after his first
experience with Johnson. ``I had a hard time seeing the ball out of
the crowd. You can't hit what you can't see. You could hit me in
the head and I wouldn't see it. I just listened for the glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Eric Young and Raul Mondesi were the only Dodgers
in the starting lineup Monday who started for the 1998 season
opener. . . . The sellout crowd of 53,109 was 648 shy of the club's
opening-day record. . . . Dodgers hitters struck out 16 times.

WHEEL MAKER EXPANDS IN EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Superior Industries International Inc., a leading
American wheel maker, has made further inroads into the European
market by winning a contract from the Rover Group Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Suoftec, Superior's European joint venture company in
partnership with Otto Fuchs of Germany, will supply cast aluminum
wheels for some of Rover's sport-utility vehicles and passenger
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed, but the deal announced Monday is a
multiyear contract. It is also Los Angeles-based Superior's first
contract with Rover Group and marks the initial production run of
cast wheels from the company's manufacturing plant in Tatabanya,
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to get cast wheels for the Hungary plant for
a while, so this is a real important addition from that point of
view,'' said R. Jeffrey Ornstein, Superior's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, which opened in late 1997, employs 550 people and
also supplies about 700,000 forged wheels a year to Audi. It can
make about 2.5 million wheels annually, and the new deal with
Longbridge, England-based Rover will boost production to about 50
percent of capacity, Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Cast aluminum wheels are lightweight and offer manufacturers
more design options than are available in the forging process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aluminum is the material of the future in the automotive
industry ... and Superior will continue to be a major
beneficiary,'' Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments to Rover are expected to begin this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Superior also makes aluminum wheels and other aluminum
components for major domestic and foreign manufacturers. It also
manufacturers accessory products for the national automotive
aftermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The company is coming off a strong fourth quarter when profits
and sales hit record levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the December fourth quarter Superior earned $19.55 million,
equal to 71 cents a share, an increase of 25 percent from the prior
year's period, on sales of $152.7 million. In the 1997 fourth
quarter, Superior earned $15.65 million, or 56 cents a share, on
sales of $150.9 million, which beat analysts' expectations by
almost 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, Superior earned $52.32 million, or $1.88 per
share, compared with income of $55.39 million, or $1.96, in 1997.
Sales in 1998 totaled $539.4 million vs. $549.1 million the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Superior stock closed up 6.25 cents Monday at $23.6975.

DRIFTER GETS 4 TO 12 YEARS IN HIV CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nushawn J. Williams, a young drifter who ignited a national
debate on whether spreading the AIDS virus could be a criminal act,
was sentenced Monday to four to 12 years in prison after several of
his alleged victims refused to cooperate with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   When it first came to light in October 1997, Williams' case
seemed to crystallize many of society's worst fears about the AIDS
epidemic, bringing to light a subculture of aimless young people
who traded sex partners as casually as they would clothes.
Authorities in Chautauqua County, in the far western corner of New
York state, called Williams a sexual predator who sometimes traded
crack cocaine for sex, knowing that he had HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   They said that in the year he lived in Jamestown, a faded
industrial city south of Buffalo, he had sex with at least 48 young
women and girls in the area, infecting 13 of them with HIV. The
frenzy over his case mounted when health officials who interviewed
Williams, a native of Brooklyn who has also lived in the Bronx,
told them he had had 50 to 75 more sex partners in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 22, became the first person in New York, and one of
only a handful in the country, to face charges for giving someone
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sentence was handed down in Chautauqua County Court in
Mayville, N.Y., under a plea agreement with the country district
attorney. Williams pleaded guilty in February to one count of
reckless endangerment for having unprotected sex with a woman whom
he did not warn of his HIV status _ prosecutors did not say whether
she was infected _ and two counts of second-degree rape, for having
sex with a 13-year-old schoolgirl.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the only two victims who were willing to testify,''
said William Coughlin, an assistant district attorney who handled
the sentencing. But he said that the case ``only encompasses the
people the police were aware of,'' and that the discovery of new
victims could yield new charges.
</P>
<P>
   Williams faces sentencing next week in the Bronx on a charge of
reckless endangerment for having unprotected sex with a 15-year-old
girl. Under an agreement between his lawyers and Bronx and
Chautauqua prosecutors, his sentence on that charge will run
concurrently with Monday's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides, I think, gave in a little,'' said William Cember,
Williams' lawyer in the Bronx case.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is already serving one to three years for a conviction
on selling crack cocaine in the Bronx. Cember said the new,
four-to-12-year sentence would begin running retroactive to when
Williams first became eligible for parole on the drug case last
year. That means he will be eligible for release in 2002.

SUSPECT IN SUBWAY KILLING RULED FIT TO STAND TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man with a history of mental illness who is accused
of pushing a woman to her death in front of a subway train was
found fit to stand trial for murder Monday by a Manhattan judge.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Carol Berkman of state Supreme Court rejected pleas from
defense lawyers that Andrew Goldstein, who has a long history of
schizophrenia, be found incompetent and confined only to a secure
mental institution. Citing reports from two psychiatrists who said
Goldstein functioned well when taking his medication, Berkman ruled
that he was fit to stand trial for second-degree murder in the
death of Kendra Webdale, 32, who was pushed in front of an N train
in the 23rd Street station in Manhattan on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard of fitness is not a particularly high one,''
Berkman said in her ruling. ``While Goldstein is impaired, he is
not so impaired that he cannot assist in his own defense or undergo
the stresses of a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   If Goldstein is found guilty of second-degree murder, he will
face 25 years to life in jail, but if the jury finds that he was
not responsible for his actions because of mental illness, he will
likely be confined to a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, is expected to focus his
defense on the state and the city's systems for caring for the
mentally ill. He pointed out at Monday's hearing that Goldstein was
hospitalized for schizophrenia six times last year, frequently at
his own request, and was released from a hospital just a little
over two weeks before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Dankner, a lawyer representing Ms. Webdale's family,
announced Monday that they would file a $20 million medical
malpractice lawsuit against the city hospital system, for allowing
Goldstein's release after treatment last year. The suit will also
name the city's subway system, Dankner said. He added that
additional lawsuits will be filed against any private hospitals
that are found to have recently treated and released Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in the criminal trial, William Greenbaum, is
expected to argue that Goldstein was not taking the medication that
suppresses his schizophrenia at the time of the attack, and was
responsible for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   On videotape and in written statements, Goldstein confessed to
pushing Ms. Webdale to her death. Goldstein told police that a
psychotic episode caused him to believe that a ``spirit or ghost''
entered his body and forced him to push Ms. Webdale, in a chilling
assault that rekindled the fears of many subway riders of random
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webdale's sister, Kim, attended Monday's hearing and said
she was ``very pleased'' with Berkman's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should never have released this man,'' Dankner said. ``He
never should have been walking free on the streets of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Dankner said that he was still trying to determine all the
hospitals where Goldstein was treated for mental illness. Fishbein,
Goldstein's lawyer, said he would not discuss Goldstein's private
medical history.
</P>
<P>
   Dankner said that Goldstein was treated twice last year at
Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan and once at Elmhurst Hospital in
Queens _ both run by the city _ and that a private hospital, North
General in Manhattan, treated him for 22 days last winter and
released him on Dec. 15, two weeks and two days before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Bade Goodman, a spokeswoman for the corporation counsel's
office, declined to comment Monday. Cheryl Anderson, a spokeswoman
for North General, said she had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a hint of how the trial could broaden to the larger issue of
treatment of the mentally ill, Berkman suggested Monday that she
was constricted by the current legal standards for the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that someday, probably after we are all gone,
people will look back at our treatment of mental illness under the
law and be shocked and appalled,'' she said. ``But that is really
not the issue I have before me today.''

PITCHING MATCHUP FAILS TO MEASURE UP

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson each faced 29
batters in Monday's season opener at Dodger Stadium.Together they
surrendered seven earned runs and four homers among 15 hits. They
walked eight. And each hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning this highly anticipated matchup of free-agent saviors
didn't do much to disprove that the game is all about offense.
</P>
<P>
   The two sizzlers fizzled out into no-decision purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was around by the 11th when the Dodgers finished off an
8-6 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, but that was mostly
because of their own undoing innings earlier. Which gave the writer
from Sports Illustrated here to do a story on the marquee duel for
this week's magazine his angle after the sixth inning: just another
overhyped Hollywood flop.
</P>
<P>
   At least, from a pitchers' standpoint. Raul Mondesi wouldn't
think so.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, only Johnson could have limped off with any form of
dignity. He experienced some tightness in a sore groin muscle but
worked around that and six walks to leave his team ahead 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't much for Johnson to be satisfied about after
five Diamondbacks relievers gave up six runs and nine hits in the
last four innings. At least he didn't leave to boos as Brown did
after giving up Jay Bell's three- run homer with two outs in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be sharper to be successful,'' Johnson admitted. ``I
stayed calm and focused. It was an emotional game, but I thought I
had it under control considering I hadn't pitched to almost anyone
in that lineup before except (Devon) White (who homered off him in
the fourth).
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the run support, but walks are always going to be my
biggest drawback.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had reached 125 pitches through the seventh, which
started with him running off the mound after two pitches to Todd
Hundley because a wrap on his inner thigh had unrolled on him.
Johnson took it off, struck out Hundley and got out of a
men-on-first-and-third situation by fanning Mark Grudzielanek. But
Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter hit for Johnson in the top of
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went seven; that's all I was asked to do,'' said Johnson,
who last pitched on the Dodger Stadium mound when he was a junior
at USC, against the Dodgers in an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did send a message to everyone that maybe this team
suffered some bumps and bruises last year, but we're not backing
down to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans weren't backing down to Brown, either. But boos on
opening day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have booed myself, too,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing is, I've had bad games before and as much as I
hate to admit it, the odds are that I'll have 'em again. Even the
next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have pitched better, but it's a heck of a lot
easier to take pitching bad when we win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised (by the boos),'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson, ``but he'll change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Eric Karros rather sarcastically: ``I'm really happy to
see Randy Johnson twice in my first 10 games, but I could be
Arizona having to face Brown twice.''

EARLY WYNN, PITCHER WHO WON 300 GAMES, DIES AT 79
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early Wynn, the Hall of Fame right-hander who won 300 games over
23 seasons, dominating American League batters with a legendary
meanness to match his talent, died Sunday night at an
assisted-living center in Venice, Fla. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a stroke, Wynn's business
manager, Dave Baudouin, said.
</P>
<P>
   When he made his debut in the major leagues with the Washington
Senators in 1939, Wynn, a fastball pitcher from the Alabama cotton
fields, was ordered by Manager Bucky Harris to knock down every
batter he got two strikes on or face a $25 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter if the hitter was DiMaggio or Ted Williams,''
Wynn would recall. ``I was making $350 a month. I couldn't afford
giving up $25.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, Wynn was still knocking batters down, but he
had added a curveball, slider and knuckleball, prompting Williams
to call him ``the toughest pitcher I ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn was a 20-game winner five times and an All-Star every
season from 1955 through 1960. After eight years with the lowly
Washington Senators, he teamed up with Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and
Mike Garcia to give the Cleveland Indians one of baseball's
greatest pitching rotations. In pitching the 1959 Chicago White Sox
to the franchise's first pennant in 40 years, he went 22-10 and won
the Cy Young award as the American League's top pitcher at age 39.
When he retired after the 1963 season, he had pitched longer than
anyone else in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot, 200-pounder with a broad chest and thick legs, Wynn
delivered all of his pitches with the same seemingly effortless
motion in compiling a lifetime record of 300-244 with a 3.54 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn never hesitated to whistle a pitch past a hitter's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``That space between the white lines _ that's my office, that's
where I conduct my business,'' he said of home plate. ``You take a
look at the batter's box, and part of it belongs to the hitter. But
when he crowds in just that hair, he's stepping into my office, and
nobody comes into my office without an invitation when I'm going to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Hartford, Ala., Wynn showed up at a Senators tryout
camp as a 17-year-old high school junior, determined to escape a
life picking cotton and peanuts. He was signed for $100 a month,
began pitching in the Florida State League and never did finish
high school.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Senators after three years in the minors and
became one of their top starting pitchers, relying on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   His career began to flourish in 1949 after he was traded to the
Indians and was taught to throw breaking balls by their pitching
coach, Mel Harder, a star right-hander of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn led the American League in ERA in 1950 with a mark of 3.20.
He tied Lemon for the league lead in victories in 1954, with 23, as
Cleveland beat out the Yankees for the pennant by winning a
league-record 111 games. But he was the loser in Game 2 of the
World Series as the Indians were swept by the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Although he led the league in strikeouts in 1957, Wynn was
traded to the White Sox after the season. He topped the league in
strikeouts again in 1958. After pitching Chicago to a pennant in
1959, he won Game 1 of the World Series against the Los Angeles
Dodgers, but was hit hard in two other Series starts.
</P>
<P>
   Although long plagued by gout, Wynn kept pitching, and he got
victory No. 299 on Sept. 8, 1962. But in his final three starts
that season, he was unable to become the 14th pitcher in major
league history to reach the 300 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn was released by the White Sox after going 7-15, then was
signed by the Indians for a second stint on May 31, 1963. He
reached the 300-victory milestone on July 13 when he left after
five innings with a 5-4 lead against the Kansas City Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never slept the night before; the gout was killing me,''
Wynn said afterward. He expressed gratitude to his manager, Birdie
Tebbetts, for lifting him for a pinch-hitter because ``I might have
fallen on my face. I was exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn retired after that season and became the Indians' pitching
coach, succeeding Harder, his former mentor.
</P>
<P>
   He later served as a coach for the Minnesota Twins and a
broadcaster for the Toronto Blue Jays and White Sox. He also
campaigned to secure enhanced pension benefits for old-time
players.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Sherry Van Tilburg, and a son, Joe
Early, both of Venice; a half-sister, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wynn, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1972, was
remembered as much for his relentlessness as for his 300 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hitter I face is a man trying to take money out of my
pocket,'' he said. ``Every hitter is an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn was incensed whenever a batter drove the ball through the
mound, as first baseman Mickey Vernon, his teammate with the
Senators and Indians, could attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were roommates and good friends,'' Vernon remembered.
``After I was traded back to Washington, I got four hits off of him
the first time I faced him, the last one knocking the glove off his
hand. When I got to first base, he was steaming. He looked over and
said, `Roommate or not, you've got to go in the dirt seat next time
I see you.' Sure enough, the next time I faced him, the first pitch
was up over my head _ to let me know he hadn't forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn was supposedly asked if he would throw at his own mother.
</P>
<P>
   His reply: ``It would depend on how well she was hitting.''
