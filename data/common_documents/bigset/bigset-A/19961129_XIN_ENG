<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro is due here Friday for a three-day visit to Egypt,
during which he will meet with his counterpart Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected hold talks on the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process, a number of issues of
mutual concern and ways to strengthen bilateral relations in all
fields, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has attached great importance to its ties with Italy,
particularly in trade, industry, agriculture, investments,
researches and modern technology, MENA quoted Ussama al-Baz, first
foreign undersecretary and director of President Mubarak's office
for political affairs, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro's visit comes following a series of high-powered
Italian missions to Egypt in the past couple of months by Italian
ministers of defense and foreign affairs and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been Egypt's most important trade partner for
years. Its exports to Egypt stood at 1.96 billion U.S. dollars
last year, while imports stood at 1.79 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its contributions to the technical transfer, staff
training and research development with Egypt, Italy also funded
the Esna Dam, Egypt's second largest of its kind, through a
108-million-dollar soft loan.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia successfully launched a
multi-headed SS-24 (or RS-22) intercontinental ballistic missile
at the Plesetsk testing site today, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
All ten practice payloads of the nuclear delivery missile
successfully hit the training targets in the designated area of
the Kamchatka peninsula, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The missile was launched at 14:10 Moscow time (11:10 GMT) at
the testing complex located in northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth training launch of an intercontinental
ballistic missile in 1996, concluding this year's military
training program of the Russian strategic rocket troops.
</P>
<P>
All previous launches of the intercontinental ballistic
missiles were successful, Interfax said. However, it pointed out,
unlike previous launches, today's missile was launched from a
railroad rocket complex.
</P>
<P>
The last time Russia used the railroad rocket complex for
missile launches was more than six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Igor Sergeyev, Strategic Rocket Troops Commander who observed
today's missile launch, said:"The task of the launch -- to confirm
the maintenance of the tactics and technical characteristics of
intercontinental ballistic missiles for possible extension of
their exploitation -- was fully completed."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, S. Africa Take Steps for New Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and South African
today took steps further toward signing a new trade agreement
after resolving to explore ways of opening trade in such products
as chemicals, footwear and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which started trade talks in 1992 to renew
the 1964 agreement, met in Harare under the Joint Technical
Working Group on other products, set up at a landmark meeting
held at Victoria falls in Zimbabwe in June.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries said
discussions focused on proposals tabled by Zimbabwe for improved
access of its exports to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Zimbabweans pressed South Africans to lower
punitive duties on the products discussed, pointing out that
South Africa is now enjoying huge and preferential market access
to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Out of two-way trade exceeding 700 million U. S. Dollars,
South Africa is enjoying a surplus of more than 60 million U. S.
Dollars which is set to grow unless the current tariff
distortions are rectified.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said comments made at the meeting would be taken
to industry associations in both countries for ratification. The
associations would then exchange detailed information "with a
view to presenting a formal position to the South African
government".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the associations agreed to speed up the
talks before their next meeting, set to be held at the end of
January, which would consider South Africa's response to the
proposals from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also discussing ways of increasing trade
in agricultural products, and have since agreed to reduce tariffs
on Zimbabwean textile and clothing products from 90 percent to
about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Zimbabwe will have to export to South Africa, its
largest trading partner, under an agreed quota system.

<HEADLINE> China, India Contribute to Human Civilization: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, initiated by China and India, have proved to
be a far-reaching contribution to the human beings, said Chinese
President Jiang Zemin today while meeting with his Indian
counterpart Shankar Dayal Sharma.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here today on a four-day state visit after
attending the APEC fora and visiting the Philippines, said more
than 2,000 years of exchanges between the two countries have laid
a sound foundation for the development of good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
"Our two peoples have sympathized with and supported each other
in the struggles against imperialists and colonialists," said
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that India was among the earliest countries to
establish diplomatic relations with China after its founding in
1949.
</P>
<P>
It was China and India that initiated the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence which were pioneered by Chinese Premier Zhou
Enlai and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in April 1954.
</P>
<P>
The five principles are mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and
peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Sharma said the five principles have been
widely applied throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
India and China are large and populous countries with huge
domestic markets, said Sharma. The two countries have great
potentials in trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As two large developing countries, India and China should
strengthen cooperation and continue to coordinate and support each
other, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said: "It is China's set policy to
develop long-term, stable good neighborliness and
mutually-beneficial cooperation with India."
</P>
<P>
"Both countries are now facing the task of developing the
economy and improving the livelihood of our peoples," he said. "We
both need a peaceful and stable surrounding."
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have more common and shared interests
than differences and there is no problem that cannot be solved
concerning bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is willing to work with India to forge a
future-oriented friendship and constructive partnership based on
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president fully agreed with Jiang, hailing as very
important the establishment of a future-oriented friendship and
constructive partnership. He accepted the invitation extended by
the Chinese president to him to visit China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president earlier met with speakers of the Indian
Council of the States and House of the People (upper and lower
houses of the parliament).

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebel Leaders Launch Presidential Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Two months ahead of the
presidential polls in Chechnya, separatist leaders have begun
election campaigns in the breakaway republic in Russia's North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Ruslan Kutayev, co-chairman of the Coordinating Council of
Chechen Political Parties and Public Movements, said today that
the council would discuss preparations for the elections at its
next session within days.
</P>
<P>
The elections are scheduled for January 27.
</P>
<P>
At the session, representatives of about a dozen Chechen
political parties and public movements were expected to consider
possible candidates for the Chechen presidency, Kutayev said.
</P>
<P>
The election campaign began earlier this week, as Chechen
separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and his army commander,
Shamil Basayev, mounted presidential bids, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
Basayev, who led the hostage-taking raid on the Russian town of
Budyonnovsk in June 1995, told local television on Tuesday that he
would run for president in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said he would show by deeds that he was capable not only of
fighting but also of building a peaceful life in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old army commander, who is wanted in Moscow for
"acts of terrorism," said that he would campaign on fighting crime
and corruption in Chechnya, and ensuring "just distribution of
national wealth."
</P>
<P>
Basayev, popular among the Chechen militants which he commands
in the broad southern and central parts of Chechnya, became "a
national hero" in the eyes of the Chechen separatists because of
his military feats in the war which broke out in December 1994,
particularly for the Budyonnovsk raid which successfully stalled
the war for several months in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Villagers in the rebel regions have his poster on their walls,
along with that of the separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, who was
killed.
</P>
<P>
Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev has also
declareed his candidacy for the elections, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, who was a former journalist and writer and
replaced the dead Dudayev in April this year, has not got such
strong support as Basayev, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Chechen coalition government, Aslan Maskahdov,
who was chief of staff during the war, is also expected to run for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Maskahdov is thought to enjoy big support because of his
leading the separatists to victory last August in the war, and
forcing the Russian troops to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his peace negotiations with Russia have also won him
support from the pro-Moscow Chechens.
</P>
<P>
Among other possible candidates were Chechen presidential
national security adviser Akhmed Zakayev, Parliament chief Akhyad
Idigov and First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov, Kutayev
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the electoral regulations made by the Chechen parliament
and the Chechen Central Electoral Commission, the presidential
candidates are required to collect 10,000 supporting signatures
and submit them to the electoral commission by the voting day.
</P>
<P>
Kutayev said parliamentary elections would also be held for
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
To pave way for the elections, Moscow has agreed to withdraw
all its remaining troops, numbering 20,000, from Chechnya by the
elections.

the world to develop ourselves."
</P>
<P>
The two peoples can say that they have done their bit to
contribute to the mankind when they have developed and become
prosperous, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Though there are still historical problems yet to be solved
between our two countries," Jiang said, "we have more common and
shared interests than differences."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese visitor suggested both sides trust each other and
conduct mutually-beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Our two nations can no doubt forge a 21st-century-oriented
constructive partnership so long as we abide by the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and treat bilateral relations
in their historical perspective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Sharma said that the cooperation and
friendship between Asia's two largest nations will be a powerful
and enduring factor in promoting peace and stability in this
continent and the world as well.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- OAU Secretary General
Salim Ahmed Salim has embarked on a four-nation official tour
that would take him to France, Senegal, Burkina Faso and Togo, an
OAU press release said here today.
</P>
<P>
In France, Salim will undertake consultations with Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko who is now recuperating from cancer
surgery in Nice. He left here for the visit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to discuss with Mobutu about the refugees
problem in eastern Zaire in which Zaire accused Rwanda of
invading into its territory to back Tutsi rebels. A million
Rwandan Hutu refugees were trapped in fighting between Zairean
troops and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
On November 15, the U.N. Security Council decided to send a
multinational force to help create safe corridors in eastern
Zaire for the refugees to return to Rwanda which said the
dispatch is now irrelevant because most of the refugees have
returned home.
</P>
<P>
Then Salim will proceed to Dakar, Senegal for a three-day
working visit that will enable him to consult with President
Abdou Diouf.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, Salim is also expected in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to attend the 19th summit of France
and French-speaking African countries scheduled to take place
from December 4 to 6.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the participants will discuss a candidate to
replace Boutrous Boutrous-ghali, Secretary General of the United
Nations as the United States has vetoed his reelection of the
U.N. chief for a second term.
</P>
<P>
Later Salim will go to Lome, Togo on an official visit and
consultation with president Gnassingbe Eyadema.

made of all kinds of fibre - silk, cotton, linen and synthetic
fibre, because the raw material originates in China and elswhere.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will also deny the free access that the US
guaranteed to the EU at the end of the Uruguay Round.
</P>
<P>
Since the products are no longer considered of EU origin, they
will be subject to import quotas in the US.
</P>
<P>
"The new US rules may contravene the US commitments under two
WTO agreements: the Agreement of Textiles and Clothing and the
agreement on Rules of Origin," the EC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU's action followed a complaint by Italian silk clothing
producers who fear that 57 million ECU(some 74 million US$) of
their exports will be affected.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Barriers Regulation is the EU's new instrument which
allows individual firms as well as industries and Member States to
ask the EU to act against a specific barrier to trade.

<HEADLINE> African Trade Body Threatens Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A Johannesburg-based
private organization promoting trade within Africa and with other
economic blocs worldwide would close within a week if its
participating countries and organizations do not pay their dues.
</P>
<P>
A source said today that the African International Trade
Center (AITC) gave the warning here.
</P>
<P>
Set up in February 1995, the AITC was acknowledged by the U.N.
Economic Commission for Africa as a focal point for south-south
cooperation. And it was also recognized by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) as a focal point for south-south, south-north
and inter-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Juan Kirsten told a news briefing here that
the AITC has promoted trade worth millions of Rands since its
inception last year, but the main beneficiaries of its efforts
were tardy in paying their dues of 15,000 U.S. Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten said, however, African governments have yet to
''activate their membership'' of the AITC despite the OAU council
of ministers having agreed to acknowledge it as a focal point for
trade development on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He also said procrastination and a lack of sense of African
identity and solidarity made the prospects for an African
economic community bleak.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major reassured the House of Commons Thursday that the government
was not prepared to change its policy on Northern Ireland and that
he would not bargain for a fresh IRA cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question in Parliament today, Major insisted Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, would only join peace talks if the
IRA "gave up violence once and for all".
</P>
<P>
"When Sinn Fein can join the talks depends upon their own
actions. We need to see an unequivocal restoration of the
ceasefire," he told Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that he had published a statement of
the government's position and had sent it to John Hume, leader of
the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP).
</P>
<P>
Hume and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams had earlier made joint
proposals, not made public, for a new IRA ceasefire which Major
rejected on Tuesday.

<P>
LUANDA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The activities made by the
United Nations Children's Fund in Angola this year have been
"fairly positive" and helpful to the peace process in the
country, a spokesman of the fund said here today.
</P>
<P>
The fund's representative based in Angola Christian Voumark
made the remarks when briefing reporters its 1996 work in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. Children's Fund has mainly involved
itself into the quartering and disbandment of soldiers of the
former rebel UNITA movement, especially those under 18, as well
as into polio vaccination and the iodizing of table salt in the
war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The activities, funded by the international community which
has provided nearly 22 million U.S. Dollars in the past year,
have contributed to the progress made in Angola's peace process,
the U.N. official added.
</P>
<P>
He said the realization of peace and national reconciliation
in Angola will ensure the fund would provide better service there
in the future.

<HEADLINE> 8.4 Million Worldwide Infected With AIDS: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 8.4 million
people worldwide are estimated to have been infected with AIDS by
December 1, 1996, according to a United Nations report on AIDS
made public here today.
</P>
<P>
A more useful indicator of trends in the global epidemic,
however, is the number of people of newly-infected with HIV, a
virus causing AIDS, which is 3.1 million for 1996, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
This new HIV infections, most under the age of 25, work out to
around 8,500 cases a day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, children made up 830,000 of the estimated 22.6
million people living with AIDS or HIV infection, and 42 percent
of the rest 21.8 million adults living with HIV or AIDS are
women.
</P>
<P>
Since the AIDS was first identified in the United States in
1981, about 30 million people were thought to have been infected
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Of these, an estimated 5 million adults and 1.4 million
children died from HIV or AIDS-associated illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The UN report said 75 to 85 out of every 100 HIV infections
worldwide were caused by unprotected sexual intercourse, and
heterosexual intercourse accounted for more than 70 percent of
global adult HIV infections to date.
</P>
<P>
While on regional base, the report said sub-Saharan Africa
accounts for the largest slice of people in the world living with
AIDS or the HIV infection, 14 million or 63 percent, of which
more than 50 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
South and Southeast Asia are the second highest, with 5.2
million cases, of which more than 30 percent are women.

<HEADLINE> PA to Boycott Multi-lateral Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) --- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
has decided to boycott most multi-lateral peace talks to
protest Israel's delay in implementing the PLO-Israel interim
peace deals signed last year.
</P>
<P>
The boycott is a natural reaction to Israeli intransigent
policies that undermine peace efforts on the Palestinian-Israeli
track, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's Political Advisor
Ahmed al-Tayeb made the remarks today in an interview with the
local radio Sawt al Arab.
</P>
<P>
It is unreasonable to talk about regional cooperation while
Israel is intensifying its settlement activities and pursuing
suppressive policies against the Palestinian people, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that talks about Israeli redeployment in Hebron, the
last West Bank town still under Israeli control, are faltering
because of Israel's intransigence and the Palestinian leaders
will not accept any attempt to renegotiate the issue to reach a
new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has so far not abided by a timetable for
implementing the agreements signed with the Palestinians, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The PA official said the boycott would last until progress is
achieved in talks on implementing signed agreements on issues
such as Israel's handover of most of the West Bank town of
Hebron, further redeployments from the rest of the West Bank and
the resumption of final status peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Multi-lateral talks on economic cooperation, water,
environment, arms control and refugees have been held since the
Mideast peace talks were launched between Israel and the
Palestinians, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russia, co-sponsors of the peace process, as well
as Europe and Arab States had participated in the multi-laterals
talks.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Demands International Arbitration Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today called for international arbitration over the
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference in Jericho with visiting
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, Arafat blamed
Israel for delaying the conclusion of the talks on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear and obvious that the other side, the Israelis,
are insisting on changing and delaying the implementation of what
has been agreed upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the optimistic tone of the Israeli side, Arafat
denied progress has been made in the Hebron talks. He said that
the new proposal put forward by Israel in recent days was not
different from the original one and remained unacceptable to the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Israel has softened its stand on
demanding the right of re-entering the Palestinian-controlled
areas in Hebron after the redeployment. The new idea put forward
by Israel is that the clause will not be written down in the
agreement, but rather included in a separate understanding between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for international arbitration from those who
have signed the agreements between us and the Israelis at the
White House with the presentation of (U.S.) President Bill Clinton
to push forward the peace process, and to investigate who is
behind the delay of the sincere and accurate implementation of
what has been agreed upon," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the signing ceremony of the first
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in Washington on September 13,
1993, witnessed by the U.S. and Russia, co-sponsors of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat added he was not opposed to holding a meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, except that it was
not only a photo opportunity but should bring about the
implementation of the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said at the press conference that Jordan supported the
Palestinian peace efforts, and he warned Israeli against
re-entering Hebron after the redeployment if it wanted to avoid
the resumption of violence.
</P>
<P>
He echoed Arafat's call for international intervention in
order to push forward the peace process, which is facing great
difficulties. "All efforts are needed ... not only by Jordan,
but by all the international community and all the leaders in
the world, to save the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti warned Israel against making statements about its
troops' re-entering of Hebron, which, he said, would "poison the
atmosphere of the talks and lead to total disaster."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the Israelis and Palestinians to
build confidence. He also said that Israel should solve the
issues of expanding settlements and closure of the Palestinian
territories with deeds instead of only words.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli sources insisted that progress had been
made in the Hebron talks in recent days. Israel Radio quoted
them as saying the two sides have narrowed differences on the
issues of "hot pursuit" and arming of the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The remaining differences yet to be resolved are Palestinian
demands on opening a market and a street in central Hebron, they
added. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will resume talks
this evening in a bid to finalize the deal.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Totaling 3,650 tons of
French wheat flour, which came into Tanzania earlier this month under
the 1996 France Food Aid Program, will be auctioned after full
import duty is paid.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Acting Minister for Finance Daniel Yona told the
official Daily News here today that the Treasury and the Ministry
of Agriculture and Co-operaives will jointly work out mechanisms
of disposing the wheat flour through public auction.
</P>
<P>
The wheat flour worth near 830,000 U.S.Dollars was handed to
Minister of Agriculture and Co-opeatives Paul Kimiti by the
French Ambassador to Tanzania, Alain Bispean, on November 11 it
has been laying at the Dar es Salaam Port, awaiting the import
duty aspect raised by Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
Yona said that the Ministry of Agriculture had submitted to
the Treasury its application for tax remission. But after a
thorough study by experts, it was found necessary to dispose the
consignment through public auction and its taxes must be paid.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Ministry of Agriculture said that it
will be difficult to sell the wheat flour because the selling
price will be very high after the import duty is imposed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Arab League delegates will hold
an extraordinary session Sunday to discuss Israeli settlements in
the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the 22 permanent members was called at the
request of Syria and Palestine, Secretary General of the
Cairo-based league Esmat Abdel Meguid told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians were infuriated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's pledge that Jewish settlements would continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians complain that the Jewish settlements break up the
territory between their main cities and diminish their chances of
establishing an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Syria strongly attacked Israel' reported plans to build three
new settlements on the Golan Heights with a total of 900 homes and
accused it of pushing the region into war by doing so. It called
for world pressure to stop Israel's settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria are locked in a fierce dispute over the Golan
Heights which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war. There are
32 Israeli settlements that now house approximately 14,000 Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel to return the strategic plateau
while Israeli government vowed not to relinquish its self-claimed
sovereignty. Tension is brewing between the two sides as the
bilateral peace talks, suspended from last March, have failed to
resume so far due to the dispute.

LAGOS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) plans to decentralize the implementation of its
programs in Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory (fct) in a bid to
facilitate its participation in the development process of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The measure will involve community-based organizations and
non-governmental organizations, Lazarus Gaza, UNDP Monitoring Adviser
in FCT, said today in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
UNDP, in conjunction with the National Planning Commission, has
identified six development programs for implementation in the capital,

The programs cover mass literacy, environment and natural resources
management, small and medium-sized enterprises, national statistics
information system, women in development and management of
development.
</P>
<P>
They are designed to be "pro-poor, pro-nature, pro-jobs, pro-women
and pro-children" in order to facilitate sustainable human development
in the territory, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The major objective in this direction is to empower the
disadvantaged segment of the society through human resources and
institutional development and to facilitate their participation in the
development process," he added.

<HEADLINE> Belarus President Signs New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko signed the country's new constitution tonight, which
was approved by a nationwide referendum Sunday, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The copy signed by the president will be regarded as the
reference copy and stored eternally in the presidential residence,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Lukashenko said, "Some say
that Lukashenko won the referendum. Nay, this is rather the
triumph of the people, of all the democratic forces."
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the constitution in the referendum put an end
to the confrontation between the president and parliament. The new
constitution extends the president's powers and his term in
office.
</P>
<P>
Belarus will continue moving toward a nuclear-free status,
Lukashenko said, adding that the withdrawal of the last former
Soviet strategic missile from Belarus to Russia Wednesday is
testimony to this.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) plans to expand
eastward look even more absurd in this light, he said. "Jointly
with Russia, Belarus must oppose this," he stated.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, attending the ceremony were heads of
all branches of power of the country, lawmakers, and heads of
diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, all of 110 pro-Lukashenko previous parliament
deputies formed the House of Representatives, or the lower house
of the new parliament, and held the first session of the lower
chamber. Former Communist Party leader Anatoly Malofeyev, 63, was
elected chairman of the house.
</P>
<P>
The upper house is to be formed later in accordance with the
constitution. Up to one-third of the 64-seat chamber will be
appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the lower house of the two-chamber legislature
put an end to the previous 199-seat parliament, which had been
involved in the political confrontation with the president over
the constitutional amendments adopted in the Sunday referendum.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Rules Out Use of Force Against Striking Truckers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe today ruled out the possibility of using force against
striking truckers, who placed blocks on the roads across the
country earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Transport Bernard Pons said this evening
on television that he was expecting "some progress in the hours to
come" leading to a compromise between the truckers, who are on
their 11th consecutive day of strike today, and their bosses.
</P>
<P>
Pons said that the bosses were still holding an open attitude
for negotiation over salary raise, after the truckers rejected an
earlier proposal of 1 percent raise of their pays by the bosses.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government could issue a decree ordering
the bosses to cut working time for the truckers, if the two sides
failed to reach an agreement in the field Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the labor dispute reached an agreement over
early retirement at 55 Wednesday, which was one of the three
demands presented by the truckers, who also asked for higher pays
and shorter work week.
</P>
<P>
Pons said that the two sides could sign a package of agreements
Friday in the presence of government mediator Robert Cros, who
mediated six nights of marathon talks until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the four unions of bosses also confirmed
this evening that they would yield to some of the demands by the
truckers, and said that they still left the options over salary
raise open.
</P>
<P>
Some striking truckers have reportedly stopped blocking access
to gas supply centers in order to deny accusations that they were
holding the whole people of France "hostage" by causing gas
shortages across the country through the blockade.

<HEADLINE> World Aircraft Pollute Air Severely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) is turning its attention of air
pollution from road vehicles to off-road vehicles, saying 400,000
aircraft of the world are responsible for two to three percent of
the earth's air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"This share may very well double or triple by the year 2015,"
said Lars Nordberg, Deputy Director of the Environment and Human
Settlements Division of the UN/ECE at the fourteenth session of
the executive body for the UN/ECE Convention on Long-range
Transboundary Air Pollution on November 25-28.
</P>
<P>
The Protocols to the UN/ECE Convention already recommend
specific technologies to control the emissions from traffic, but
until now these recommendations have dealt almost exclusively with
road vehicles such as cars and lorries, the UN/ECE said in a press
release here today. Now it is turning its attention to other
sources of emissions such as aircraft, ships, tractors,
construction equipment and lawnmowers.
</P>
<P>
On average, according to the press release, the complete
combustion of one kilogram of jet A1 aviation fuel has been
estimated to generate about 3.16 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2),
1.25 kilogram of water (H2O) in the form of vapor and one kilogram
of sulphur dioxide (SO2). Estimates of fuel sales to airlines
suggesnitrogen Oxides (NOx) emitted each year by aircraft
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE quoted data provided by the Dutch government as
saying that 94 percent of these emissions occur in the northern
hemisphere, mainly in North America (44 percent) and Europe (30
percent). Most occur at an altitude of 9 to 13 kilometers. it has
been estimated that 44 percent of all fuel is consumed above the
tropopause - limit between the troposphere and the stratosphere.
Civil aviation is responsible for most of this air pollution, but
military aviation also plays a significant role. The impact of
light aviation is mainly local.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE said that there are several technical and
operational options for reducing aircraft emissions such as
measures to improve the engines and methods to operate the craft
better.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Urges Israel To Show Peace Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has called on israeli government to indicate its
commitment to pursuing the Middle East peace process, Foreign
Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function in Pretoria to commemorate the annual
United Nations international day of solidarity with the
Palestinian people, Nzo said: ''Action is required which shows
that Israel intends complying with existing undertakings in terms
of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of Israeli security forces from Herbon was just a
case in point, said the minister. He stressed that provocations
such as the opening of the jerusalem tunnel and the expansion of
settlement must end.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Nzo said the South African government had noted
with satisfacation the steadfast commitment the Palestinian
leaders showed despite serious provocative incidents.
</P>
<P>
These incidents included severe and widespread economic
hardship caused by the closure of the territories and the
blocking of the implementation of agreements with Palestine by
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The South African Foreign Minister also underscored south
africa's good relations with Palestine, saying possible areas of
cooperation between the two countries were being examined.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Accuses Palestinians of Delaying Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today accused the Palestinians of continuing
to delay a Hebron agreement, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the comment when he was addressing the annual
luncheon of the Israel Editors' Committee in Tel Aviv this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat hopes to gain
from not signing an agreement on Israeli troop withdrawal from
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu predicted that Arafat will ultimately conclude the
peace talks on Hebron because, in his opinion, the delay is not
paying off for him.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreements, Israel was supposed to have
withdrawn its troops from most parts of the West Bank city of
Hebron by March.
</P>
<P>
However, the former Labor government postponed the
redeployment plan following a series of suicide bombing attacks
by fundamentalist groups in Israel late February and early March.
</P>
<P>
The plan was further delayed by the hardline Likud government
which took office in June. The Netanyahu government has insisted
on renegotiating the original plan on grounds of the security
arrangements for the 450 Jewish settlers living among the 120,000
Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side demands that the original agreement
be implemented without any change.

<HEADLINE> World's Highest Aids Figures Recorded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa
accounts for the largest slice of people reportedly having been
infected with AIDS or HIV, a virus causes aids, 14 million or 63
percent of the world's total, according to a United Nations
report on AIDS made public here today.
</P>
<P>
About 22.6 million people worldwide are believed to be
infected with the HIV, and most of them are women, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It also put the Sub-Saharan region as having the world's
highest AIDS deaths amongest adults for 1996, 783,700 of the 1.1
million world total.
</P>
<P>
The region's prevalence rate (the number of people with AIDS
or HIV in a specific region at a specific time divided by the
entire population of that region) of 5.6 percent is also the
highest in the world, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Projections for Zambia and Zimbabwe indicate that, because of
AIDS, child mortality rates may increase nearly threefold by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
While in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, surveys show that over 10 percent of women attending
antenatal clinics in urban areas are HIV infected. Infection
rates even exceeded 40 percent at some surveillance sites.
</P>
<P>
Women in these countries are infected mainly through
heterosexual intercourse, which they start in their early teens,
said the report, adding peak HIV infection rates are reached
before the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
however, infection rates have increased by several fold within
only a few years as has been observed recently in botswana and
south africa.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa between 1993 and 1995, HIV prevalence among
women increased from 4.3 to 11 percent in Orange Free State
Province, and from 9.6 to 18 percent in Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
While Rwanda and Burundi already have one of the oldest and
most severe HIV epidemics in Africa. In contrast, Zaire has so
far experienced a relatively low, stable HIV prevalence.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China, India Making Headway in Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China and India, the world's
two most populous countries, made headway in improving bilateral
relations today as they signed several agreements including one
concerning confidence building along disputed border areas.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin first paid respect to
Mahatma Gandhi today by laying a wreath on his memorial before
discussing issues of common concern with Indian Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
After the discussion session, Jiang witnessed the signing of
the agreements which also included accords on maritime
transportation, joint crackdown on drug trafficking and India's
maintaining its consulate-general in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The confidence-building agreement reminds observers of a
similar military agreement signed in April this year in Shanghai
by the presidents of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said here today the agreement with India is a
big step toward maintaining peace and stability along the line of
actual control in the border areas, creating a fair atmosphere for
the final settlement of the border issue which is left over from
history.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister hailed the confidence-building
agreement as conducive to establishing a mechanism for negotiation
concerning and cooperation along the more than
2,000-kilometer-long border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Jiang who arrived Thursday on a four-day
state visit, the first by a Chinese head of state since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1950, said: "It is
an important part of China's policy for sound bilateral relations
to establish with India long-term, stable and good neighborliness
and mutually-beneficial cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Gowda described Jiang's visit as "especially important" at the
turn of the century. He said the visit will help reach a
consensus while building a constructive and cooperative
partnership on the basis of friendship and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Jiang on Thursday invited Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma
to visit China and Sharma accepted the invitation with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also met with Sitaram Kesri, interim
president of the Indian National Congress Party, later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his Indian counterpart
Inder Kumar Gujral agreed today that Jiang's visit achieved
positive results after exchanging views on issues of common
concern and striking consensus in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two foreign ministers agreed upon the
direction along which China and India will develop their bilateral
relations in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated China's set policy concerning the Dalai Lama
and stressed that Tibet is an intrinsic part of China.
</P>
<P>
Gujral stressed that the Indian government fully respects
China's approach and has made it clear time and again that Tibet
is an autonomous region of China.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering held by the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry, President Jiang predicted the Chinese and
Indian peoples will be able to work together in the next century
for the prosperity of their countries as well as for the
revitalization of world civilization and development.
</P>
<P>
"Our two peoples had once added a brilliant chapter to the
annals of the ancient human civilization with their work and
wisdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as saying "there
will be no Asian century unless China and India are developed".
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that as the populations of China and India combine
to amount to 2.1 billion, the development of the two countries is
vital to the well-being of the entire world as well as their own.
</P>
<P>
"While the whole of Asia is working for a lasting peace and
economic development, a major task our two countries face now is
to enhance our friendship and promote our economic cooperation and
trade," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president cited as the most favorable conditions
for bilateral economic cooperation the eased international
situation and sustained, rapid growth of the economies in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said geographical proximity, vast land masses, rich
natural resources, large populations and huge markets are also
advantages for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The shared desire for a lasting friendship is a reliable
guarantee for the long-term cooperation between the two countries,
Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Ghali Calls for Peace in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called for peace in Middle
East in a written statement today to mark the International Day of
Solidarity with the Palestinian People while a ceremony was held
at UN Geneva Office.
</P>
<P>
"This annual commemorative events provides an opportunity to
remind the international community that the question of Palestine,
which is at the center of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle
East, remains unresolved despite of the peace process which began
at Madrid in 1991." said Ghali in the statement sent from New
York. He pointed out, "this issue is very close to my heart, and I
have devoted, and will continue to devote, my best efforts to
contribute to the achievement of a comprehensive and just peace in
the region."
</P>
<P>
The International Day has been observed annually on November 29
since adoption of a General Assembly resolution in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Ghali went on that "the establishment of an elected Palestinian
administration over Gaza and parts of the West Bank earlier this
year was a significant advance" along the road to reconciliation
and peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. "It is
now of the utmost importance not to dissipate those achievements
but to build on them, in order to fulfil the hopes of all the
peoples of the region for a future of peace," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ghali hoped that progress can also be made in the
Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the road towards complete peace is not smooth. After
recalling a series of events negative to peace in the region in
February, March and September, Ghali said, "The resumption of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations has been an encouraging
development. It is essential that the parties should abide by
agreements already reached and make tangible progress towards a
comprehensive, just and lasting settlement based on security
Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)."
</P>
<P>
Ghali said, "I would like to take this opportunity to renew
once again the firm commitment of the United Nations in support of
the peace process. The programs and agencies of the United Nations
system will continue to provide all possible expertise and
assistance in humanitarian relief and in the fields of economic
and social development, in order to contribute to creating the
necessary conditions for peace."

<HEADLINE> ADB to Assist Rural Sanitation in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has agreed to provide a loan assistance of over 20 million
US dollars for a rural water supply and sanitation project in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the loan was signed here by representatives of
the bank and the Nepali government, according to the Nepali
Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The project, the fourth of its kind in Nepal, will be
implemented in 40 districts of the country's eastern, mid-western
and far-western regions with a view to providing water to about
600,000 rural people.
</P>
<P>
It will also help promote hygiene education in the project
areas, provide low-cost sanitation facilities in selected rural
communities, extend the community-based approach to other similar
projects in order to strengthen operation and maintenance, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB bank earlier had assisted the implementation of three
similar projects in Nepal's remote rural areas with a total amount
of 42 million US dollars in loan assistance, which have already
benefited about 3 million local people.

<HEADLINE> Producer Excludes Fish-meal From Cattle Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Pressure from supermarkets has
forced a leading animal food manufacturer to stop using fish-meal
in feed for beef cattle and lambs, The Daily Telegraph said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the beef crisis, retailers were increasingly
worried about the use of animal protein in livestock diets," the
newspaper quoted the manufacturer, J. Bibby Agriculture, as
saying. The company feared that major retailers would buy their
meat abroad.
</P>
<P>
The crisis broke when mad cow disease, which is believed to
have been caused by feed containing the contaminated remains of
sheep and cattle, was linked to a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease in people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Bibby dropped fish-meal, used for its high
food value, from its main brand of feed for dairy cattle. The
exclusion now extends to cattle and lambs destined for the butcher
unless farmers ask specifically for it to be included.
</P>
<P>
Although the decision has been taken on food quality and safety
grounds, it will help fish conservation by reducing commercial
demand for fish.
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that cattle and sheep can thrive on food
containing soya and other ingredients instead of fish-meal. In one
trial, at the Oatbridge College of Agriculture in Edinburgh, 140
lambs were divided into two groups and fed diets with and without
fish-meal. These showed "no significant differences" in
performance.

<HEADLINE> First Sentence for Bosnian War Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hague tribunal for war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia today ordered a Croat jailed for
10 years for taking part in the massacre of 1,200 Muslims during
the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
This was the first sentence handed down by the tribunal since
it was established in 1993, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, also the first international war crimes verdict
since the post-World War II tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo,
sentenced Drazen Erdemovic to 10 years in prison the massacre of
Muslims at Srebrenica in July, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Erdemovic, 25, admitted his role in the slaughter allegedly
organized by the Bosnian Serb army at a farm in Pilica, north of
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
Erdemovic said he had to obey the order by his commanding
officer in a Bosnian Serb army execution squad to shoot groups of
10 Muslims, otherwise he himself would have been shot dead.
</P>
<P>
Erdemovic's attorney had demanded an acquittal, arguing that
Erdemovic was forced to participate in the killing.
</P>
<P>
The presiding judge, Claude Jorda of France, said Erdemovic
should serve the term, minus time already served since his
transfer here at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Erdemovic had actively assisted investigators in probing crimes
committed around the fall of the Srebrenica enclave.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has indicted 74 war crimes suspects, but only
seven have been extradited to the U.N. court.

<HEADLINE> Ejection Of Minorities Continues In Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Ejection of Muslims and Serbs
by the Croats is continuing in the western part of Mostar, the
United Nations High Commission For Refugees (UNHCR) said today.
</P>
<P>
Three eviction cases occurred over the past five days with
another 65 minority people ejected since the Dayton peace accords
were signed, said UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski.
</P>
<P>
"This is a totally appalling situation, considering that it is
happening a year after Dayton," Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR intervention in the ejections has produced very
little results, with only six-evicted people returning to their
apartments, he said.
</P>
<P>
A 65-year-old handicapped woman was seen being dragged from her
apartment into a car by three Croats in uniforms and dumped at a
square 100 meters away from the border which divides
Croat-controlled western Mostar and Muslim-controlled eastern
Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the old lady was later driven to her sister's
home in eastern Mostar by a passing motorist.
</P>
<P>
Before the war broke out in 1992, there were 43,931 Muslims,
42,648 Croats and 23,909 Serbs in Mostar. Now, only 800 Serbs and
3,000 Muslims remain in western Mostar and 400 Serbs and 200
Croats stay in eastern Mostar.
</P>
<P>
The minorities in western Mostar are believed to be
second-class citizens who are unemployed and fearful of their
apartments being taken over, compared to those who live fairly
normal lives in the eastern part, Janowski said.

<HEADLINE> Treatment in Theory Found for Muscular Dystrophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A British science team has
developed a novel treatment -- in theory -- for muscular
dystrophy, the fatal muscle wasting disease, according to the
latest issue of the science journal, Nature.
</P>
<P>
The hereditary disease, caused by the loss of part of a stretch
of the genetic code containing three million "letters," affects
one in 3,000 boys, cutting their lifespan to between 20 and 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of Oxford University have found that, as a result of
defects in this gene, muscles in the body are unable to make an
important protein called dystrophin, and so wither.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to replace the protein have been unsuccessful
because the gene is so large.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Kay Davies has shown that it should be possible, in
theory, to treat the disease by turning on the manufacture of
another muscle protein, called utrophin, which is a similar
protein to dystrophin and is normally made in all cells.
</P>
<P>
In the early human fetus, they do the same job but at about 23
weeks' gestation, utrophin and dystrophin begin to do different
things in muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
To show whether utrophin could help treat the disease, Prof.
Davies studied mice that lack dystrophin and thus suffer a wasting
disease that is similar to muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
She introduced a gene that meant the mice continued to make
utrophin and found that there was a significant fall in muscle
wastage to the point where the tissue looked normal.
</P>
<P>
"It has worked spectacularly well," said Davies. "We did not
expect it to be so successful."
</P>
<P>
Now the search is on for drugs that can reactivate the
manufacture of utrophin in adults. The key lies in a stretch of
genetic code called a promoter, which turns genes such as that
responsible for utrophin, on and off.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Amends Law on Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian National Assembly
has approved an amendment to the foreign investment law, raising
the minimum amount of foreign fund for a business to register as a
foreign funded firm to 50,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, approved Thursday, foreign fund under the
minimum amount in a firm will no longer be considered as
investment and will not enjoy foreign investment protection.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the required capital for registering a foreign
company has been 50,000 leva, or 150 U.S. dollars at the current
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the old law, the amendment makes it clear that money
deposited by foreigners in Bulgarian banks will not be taken as
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners still do not have property rights to land in
Bulgaria. But under the new law, registered joint ventures with
foreign fund can obtain land for construction.
</P>
<P>
The new law also reduces the minimum value of equipment and
technology of foreign investors needed to qualify for the
exemption of value added tax, tariffs and other taxes, from five
million U.S. dollars to 50,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Bulgaria stood at 14 million dollars in
1990. The figure rose to 50 million, 127 million, 220 million and
104 million in 1991,1992,1993 and 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, the country attracted 201
million dollars of foreign investment, with Germany as the biggest
investor. Bulgaria still lags behind many other eastern European
countries in foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Urbanization Threatens to Devour Farmland in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The rampant expansion of urban
areas is eating away scarce fertile farmland in Egypt where
balanced development could be hard at hand with less than 4
percent of land cultivated and only 5.5 percent of the country
populated.
</P>
<P>
The urban areas, villages and cities, within the Delta, the
fertile triangle which represent over 90 percent of Egypt's total
agricultural lands, have doubled in size between 1972 and 1990,
according to a recent study by Cairo University's center for
Environmental Hazard Mitigation (CEHM).
</P>
<P>
Nine-month extensive investigations revealed that the rapid
expansion of smaller yet numerous villages, instead of the main
cities, posed the largest threat to Egypt's already-limited
agricultural lands.
</P>
<P>
Urban areas shot up from 3 percent of the total Delta area to 6
percent over less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"If the trend continues, an additional 6 percent of the
farmland will be transformed into urban areas by 2010," said CEHM
Project Manager Mohamed Sultan.
</P>
<P>
Despite suggestions of immediate removal of such encroachment
and close monitoring, it is hard to curb the sprawlings, if taking
into account that about 99 percent of the whole population live on
mere 4 percent of its vastly-deserted territories.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, the River Nile waters draining into the
Mediterranean Sea no longer carry the silt and clay, a natural
protective layer for the Delta, since the construction of the High
Dam.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the sea is constantly eating into the Delta and
eroding the coastline," the research added.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of satellite imagery data showed that stretches of
land have been either submerged or eroded away.
</P>
<P>
Sultan said to tackle this problem, a number of wave breakers
have to be erected at carefully selected areas where coastal
erosion is at a maximum.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Police Smash Bank-Swindle Syndicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police today
smashed a syndicate in which drug addicts had allegedly been lured
to swindle 180,000-HK-dollar (23,226-US-dollar) loans out of
banks following the arrests of seven people, a police spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that police received a report from a bank in Shatin
that a customer had submitted an application for a
40,000-HK-dollar (5,161-US-dollar) personal loan with a false
address and fake documents.
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old applicant, suspected to be a drug addict, was
then arrested. He claimed to have been recruited by a man to
deceive the bank for a reward of 350 HK dollars (45.2 US dollars),
he said.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent to his arrest, police apprehended a 27-year-old man,
believed to be the mastermind, and five other suspected drug
addicts.
</P>
<P>
The mastermind is suspected of offering false documents to his
recruits to submit 12 applications for loan totaling 495,000 HK
dollars (63,870 US dollars) to three banks in September and
October.
</P>
<P>
Five of the applications had been approved and 180,000 HK
dollars (23,226 US dollars) were deposited into their accounts.
</P>
<P>
The case is still under investigation, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers, Bosses Meet Amid Attrition War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- French truckers and their bosses
met again this morning while French people waited for a government
decree on shorter working hours with full payment to end the
12-day-old road blockade.
</P>
<P>
"We arrived determined to open the question of 100 percent
payment for working time," said Claude Debons, a workers
industrial delegate who was about to join the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that although a government decree could give a legal
guarantee for some labor rights, it would not take into account
everything involved.
</P>
<P>
The union delegates and the bosses were supposed to sign a
protocol of agreement reached Wednesday night under the government
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation has made some progress in earlier retirement,
at age 55, for the truckers. But disputes over higher pay and
shorter working hours remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, truckers are reportedly beginning to lift some of
the 250 blockades they placed on roads across the country.
Differences over whether to end the blockade, which was said to
have turned into a war of attrition, have appeared among strikers.
</P>
<P>
Local media described the situation on the roads as "very
confusing."
</P>
<P>
As many gas supply centers are under blockade by the truckers,
nearly half of the departments in France are rationing gas
supplies today, and about 2,500-3,000 gas service stations out of
a total of 18,000 in France have been closed.
</P>
<P>
Many department stores and supermarkets were running out of
fresh food such as fish, meat and vegetables, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The strike also caused serious damages to the trucking industry
of neighboring countries, including Britain, Spain, Italy, Benelux
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, British Prime Minister John Major summoned the
French ambassador to express his "horror" over the strike.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe Thursday night called on the
conflicting sides to solve "a couple of the disputes" immediately,
as the strike was bringing tremendous losses to the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The State Secretary for Transport, Anne-Marie Idrac, said that
the government was rushing to draft a decree on cutting working
hours and raising pay.
</P>
<P>
A domino-affect, "technical unemployment," is seen in other
enterprises, as workshops depending on trucking transportation run
short of jobs in France and in neighboring countries.

BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- On March 9th next year, people
in northeast China will have the rare opportunity to see a total
solar eclipse and the Hale-Bopp Comet at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Li Qibin, director of the Beijing Observatory, said that at

another in Brazil in May, 1947; and a third in Kenya in November,
1948.
</P>
<P>
March 9th will be the seventh and final chance during this

<HEADLINE> British Minister on Britain-African Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain has this year
allocated over 6.5 million Pounds (about 10.8 million U.S.
Dollars) to UK Military Training Assistance Scheme and Africa
Defense Fund, a British minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by visiting British Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs and Overseas Development Baroness Lyinda Chalker
when addressing a meeting organized by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) in the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
Chalker said: "Britain's policy in Africa is guided by two key
objectives: support for the the peaceful resolution of conflicts,
and the alleviation of poverty through sustainable development,
good governance and economic reform."
</P>
<P>
On the UK's role in helping Africans prevent and resolve
conflicts, the minister said that Britain is providing support to
former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere in his diplomatic
efforts and has made contributions to the OAU for the peace fund
and the new conflicts management division.
</P>
<P>
"The UK-African peacekeeping initiative, launched in September
1994 is playing a leading role by helping Africans to respond to
regional crisis," she added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Britain's assistance to Africa, Chalker said,
"Africa is at the heart of British assistance for overseas
development." She added that "last year we spent some 400 million
Pounds (about 650 million US Dollars) on direct support for
Africa. Some of it was for emergency relief."
</P>
<P>
Africa "needs continuing structural change at each stage" and
"import barriers in Africa are still far higher than in other
developing countries. They hold back regional trade and reduce
real incomes," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The British minister also talked of Africa's debt crisis,
saying, "we have written off our old aid loans to 16 African
countries. The Paris Club of government creditors has, through
the Naples terms, reduced the official bilateral debts of 14
African countries by up to 67 percent."
</P>
<P>
She stressed the importance of closer relations between the
OAU and the European Union (EU). "We and our partners in the EU
look forward to the first EU/OAU ministerial meeting which we
hope will take place in the new year. This event should help to
reinforce the good cooperation which has been developing among
us," she added.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the British minister visited the OAU Conflict
Management Center and held talks with OAU acting secretary
general Ahmed Haggag.
</P>
<P>
Chalker arrived here yesterday for a four-day visit to
Ethiopia. She is here to attend the centenary celebration of the
British embassy in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> HK High Court to Use Chinese to Hear Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- From December 1 on, the High
Court of Hong Kong can use either Chinese or English in the
hearing of appeals from the magistrates' courts, the Labor
Tribunal and the Small Claims Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hong Kong's Judiciary said here today that the
same applies to applications for leave to appeal from the labor
and small claims tribunals.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objective is to put in place a bilingual
system that would allow suitable cases to be heard in Chinese or
English.
</P>
<P>
He said that in each case, the judge has the discretion to
decide which official language to be used with the aim to ensure
the just and expeditious disposal of the case.
</P>
<P>
He said, "This move will enable Chinese-speaking appellants to
present his grounds of appeal, communicate directly with the judge
and dispense with the need for interpretation."
</P>
<P>
So far English has been the only official language in the High
Court in Hong Kong and interpreters have to be used even when
every person in court speaks or understands Chinese.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Judiciary is committed to enabling Chinese to
be used in all courts by July 1, 1997, and this is an important
step towards achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
On December 4 last year, the High Court of Hong Kong for the
first time used Chinese to try a civil case involving an
inheritance dispute between a 90-year-old woman and her three
daughters.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Inspected Newly-Opened Expressway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Li Peng
inspected a newly-opened express highway in east China yesterday,
saying that the road will play a significant role in the economic
growth of the Yangtze River delta.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway, which links China's largest
city to the capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province, was
completed in September.
</P>
<P>
With a length of 274 kilometers, it passes through the river
delta, one of the country's most prosperous regions, and helps
reduce the driving time between the two cities by three hours.
</P>
<P>
In a drizzling rain, Li, accompanied by vice premier Wu Bangguo
and top government leaders of Shanghai and Jiangsu Province,
walked along the expressway and chatted with some of the road
workers.
</P>
<P>
"You have done a good thing, not only for Shanghai and Jiangsu,
but also for the people across the country," Li told them, adding
that the road has helped strengthen connections between China's
inland and coastal provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the completion of the Shanghai-Nanjing expressway
has also provided new opportunities for road construction in areas
where there are many rivers and lakes, which abound in South China.
</P>
<P>
"This expressway, which was completed within a short period and
at a low cost, indicates that China has climbed another step in
the design, construction, and management of express highways," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Feature: HK Military Facilities Built to Greet PLA Garrison  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Construction is in full
swing here on two civil engineering projects, slated to be handed
over to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison to be
stationed in Hong Kong after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Now 80 percent of the work has been finished on the two
projects -- the Stonecutters Island Naval Base and the Gun Hill
Military Hospital, according to the main contractor China State
Construction Engineering Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Both projects are designed and managed by the Architectural
Services Department of the Hong Kong Government; China State
Construction Engineering Corporation successfully won the bid for
the two contracts.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the military facilities was nailed down in an
agreement signed by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in June
1994. The British side agreed to rebuild for the PLA troops some
buildings and fixed facilities gratis, including a military
hospital and a naval base.
</P>
<P>
The naval base is being built on a reclaimed plot along the
south shore of the Stonecutters island, which now is actually
linked to the west part of the Kowloon peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Fu He, the deputy site manager who oversees the project, said
that on the 16-hectare working site, 33 buildings with a total
ground floor area of 35,000 square meters are under construction,
including an office block, quarters, an assembly hall, a quay
club, a vessel repair workshop, a fuel storage building, a signal
tower, a helicopter landing pad, a sewage treatment station, just
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
Standing on the helicopter landing pad, one can get a
bird's-eye view of the naval base, which, like a small society, is
composed of three parts -- the administrative and military
training zone, the logistic zone and the residential zone. The
naval base is backed against a green hill in the north and is
facing the west part of repair and fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that there is a tremendous amount of work to do in
building underground utilities, such as various supply systems of
electricity, gas, water and fuel. A 2-kilometer-long road and a
landscaping area totaling 40,000 square meters are also part of
the work.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving 1.12 billion HK dollars (145 million US
dollars), is the biggest contract the Architectural Series
Department has ever awarded. It is also the largest project the
China State Construction Engineering Corporation has ever
undertaken in Hong Kong.

"It is a project of significance, directly linked to the
historic affair next June, when China will resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy site manager said: "We have done nearly 80 percent
of the work, and now we are busy installing electrical and
mechanical equipment," said Fu. He was confident that the project
could be finished in time.
</P>
<P>
Though in a smaller scale, the Gun Hill Military Hospital is
also a project of significance for the contractor, China State
Construction Engineering Corporation. The project which started in
May 1995 involves 398 million HK dollars (51.5 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ma Peiquan, the site manager said that the project would be
completed in February 1997, well ahead of July next year when it
will be handed over to the PLA garrison in Hong Kong. The hospital
will provide comprehensive medical services for the PLA servicemen
based in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It takes ten minutes to walk to the construction site of the
military hospital from Tsim Sha Tsui, the downtown area in
Kowloon. The main hospital building, comprising a "C" shaped low
block and an "L" shaped 11-storey high block, has emerged out of
the dense bamboo scaffolding. On the 17,000-square meter site,
other auxiliary facilities are being set up, including a
seven-story composite block, a storage block, a canteen and two
staff quarters.
</P>
<P>
Ma said: "The civil work has almost finished, and we just
started the internal fitting-up."

<HEADLINE> London Circus' Artist Undergoes Surgery in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Royal London Circus'
flying trapeze artist Elliot Noves-Steve who fractured his neck
during a show in Sembilan State, Southeastern Malaysia, has
undergone an eight-hour surgery at a local hospital in the State.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Ecuadorian, who underwent the surgery
yesterday at the Seremban hospital, was reported in critical
condition as he had suffered severe ruptured nerves, a hospital
spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Doctors fear that Noves-Steve may be paralyzed from the neck
down even if he survives.
</P>
<P>
The Flying trapeze artist fell eight meters head down onto a
safety net during the final show of the day on Wednesday and was
taken to the hospital by his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Circus president and producer Paul L.B. Lee said Noves-Steve
was considered to be among the world's best trapeze artists,
together with his 24-year-old brother Jeery, and they were
innovative and adventurous in their act.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the five-member troupe faced this kind of risk daily
and considered it as part of the job.
</P>
<P>
The circus, which is on the last leg of its tour of Malaysia,
was in the midst of finding a suitable replacement for the popular
Ecuadorian, Lee said, adding the circus will leave for China after
its performance in the country.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry Sessions for HK Chief Executive Candidates End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The three-day
question-and-answer sessions for the three candidates for the
first Chief Executive of the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) ended this morning at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, vice chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the
SAR, said at the end of the sessions that members of the Selection
Committee and the candidates were all fully prepared for the
sessions, with questions very well raised and answered.
</P>
<P>
He said it is especially good that all members of the Selection
Committee and the candidates can proceed from the considerations
of Hong Kong's overall and long-term interests, and of the needs
for ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
"These question-and-answer sessions have been carried out in a
democratic way which is in line with Hong Kong's practical
conditions," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, Peter K.C. Woo and Ti Liang Yang this morning
answered questions raised by Selection Committee members from the
political sector.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the afternoon of November 27, four inquiry
sessions have been conducted, one for each of the four function
groups in the 400-member Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
During all four sessions, members of the Selection Committee
were very active to ask questions, which involved the relationship
between the SAR government and the central government; the
implementation of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law;
the political and legal systems of the future SAR; exchanges
between Hong Kong and the world; Hong Kong's long-term economic
prosperity; industrial policy; employment issues; housing and
social welfare policies and many other aspects.
</P>
<P>
All of the three candidates answered these questions in a
sincere and detailed way during their one hour time in each
session.
</P>
<P>
They all held that the Basic Law is the fundamental guarantee
for Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term prosperity and
stability. The implementation of "one country, two systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" is the unswerving policy
for running Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They also said that they will make concerted efforts with the
six million Hong Kong residents to maintain Hong Kong's status as
an international finance, trade, shipping, tourism and information
center, as well as the status of free port, so that Hong Kong can
have a brighter future in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Selection Committee generally showed their
satisfaction with the form of the question-and-answer sessions,
which were televised live on the local circuit. They held that
this is quite helpful for Selection Committee members and Hong
Kong residents to know more about the candidates themselves and
their political platforms.
</P>
<P>
Member of the Selection Committee Yu Sun-say said that the
question-and-answer sessions gave him a better understanding of
the three candidates, and Hong Kong people can clearly see that
the operation of the Selection Committee is quite fair and open.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Lai-wan, also member of the Selection Committee, said
that the arrangement of the four sessions reflected principle of
democracy and impartiality, and it also fully proved that the
choice of the Chief Executive is not "ordered" by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
According to related decisions by the Preparatory Committee,
the third plenary session of the Selection Committee will be held
on December 11 in Hong Kong to produce the Chief Executive-elect
through balloting.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Slams at Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has renewed his warning against the Israeli settlement policy in a
message to the hardline Israeli Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli settlements hinder the peace process and undermine
the efforts exerted to push it forward in the region, said Mubarak
in the letter addressed to Binyamin Netanyahu, splashed across
major Arabic newspapers here today.
</P>
<P>
"The settlements could blast the trust between Israel and the
Arab countries," he said, adding that Israel should give up the
settlements policy and stop expanding the existing settlements in
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Egypt is closely following the development in the
region, Mubarak stressed the exigency of reaching an agreement
between Israel and Palestinian Authority to settle their
difference, and resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to have diplomatic ties with the
Jewish state, has recently stepped up attacks at the Israeli
settlement expansion, warning of a freeze in normalizing relations
as a protest against the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet announced this month the establishment of
three more settlements, most of them around Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu pledged last week that the Jewish settlements will
continue to expand regardless of the mounting Arab outcry.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzak Mordechai
approved the construction of 1,200 housing units.
</P>
<P>
Infuriated Palestinians have complained that the settlements
break up the territory between the main cities and diminish their
chances of setting up an independent state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Syria has also condemned reported Israeli plans to build three
new settlements on the Golan Heights with a total of 900 homes and
accused it of pushing the region into war by doing so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat said in Jericho
Thursday no progress was achieved during the attritional,
three-month Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the redeployment
in Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, 133 UN member states Thursday voiced
their opposition to the Israeli policies aimed at expanding the
settlements in the Palestinian territories and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Burns said that the
Israeli settlements hinder the peace negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israelis.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Exchange Reserves Exceeds 100 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange
reserves reached 100.45 billion US dollars on November 12, up from
75.36 billion at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is appropriate for China, given the fact that the
nation's outstanding foreign debt has surpassed 100 billion US
dollars, and over 20 billion US dollars is needed for repayment of
debt principal and interest each year," the central bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the rapid growth in China's foreign exchange
reserves was a favorable result of the nation's macro-control
policies.
</P>
<P>
China's moderately-tight monetary policy since the second half
of 1993 has effectively restricted overall domestic demand and the
expansion of the credit scale, which in turn has helped improve
the country's balance of international payments.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index in China, which soared to a record high
of 21.7 percent in 1994, has since been brought under control,
down to 4.7 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
A foreign trade surplus of 34 billion US dollars between 1994
and this October is another major factor contributing to the rapid
expansion of China's foreign exchange reserves, the central bank
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that a continual and massive inflow of foreign
investment is yet another important source for China's growing
foreign exchange reserves.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Building Power Plant for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a thermal
power plant started today in Xiangfan, in central China's Wuhan
Province, as part of the country's largest water conservation
endeavor, the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
With an overall installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts,
the Three Gorges Project can only generate 5 million kwh of power
during the low-water season of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
According to the project design, a thermal power plant with
generating capacity of 6 million kw must be built for supplemental
energy.
</P>
<P>
Four coal-burning generating units, each with a capacity of
300,000 kw, will be installed during first phase construction of
the Xiangfan power plant.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has been listed on the state plan for
infrastructural construction for 1996, has a total investment of
nearly 7.4 billion yuan (about 850 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts said that when the power plant is completed, the
shortage of power supply in the northwest part of Hubei can also
be greatly relieved.

MACAO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will

official said here on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will continue to give support and

<HEADLINE> Australian External Deficit Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's current account
deficit deteriorated to 1.788 billion Australian dollars (1.607
billion U.S. dollars) in October on a seasonally adjusted basis,
the worst level in eight months, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The figure soared by 98 million Australian dollars, or six
percent, from 1.69 billion Australian dollars (1.52 billion U.S.
dollars) in September, said the ABS.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst monthly external balance figure recorded since
February when the current account deficit stood at 1.84 billion
Australian dollars (1.65 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was also the fourth monthly deterioration of the current
account deficit in a row. The figure was much higher than market
expectations, which centered on a slight fall to 1.6 billion
Australian dollars (1.44 billion U.S. dollars) in the month.
</P>
<P>
In trend terms, which reflect the long-term direction of
changes in the current account balance, the current account
deficit widened to 1.61 billion Australian dollars (1.45 billion
U.S. dollars) in October from 1.55 billion Australian dollars
(1.39 billion U.S. dollars) in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account has never been in surplus in
trend terms in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures also showed that the structural problem of the
Australian economy was the sole major cause of the worsening
imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted net income deficit, which values the
level of debt owed by Australia to overseas creditors, contributed
1.91 billion Australian dollars (1.72 billion U.S. dollars) to the
total current account deficit, only being offset by a modest
surplus in net services and net unrequited transfers.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst net income deficit in 11 months, or since
November 1995. It reflected the fact that Australia had to rely on
overseas funds for its economic development due to its poor level
of national savings.
</P>
<P>
Citibank Ltd.'s chief economist Stephen Koukoulas said that the
"best in the current account deficit readings in this cycle are
probably behind us."
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust Australia Ltd.'s senior economist David Bassanese
said that the net income deficit would stay close to around 1.9
billion Australian dollars (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) over the
next two months because Australia had to service its large amount
of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists agreed that the current account
deficit would not have an impact on short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"The current account in Australia is almost entirely driven by
the net income deficit. There is no short-term fix to the net
income deficit which will involve long-term structural reform to
resolve Australia's saving-investment imbalance," said Dresdner
Australia Ltd.'s chief economist Rob Henderson.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the federal government budget moved from
deficit to surplus, the trend deterioration in the current account
deficit would begin to turn around.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government of Australia planned to improve public
sector savings by cutting expenditure by 7.2 billion Australian
dollars (6.5 billion U.S. dollars) over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
It has projected a turn-around in the budget position from a
deficit of 5.6 billion Australian dollars (5.0 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1996-97 to a surplus of 1.6 billion Australian dollars
(1.44 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The economists' view was supported by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello said that the current account deficit
was a "long haul" problem which could not be quickly resolved.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard also dismissed concern that the
balance of payments figures would have any significance for
official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"The climate is still very good for the maintenance of low
interest rates if you look at all of the various ingredients, so I
wouldn't see today's figures as in any way party-pooping the
present climate," he told the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed that the country's trade imbalance also
worsened in October, with the seasonally adjusted merchandise
trade deficit widening to 21 million Australian dollars (18.9
million U.S. dollars) from 15 million Australian dollars (13.5
million U.S. dollars) in September.
</P>
<P>
The Australian financial market did not take much heed of the
current account deficit figures today as both the Australian
dollar and the stock market went firmer.

<P>
GENEVA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government decided
Thursday to restrict imports of sausages and other meat products
from neighboring countries starting from January 1, 1997 in fear
of the mad cow discease.
</P>
<P>
Countries affected by the new restrictions include Germany,
Austria, Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government claimed that most European Union members
have not done much to control the spread of the mad cow disease,
adding that some were still using internal organs to make sausages
and other meat products.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland demanded that Germany, Austria and Italy give
further clarifications on these matters.
</P>
<P>
It said that France would be less affected by the restrictions
because France has done better in controlling the spread of mad
cow disease.

Early this year, Austria and Germany banned the imports of beef
from Switzerland. Italy made similar restrictions later.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Prefer Blue, Green and White Colors, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A national survey has shown
that Chinese people's favorite colors are blue, green and white,
and that their color choices have become more varied in recent
years, reflecting strong personal characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 2,500 urban and rural residents was conducted by
the research institute on public opinion associated with the
People's University.
</P>
<P>
In addition to blue, green and white, Chinese people also find
black and brown appealing. But red and yellow, which were
long-time first preferences, are now lagging behind, the survey
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Surveyors added that the days of Chinese wearing exclusively
grey or green clothes are gone.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the Chinese share their tastes in color
with people from the United States, Russia, Iceland, Denmark,
Finland and Japan, who name blue and green as their top color
choices.
</P>
<P>
This may reflect a relationship with nature, particularly the
earth and sky, surveyors said.
</P>
<P>
The data show that young people prefer pink, rose and purple,
while older people favor brown and green. Those under 30 liked
white best, while a majority of people above the age of 60 said
they do not like white at all.
</P>
<P>
Among the survey group, some 80 percent agreed that color may
affect a person's mood.
</P>
<P>
Gender and age impose fewer influences on color choices than do
profession, education and income, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
These days, the survey pointed out, Chinese people are paying
closer attention to the colors of the goods they buy, especially
items that they associate with their personal image.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China, India Seek to Build 21-Century-Oriented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China and India today
stressed that they will seek to forge a 21st-century-oriented,
constructive and cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached during a meeting between visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that bilateral relations have
witnessed improvement and progress in recent years thanks to
concerted efforts. He said that China and India have maintained
high-level visits which have facilitated deeper understanding and
mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
"Our two governments have made progress in exchanges and
cooperation in the military field as well as in politics, trade,
economy, science and technology and culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later today, China and India today signed an agreement on
confidence-building measures in the military field along the line
of actual control in the China-India border areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reminds observers of a similar military accord
signed by China, Russia and three other former Soviet republics
concerning their common borders.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the presidents of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and Tajikistan signed in Shanghai an
agreement on confidence building in the military field in border
areas.
</P>
<P>
Gowda hailed the confidence-building agreement as conducive to
establishing a mechanism for negotiation and cooperation
concerning the common border which measures more than 2,000
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said the agreement is a big step toward
maintaining peace and stability along the line of actual control
in the border areas, creating a fair atmosphere for the final
resolution of the border issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important part of China's policy for sound bilateral
relations to establish with India long-term, stable, and good
neighborliness and mutually-beneficial cooperation," said Jiang,
who arrived here Thursday on a four-day state visit, the first by
a Chinese head of state to India.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jiang invited Indian President Shankar Dayal
Sharma to visit China and Sharma accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister noted that India and China are the
largest developing countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"High-level visits between the two countries are conducive to
developing bilateral relations," said Gowda.
</P>
<P>
He described Jiang's current visit to India as "especially
important" at the turn of the century. He said the visit would
contribute to a consensus between the two countries while building
a constructive and cooperative partnership on the basis of
friendship and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Gowda said that the two countries, which are both aspiring to
develop their economy and society, hope to do so in a fair
external environment.
</P>
<P>
"We should try to find a solution acceptable to both sides to
unresolved border issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese side has always taken a positive
approach toward the settlement of the border issues which are left
over from history.
</P>
<P>
"I believe China and India are capable of settling the
historical issues through peaceful negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China and India are neighbors with
similar levels of development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have a lot to share while conducting
mutually-beneficial cooperation and striving for joint
development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister said that economic and technical
cooperation is an important component of the relationship between
the two countries. He said that he hoped India and China can
strengthen cooperation in the sectors of trade, economy, science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation within South Asia, Jiang said that China
supports South Asian regional cooperation and is for anything
conducive to prosperity and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Special Assistant Zeng Qinghong,
Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering, Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, Special Assistant Wang Weicheng and
Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Gyaincain Norbu.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral was also present at
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> New Drama to Tell Tragedy of Historic Reformer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A new drama will be staged in
the Chinese capital this month that tells the tragic history of a
politician who worked to reform China some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Shang Yang," produced with a record investment of 800,000 yuan
(some 100,000 US dollars), is the true story of Shang Yang, an
official who was murdered for promoting what are considered to be
the earliest efforts to unite and develop China.
</P>
<P>
Shang, a cabinet member of the Qin kingdom during the Warring
States period (475-221 B.C.), suggested that governance by strict
law would strengthen the country and help it to become more
prosperous. He also advocated the building of a powerful army and
developing the economy.
</P>
<P>
Shang's proposals were accepted by Qinxiaogong, the king of
Qin. But Shang was killed by Qinheiwenwang, the son and successor
of Qinxiaogong, who believed his power was being undermined by
Shang's measures.
</P>
<P>
However, Shang's reform proved to be effective, as it laid a
solid foundation on which Emperor Qinshihuang built the Qin
Dynasty and united China for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Shang's popularity resurfaced in the 1970s, when it was used as
a political tool by the radical "Gang of Four" in their attempt to
seize state power.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Culture said that artists in
the 1990s have a new understanding of the historic period in which
Shang lived, and have re-created an "artistic" version of the
reformer.
</P>
<P>
"The drama is about the difficulties of reforms in the ancient
times," said Yao Yuan, the playwright. Yao is from the People's
Liberation Army and is known for his adaptations of many modern
revolutionary works that depict the lives of Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Historians have said that the play is historically accurate,
unlike many modern-day films and TV series about similar subjects.
</P>
<P>
The drama was developed by the Shanghai Drama Art Center and
the Shanghai Youth Drama Troupe, and funded by the Shanghai
Performance Company.
</P>
<P>
The show was performed in Shanghai. where it received good
reviews. However, its art director, Zhang Xianheng, said the
greatest challenge is to please the critics and audience members
in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to the drama's profound meaning, the
production has an unusually grand scale. The stage properties,
including some terra cottas figures that are 1.7 meters high, will
be shipped to Beijing in four containers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the actors and actresses in the show have won top
awards from the country's leading theatrical organizations, Zhang
added.

<HEADLINE> No Timetable for Yuan's Capital-Account Convertibility: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China does not have a
timetable for making its currency convertible under the capital
account, a spokesman of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said here today.
</P>
<P>
Making the Renminbi yuan freely convertible, under both the
current and capital accounts, is a long-term goal of China's
reform in its foreign exchange system, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But the achievement of the goal will only be determined by the
central government's macro-control ability, the ability of
enterprises to adapt to the market and the performance of the
macro economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As for when we can make the yuan convertible under the capital
account or even freely convertible, we have not worked out a
specific timetable," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China,
announced earlier this week that as of December 1, China will make
the yuan convertible under the current account by undertaking the
obligations of article eight of the agreement of the International
Monetary Fund, which prohibits, except with IMF approval,
restrictions on payments and transfers for international
transactions, multi-currency practices and discriminatory currency
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The current account includes trade, labor and tourism, as well
as normal short-term banking and credit facilities. The spokesman
said that convertibility will oblige China to remove all
restrictions on enterprises' payments for imports and labor and
services, repayment of the interest of foreign debt, and the
repatriation of profits by foreign business people in China.
</P>
<P>
This will help create a favorable condition for Chinese
enterprises to compete in the world market and for foreign
investment in China and foreign trade with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the yuan becomes convertible under the current account,
China will continue to retain some restrictions on transactions
under the capital account, which includes direct investment,
international loans and securities trading, the spokesman noted.

<HEADLINE> HK GDP Growth Rate for 1996 Estimated at 4.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The overall gross domestic
product (GDP) of Hong Kong for this year will be maintained at 4.7
percent, which is closely in line with the growth rate of last
year, according to official forecasts released today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the forecast of consumer price inflation is lowered
further from 6.8 percent to 6.0 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's overall economic conditions experienced further
improvement in the third quarter, from the setback in the latter
part of last year and early this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the GDP growth rate in real terms
in the third quarter was about 5 to 5.5 percent, up from 3.3
percent in the first quarter and 4.3 percent in the second quarter
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Government Economist Tang Kwong-yiu said today that in the
third quarter consumer demand continued to revive, as evidenced by
the steady pick-up in retail sales. Investment demand also
continued to grow, albeit at a relatively less rapid rate than in
the preceding two quarters. Meanwhile, inventory accumulation in
the local economy was lowered to a more normal level.
</P>
<P>
He said that the growth in exports of goods in the first nine
months of this year was considerably slower than that attained
last year, but the dampening effect on overall GDP growth was
offset by the concurrent marked slowdown in imports of goods for
local use, resulting in a further narrowing of the visible trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Labor market conditions continued to improve in recent months,
with the unemployment rate falling to 2.6 percent in the third
quarter from 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent in the first two
quarters, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Deposits, Loans, Advances Up in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Statistics issued by the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority here on Friday showed that both
deposits, loans and advances rose in October.
</P>
<P>
The total deposits rose 1.7 percent in October, following a
growth of 0.7 percent in September. The increase was attributable
to a 3.1 percent rise in HK dollar deposits, which outweighed the
slight fall of 0.1 percent in foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
HK dollar deposits recorded notable growth across the board.
Demand deposits expanded further by 2.2 percent in October, having
risen by 9.6 percent in September. Savings and time deposits rose
more rapidly in the month, by 2.3 percent and 3.5 percent
respectively, compared to their respective growth of 0.8 percent
and 1.4 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Total loans and advances displayed a slight grow of 0.1 percent
in October, following a decline of 0.9 percent in September. The
rise reflects a further expansion in domestic credit by 1.0
percent, which more than offset the decline of 0.7 percent in
offshore loans.
</P>
<P>
Of the domestic credit, loans for trade financing fell further
by 0.7 percent, after a decline by 3.7 percent during the
September quarter. On the other hand, other loans for use in Hong
Kong continued to increase by 1.2 percent, fueled by a further
strong growth in mortgage loans.

HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong Provincial
Public Security Bureau (PSB) returned two crime suspects to Hong

total amount of money involved in the two cases is about 6 million
HK dollars (769,000 US dollars).

reached 11.36 billion Patacas (about 1.44 billion US dollars),
down 3.1 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports totaled 11.72 billion Patacas (about 1.48 billion
US dollars), down 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit hit 363 million Patacas (about 45.9 million US
dollars), down 19.2 percent from the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Garments and textile products remained the staple goods for

European Union. The United States bought 39.9 percent of Macao's
exports, while the EU absorbed 33.1 percent. Exports to the

</P>
<P>

But, the imports of raw materials and semi-finished goods rose
2.7 percent in the period.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Changes Approved in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Constitutional changes were
approved overwhelmingly by Algerians to ban religion in politics,
a boost to the government battling Muslim insurgency.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide referendum held Thursday showed that 85.8 percent
of the votes were in favor of and 14.1 percent against the
changes, according to Interior Minister Moustafa Ben Mansour.
</P>
<P>
Mansour told a press conference here Friday that 79 percent of
the 16.4 million registered voters cast their ballots and of the
12.7 million valid votes, 10.9 million were in favor and 1.8
million against the constitutional revisions.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the high turnout as a show of "enthusiasm and
freedom."
</P>
<P>
The referendum, held in tightened security measures, endorsed a
ban on political parties based on religion, language and
regionalism.
</P>
<P>
It was known that the country's Berber community has long
struggled for official recognition of its language.

<P>
The government said that the constitutional changes were aimed
at maintaining stability in the North African country after an
Islamic insurgency killed more than 60,000 people in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitutional revisions, a new chamber of parliament
will be set up, with one-third of its members to be appointed by
President Liamine Zeroual and the rest chosen by elected local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The referendum took place amid waves of violence which claimed
about 250 lives in the Algiers region in seven weeks. However, No
violence was reported at the time of polling.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened to secure a smooth polling.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Xerox has increased its
investment by 50 million US dollars in China's inland areas and
Hong Kong this year and become one of the leading suppliers of
document products in this region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference to promote its new digital
publishing system, Kim Kuen Chang, president of Xerox of Shanghai
Ltd., said that Xerox has set up nine branch offices on China's
inland areas and Hong Kong, and will further increase the
expansion in the future.
</P>
<P>
The business income of Xerox in the region are expected to hit
one billion US dollars annually, and the number of employees will
exceed 5,000, compared to the present 1,500.
</P>
<P>
Xerox has conducted business in China for seven years,
establishing joint ventures in Wuhan, Suzhou and Shanghai, which
specialize in the manufacturing of Xerox and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong alone, Xerox's revenues doubled over the past
seven years, registering 88 million US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty on
July 1, 1997, will give more impetus to the region's market for
document products. The increase in investment just reflects
Xerox's confidence of the economic potential of the region, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The company's new publishing system, named "DocuTech," is an
integrated publishing system that provides high-speed and
full-resolution digital image capacity.

MOGADISHU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of 53 militiamen of

with them under no clear political agenda," said Araye.

Mohamed Aidid over the defection of the militiamen. Mogadishu has

PARIS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After six days of marathon negotiations between the unions and
the organizations of bosses, the situation appeared deadlocked on
Thursday over the blockade of roads across the country by striking
truckers. The government could submit this morning a draft decree
ordering the bosses to cut working hours for the workers.
</P>
<P>
Gas supply in part of France is rationed today because gas
storing centers was blocked by striking truckers. The strike also
triggered strong protests from neighboring countries whose
trucking industry is seriously harmed by the strike.
</P>
<P>
-- During her visit to Paris early this week, Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga agreed to the idea of
holding a referendum on autonomy for the Tamils to make peace
``with or without the Tigers.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After 12 days of conflict, the strike by the truckers has
turned into a war of attrition. The truckers are still holding
250 blocks on the roads across the country, although a protocol of
compromises should be signed by the two sides this morning. The
unions are asking for the resumption of talks over higher pay and
shorter work week, while their demand for early retirement has
already been met.
</P>
<P>
-- According to Radio Algeria, the primary results of Thursday's
constitutional referendum gave an overwhelming support to the
constitutional reform initiated by President Liamine Zeroual. The
participation rate of the polling was 72 percent, seven points
higher than the presidential election in November 1995.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit in the first 10 months of this year amounted to 19.5
billion U.S. dollars, more than twice the red-ink figure recorded
for the same period last year, according to the Bank of Korea
today.
</P>
<P>
If this trend continues, South Korea's current account deficit
will reach 22 billion U.S. dollars for all of 1996, the central
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ever-growing current account deficit, accounting for
slightly over 4 percent of the gross national product (GNP) in
excess of the country's sustainable level of 2 to 3 percent, could
result in such side-effects as increased foreign debt and
unemployment, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the spiraling current account deficit
mainly to the poor export performance.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of this year, South Korea's exports
totaled 106.47 billion U.S. dollars, while imports amounted to
123.28 billion U.S. dollars, resulting in a deficit of 16.81
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Largely affected by the soaring current account deficit, South
Korea's foreign reserves declined from 32.84 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of September 1996 to 32.23 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of October.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 Rwandan Refugees Out of E. Zaire Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goma, Zaire, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Flocks of Rwandan Hutu
refugees are emerging out of the forests in eastern Zaire's Goma
region on their way back home. The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refrgees put the number at 30,000.
</P>
<P>
This might be the second tide of Rwandan refugees to be
ropatriated after at least 600,000 others crossed the border and
returned home during the last four days.
</P>
<P>
In tattered clothes and apparently hungry and tired, the Hutu
refugees, who fled into Zaire in fear of the Tutsi reprisal after
the 1994 genoaide, are silently walking along the 150 km road
between the towns of Masisi and Sake to the west of Goma city.
</P>
<P>
Some told Xinhua correspondents that they have been walking
for 40 days, many dying on the road from hunger and diseases.
</P>
<P>
They said they were driven from south Kivu's Bukavu region to
north Kivu's Goma region by the war started in October between
the local Banyamulange tribe and the Zairean government troops.
</P>
<P>
But the continued fighting between the Banyamulange forces and
the former Rwandan government soldiers near the refugee camps has
forced some of the frightened refugees back to the forests while
many others moving eastward to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are going home, " said Dores Nyagi, a 30-year old
woman mothering five children, one of whom was born in the forest
during the hiding time.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has said it is preparing to receive the
new tide of refugees, promising there will be no arrest of
suspects without full investigations.
</P>
<P>
"There shouldn't be any panic in Rwanda. The government is
committed to settling the people and then will let the justice
take its course," said Claude, a senior advisor to Vice-president
and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, who led Tutsi troops to victory
in 1994 and took power from the former Hutu government.
</P>
<P>
During the 1994 genocide, about 500,000 Tutsis and moderate
Hutus were killed, whith two million Hutus displaced or turned
refugees as a result.
</P>
<P>
At least half of the 1.2 million Rwandan Hutu refugees located
in the region are believed to have gone back home during the last
four weeks. The situation in eastern Zaire appears to be calming
down amid allegations that the Banyamulange rebels have gained
somewhat control of the region.

how the secret Israeli spy agency, Mossad, operated for 10 years
in Iraq to help the Kurds against the Baghdad regime.
</P>
<P>
The book, Broken Hope, authored by Shlomo Nakdimon and
published by Yediot Aharonot, details the Israeli campaign for
the Kurds between 1963-75.
</P>
<P>
The Mossad agents joined hands with Kurdish rebels in blowing
up oil terminals and seizing a large reservoir as part of an
effort to help the Kurds win independence. The Israeli Air Force
cargo jets flew arms and medical supplies to Iran, and from there
the supplies were transported to the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Nakdimon said the Kurds received such arms as artillery,
mortars, rockets and light weapons.
</P>
<P>
The author says he interviewed 70 people, most of them Mossad
agents and army officers involved in the Kurdish campaign. Some
of them described how the Mossad organized the Kurds into units
that attacked Iraqi troops in the north. A total of 10,000 Iraqi
soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish campaign ended in 1975 when the Shah of Iran
signed an agreement with then-Iraqi Vice President Saddam Hussein
that ended the Kurdish revolt. Kurdish leader Mula Mustafa
Barazani was taken by surprise by the accord.
</P>
<P>
Several days after the accord was singed, Israel evacuated its
agents from northern Iraq and brought them to Iran. The Kurdish
revolt soon collapsed as Iraqi troops routed the Kurds, according
to the book.

<HEADLINE> Late Nigerian Security Chief Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police have
identified the chief security officer of the Lagos international
airport, Sola Omotsola, who was killed in a car bomb recently, as
an anti-government agent.
</P>
<P>
The official "New Nigerian" reported today that investigations
by security operatives on the incident revealed that Omotsola and
his cousin Nelson Kassim, who was also killed in the bomb, were
sabotage agents working for the anti-government National
Democratic Coalition (NADECO) led by Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is rather a shock to the police, who suspected
that the bomb was planted in the chief security officer's car by
a sabotage agent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters yesterday in Lagos, police airport
commander Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar said that Kassim was believed
to carry the bomb on his lap on their way to the airport when it
exploded, tearing himself and the car into pieces.
</P>
<P>
Dring a search of Omotsola's office in their airport, the
police found four detonators already connected, two radio
frequency ignitors, four kilograms of dynamite explosives, a roll
of cellotape used for plastering the bomb and a nine-volt dry
cell battery.
</P>
<P>
The searchers also seized a bag containing Kassim's passport,
computer spare parts and a radio frequency counter.
</P>
<P>
Omotsola's colleagues said he was always conscious of the
security of his office, to the extent that no one had the key to
his office while he was alive, and that his office was never
cleaned without his presence.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said Kassim has been confirmed by security agents as
a computer technologist with vast knowledge in bomb making.
</P>
<P>
Omotsola, 50, has a doctorate in criminlogy. He was a Nigerian
American and was invited to the Lagos airport by Nigerian
authorities in 1984 from the J.F. Kennedy Airport, the United
States, where was a chief security officer.
</P>
<P>
He was killed with his cousin on November 14, when his car
exploded on the way to airport.

<HEADLINE> China Won't Suffer from Debt Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China is unlikely to suffer
from a debt crisis as its foreign exchange reserves head towards
100 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October the reserves had reached a record 98.8
billion US dollars, a senior banking official has pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"China has always adopted a positive, but cautious stance in
utilizing foreign capital," said Yin Jieyan, deputy governor of
the central bank, the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
He added that although China's outstanding foreign debt reached
106.5 billion US dollars at the end of last year, its
debt-servicing ratio, at 7.25 percent, and debt rate of 69.93
percent stood well below international "warning lines" of 20
percent and 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yin Jieyan said that the Chinese government will stick to the
policy of actively introducing foreign capital in the coming 15
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputy governor said China can only open its
capital market in a gradual and steady manner, since the market is
still in its preliminary stage and needs strengthened supervision
and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"China won't give up the overall control on the total amount of
foreign investment, as a precaution against a too speedy growth in
outstanding foreign debt," said Yin, noting that the nation will
also better guide foreign capital to encourage infrastructure and
technical renovations in some enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor added that the central bank has adopted a
foreign investment registration system, and was ready to set up
two special funds for improved control of foreign capital in-flow
and utilization.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank manages the foreign capital on such a
principle: The interests of the investors have to receive proper
protection, and the bank also needs to keep a close eye on the
risks of the flowing foreign capital to prevent any financial
crisis caused by capital flight, or inward rush of hot money,"
explained Yin.
</P>
<P>
China has led all developing countries in amount of foreign
investment in recent years, attracting a total of 229 billion US
dollars in foreign capital by the end of last year.

GUANGZHOU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A number of banks in
Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province, have
got into the business of science loans, demonstrating that
science as an object of investment is beginning to be common in
the city.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, more than 800 million yuan in loans had
been set aside for 741 local science programs, according to
government statistics, and the loans have greatly stimulated local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, loans for science were double what
government investment in the sector, and the municipal science
and technology commission has started to set up finance
organizations to collect funds for scientific and technological
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the municipal science and technology commission set up
the Guangzhou Hi-tech Development and Investment Corporation. To

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Rises to 3.4 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate rose
to 3.4 percent in October, following a 3.3 percent rise for the
previous two months, the Management and Coordination Agency said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate hit a postwar record of
3.5 percent in May and June and started easing in July, Kyodo News
Service quoted the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 0.1 percentage point rise in October was due mainly
to an increase in job seekers, an agency official said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job
offers to job seekers in October improved slightly to a seasonally
adjusted 0.73, following 0.71 in both September and August and
0.72 in July.
</P>
<P>
The ratio means that there were 73 job offers for every 100 job
seekers in October.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the situation a year earlier, job offers
increased 24.3 percent in the manufacturing sector, 23.9 percent
in the transport and telecommunications sector and 23.8 percent in
the services sector, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's employment situation worsened from around 1993, in
widespread corporate streamlining moves stemming from a recession
after the collapse of the asset-inflated "bubble" economy in the
early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Remain High in Kenya: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) expects interest rates to remain high for some time in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The local influencial "Daily Nation" newspaper today quoted
outgoing IMF resident representative Walter Mahler as saying here
on Thursday that so long as the domestic and foreign debt stocks
remain high, the government will continue to offer high yields on
Treasury Bills, thus keeping interest rates high.
</P>
<P>
However, he told a press conference that interest rates are
expected to reduce marginally as a result of an anticipated
weakening of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Reduced activity in the private sector and failure of business
due to the high cost of credit are set to reduce the demand for
credit, leading to lower down interest rates, the IMF official
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank are still concerned by high level
of corruption in the east African country, which would remain at
the top on the Fund's Kenya agenda, according to the IMF
official.
</P>
<P>
"If this (corruption) is eliminated, Kenya can be an African
success story, and could easily register a growth rate of over
5 percent," Mahler pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official hailed Kenyan government's efforts to salvage
a fragile economy particularly in the 1992/93 financial year,
adding that the country's economy has emerged from deteriorating
fiscal and monetary policy, high inflation of over 50 percent, an
almost zero growth rate and a high budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The local monthly "Economic Review" issued by the Central Bank
of Kenya last month said taht the monthly average interbank rate
remained at 18.6 percent in September, 1996, while the lending
rate for commercial banks was at 28.0 percent in August 1996.

<P>
FUZHOU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province, historically vulnerable to floods and typhoons, has
launched a province-wide drive to promote water conservation
projects in the winter-spring period.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has invested 10 billion yuan to
construct new water conservation systems.
</P>
<P>
It has built 2,896 reservoirs with a combined water storage
capacity of 10.2 billion cubic meters, and 215,000 water diversion
projects, which can supply 12.5 billion cubic meters of water for
drinking and irrigation annually.
</P>
<P>
A flood warning system has gone into operation on the Minjiang
River, where embankments with a total length of 992 kilometers
have been reinforced.
</P>
<P>
The goal of transforming 40,000 hectares of medium- and
low-yielding fields will be fulfilled by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1997, governments at prefecture and city levels in
Nanping, Sanming and Longyan, which are frequently hit by serious
natural disasters, will allocate 20 million yuan annually to build
water projects.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Population in 1995 Reaches 125.57 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's population rose 1.6
percent over a five-year period to 125.57 million last year,
marking the lowest growth rate since 1945, Kyodo News Service
quoted the government as reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
A national census released by the Management and Coordination
Agency put the nation's population at 125,570,246 on October 1,
1995.
</P>
<P>
The population of women outstrips men by 63,995,848 to
61,574,398, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6 percent growth rate, the lowest since the end of World
War II, reflects a continuing downtrend in the birth rate, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the 1995 census show the number of people over
the age of 65 increased by 3.37 million in five years to about
18.26 million, accounting for 14.5 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the number of people under the age of 15 dropped
by 2.47 million to 20.01 million, making up 15.9 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 census, 22 prefectures saw the aged outnumbering
the young, indicating the rapid progress of an aging society, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Census is taken every five years in Japan since 1920.

<HEADLINE> Oil Industry Promotes China's Urbanization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's oil industry has
created a string of boom towns - with one time quite villages
transformed into thriving cities.
</P>
<P>
Development of the oil industry has accelerated China's
urbanization process, officials told a conference in Dongying, an
oil town in eastern Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 years ago, Dongying was a village in the vast Yellow
River Delta. With the construction of the Shengli Oilfield nearby,
Dongying has become a coastal open city with complete facilities.
</P>
<P>
The city is now capable of generating 20 billion yuan
(about 2.4 billion US dollars) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
annually.
</P>
<P>
Like Dongying, more than 20 newly rising oil towns have sprung
up from barren fields over the past four decades. Daqing, a
world-class oilfield in northeast China, is one such oil boom town.
</P>
<P>
Construction of every oilfield demands a massive force of
personnel, infrastructure construction, and supplies for daily
life. Oilfields and oil towns depend on each other for joint
development.
</P>
<P>
Since Puyang City was founded, the Zhongyuan Oilfield in
central China's Henan Province has provided personnel, materials,
money, management experience and technology to support the
development of the city.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), investment
in the construction of Puyang reached 1.08 billion yuan, with much
money coming from the Zhongyuan field. Puyang has abundant water
and power supplies, and has been built into the province's first
national-level clean city.
</P>
<P>
Puyang, with complete city functions, is becoming a powerful
base for the Zhongyuan Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, oil towns gain strong momentum by developing
petrochemical, food, building materials and engineering industries.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the State Statistical
Bureau, Daqing, and northwest China city Karamay, have been listed
among the 50 top cities in the country in terms of comprehensive
strength.
</P>
<P>
Oil towns have increasingly become a magnet for foreign
investors. So far, 307 overseas companies have been set up
in Dongying, investing 100 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Building Oilfields out of Yellow River Silt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of tons of silt
carried across China along the Yellow River will help save
billions of yuan in the country's oil exploration drive.
</P>
<P>
The silt will be used as fill to create man-made land off
China's coast, to turn offshore oil drilling into land-based
exploration.
</P>
<P>
Officials have predicted that the move will save around four
billion yuan. And the ready-made fill will be transported free
of charge, courtesy of the country's second longest river.
</P>
<P>
The silt is carried down the river from the Loess Plateau and
will be put to good use, once it reaches the Chinese coast. Over
the next six or seven years the silt will be used to infill up to
100 square kilometers of offshore oil-rich area.
</P>
<P>
The move will turn oil exploitation in offshore areas, believed
to have an estimated 250 million tons of oil reserves, into oil
development on land.
</P>
<P>
Engineers at Shengli Oilfield, China's second largest,
explained that the cost of drilling a one meter depth on land is
just one seventh of that in the sea. An additional 10.35 million
yuan of investment is needed for sinking a 2,500-meter-deep well
at sea.
</P>
<P>
The offshore oil-rich areas are within a zone where changes in
the course of the Yellow River into the sea are taking place, make
oil well exploration very difficult and costly.
</P>
<P>
Important oil production bases for Shengli Oilfield fall well
within the Yellow River estuary area. The frequent changes in the
course of Yellow River into the sea, as a result of silting in the
estuary area of the river, have become a major threat for oil
production in the Shengli Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, China built a canal at the eastern end of the Yellow
River and the course of Yellow River into the sea has remained
unchanged for 20 years, creating a sound environment for
production at the Shengli Oilfield, and obtaining precious
experience for transforming harmful silt into a useful source.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Yellow River carries about one billion
tons of silt from the Loess Plateau in northwest China down to the
estuary area each year, pushing the coastline further forward to
the sea by a third of a kilometer each year. An average of 27 sq
km of land is being created this way each year.
</P>
<P>
The Gudong oil production center of Shengli Oilfield is an oil
production base on land, built on Yellow River silt. The oil
base, now with an annual production capacity of five million tons
of oil, was five meters below the sea 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year relevant departments decided to build
facilities to divert water from the Yellow River into the
newly-found offshore oil-rich areas, accelerating the silting
process. Two months later, water with a large volume of silt in
the Yellow River, started to fill the offshore oil-rich areas -
getting the new land mass well underway.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's consumer prices for
November remain stable, with the index for Tokyo's 23 wards rising
by only 0.1 percent, the Management and Coordination Agency said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The index for November stood at 99.8 against the base of 100
for 1995. The index was unchanged in October and registered a
fall of 0.4 percent in September, Kyodo News Service quoted the
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the previous month, the November index fell 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices keep moving on a stable note, an agency
official said.
</P>
<P>
The marginal rise in November was attributable to price
increases in fresh fruits, up 11.1 percent, tuition, up 1.9
percent, and supplementary education, up 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Such increases offset a fall in prices for household durables
such as air conditioners and other home electrical appliances,
down 5.7 percent, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Currency Devaluates Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar was
exchanged on Thursday at the rate of 700 Tugriks, the Mongolian
currency, a record high registered this year.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that the buying price for the
U.S. dollar was 700 Tugriks while the selling rate stood at 704
Tugriks at noon, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Dollar-Tugrik rate was 1:394 after the Mongolian
government made Tugrik convertible in May 1993 as a step toward
the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The rate remained relatively stable until 1995 when it
surpassed 1:450. The steep rise in the rate in the past few days
was surprising to many Mongolians.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts said that the dramatic devaluation of Tugrik
was caused by the decline of foreign reserves, the fall in the
international market price for copper sands and cashmere, the
government's decision to deregulate the basic prices for fuels and
the growing demand for the U.S. dollars on the market.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Shuts Down 500 Small Pollution Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province has shut down 502 small enterprises that seriously
polluted the environment.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the closures mainly affected small
pollution-causing enterprises, engaged in paper-making,
leather-tanning, gold dressing, oil refining and asbestos
production, with paper-making enterprises using chemical pulp the
chief source of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Inside the province, there are 300 small chemical pulp-making
enterprises which discharge more than 100 million tons of waste
water each year, seriously polluting major rivers in the province.
</P>
<P>
To effectively curb environmental pollution, Fujian provincial
Party Committee, and Fujian Provincial People's Government, held a
special conference on environmental protection and urged different
localities to shut down the small pollution-making enterprises
within a time limit.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental protection departments have also sent teams
to different areas to inspect the implementation of the closure
program.

KAMPALA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Over 500 Zairean refugees
crossed into Uganda on Wednesday, fleeing the Uganda rebels of
the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), who are alleged to be based
inside Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Bury Drivers Below Ground, Says Chinese Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese road construction
expert has come up with a way of beating traffic pollution --
sunken roads.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Renpu not only wants to bring polluting vehicles down to
earth -- he wants them to travel on sunken roads, three meters
below street level.
</P>
<P>
It would enable sound proofing to be fitted and special
extractors to suck away poisonous fumes.
</P>
<P>
Zhu laid down his road plan to an international conference in
the Chinese city of Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
He said he also believes that the idea would ease congestion
by having street level sidewalks for pedestrians, and special
cycle lanes at a slightly lower level.
</P>
<P>
The concept, put forward by Zhu of Beijing Architecture
Engineering Institute, is aimed at building a multi-level
transportation network as an alternative to traditional roadways
where vehicles, cycles, pedestrians and even horse-drawn transport
compete for space.
</P>
<P>
Under Zhu's plan, announced at a recent international
conference on infrastructure construction in Hangzhou, the sunken
roads will be mainly for moving motor vehicles, while routes for
bicycles and pedestrians will still remain at normal surface level
though the cycle lanes will be slightly lower than the pedestrian
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
The idea suggests putting sound-absorbing material onto the
"walls" of the sunken roads to reduce noise pollution, while
building air pumping channels at the bottom of the "walls" to draw
and filter waste gas from motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
He also wants belts of greenery at each level of the roads to
act as natural air cleaners.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan to Use WB Loans to Treat Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan City in central China's
Hubei Province is to utilize 1.25 billion yuan (156 million
U.S. dollars) in World Bank loans to build sewage disposal systems
in next five years.
</P>
<P>
Qian Yunlu, municipal Party Secretary told a Wuhan
environmental protection conference that the city is to build a
number of sewage disposal projects around Donghu Lake, Moshui Lake
and in western part of Hankou area, to make the water of the lakes
and rivers clearer.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is rich in water resources, with water area accounting
for one fourth of its land space. As well as its large and small
lakes, the Yangtze River, the longest river in China, and Hanjiang
River meet in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, about 150 million tons of industrial
waste water, and 500 million tons of domestic waste water, were
directly poured annually into the Yangtze and Hanshui rivers,
which threatened the safety of drinking water for residents along
the banks of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongshun, Director of Wuhan Bureau for Environmental
Protection said by the end of this century, the city will be able
to treat 540,000 tons of waste water daily, basically controlling
the deteriorating river and lake pollution situation in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city will also ban waste water irrigation for farm land by
the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Europe on Bumpy Road to New Security Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the Organization
of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) member countries will
gather here next Tuesday to continue on their bumpy road leading
to a new security mechanism for the entire continent.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, to be held amid heated debates on building
a post-Cold War security framework for Europe, will focus on
proposed plans for expanding the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
It will discuss ways to adjust relations between the United
States and Europe, and between the West and Russia, according to a
document released by Portuguese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda are new criteria for modifying the Treaty on
Reducing Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, coordination of
foreign and defense policies among OSCE members, enhancement of
the awareness of joint security, promotion of democratization, and
a bigger OSCE role in containing regional and ethnical conflicts.
</P>
<P>
At the preparatory meeting beginning Monday, EU members and the
U.S. still appeared to have many differences over the European
security mechanism and the role of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Washington resolutely opposed any proposal and idea that it
deemed potentially weakening the status of NATO, while most of
EU's 15 members regarded the OSCE as an important mechanism and
forum to seek and maintain stability, peace and development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
And Russia so far has made no comments on labeling the OSCE as
the "21st century model of European security."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to the Portuguese press, Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that his country will not change
its stance over NATO's expansion, and will sign no agreements with
the military alliance in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Inside the EU, nations differ in views on the construction of
European security. Britain, for example, has decided not to
support the proposal by most EU members to turn OSCE into the only
pan-European organization for security consulation and cooperation
on an equal footing among European countries, the U.S., Canada,
Russia and other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Initiated from its own strategic interests and for maintaining
its influence in Europe, Britain might take side with the U.S. on
the issue of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming meeting, OSCE leaders are expected to
elaborate their proposals and positions in an effort to reach
understanding, narrow differences, and lay the foundation for
securing Europe's future security through negotiation and
consultation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is widely recognized as a complicated,
difficult and long process to accomplish the "integration of
security of the whole Europe."

<HEADLINE> China's Guizhou Uses Gangue for Electricity Generating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China is to build a large
power plant, the first of its kind in the country to use a
residual bye-product as its fuel.
</P>
<P>
The plant, with a generating capacity of 150,000 kilowatts, is
to be built in southwest China's coal-rich Guizhou Province, and
will burn a waste material known as gangue.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials said that a further five gangue power
plants, with a total installed capacity of 118,500 kilowatts, will
be built in Guizhou over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Gangue has been a source of environmental pollution
and is abandoned as a waste by-product from the coal and mineral
industries. But its use is expected to bring the province
satisfactory economic benefits if properly used in power industry.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that a gangue power plant, with an installed
capacity of 24,000 kilowatts consumes 400,000 tons of of the waste
a year. It can generate 130 million KWH of electricity and save
an equivalent of 200,000 tons of more costly standard coal.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that gangue use will help develop Guizhou's coal
enterprises, most of which are located in mountainous areas.

<HEADLINE> Trading on Bangladesh's Stock Exchanges Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's two stock exchanges
in Dhaka and Chittagong experienced a sluggish business last week
due to lack of active participation by market operators.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, trading on the Chittagong stock exchange
(CSE) in the country's largest port city remained suspended on
Tuesday and Wednesday as the share brokers and their authorized
dealers boycotted the trading floor in protest against the
agitation of the curb market operators.
</P>
<P>
Although business on the floor resumed on Thursday, the
transaction was very thin on the day when only 14 issues were
traded among 109 listed securities.
</P>
<P>
The CSE index slid by 53 points to 1,517.42 at the closing of
the week on Thursday while the market capitalization through the
stock exchange reduced by 250 million tk (5.8 million US dollars)
to 17.68 billion tk (411 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the Dhaka stock exchange (DSE), bear similarly dominated it
last week though the trading slightly improved Saturday. The DSE
all share price index along with volume, value and market
capitalization bitterly experienced a rapid downward trend from
Monday to Thursday and finally all the market indicators closed at
a lower position compared to the previous week's business closing.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the DSE index ended on Thursday at 264.69
points lower than 3,298.04 points of previous week and market
capitalization lost 2.02 billion tk (47 million dollars) during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that market operators mostly refrained from
trading on the floor throughout the last week following untoward
incidents in the curb market in front of the both bourses.
</P>
<P>
Enraged curb market stock players went on the rampage and laid
siege to the CSE building in protest against the sudden falling
prices of shares of most companies on the trading floor on
November 25.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on November 20, at least 10 persons were injured in a
series of clashes that ensued between angry small share investors
and the police in front of the DSE building, which erupted between
some sub-brokers of the DSE and curb market traders over the
selling of shares at a low price.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Singapore Ready For Inaugural WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- With just ten days to go
before the inaugural World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial
Conference starts here, Singapore, while putting final touches on
its preparation work, is all set to greet the expected 4,000
delegates and 1,500 media members from around the world for the
event.
</P>
<P>
Even the smallest detail has not been overlooked by the
organizers of the conference, the largest and most important
meeting ever held in this tiny island country.
</P>
<P>
Ho Meng Kit, managing director of the Economic Development
Board of Singapore, who chairs the co-ordinating committee for the
event, said to the media on Thursday that details such as meeting
all dietary requirements and providing newspapers from the
delegates' home countries had been taken care of.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government is spending 18 million Singapore
dollars (about 13 million US dollars) on the conference, to be
held from December 9 to December 13, while about 3,000 people from
the public and private sectors are involved in planning,
organizing and running the event, he said.
</P>
<P>
One example of the detailed planning was the special
arrangement for the handling of luggage of delegations heads, he
said.
</P>
<P>
People will be cleared through the airport in about 30 minutes,
but luggage may take longer, and may arrive in the hotels an hour
after the delegates have checked in, the organizers noted.
</P>
<P>
"For some people, especially the VIPs, we think that may be an
inconvenience to them," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
The organizers, therefore, worked with the delegations and with
airport staff in Singapore and in the countries where heads of
delegations board the planes in order to make sure that luggage
belonging to delegation heads will be first off the planes.
</P>
<P>
Then, they will be whisked by special vans to the hotels, so
that heads of delegations will receive their luggage before the
rest of their parties.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to make the conference participants really feel at
home, the organizers had also made the arrangement to put
newspapers from their home countries in their hotel rooms and
cars. The Singapore Airlines will bring in the newspapers from the
destinations it flies to.
</P>
<P>
For dietary requirements, there will be local, Western, halal,
vegetarian and kosher food for people attending the three official
functions which Singapore will host, namely, the Welcome Dinner
for the participants on December 9, the dinner given by Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in honor of the Heads of Delegations
on December 11, and the gala closing dinner on December 13.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving into the phase where we try to simulate what
will happen during the actual event and make the final changes as
necessary," Ho said, adding that there will be a full-scale
transportation exercise on December 3 involving cars and coaches
that will ferry delegates during the actual event.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is energized and motivated to give their best shot.
I feel confident that the various agencies will put in their very
best, and we will have a very good show for everybody," Ho said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Reports 0.9 Percent Export Growth in 9 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has
revealed that the country's exports for the first nine months this
year rose less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The disheartening 0.9 percent export growth in the first three
quarters of the year fell far short of the 18 percent growth
projected for this year at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank admitted that the export sector, which is one
of the key pillars of Thailand's economy, could well show no
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement has stunned Thailand's commercial community
and contributed to a plunge of 20.81 points, or 2.2 percent, in
the Stock Exchange of Thailand index on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It had been hoped that the 5.8 percent export growth for the
first half of the year would improve in the second half.
</P>
<P>
However, the export growth, instead of improving, further slid
steadily in the following three months until September, when
exports were down 9.3 percent from the figure of September last
year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank conceded that it was impossible for export to
meet its latest readjusted and much-lowered prediction of 5.5
percent growth for the year, as this would require an average
growth of more than 20 percent per month from October to December.
</P>
<P>
The maximum growth for the year would now be only 0.5 percent,
according to Kleo-Thong Haetrakul, director of the bank's economic
research department.
</P>
<P>
The slump in exports was a structural problem and would take
time to improve, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit sectors were fisheries, agricultural products and
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Ministry has presented a different set
of statistics, putting export growth for the first nine months
this year at 1.6 percent, and 2 percent for this year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Rebels Want Liberated Areas Vacated For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) wants the liberated areas of the north
vacated before peace talks commence, an LTTE leader has announced.
</P>
<P>
In a "Martyrs Day" message released Wednesday from his London
office, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran insisted on the
withdrawal of government troops from the liberated areas to
create a congenial atmosphere for peace talks, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
He described President Chandrika Kumaratunga's recent call for
surrender of arms before talks as "ridiculous as no liberation
movement with self-respect could accept such humiliating
conditions."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We want peace talks to be held in a congenial
environment free from the pressure of military aggression. Our
position is that political negotiations should be preceded by
creating conditions for de-escalation, withdrawal of troops and
establishing normalcy."
</P>
<P>
He explained that he does not believe that Sinhalese
governments committed to repression and military solutions will
resolve the Tamil national problem by peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Calls for African Candidates for Top U.N. Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A visiting top African official
said today that if incumbent United Nations Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali is denied the second term, an alternative
African candidate should be given priority.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), said he does not want to see conflict on the
matter as a U.N. secretary-general has to work with full support
from all the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who is on a visit to France, made the remarks after
meeting a senior official from the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Salim's new statement signaled another break in
the 52-seat OAU's stand that the continent fully backed
Boutros-Ghali for another five-year term. Ethiopia had urged
Africa to present alternative candidates for the job.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Boutros-Ghali of failing to reform the world body,
the U.S. used its veto power last week while the other 14 Security
Council members supported the Egyptian diplomat, whose term ends
on December 31, and threatened it would not support even another
one-year term for the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
But many African nations and France had hoped that by not
putting forward other candidates, the Council at minimum could
negotiate a compromise for a two-year term.
</P>
<P>
Among Africans mentioned as potential candidates are
Under-Secretary-General Kofi Annan of Ghana, who heads
U.N. peacekeeping operations; Amara Essy, foreign minister of the
Ivory Coast; and Hamid Algabid of Niger, secretary-general of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Salim, a Tanzanian national, excluded the possibility that he
would be another candidate.

COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven Sri Lankan
fishermen who were taken into custody by the Indian Coast
Protection Service along with five trawlers have been released

sources.
</P>
<P>
This is the first success of Sri Lanka's efforts to obtain the
release of a total of 75 fishermen currently held in India, the

</P>
<P>
The Indian authorities had taken this decision after

India has taken 75 fishermen and 21 trawlers into custody
recently on charges of entering the Indian waters without
permission.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cuba Tightens Security Around Spanish Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities set up a huge
security operation to seal off the Spanish Embassy in Havana as
crowds gathered outside the building for the third day running.
</P>
<P>
The government said the measures were taken to protect the
embassy and to prevent Cubans seeking asylum from forcing their way
into the building.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso said the Cuban
government is responsible for taking the necessary measures to
guarantee the integrity and inviolability of the embassy of a
country with which it has diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish embassy is now operating normally and without
changes, he added.
</P>
<P>
The embassy became the focus of attention this week after
comments by Spain's ambassador-designate to Cuba Jose Coderch
Planas in a Spanish newspaper that his embassy's door would be
open to "dissidents" whom he would help in any way he could.
</P>
<P>
The comments sparked rumors that special visas would be granted
or issued quickly by the Spanish embassy without having to go
through the normal procedures, and crowds started to gather
outside the building.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Foreign Ministry denied the rumors on Wednesday at the
request of the Spanish diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
Coderch's comments led Cuba to revoke its approval for him to
take up his post in Havana, accusing him of interfering in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest move in a diplomatic spat started in early
November after Spain's Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said on
Spanish television that his government's policy was to lend
support to what it called a "peaceful transition to democracy in
Cuba."
</P>
<P>
However, both sides are now trying to play down the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso was quoted by
Reuter news agency as saying that his ministry had noted Sapin's
statement that it wanted to treat the issue calmly and did not
want to escalate the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The same willingness can be seen" from Cuba, Alfonso told a
regular weekly briefing.
</P>
<P>
Spain ruled Cuba until the Caribbean island waged its first war
of independence in 1868 and became a republic in 1902. It was
Cuba's closet friend in Europe under the former Socialist
government of Prime Minister Felope Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
But last May's general election in Spain swept Conservative
Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, into office. He has taken a much
stronger line against Cuba, cutting Spanish aid to the island,
branding Castro a "dictator" and demanding reforms in the island.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the row, the Cuban Foreign Ministry accused
Spain of becoming a spearhead for U.S. interests against the
Caribbean nation. The U.S., which has operated an international
economic embargo against Cuba for the last 36 years, tightened
sanctions in March this year after the downing of two U.S. planes
allegedly violating Cuban airspace.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Produces 3 Challenges: Alatas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said the current globalization process brings about
three challenges for Indonesia to address.
</P>
<P>
The three challenges were how to encourage fair global trade,
accelerate the development of developing countries' economies and
eradicate poverty, Alatas said on Thursday in Semarang, Central
Java.
</P>
<P>
He said the promotion of development and international economic
cooperation were crucial problems facing the world community, said
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The current globalization process has brought about drastic
changes in the pattern of world trade, production, and monetary
transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The globalization process led to developing countries' products
having wider access to developed countries' market, but it also
had a negative impact on the interests of developing countries,
especially those making little progress in the implementation of
development activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concern that the globalization process would
widen economic disparities between the developed and developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
In fact, global activities in the monetary sector had a fatal
impact on the development of developing countries' capital market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The globalization process tends to sharpen rather than to
lessen imbalanced north-south relations and weaken the developing
countries' position in decision-making on world economic matters,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a concrete action plan to address the negative
impact of the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
To re-build the world economic order, Alatas said it was
necessary to launch new global partnership between rich and poor
countries on a fair profit-sharing basis.
</P>
<P>
He also called for efforts to reactivate the north-south
dialogue which has been at a standstill for the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Economy to Grow 3.5 percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in
Brazil this year will only reach 3.5 percent, half a percentage
point short of the government's target of 4 percent, the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
That means the rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP)
will have fallen for the second year running, down on the 5.8
percent increase in 1994 and the 4.1 percent rise in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's GDP fell 2 percent during the first half of the year

<HEADLINE> Singapore Courts to Come Down Harder on Drug Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore courts will
come down harder on drug users in the future as the Chief Justice
of the country called for heavier punishment for the offenders.
</P>
<P>
A Straits Times report said today that the Chief Justice Yong
Pung How has said that fines and jail sentences of between one and
three months imposed by the Subordinate Courts were
"inappropriate" in cases where the maximum penalty for the offense
is ten years' jail.
</P>
<P>
Consuming drugs is punishable with a maximum of ten years' jail
and a fine of 20,000 Singapore dollars (about 14,300 US dollars)
by the Singapore law.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Yong Pung How said he would issue a directive to
the lower courts on the appropriate sentences for drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
He said this on Thursday after dismissing the appeal of a
26-year-old contract worker who had admitted consuming the drug
Ecstasy at a local disco in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Justice confirmed the sentence of 12 months' jail
meted out to the offender, who had previous convictions for other
offenses, including possession of cannabis.

<HEADLINE> 45 Drug-Using Police Officers Called to Retire in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Forty-five high-ranking
investigative police officers have been called into retirement
because of drug consumption, the Chilean government said today.
</P>
<P>
Jose Joaquin Brunner, Chile's secretary-general of government,
said the officers are not the first being put out of the law
enforcement force due to the drug consumption problem.
</P>
<P>
"An effective policy of control and improvement of the
professional technical standards of the police is being
implemented," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the government institutions, as well as private
sectors, are concerned about drug consumption, because "it touches
all levels of the society."
</P>
<P>
As a standard practice, public and private sectors in Chile do
not permit employees to continue working if they consume drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government earmarked 424 million pesos (over one
million U.S. dollars) this year to prevent drug consumption, since
an estimated 4 percent of the country's labor force regular
consume some kind of drug.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House to Deliberate Constitutional Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives will open discussions on a fresh proposal to amend
the constitution to lift the limits on the terms of all elected
officials, including President Fidel Ramos, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"We will start deliberations to find out if the so-called
initiatives to change the Charter have legal basis," said Pedro
Romualdo, chairman of the lower chamber's Committee on
Constitutional Amendments, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Romualdo said the committee would also discuss three other
proposed amendments to the charter -- a shift to parliamentary
government, elections of senators by regions and return of police
control to local government officials.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarian Jose Zubiri said the new charter change
proposal was forwarded by pro-Ramos forces within the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party, the president's political party. He said Ramos'
supporters wanted to ram through charter amendments immediately
after the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.
</P>
<P>
Romualdo said his committee will start next week a series of
public consultations in the hope that a committee report can be
submitted to the floor for debates.
</P>
<P>
But also on Thursday, Ramos warned any political group against
using his "humble success" of hosting the APEC meeting to revive
plans to extend his term beyond 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I have not authorized anyone to use APEC's humble success as a
means to launch an extension or a new candidacy of the incumbent
president," Ramos was quoted as saying by the Office of the Press
Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, whose six-year term expires in June 1998, has said on
many occasions that he will not run for a second term.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Declares Truce for Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos on Friday declared an unprecedented 60-day unilateral
ceasefire with all rebel groups in the country to allow the people
to celebrate a peaceful Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
The truce, starting from December 1 to January 29, is the
longest unilateral cessation of offensive military operations that
government has declared since 1986, when the first round of peace
talks with the rebels were launched.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of the president's efforts to reconcile with
all insurgent groups before his term expires in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Previous unilateral ceasefires announced by the government
lasted for only 30 to 45 days.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry had earlier recommended the declaration of
a longer truce to convince insurgents about the sincerity of
government's peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Presidential consultant on military affairs Edgardo Batenga
said the ceasefire would not cover normal law enforcement
functions, adding that the government would continue to protect
the people, communities and vital installations.
</P>
<P>
Safe-conduct passes would also be issued to all rebels during
the 60-day ceasefire provided they do not carry firearms,
explosives and other deadly weapons, Batenga said.
</P>
<P>
Manila struck a peace deal with the country's mainstream Muslim
rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), in
September, bringing peace to much of the southern Mindanao island.
</P>
<P>
But the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), an MNLF
splintered group, rejected the peace deal and continued to fight
the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Planned exploratory peace talks between the government and the
MILF have been delayed repeatedly because of renewed fighting
between the two sides in the southern Philippines during the past
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Beside the MILF, the New People's Army and some other small
rebel groups also continued their armed struggles against the
government.

<HEADLINE> First Stage of East-West Gas Pipelines Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia will be able to provide
its gas to Poland and Germany from now on with the connection of
its gas pipelines with those of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The connection was possible after a 107-kilometer gas pipeline
was completed today as the first phase of the construction of the
Polish section of the East-West gas pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin joined his Polish
counterpart Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz today in the western Polish
city of Poznan at a ceremony for the connection.
</P>
<P>
Both of them expressed their satisfaction, and Chernomyrdin
hailed the accomplished work as the beginning of a great project.
</P>
<P>
The East-West pipeline would start from Russia's northern
peninsula of Yamal and go through Poland to reach West Europe.
</P>
<P>
Its Polish section, which would stretch 665 kilometers and cost
about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, was kicked off in the fall of 1995
and was scheduled for completion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
With the pipeline's operation, Russia will be able to supply 67
billion cubic meters of gas to West Europe every year and 14
billion cubic meters to Poland every year.
</P>
<P>
The project was agreed by the governments of Poland and Russia
in August 1993, with the signing of an agreement during
Chernomyrdin's visit to Poland in February 1995.

will retire. If he had totally decided to retire, he would have
said so."

Indurain hinted two months ago he would decide whether to quit

JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas criticized western countries for campaigning for
democratization in other countries and repudiating the principles
of democracy in international relations.
</P>
<P>
"They are campaigning that democracy be integrated into the
development process of developing countries and made a condition
for development cooperation between the developed and developing
nations," Alatas said on Thursday in Semarang, Central Java.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the value of democracy should be forcibly applied
in all countries, reports reaching here today quoted the minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, he said that no single country is entitled to
dictate its concept or ideology on human rights to other
countries, to launch baseless accusations, to teach or judge, let
alone to launch political campaigns using human rights as a
pretext or make it a condition in international economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to him, issues like democratization, human rights,
environment and a good government should be prevented from
becoming a new course of conflict between developed and developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parliament Wants Next Budget to Rise 13 Pc </HEADLINE>

<P>
JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives' Budget Commission Thursday proposed raising the
1997/98 budget by 13 percent on this year's budget to 102 trillion
rupiahs (43.1 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The commission, at the conclusion of its three-day hearing with
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad, also approved the
government's budget accounts for the first half of the 1996/97
fiscal year, which will end next March, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The government's accounts for the April-September period show a
surplus of 700 billion rupiahs (295.9 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The commission endorsed the government's projected 100 rupiah
(43.5 million dollar) surplus for the second half of the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said earlier that although the budget followed
balanced-budget principles the government would do its best to
produce a surplus every year to reduce its dependence on foreign
loans.
</P>
<P>
"In the current era of globalization, where the roles of
investment banks, mutual funds and fund managers are getting more
dominant than government's, it is very important for us -- the
government -- to produce budget surpluses," the minister said.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil lost 12 billion
U.S. dollars in tourism revenues between 1986 and 1995 due to a
fall in the number of foreign tourists, a tourism association said.
</P>
<P>
Two million overseas tourists visited Brazil last year, only a
little more than the 1.9 million in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The worst year of that "lost decade" was 1990, when tourist
arrivals dropped by one million, a survey by the Brazilian
Association of Travel Agencies showed.
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro, the nation's biggest sea port and commercial
center, has been the favorite of tourists, receiving 42 percent of
the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Although the tourists constantly complain about the lack of
special signs for tourists and the untidiness of urban areas, 89
percent of visitors said they would revisit Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tourists come from Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay,
Brazil's partners in the Southern American Common Market
(Mercosur), the biggest trade bloc in the region.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that there are 10,000 hostelry
installations in Brazil, with a total of 300,000 hotel rooms, and
the hotel network earned 2 billion dollars in gross income in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is ranked among the world's top 10 countries earning
biggest tourism revenues.

<HEADLINE> Central America, Caribbean Ministers Debate Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 19 Central
American and Caribbean countries are meeting in Costa Rica for
talks on political integration.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Naranjo, foreign minister of host nation Costa Rica,
told Xinhua this was a good time for Central America to seek a
political alliance with the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
He said that only through union could small countries such as
theirs achieve relevance and influence in an increasingly
globalized world.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would try to establish a basis for a comprehensive
political alliance that would eventually evolve toward programs of
wider integration in the economy, commerce, tourism.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from five Central American countries and
their counterparts from the 14-member Caribbean Community
(Caricom) hope to set a common agenda and improve relations.
</P>
<P>
Despite their geographical proximity, Central America and
the Caribbean haven't enjoyed close relations, mainly due to
different cultures and traditions.
</P>
<P>
Relations have been strained since the early 1990s due to
conflicts between the two sides' banana-producing countries over
preferential access to European markets granted to former colonies
of certain European countries.
</P>
<P>
Some Caribbean countries are highly dependent on banana exports
to the European Union which has granted these countries, mainly
former colonies, preferential access to the EU market to protect
their economies.
</P>
<P>
The EU has assigned quotas to Central American banana exporters
which restricts their access to the market and has caused tension
between countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Naranjo and Jamaican Foreign Minister Seymour
Mullings, tried to play down the conflict in their inaugural
speeches and emphasized the efforts at rapprochement made by both
regions.
</P>
<P>
Mullings said the meeting offered an ideal opportunity to
discuss common interests and define priorities to guide future
relations.
</P>
<P>
The region had many important problems to solve, such as
poverty, the degradation of the environment, drugs and arms
trafficking which are a threat to society.

<HEADLINE> New Bases Planned to Boost China's Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Twenty Chinese commercial
grain production bases slated to open within five years will
increase commercial grain production by five million tons.
</P>
<P>
The production bases will require an initial investment of 2.13
billion yuan (about 256.6 million US dollars), today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the 20 bases are expected to increase grain output by
10 million tons, half of which will be slated for market sale,
significantly stabilizing China's grain supply, the newspaper
quoted an official with the State Planning Commission (SPC) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 10 million tons represent about 30 percent of the increase
to meet the country's grain goal for 2000, said Le Dacheng, deputy
director of the Department of Rural Economy under SPC.
</P>
<P>
As opposed to previous county grain base efforts, this plan is
guaranteed by a one-billion-yuan (about 120 million US dollars)
state investment. And local governments will contribute the 1.13
billion yuan balance.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said seven prefectural-level bases will be in
northeast China's Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. The others
will be in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, Anhui
and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the bases are expected to produce a
total of 90 million tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to build water conservancy projects,
breed fine grain varieties, improve low-yield lands and and
upgrade agricultural machinery, it said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Pay Russia Overdue Debts With Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine wants to pay part of its
overdue debts to Russia in strategic bomber planes, Ukrainian
Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk said today.
</P>
<P>
The bombers could also be exchanged for spare parts for
Ukraine's other military aircraft, Kuzmuk said after returning
from a two-day visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Igor Rodionov about
the barter, Kuzmuk said such a deal would be reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has to spend about one million U.S. dollars a year to
maintain just one TU-160 bomber, Kuzmuk told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The country wants to send 19 TU-160 and TU-95 planes to
Russia. Kuzmuk said the bombers are in good condition and the
exchange would be of mutual benefit to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ukraine and Russia signed an agreement on
re-scheduling some of Ukraine's debts accumulated under the days
of the former Soviet Union. Russia allowed Ukraine to defer
repayment of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars of debt for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also signed a deal with the Russian gas company
Gasprom, under which repayment of 1.4 billion dollars of Ukrainian
debt will be deferred for 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Sandinista Front Nominates Assembly President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Sandinista presidential
candidate Daniel Ortega has said that his party has nominated
Enrique Sanchez Herdocia, a disident from the Liberal Alliance, as
president of the new National Assembly of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, in his capacity as the leader of the Sandinista Front
for National Liberation (SFNL), said Wednesday night that his
party had informed Sanchez of its nomination.
</P>
<P>
It was the SFNL's task to see that the next National Assembly,
the country's top legislature, would move in the direction of
autonomy and independence from the executive power, said Ortega.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, an elected deputy and president of the Nationalist
Liberal Party, called president-elect Arnoldo Aleman of the
Liberal Alliance a liar and severed relations with him last week.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez confirmed Wednesday his intention of seeking to be
nominated for the presidency of the legislature, saying he was in
contact with the SFNL, but denying that he or his party was seeking
commitments from the future Sandinista sector of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Aleman, who was elected president on the ticket of the Liberal
Alliance on October 20, had promised to name Sanchez interior
minister in the next cabinet, but said later he would appoint Jose
Antonio Valdivia instead.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the SFNL's nomination, Ortega said the SFNL
must practice an effective opposition to the government of the
Liberal Alliance that will assume power early next year.
</P>
<P>
He has accused Aleman of buying off some deputies to prevent
them from legislating and approving laws that affect the interests
of the Liberal Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, who was defeated by Aleman in the election last month,
has also accused the Liberal Alliance of committing "serious
irregularities" in the vote and demanded a full-scale revision of
the results.
</P>
<P>
Aleman is expected to assume office on January 10 next year.

<HEADLINE> Interest-rate Cut to Drive Consumer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer market can
look forward to a thriving season of prosperity stimulated by
interest-rate cuts and crop harvests, today's "China Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper also indicated that the commodity
sales could reach a total of 2,500 billion yuan (301 billion US
dollars) for 1996 by the end of December, up 20 percent from 1995,
with no slow-down till spring.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade attributed the awakening
consumer market partly to expanded purchasing power as a result of
interest-rate cuts in May and August this year.
</P>
<P>
Another strong push in the consumer market comes from
increasing power in the countryside. The income of farmers will
grow this year as a result of a good harvest, an increased grain
output and rapid development of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, the purchasing power of city residents is limited due
to a slight increase in personal income this year.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the supply of pork, sugar, vegetables, and
industrial commodities will be steady till the coming spring.
</P>
<P>
The government has reinforced sugar reserves to guarantee sugar
supply. The market demand for industrial commodities will grow and
garment sales will increase, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Declares Truce for Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos on Friday declared an unprecedented 60-day unilateral
ceasefire with all rebel groups in the country to allow the people
to celebrate a peaceful Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
The truce, starting from December 1 to January 29, is the
longest unilateral cessation of offensive military operations that
government has declared since 1986, when the first round of peace
talks with the rebels were launched.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of the president's efforts to reconcile with
all insurgent groups before his term expires in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Previous unilateral ceasefires announced by the government
lasted for only 30 to 45 days.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry had earlier recommended the declaration of
a longer truce to convince insurgents about the sincerity of
government's peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Presidential consultant on military affairs Edgardo Batenga
said the ceasefire would not cover normal law enforcement
functions, adding that the government would continue to protect
the people, communities and vital installations.
</P>
<P>
Safe-conduct passes would also be issued to all rebels during
the 60-day ceasefire provided they do not carry firearms,
explosives and other deadly weapons, Batenga said.
</P>
<P>
Manila struck a peace deal with the country's mainstream Muslim
rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), in
September, bringing peace to much of the southern Mindanao island.
</P>
<P>
But the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), an MNLF
splintered group, rejected the peace deal and continued to fight
the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Planned exploratory peace talks between the government and the
MILF have been delayed repeatedly because of renewed fighting
between the two sides in the southern Philippines during the past
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Beside the MILF, the New People's Army and some other small
rebel groups also continued their armed struggles against the
government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Congratulates on Conference of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng here
today extended his warm congratulations on the convocation of the
Conference marking the International Day of Solidarity with the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
In his massage of congratulations on the conference, which is
to be held today at the United Nations headquarters in New York,
Li said that since the Middle East Peace Conference held in Madrid
five years ago, Palestine-Israel peace talks have made important
progress thanks to the joint efforts of the two negotiating
parties and the international community.
</P>
<P>
The exercise of self-rule by the Palestinian people in their
own territory represents an important step towards complete
restoration of the lawful national rights to the Palestinian
people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed China's happiness to see this development.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, given the complexity of the Middle
East question, it is still a long way to go before the Palestine
issue, the crux of the Middle East question, can be finally
resolved and the lawful national rights restored to the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The peace-loving people and forces all over the world have for
years given attention and rendered support to the just cause of
the Palestinian people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said he firmly believes that as long as all the parties
concerned abide by the agreements already reached and continue
their negotiations in a pragmatic and flexible manner and on the
basis of the relevant U.N. resolutions, peace that the Middle East
peoples have longed for will finally come and the sacred goal of
restoring the lawful rights to the Palestinian people will
ultimately be achieved.
</P>
<P>
China has all along sympathized with the Palestinian people's
experience and supported them in their just cause, Li went on to
say.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, continue to make unremitting efforts
together with the international community for continued progress
in the Middle East peace process and for the realization of peace
and development in the Middle East, Li concluded.

<HEADLINE> Russia, DPRK Sign Investment-Protection Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have signed an agreement on
reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Russian Foreign Ministry said the accord was
signed here by Russian Minister for the Economy Yevgeny Yasin and
DPRK's Ambassador to Russia Song Sung Pil on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources held that the agreement "will ensure protection of
the interests of Russian and Korean investors at the international
and legal level, as well as promote the investment cooperation
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The signing of the document was part of a process by the two
sides to revive their economic ties, which had an active character
in the times of the former Soviet Union, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The process began in April this year with a visit to Pyongyang
by a Russian delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly
Ignatenko, which took part in the first meeting of the joint
inter-governmental commission for trade and economic, and science
and technology cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Thursday's signing ceremony, Yasin pointed out that
the agreement would promote the development of bilateral economic
ties.
</P>
<P>
Song Sung Pil said, in his turn, that there are wide areas for
economic cooperation between the two countries, noting that many
projects in DPRK had been built with the help of the technology
from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
At present, trade turnover between Russia and DPRK stood at 100
million U.S. dollars, which neither Moscow nor Pyongyang were
satisfied with, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two have established about 40 joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Introduce Israeli Irrigation Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
one of China's major grain producers, is to introduce an advanced
Israeli irrigation technique to help raise its grain output.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong Farming Machinery Bureau and Shandong Foreign
Investment Service Company have signed a letter of intent with
Israel's EIN-TAL company to promote the technique in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at the Farming Machinery Bureau, the
introduction of a sprinkler irrigation technique from the Israeli
company is expected to increase crop output by 1.5 times, saving
at least 80 percent of irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
Avi Halpert, an expert with the Israeli company, said the
technique is suitable for vegetable and flower growing in green
houses, peanut and cotton growing under plastic sheets, as well as
fruit tree cultivation.
</P>
<P>
He has traveled to Tengzhou City to start the introduction work.
</P>
<P>
Israel has applied for a patent for the irrigation technique in
China, and made experiments in east China's Shanghai City and

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Football Stars' Heart Surgery Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian football star Nwankwo
Kanu Thursday underwent a successful heart surgery in the United
States to correct a heart defect that threatens his football
career, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
Sunmonu Bello-Osagie, an official from the Nigerian
Consul-General in New York who has accompanied Kanu to Cleverland
for the surgery, said the operation lasted four hours and that
everything went well.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-year-old Kanu was the captain of the Nigerian national
team that won the country the first-ever Olympic football gold
medal in Atlanta in August. He also won the 1993 Under-17 World
Cup for Nigeria and the European Champions Cup for Ajax of
Amsterdam in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Olympic Games, he was diagnosed with valvular
insufficiency of the aorta by doctors of his newly-signed Italian
club, Intern Milan.
</P>
<P>
The doctors hold that kanu's football career is over with the
heart defect, but some top American heart Surgeons said the
condition is rectifiable through a quite standard operation.
</P>
<P>
Kanu is expected to recover in eight months.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Coalition Continues Protests in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of the Serbian
opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) continued their rallies
and demonstrations in Belgrade today to protest against the
government for its election fraud.
</P>
<P>
Marching through central city streets, just like in the past
few days, some of the protesters again threw eggs and rotten fruit
at the buildings of the Serbian state radio and television and
newspapers of Politika, Borba and Vecernje Novosti dailies, all
pro-government media.
</P>
<P>
Protesters largely disregarded the appeal of opposition party
Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) leader Vuk Draskovic to refrain
from vandal acts in order to avoid a repetition of Wednesday's
smashing of windows on the Politika and radio and television
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The SPO, together with the Democratic Party (DS) and the Civic
Alliance of Serbia (GSS), forms the Zajedno coalition.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic, DS leader Zoran Djindjic and GSS leader Vesna Pesic
spoke at a rally in downtown Belgrade today, repeating their
rejection of the third round of elections for the city council and
stressing they wanted reform and power in all of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno boycotted the third round of elections for local
authorities held Wednesday, claiming they had won majority in the
second round of elections on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade university students also continued their protests
today, but distanced themselves from the Zajedno coalition.

<HEADLINE> New "Learning Line" to Smash Learning Barriers: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain today announced the
introduction of the first ever free, permanent "learning" helpline
for all adults which will be on air next September.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister James Paice said in a statement, "In the
ever more rapidly changing world of work people have to adapt, to
develop themselves and to keep up to survive."
</P>
<P>
Equally, there are more opportunities to learn, and more ways
of learning, than ever before. Good-quality information exists,
but for some people it is not easy to find the information they
are looking for, "the Learning Line is the first of its kind in
the world," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The helpline will provide advice on job hunting, information on
financing learning and make provision for those with hearing
impairment by offering the service via a minicorn and be available
outside the normal working day for those who are employed,
according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
It will help people find the right course for them, reduce
drop-out and improve success rates, so that more people finish
their courses and gain a qualification, it added.
</P>
<P>
To be effective, the education minister said, "The helpline
must be clearly linked with local information, advice and guidance
services and with providers of education and training
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
The set-up costs of the "Learning Line" in the first year will
be some 4 million pounds (6.4 million U.S. dollars), with a total
investment of 20 million pounds (32 million dollars) over the next
few years, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> US Weapons Arrive in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A train carrying American
weapons delivered to Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation army arrived
this afternoon at the Hadzici station, on the outskirts of
Sarajevo, local TV reports said.
</P>
<P>
The seven-car freight train carried 10 armored personnel
carriers and one main battle tank, which were part of the
8,000-ton weaponry and military equipment being unloaded at the
Croatian port of Ploce from the special chartered ship American
Condor.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of American weapons in Sarajevo also officially
re-opened the freight transportation on the Ploce-Sarajevo
railway, after a five-year disruption by the war.
</P>
<P>
The federation army, the Muslim forces in particular, will
benefit from the 100 million dollars worth of weapons and
expertise provided by the United States under the so-called "Train
and Equip" program.
</P>
<P>
Washington argued that the program was designed to buttress the
Muslim army, which was outgunned during the war, to achieve a
military balance with their arch-rival Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
Also today, a convoy of 15 trucks carrying ammunition unloaded
at Ploce went to a military testing range warehouse near Livno in
southwestern Bosnia, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Reduces Surplus Arms Before Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has fulfilled all
obligations in reducing surplus arms obliged in an agreement on
sub-regional arms control, a Yugoslav official said today.
</P>
<P>
General Radojica Kadijevic, chairman of the Federal Committee
for the Implementation of the Agreement, said his country has met
the requirement a whole month before the deadline from the
inspection and surplus arms reduction plans contained in the first
stage of the agreement on sub-regional arms control reached in
Florence, Italy, last June.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's cooperation with the representatives of the
verification committee of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna and the signatories of the
agreement has been highly praised, Kadijevic said.
</P>
<P>
He said this is a significant contribution to Yugoslavia's
reintegration in the international community.
</P>
<P>
"According to the OSCE, Yugoslavia has contributed
significantly to the strengthening of peace in the region and in
Europe, which is in the spirit of realization of the Dayton peace
accords," the Tanjug news agency quoted Kadijevic as saying.

The committee underscored the need for the OSCE and the
international community to firmly demand that the other
signatories of the Florence agreement consistently and fully
fulfill their obligations, he added.

Croatia, and both entities in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Seeks Coop for Peacekeeping in Great </HEADLINE>

<P>
Goma, Zaire, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Lieutenant-General
Maurice Baril of Canada, who will lead a multinational force to
Zaire, today sought cooperation from Zaire's rebels on the
proposed task force.
</P>
<P>
"There's still an urgent need to send the multinational force
to the region," said the general, who drew the conclusion after
his hour-long meeting with Roland Kabila, leader of eastern
Zaire's rebel force, the Liberation Army of the Congo, and a tour
of the war zone in Minova, 50 km southwest of the eastern city of
Goma.
</P>
<P>
Though he did not elaborate on details of his closed-door
talks with Kabila, who controls eastern Zaire with 6,000 rebels,
Baril indicated he was seeking "a softened stance " from the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The UN has decided that the mandate for the mission would end
on March 31, 1997, and after that, the responsibility would be
passed to an African force.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian general did not say whether the rebel leader had
approved of an international intervention. Earlier, Kabila said
his troops "would fight any intruders."
</P>
<P>
Neither did Baril, who came here today from Kigali, capital of
Rwanda, mention that he had received positive reaction from the
Rwandan government, which had persistently argued that it is not
the military intervention that is needed, but humanitarian
resettlement aid since a half of the 1.2 million Rwandan refugees
has been repatriated voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The western countries, after weeks of endless meetings, at
last agreed that the objective of a multinational force would be
strictly humanitarian and neutrual both politically and
militarily.
</P>
<P>
They had mapped out ways of a low level of assistance to using
security forces as protection, according to the Canadian general.
</P>
<P>
These include continuing current humanitarian asistance to
voluntary repatriation of refugees by providing security forces,
or setting up a multinational headquarters to direct and
coordinate humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
Although the Zairean government has welcomed the U.N.
intervention, the development of the multinational force is
impossible "without the permission from Rwanda's authorities and
the cooperation from the revels in eastern Zaire," said a
diplomat in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Zaire has been the hot spot of Africa since October
when the local Tutsi-dominated Banyamulenge tribe waged a rebel
war against the Zairean government forces in a bid to regain
their denied citizenship.

<HEADLINE> UK to Build Competitive Market in Digital TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
announced proposals on the provision of conditional access
services for digital television.
</P>
<P>
They provided that licensing of conditional access technology
must take place on fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
</P>
<P>
Conditional access is the technology which supports pay
television. Signals are scrambled, and only those consumers who
have a valid contract are authorized to unscramble and view the
chosen programs.
</P>
<P>
Conditional access technology is commonly regarded as a key
gateway between viewers and broadcasters for digital TV.
</P>
<P>
Answering a parliamentary question, President of the Board of
Trade Ian Lang said UK regulations (1996/2185) were brought into
effect on 23 August l996.
</P>
<P>
"The basic approach of these regulations is to ensure all
broadcasters can gain access on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms, to any digital set top boxes which can
receive their signal," he added.
</P>
<P>
They also prohibit anyone granting such a license from
discouraging the manufacturer from including, in the same
equipment, another conditional access system, according to the
president.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the draft regulations, National Heritage
Secretary Virginia Bottomley said, "These final draft regulations
clearly show the government's commitment to a future in which
viewers can look forward to more choice and the industry to
competition based on programming which meets viewers' needs and
interests."

<HEADLINE> Armenian Premier Outlines Market Reform Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The newly-appointed Armenian
Prime Minister, Aren Sarkisian, today outlined the economic reform
program of his cabinet, stressing the need to guarantee stable
economic growth and a rise in living standards.
</P>
<P>
Sarkisian was appointed Armenia's premier on November 4, and
his cabinet was formed five days later.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a program of action, drawn up by his cabinet, at a
session of the parliament, Sarkisian voiced the need to deepen the
market reform in the country, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the government's economic policy is to
guarantee stable economic growth and a rise in living standards,"
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
This requires the promotion of the private sector, a definite
tax policy, the development of a clear structure of government
spending, guarantees of low and predictable inflation, the
development of the most important parts of the infrastructure
(power supplies, the municipal economy, transport,
communications), and the formation of a system of direct social
security, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Sarkisian called for changing the present situation whereby
production has become less profitable than the distribution and
redistribution of goods.
</P>
<P>
A policy of stable economic growth must be adopted in the years
to come, the premier said, adding that the investment climate
should be liberalized, the effectiveness of investments raised, a
skillful and cheap labor force used and an anti-trust policy
pursued.
</P>
<P>
President Levon Ter-Petrosian, who attended the parliament
session, urged the law makers support the economic reform program
of the government.
