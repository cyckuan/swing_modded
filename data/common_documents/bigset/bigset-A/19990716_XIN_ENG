<HEADLINE> Canada Appeals Against WTO ruling on Dairy Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government Thursday
launched a formal appeal against an earlier World Trade
Organization (WTO) ruling over the dairy export subsidy.
</P>
<P>
"Canada believes that its dairy industry pricing practices
conform with WTO rules," Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said at
the launching of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to "work closely with the industry to make a strong
case before the Appellate Body."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canadian International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi
made it clear that the appeal "demonstrates our firm commitment to
Canada's dairy industry."
</P>
<P>
"We have been working closely with the provinces and the
industry to prepare Canada's submission, which we are delivering
to the WTO on July 19," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO decided in March this year that Canada's dairy pricing
system for certain exports to be an export subsidy and demanded
changes be made by Canada in its tariff rate quota for fluid milk.

<HEADLINE> Bush to Forgo Federal Matching Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush said Thursday that he would not accept
federal matching funds for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor, who has raised 37 million dollars in the
first six months of 1999, said that if he accepted the matching
funds, his campaign would have been restricted by spending limits
in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
"After looking at the numbers, cash on hand of 30 million dollars,
I've decided not to accept federal matching funds during the course
of this campaign," Bush said while campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
"You've got limits that constrain a candidate," Bush said. "I
want to be in a position to respond. I want to be in a position to
plan, and I want to be in a position to plan according to need."
</P>
<P>
By forgoing matching funds, Bush will be able to spend as much
as he wants in pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination,
according to the rules of the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
But he will still have to abide by contribution limits of 1,000
dollars per person or 5,000 dollars per political action
committee.
</P>
<P>
With the withdrawal of Representative John Kasich of Ohio
from the presidential campaign and the departure of Senator
Robert C. Smith from the Republican Party, there are still 10
vying for their party's nomination as presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
They are George W. Bush; Senator McCain of Arizona; Elizabeth
Dole, the former president of the Red Cross; former Vice
President Dan Quayle; Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah; Lamar
Alexander, a former education secretary; Steve Forbes, a
multimillionaire publisher; Alan Keyes, a former diplomat; Gary
L. Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council; and
Patrick J Buchanan, the conservative commentator.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises to "Walk With" Israel in Peace Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the White
House Rose Garden, saying the United States "will walk with you"
in search for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"As Israel again walks bravely down the path of peace, America
will walk with you," Clinton said, referring to the historic White
House handshake between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the
late Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
"As we have seen before at this house... what first seems
unlikely -- even impossible -- can actually become reality when
the will for peace is strong," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he would "inject new momentum into the peace process
and to put it back on all tracks."
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to inject new momentum into the peace
process and to put it back on all tracks," he said. "For this we
need American leadership and support all along the way."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States could contribute to the process "more
as a facilitator than as a kind of policeman, judge and arbitrator
at the same time."
</P>
<P>
Barak said Israel would live up to all agreements, including
last October's Wye agreement on Israel's further pullback in the
West Bank. He also promised to pursue agreements with with Syria
and Lebanon, and he said he was prepared to meet with Syrian
President Hafez Assad. "It takes two to tango. I am ready," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Committed to Implementing Peace Pact in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Amama Mbabazi said here Thursday that his country is
committed to implementing the ceasefire agreement in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi, who had been taking part in the whole process of the
negotiations for the agreement, stressed at a press conference
that a kind of mechanism had been established to handle the
security concerns of the DRC and its neighboring countries
including Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The main problem, said Mbabazi, is that the DRC rebels, the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) and the Movement for the
Liberation of Congo (MLC) , were not able to sign the agreement
immediately because of differences between the two factions of
RCD, which differed over who should represent them in signing the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Uganda hopes the rebel groups in DRC would iron out their
differences and sign the agreement as soon as possible in the
interests of peace in DRC and security of its neighbors, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda will not stand by any faction of the Congolese rebels",
Mbabazi said, adding "as I know Rwanda takes the same position
with Uganda".

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebels Violate Ceasefire Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Task Force headquarters in Kinshasa, capital of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said Thursday that the
rebels were not committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
"SADC Task Force Headquarters wishes to announce that while the
 regional and international community are working hard to see that
the war in the DRC comes to an end, it is becoming evident that
the rebels are not committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
"There is total lack of goodwill and commitment on the part of
rebels as evidenced by their failure to sign the Lusaka ceasefire
accord," the Task Force said in a statement released here in the
Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
It said since the ceasefire agreement was signed last Saturday
in Lusaka, Zambia, the rebels had violated the pact.
</P>
<P>
These included rebel attacks on allied forces Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force said it did not initiate any attacks in all
these incidents.
</P>
<P>
"While we uphold the ceasefire agreement, we would like to
warn the rebels that once attacked we shall retaliate with the
means available at our disposal, and they shall be held
responsible for the consequences," said the Task Force.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the battlefield, the rebels and their allies
had already started movements which were beginning to threaten
various main supply routes, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force said efforts to ensure that these routes were
secured would be put in place accordingly, and urged the rebels
and their allies to abide by the Lusaka ceasefire accord.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Supports Modalities of OAU Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said here Thursday
that it supports the modalities of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) framework agreement to solve the Ethio-Eritrean border
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from Algiers, Algeria, Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi told reporters that the just-ended OAU summit had
unanimously endorsed modalities for the implementation of the OAU
framework agreement on the settlement of the dispute between the
two Horn of African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The modalities called on Eritrea to withdraw from all Ethiopian
 territories it has occupied since May 6, 1998, the prime minister
said, adding "we feel that this is a principled and a correct
package".
</P>
<P>
The OAU framework agreement, presented to both Ethiopia and
Eritrea in November 1998, and was accepted by Ethiopia
immediately, calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from all
Ethiopian territories occupied since May 6 of last year.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin told
a press conference here that his country would keep its commitment
to the peaceful resolution of the conflict, and once again called
on the international community to pressurize Eritrea to accept the
OAU modalities without "ifs and buts".
</P>
<P>
The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in early May of
1998 over a disputed stretch of their border. Tens of thousands
of people on both sides have been reportedly killed in the
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Passes 1999 Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 15 (Xinhua) -- After four consecutive days of
debate, Lebanese Parliament Thursday night endorsed the
long-awaited 1999 fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
In the 128-seat parliament, a total of 73 deputies voted for
the bill, which was approved by the cabinet in April, with 42
members against it and 13 others abstaining from voting.
</P>
<P>
The budget pegged revenue for 1999 at 3.2 billion dollars, and
spending at 5.5 billion dollars, higher compared with 2.9 billion
dollars and 5.2 billion dollars respectively for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bill also introduced a whopping 30 percent tax on
alcoholic beverages, tobacco and other non-essential commodities
and increased gosoline prices by 2,000 Lebanese pounds (about 1.3
dollars) per 20 liters.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government is struggling to bring public debt down
from 123 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 98 percent by
2003, and cut the budget deficit to five percent of GDP from its
current 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 MPs had asked to address the house in the
debate which was televised live by Beirut's six state-run and
private networks.
</P>
<P>
Many MPs exploited the discussion of budget to unleash a
vast range of attacks against the government of Salim Hoss
in order to please public opinion in the run-up to next
year's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
But observers had predicted that the budget will finally pass
with a handsome majority because Syria will not allow a
no-confidence vote leading to the domestic political disputes in
advance of the anticipated resumption of the Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
With 35,00 troops stationed in Lebanon as peacekeepers, Syria
is the country's undisputed power broker.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Mongolian Friendship In Common Interests, Jiang Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said Thursday that the sound development momentum of
Sino-Mongolian relations demonstrated that the bilateral
friendship complies with the common aspiration and fundamental
interests of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in an address at a banquet given by
Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy in honor of the Chinese
president, who was here on a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Despite some turns and twists in the bilateral relations in
the past, Jiang said that the good-neighborly friendship between
the two countries has remained the mainstream in the long river of
bilateral contacts.
</P>
<P>
Particularly after the 1990s, China-Mongolia ties witnessed
rapid recovery and growth with tangible achievements made in all
sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang especially mentioned the treaty on friendship and
cooperation signed between the two countries in 1994, describing
the document as one that "laid important political and legal basis
" for the healthy growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of the two countries made even more clear
the future direction of Sino-Mongolian relationship during
Bagabandy's successful China visit last December when the two
declared to build up a long-term, stable, healthy, mutually trust
relationship based on good-neighborhood, friendship and
cooperation towards the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The sound development momentum of bilateral ties under the
new situation proves once again the correctness of the good-
neighbor and friendly policy delineated by the two governments and
their leaders and fully demonstrates that the development of China-
Mongolian friendship meets the common aspiration and the
fundamental interests of the two peoples," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The current Sino-Mongolian friendship is hard-earned so it
should be heartily cherished even more, he said, adding that both
countries should draw on experiences and lessons of the past half
century so as to usher in even better future for the bilateral
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the new century is approaching, the two countries should
hold the common mission of advancing the bilateral friendship with
the insight of centurial perspective, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Provided the two countries are unswayed by the capricious
changes in international arena and steadfastly hold the general
direction in the bilateral development, Jiang said, it will reap
more benefits for both countries and their people, thus promoting
prosperity and development of respective nation and binding the
two as good friends and neighbors.

<P>
"Particularly when China initiated the reform and opening-up
drive some 20 years ago, the country made unprecedented progress
in all economic and social undertakings with great improvement in
both comprehensive national power and people's living standards,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are striving to overcome obstacles in the
development path and score greater success in an effort to mark
the 50th anniversary of the founding of new China and the return
of Macao into the motherland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, today's world is still in the middle of
profound changes. "Even though the Cold War has ended, the
international situation is far from tranquil. The cause of peace,
which is keenly pursued and loved by peoples worldwide, still face
new challenges," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As peace lovers, the Chinese and Mongolian peoples should
adhere to each's foreign policy of peace, and together with people
of other countries, make all-out efforts to push forward the
establishment of a new, just and rational international political
and economic order, create a new world with long-lasting peace and
common prosperity, and promote the lofty humanity's cause of peace
and development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
President Bagabandy said in his address that President Jiang's
visit, which was paid on the eve of the new century, is
significant to bring the bilateral ties into the new millennium.
Moreover, the visit is a symbolic tour for it is paid before the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The positive development of bilateral relations in the past
decade "is in the fundamental interests of both countries," he
said, adding that their cooperation witnessed marked expansion
and development in the period.
</P>
<P>
He considered the 1994 treaty played an important role in
developing the bilateral ties under the new situation. During his
previous China visit, both countries also inked several important
documents, including a joint statement in which the two nations
declared the principles for the buildup of the 21st-century-
oriented friendly and cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
He again expressed the belief that Jiang's visit will turn a
new chapter for the growth of bilateral ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian president said that his talks today with Jiang
was carried out in an atmosphere of sincerity, mutual
understanding and mutual respect, adding that he was satisfied
with the results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to make concerted efforts in a bid to further
promote the long-term and steady growth of the friendly bilateral
ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy said that China's stability and development is not
only an important factor to safeguard the peace and security in
the Asia-Pacific region, but also to ensure the peace and security
for the whole world.
</P>
<P>
He in the address also expressed his congratulations to China's
achievements made in its speedy economic development, improvement
of people's life and realization of the country's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of the banquet, Bagabandy and his wife presented
the Mongolian robes to Jiang and his wife. In return, Jiang wrote
a calligraphic work to hail the friendship between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker Killed as Greek Police Storm Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian hijacker armed with a
hand grenade was killed and all five remaining hostages were
unharmed late Thursday when Greek police stormed the bus, which
had been hijacked by the Albanian since Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted a police
officer as saying that the police stormed the bus immediately
after the Albanian had closed his eyes from fatigue.
</P>
<P>
The hand grenade the hijacker was holding exploded outside the
bus, which had been hijacked in Polykastro near the northern Greek
city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The attack came following the failure of the negotiations
between the Greek police and the 28-year-old Albanian hijacker,
Aleksandr Nana, who demanded a ransom of 250 million drachmas
(about 793,650 U.S. dollars) and safe passage to Albania with all
his hostages, six passengers and the bus driver, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, the hostage-taker had released two of
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The intercity bus had been since late Wednesday blocked by
police outside Florina, a some half-hour drive from the border
with neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
This is the second bus-hijacking incident in Greece in less
than two months. On May 29, an Albanian armed with a hand grenade
and assault rifle also hijacked a Greek bus with passengers on
board near Thessaloniki. After being paid a ransom of 50 million
drachmas (about 158,730 dollars), the 24-year-old Albanian forced
the driver to cross over into Albania where he and a Greek hostage
were shot to death by Albanian police.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Urges New N.Irish Peace Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said Thursday he was disappointed Northern Ireland's political
parties had failed to establish a new power-sharing government,
but he urged all sides not to lose heart.
</P>
<P>
"People should not allow themselves to be deflected or
disheartened," Ahern was quoted by a Reuters report filed from
Dublin as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ahern and his British counterpart, Tony Blair, who were leading
architects of the last year's Good Friday agreement, are to meet
next week to prepare the way for a review of the pact aimed at
getting it back on track by September, according to earlier
reports.
</P>
<P>
"The government remains determined that, working closely with
the British government and the parties, a way can and will be
found to implement the agreement in full," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's fragile peace process suffered a heavy blow
Thursday after the main Protestant Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)
refused to sit in a regional government with the Catholic Sinn
Fein without a clear promise to disarm by the Irish Republican
Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
The boycott raised doubts that the landmark peace deal would
ever overcome the issue of whether IRA guerrillas, who waged a
long conflict against British rule of the province, should disarm
before or after an all-party government is up and running.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Ahern said the government believed the
Good Friday agreement remained the only way forward and that he
believed the Northern Irish society wanted to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
"It remains the unalterable objective of the Irish government,
working with the British Government and the Northern Ireland
parties, to see the will of the people in both parts of Ireland
implemented as expressed in the referendums of May 22, 1998,"
Ahern was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister said he regretted the resignation of
top Catholic leader Seamus Mallon as deputy first minister
designate and praised his "tireless work... political skill,
wisdom and integrity." He said he looked forward to Mallon
continuing to play a central role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mallon, one of the province's most respected politicians and
deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, resigned
Thursday, saying the UUP was using the crisis to bleed the peace
process dry.

MAPUTO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Mozambique and
Portugal signed here Thursday an agreement on health cooperation,
under which the latter will provide 12 million U.S. dollars to
assist health development in three Mozambican provinces.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Portuguese Health Minister Maria de Belem Roseira and
her Mozambican counterpart Aurelio Zilhao signed the deal, the

<P>
Roseira said after the signing ceremony that the deal is the

</P>
<P>
However, the visiting minister said an institution made up of
representatives from the two countries will be set up to enhance
transparency and administer the use of the money.
</P>
<P>
The money, according to Zilhao, will be used to expand health
network as well as personnel training in Maputo and Gaza provinces
in the south, and Nampula Province in the north.
</P>
<P>
Roseira arrived here Monday for a four-day visit to Mozambique.
 During her stay, she also visited the health institutions in the

<HEADLINE> EU Asks Members To Show Opinion On GMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Thursday
called on the European Union (EU)'s member states to demonstrate
their concerns over the genetically modified organisms (GMO) since
some EU nations are calling for stopping the GMO approvals.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said its commissioner for the environment,
Ritt Bjerregaard, has written to "the concerned member states to
get a clear picture of their intentions with regard to the
GMO-dossiers these same member states have submitted for
approval."
</P>
<P>
"In particular the commission would be interested in any
intentions to withdraw pending notifications," the executive said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The commission said France supported by some other delegations,
at an environmental meeting on June 24-25, put forward a
declaration calling for a suspension of GMO approvals.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the declaration, Ms. Bjerregaard asked the member
states in question to "indicate the approach your government
intends to adopt to these pending notifications, and to any new
applications which may be received, and what repercussions you
consider will follow. In particular, I would be interested to know
whether and when you intend to consult the notifiers with a view
to withdrawing the notification."
</P>
<P>
The commission believed that France's declaration underlined
the importance that the commission presents rules without delay
for ensuring labeling and traceability of GMO's and derived
products.
</P>
<P>
The commission said Bjerregaard asks member states concerned to
provide full details of their position, and in particular of any
specific changes they may wish to see to a certain decision on GMO
labeling.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive, mainly responsible for proposing and
enforcing legislation, said it agrees fully with the member states
about the need to put in place a more transparent framework and to
restore public and market confidence in GMO.
</P>
<P>
However, the general suspension of new or existing
authorizations does not appear to be a practical way forward; the
commission has a clear legal obligation to pursue the procedures
set out in the relative EU directive.

<HEADLINE> France Telecom to Buy 10 Percent of British Cable TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The French telecommunications
company, France Telecom, will buy 10 percent of the shares of the
British cable TV company NTL with 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The director in charge of finance affairs of France Telecom,
Jean-Louis Vincigerra, said that once allied with France Telecom,
the NTL will be an alternative to the historical operator BT and
paid TV network BSkyB in the fields of paid TV programs, internet
service, advertisement and electronic business.
</P>
<P>
The NTL, which covers the whole territory of the United Kingdom
in cable TV, internet and fixed telephone service, is in the
process of allying with another British cable TV network, the
Cable and Wireless Communications, which will result in a sharing
of half the cable TV market in the UK.
</P>
<P>
The third British cable TV network, the Telewest, could also be
drawn into a future alliance, said France Telecom officials.
</P>
<P>
France Telecom has set up an alliance with Deutsche Telecom in
Germany, but it is very weak in the British telecommunications
market.

<P>
On the bilateral economic cooperation, Jiang Zemin said that
China has always attached importance to developing economic and
trade cooperation with Mongolia on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
As neighboring countries, China and Mongolia enjoy a number of
advantages to develop their economic and trade cooperation, the
Chinese president said, adding that the two countries have broad
cooperative areas and great potentials to tap.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, the cooperation
should be carried out in insightful and realistic ways and in line
with each's realistic conditions, the rules of the market economy
and international practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
To that end, he put forwards five suggestions for the future
cooperation:
</P>
<P>
First, both sides should fully make use of such existing
channels as the mutual visits of leaders between the two countries
and the China-Mongolia Economic, Trade, Scientific and
Technological Cooperative Committee so that the two sides can
promptly push forward and direct their cooperation in macro-
economic level.
</P>
<P>
Second, China is willing to encourage its competent
corporations to invest in Mongolia and expand various cooperation
by clinching wholly-owned or joint ventures in Mongolia. Moreover,
China urged the Mongolian side to improve the investment
environment and guarantee the legal rights of Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
Third, both countries can make use of the other's advantages
for Mongolia has abundant resources and China has technologies and
equipment suitable to the Mongolian needs.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, border trade constitutes an important part of Sino-
Mongolian economic and trade relations. The two sides should
strengthen management in the regard so as to ensure its healthy
and orderly development.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, both side should pay high attention and give full play
to the Beijing-Ulan Bator-Moscow railway, which is a rail line
linking up Asia and Europe continents, in a bid to promote the
development of each's national economy and foreign trade.

BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra reiterated here Thursday that Thailand has
always pursued "one China" policy.

Sukhumbhand said the "two states" theory is against Taiwan's
"one China" stance in the past.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment remain
stable for the first time this year, with 161,100 people seeking
jobs in June.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the unemployment in the first half of 1999, the
Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday the
number of job seekers rose by 3.5 percent, or 5,600 people were
newly unemployed.
</P>
<P>
It also said that since the beginning of the year, the number
of layoffs reached more than 80,000 and the wave of dismissals is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Since the former Likud government introduced a restrictive
economic policy in 1996, the high unemployment rate has become a
serious headache for the country.
</P>
<P>
Before and after the general elections this May, Israel's new
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has repeatedly pledged to find a way to
decrease unemployment effectively.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised that 30,000 new jobs will be created after he
took office.

<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Recent studies by the Iraqi Oil Ministry showed that
there are oil and gas reserves in the western desert areas of
Iraq, the Arabic economic daily Al-Alam Al-Youm on Thursday quoted
Director General of the Iraqi Oil Prospection Co. Ibrahim
Abdul-Karim as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi official did not disclose the volume of the
newly-discovered reserves in an area 300 kilometers northwest of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil reserve hits 112 billion barrels and is the second
largest in the world after Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will soon restore its status as the second largest oil
exporter in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) for the first time since the 1991 Gulf war, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Chief of the Iraqi Industry Federation Adnan
Al-Hamidawi has declared the initiation of 10 share-holding firms
in the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The firms will be engaged in the fields of machine-building ,
auto spare parts, textile, engineering, iron and steel, building
materials, glass and ceramics, the Al-Alam Al-Youm daily on
Thursday quoted Al-Hamidawi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of Iraq's efforts to support the private
industrial sector and set in motion the private factories that
have stopped operation since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials said that over 20,000 factories stopped
operation due to the U.N.-imposed embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Unexpected rainfalls partially have saved the rice
crop in northern Iran from drought.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Agriculture Corporation in Jilan Province
Ismail Nigarsh said that it started raining on Tuesday, thus
saving 25 percent of the rice crop in the province overlooking the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The rains saved 30,000 hectares of rice and irrigated other
55,000 hectares which were threatened by the drought.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,000 hectares of rice were damaged by drought, the
severest in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) said the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) went down by 10.2 percent in 1998
compared to the growth rate of 3.4 percent in 1997 due to the
global economic slump and the oil price decline, the Al-Hayat
daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The primary estimate of the GDP, according to a CBO report,
indicates that the oil sector contribution to the GDP declined by
32 percent while the share of non-oil sectors such as agriculture
and services grew by 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
All the economic sectors of the country were affected by the
oil price slump in the world market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The average price of the Omani crude oil retreated 36 cents to
stand at 11.92 U.S. dollars per barrel in 1998 after it reached
18.82 dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Accord Between Britain, Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
welcomed the agreement Britain and Argentina reached to reduce
tension over the disputed Malvinas Islands.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Thursday the accord
demonstrated "the determination of both Argentina and the United
Kingdom to work cooperatively and constructively to promote the
well-being and stability of the region."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Britain and Argentina agreed on a package of
measures, including lifting of a ban on Argentines visiting the
islands, resumption of direct flights from Chile and cooperation
on fish preservation in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton congratulated British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and Argentine President Carlos Menem on reaching the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The White House spokesman's statement referred the islands to
both the Falklands, which Britain called, and the Malvinas.
</P>
<P>
The pact marked the most significant thaw in relations between
the two nations since they went to war over the islands that
Argentina calls the Malvinas in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Reunification Congress Deputies Criticise Taiwan Leader's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the 6th Trustee
Congress of the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful
Reunification (CCPPR) issued a statement here today condemning the
separatist remarks made recently by Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Lee's remarks reveal his intention to
separate Taiwan from China and that he would be a sinner if he
does not immediately stop traveling down this road.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that his separatist remarks seriously
undermine the cross-straits relations and will affect the
fundamental interests of Taiwan compatriots and that the CCPPR
firmly supports China's national sovereignty and territorial
integrity, adding that there is only one China in the world and
the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China can not be
changed.
</P>
<P>
The CCPPR also held a forum this afternoon. Li Wen, a research
fellow from the China Institute of Contemporary International
Relations, said there that defining cross-straits relations as Lee
did as "state-to-state" is wrong and that Lee's remarks expose his
intention to separate Taiwan from China, which is something the
Chinese people cannot stand.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Remain Unchanged in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department reported
Thursday that consumer prices held steady in June for the second
straight month.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most
closely watched gauge of inflation, was flat in June as it was in
May.
</P>
<P>
The June's showing is the best one on inflation in 13 years,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The last time prices showed no increase for two straight months
was in 1986, when for three consecutive months the CPI actually
fell.
</P>
<P>
The good performance on consumer prices, which followed
Wednesday's report that prices at the wholesale level actually
fell 0.1 percent, was certain to calm fears about inflation that
had been generated when prices at the retail and wholesale level
spiked in April.
</P>
<P>
With inflation pressures now moderating, some economists
believe Fed policy-makers will not increase rates when they meet
again next month.
</P>
<P>
Just as in May, the good showing on consumer prices in June
reflected a big drop in energy costs. Gasoline prices fell a sharp
3.2 percent last month, the most in more than two years. Gasoline
prices were down 2.7 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The big drop in gasoline prices contributed to an overall
decline of 1.2 percent in energy costs, which followed a 1.3
percent drop in May and helped reverse a part of April's huge 6.1
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food prices were unchanged in June, after a 0.4
percent rise the month before. The moderation in food costs came
even though beef prices shot up 1.5 percent, the biggest increase
in more than six years. So the prices were held back by big
declines in prices of pork and fresh vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, price pressures
remained tame as well. The so-called "core rate" of inflation was
up only 0.1 percent in June, the same as May.
</P>
<P>
Also, apparel prices dropped 0.4 percent last month, the fifth
decline this year. Airline fares were down 4.8 percent, the
largest drop in more than three years, while new-car prices fell 0.
3 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges N.Ireland Parties to Keep Trying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
called the collapse of Northern Ireland's peace process a setback
and urged the parties to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the activity of last night is a setback for the
process," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Northern Island ran into an impasse after
Protestant Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble Thursday
rejected a peace plan put forward by leaders of Britain and
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern on July 2 proposed Sinn Fein would be allowed into an
executive for Northern Ireland on July 15 and Sinn Fein's military
wing -- the Irish Republic Army (IRA) will be decommissioned by
May 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, Trimble insists that Sinn Fein should not be allowed
into the government before the IRA is decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. still hopes the parties will keep trying to resolve
their dispute. "I understand that the British government has
ordered a review of the implementation" of the Good Friday accord
reached last year between the parties, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He said President Bill Clinton "believes there is clearly a
mandate among all the people for peace and that the parties need
to stay at this until they find a way to solve their differences."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Claims Rise Sharply Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims for
jobless benefits rose sharply last week to its highest level in a
month, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 310,000 people in this country filed new
claims for unemployment benefits for the week ending July 10, up
by 11,000 from the week before.
</P>
<P>
The increase, after two consecutive declines, left the claims
at their highest point since June 5 when they were at 326,000.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the four-week moving average for claims, which
smooths out week-to-week volatility, also was up to 303,250. That
was the highest level since June 26 when they were at 307,250.
</P>
<P>
Last week's increase was larger than economists had been
expecting, but still kept claims at a level indicating that the
nation's job market remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said Thursday that for the week ending
July 3, 12 states and territories reported declines in jobless
claims, while 39 had increases. The state data lag a week behind
the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest decline in applications for jobless
benefits was Florida, a decrease due to fewer layoffs in the
construction, trade and service industries as well as in
agriculture. And, the state with the biggest increase was
Missouri, an increase officials blamed on layoffs in the
automobile and transportation industries.

<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- France called on the European Union
(EU) Thursday to keep "the biggest vigilance" on British beef
after the EU partially lifted its embargo on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
"The French government stressed the absolute priority which
should be given to the principle of precaution," said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that France wants the EU Commission to make sure about
a good implementation of the commitment made by the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"The French government has taken note of the decision of the EU
Commission authorizing the partial resumption of the exports of
British beef from August 1st, with the indications according to
which all the conditions and guarantees have been met to this
effect," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
France discovered this week two new cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, also called mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission has lifted a three-year embargo on British
beef exports, which was imposed after the outbreak of the mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU maintains its ban on exports of living cows by Britain.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Top Striker Dreams of Being Environmentalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Women's World Cup top striker
Sun Wen said that being an environmentalist is the profession she
favors most after she retires from the national squad.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old striker said in a television interview on
Wednesday that she has dreamed of being an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
"China has not done as well as the United States and the
European countries in environmental protection, and people's
environmental awareness remained to be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to let the Chinese live in an environmental-friendly
space, that is why I want to be an environmentalist," said Sun,
who ties with midfielder Sissi of Brazil atop the scoring with
seven goals.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who now studies the Chinese language at the prestigious
Shanghai Fudan University, was not let down although it needs some
knowledge in the natural science to be an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
"I know it needs the education background in natural science,
but this is still my dream." said Sun, who writes poems often.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who was selected for the FIFA World Cup All-Star lineup,
has been hailed as an all-around great player.
</P>
<P>
"She has such good vision, can find the open spots and get the
ball to her teammates. She is at the top of her game." said
American head coach Tony DiCicco, whose team outshot China 5-4 in
penalty kicks in the final of the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Conference Reaffirms Applicability of Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations conference has
reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Thursday at the end of the
conference, representatives from some 60 countries also reiterated
the need for full respect for the provisions of the convention in
the Palestinian territory. The 1949 pact aims to protect civilians
in times of war.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting was adjourned after about 40 minutes as
the atmosphere in the Middle East was considered "improved" as a
whole, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see Israel actually proceed on its own to
implement the Convention, to stop settlement activities and to
proceed with the peace process," said Nabil Shaath, head of the
Palestinian delegation to the Conference of the High Contracting
Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
By proposing adjournment of the U.N. conference after a token
session, Shaath said Palestinians were giving Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, who took office a week ago, a chance to
revive peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
But the minister of planning and international cooperation in
the Palestinian Authority said that the final consensus statement
included a clause to reconvene the meeting should Israel fail to
uphold the Fourth Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
"And we would like to give the Israeli government an
opportunity to do so. But we would like to maintain this process
as, let's say, a last resort in case the Israeli government
continues with the settlements," he added.

<HEADLINE> Gun Worries Arise From N.Irish Peace Deal Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The breakdown of the Northern
Ireland peace process is ringing alarm bells in the province's
divided Catholic and Protestant communities with renewed fear that
it may signal a return to violence.
</P>
<P>
The worry is that following Thursday's breakdown in last year's
Good Friday peace agreement that silenced most of the guns, the
process has turned down a blind alley leaving the British and
Irish governments with a political firefighting exercise to chart
a way forward.
</P>
<P>
History shows hawks on both sides are always ready to swoop
during a power vacuum when political tempers and emotions rise in
the centuries-old conflict, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
"The chief worry is that, during the period of review, the
parties will re-trench their positions and paramilitaries will
seek to exploit the failure to secure political agreement," The
Belfast Telegraph warned in a front page article Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the signs so far are considered optimistic. A
two-year-old truce by the Irish Republican Army is intact and
security experts say they do not expect the IRA to take up arms
despite political setbacks suffered by its Sinn Fein political
wing.
</P>
<P>
"There is too much invested by the Republican Movement (IRA and
Sinn Fein) in the peace process at the moment. Any violence by the
IRA would undermine political gains by Sinn Fein," Reuters quoted
Tom Brady, security affairs editor of the Irish Independent paper,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They will sit tight," a senior British security official was
quoted as saying about the IRA which halted a bloody onslaught
against rule from London in July 1997 to pave the way for its Sinn
Fein political wing to get a place in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Loyalist" splinter-groups, so-called for their determination
to resist any moves towards unity with Ireland, "are
unpredictable," the British source said.
</P>
<P>
The province's main Protestant Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
which condemns guerrilla violence, has as much political capital
to lose as Sinn Fein if hot-headed rebels turn to the gun.
</P>
<P>
The UUP torpedoed the plans for a power-sharing provincial
government with its demands that the IRA must first hand in its
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Security experts believe the IRA has some 60 tons of armaments,
including 600 assault rifles and three tons of semtex high
explosives, stashed in bunkers in remote areas of the Irish
republic. They also are believed to have caches in Northern
Ireland itself, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
Although Republican supporters have been angered by British
attempts to make concessions to unionists on the thorny issue of
IRA disarmament, no one is talking about going back to war. If the
IRA resumed hostilities it would immediately play into the hands
of unionists who have always been sceptical about the guerrilla
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Crucially too, it would lead to Sinn Fein's immediate expulsion
from the peace process under the terms of the Good Friday
agreement, a Reuters analysis said.
</P>
<P>
There is some concern that while formation of the executive
would have meant sustained pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA for
early disarmament, the collapse of the plan takes the pressure
off.
</P>
<P>
"What we worry about now is one small incident, no matter by
whom, leading to another until everyone is sucked back into
violence," Reuters quoted a politician as saying. "All sides
realize that a vacuum is a combustible, and a sharp strike by any
group runs the risk of starting a contagion."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Say Cox Report Reflects Racial Discrimination (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Qizheng, the director of
China's State Council Information Office, said today at a press
conference that the U.S. Congress's Cox Report was a total
fabrication and that it was tainted with racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain further, Zhao cited one example in the report
where it alleged that China had stolen nuclear secrets from the
United States, because the U.S. has done more than 1,000 nuclear
tests, in reaching its present development level of nuclear
weapons, and China only did some 40 tests.
</P>
<P>
"How could China succeed? It must have stolen the American
nuclear technology, if one follows the report's logic," Zhao said.
"That is to say the Chinese race could not be as smart and
intelligent as the Americans."
</P>
<P>
Without going through the necessary legal process, Mr. Cox
arbitrarily gave names of some Chinese-Amercians in the United
States who were spies or suspected of espionage, Zhao said. "Isn'
t that racial discrimination?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Mongolian Presidents Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin held fruitful talks with Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy here Thursday afternoon, in which the two sides reached
consensus on a number of important issues.
</P>
<P>
After welcoming Jiang's visit on behalf of the Mongolian
government and himself, Bagabandy said his meeting with Jiang
again within one year after he visited China last December was
itself a reflection of the strengthening friendship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang's state visit was significant for it was paid in
the year marking both the 50th anniversary of the forging of the
diplomatic ties between China and Mongolia and the founding of the
People's Republic of China. He believed the visit will make
important contribution to the growth of Mongolia-China
relationship in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described his visit as important for it is aimed to
review the past and face up the future in the bid to push forward
the good-neighborhood, friendship and cooperation between China
and Mongolia well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president first reviewed the growth of the
bilateral ties. During the past half century, he said, good-
neighborly friendship remained the mainstream even though there
had been some turns and twists between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He particular mentioned that the bilateral ties witnessed rapid
development with tangible fruits scored in all sectors during the
past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Politically, leaders of the two countries kept frequent mutual
visits and gradually improved their mutual trust, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the Sino-Mongolian treaty on friendship and
cooperation signed in 1994 laid the political and legal foundation
for the healthy and steady growth of bilateral ties. Also, during
Bagabandy's state visit to China last year, the two sides agreed
to build up long-term, stable, healthy, mutually trust-worthy
China-Mongolia relationship based on good-neighborhood, friendship
and cooperation towards the 21st century, he said, adding that
such relationship clearly delineated the future development
direction.
</P>
<P>
Economically, the mutually beneficial cooperation has seen ever
increasing expansion, he said. Currently, China has become
Mongolia's second largest trading partner and leading investor.
</P>
<P>
In the international arena, Jiang said, the two countries
shared similar and identical views on many issues, and supported
and cooperated with the other effectively, Jiang said, adding that
China is satisfied with the current expanding friendship and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that both sides have sufficient proofs to
believe that the maintenance of the bilateral friendly relations
is not only in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but
also conducive to the peace and development for the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Provided the two countries adhering to the essential
principles of the 1994 treaty and firmly holding the general
development direction, Jiang said, the current relations can reap
more benefits for the two peoples, promote common prosperity, and
bind the two countries as good friends and good neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Also, China will continue to respect Mongolia's independence
and sovereignty, its nuclear-free-region stance and the
development path chosen by the Mongolian people, Jiang said.

<P>
President Jiang Zemin appreciated the friendship policy towards
China pursued by Mongolia and commented positively the Mongolian
decision to give priority to its relations with China and Russia.
As a wise decision, it will politically strengthen mutual trust
and economically reciprocate as well as exert positive impact on
safeguarding the regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also welcomed Mongolia's development of friendly
relations with other countries on the Five Principles of Peace and
Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy said that he fully agreed with Jiang's remarks,
observing that the two countries have enjoyed long-term friendship
with bilateral cooperation diversified and mutual understand and
trust steadily deepened.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that as an important aspect of Mongolia's foreign
policy, Mongolia will strenuously push the good-neighborly
friendship and equal and mutual-trusting cooperation with China on
the basis of the bilateral treaty signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy expressed satisfaction with the smooth development in
all sectors of bilateral cooperation and the willingness that
Mongolia will actively promote the long-term, stable, healthy and
mutual-trusting relations of good-neighborly friendship with China
which looks forward to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia gives priority to developing long-term and stable
friendship with two neighboring countries, namely China and Russia,
while carrying exchanges and cooperation of all kinds with other
countries, Bagabandy said.

WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday welcomed visiting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
the White House Rose Garden, saying the United States "will walk
with you" in search for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"As Israel again walks bravely down the path of peace, America
will walk with you," Clinton said, referring to the historic White
House handshake between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the
late Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
"As we have seen before at this house... what first seems
unlikely -- even impossible -- can actually become reality when
the will for peace is strong," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Barak said he came to Washington "as a
messenger of the people of Israel who have called for change and
renewal."
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to bring about change and renewal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he would "inject new momentum into the peace process
and to put it back on all tracks."
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to inject new momentum into the peace
process and to put it back on all tracks," he said. "For this we
need American leadership and support all along the way."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States could contribute to the process "more
as a facilitator than as a kind of policeman, judge and arbitrator
at the same time."
</P>
<P>
Barak said he hoped his visit will "usher in a new era in the
peace process and further deepen American-Israeli relations."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, referring to the U.S. role in the peace process, said
the United States "has no business trying to prejudge the final
status issues."
</P>
<P>
Barak said Israel would live up to all agreements, including
last October's Wye agreement on Israel's further pullback in the
West Bank. He also promised to pursue agreements with with Syria
and Lebanon, and he said he was prepared to meet with Syrian
President Hafez Assad. "It takes two to tango. I am ready," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges N. Ireland Parties to Keep Trying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday called the collapse of Northern Ireland's peace process a
setback and urged the parties to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
"I share the regret that the people of Ireland and Northern
Ireland feel at the setback in the peace process," Clinton said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Northern Island ran into an impasse after
the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble Thursday
rejected a peace plan put forward by leaders of Britain and
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern on July 2 proposed Sinn Fein would be allowed into an
executive for Northern Ireland on July 15 and Sinn Fein's military
wing -- the Irish Republic Army (IRA) will be decommissioned by
May 2000.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is still optimistic about the future of the process,
saying that "real progress" has been made on all sides toward
fulfilling the solemn commitments in the Good Friday Agreement
signed last year by the parties.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that it is possible to achieve full
implementation of this historic agreement in all its aspects by
next Spring, as contemplated by its terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called upon all the parties involved to "find the way
to get the peace process back on track."
</P>
<P>
The talks broke up because Trimble insists that Sinn Fein
should not be allowed into the government before the IRA is
decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. still hopes the parties will keep trying to resolve
their dispute. "I understand that the British government has
ordered a review of the implementation" of the Good Friday
accord, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "believes there is clearly a mandate among all the
people for peace and that the parties need to stay at this until
they find a way to solve their differences," Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Implement "Emergency Strategy" on War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of Angola's
Council of Ministers decided Thursday at a meeting that the
country will implement an "emergency strategy" to resolve the
problem of war refugees which have reached over 1.7 million in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
A press communique issued here Thursday by the meeting said
given the remarkably reducing relief goods from the international
community, and the limited fund on the part of the government, the
Angolan authorities decided to turn the previous direct relief
into self-relief through production by the refugees themselves.
</P>
<P>
Since July of this year, the government has set aside a special
fund for the purchase of seeds, farm tools and other means of
production and distributed them through credit financing to ensure
the basic needs of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees in the country increased sharply
following the renewed civil war late last year. More than 400,000
refugees were concentrated in Huambo and Kuito cities in central
Angola and Malanje city in the north which have long been besieged
by the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, however, could only come forth with half of
the food aid it promised due to the refugee problem in Kosovo and
worsening security situation in Angola which makes relief work
difficult.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-pledged aid, if materialized, could only meet the
needs of 49 percent of the Angolan refugees, which is far from the
demand termed by the Angolan government as "on the verge of a
humanitarian crisis".

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Manufacturing
production for the three months up to May dropped by 0.6 percent
compared with the previous three months after seasonal adjustment,
Statistics South Africa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said lower manufacturing production was reported by 16 of
the 27 major manufacturing divisions.
</P>
<P>
The lower production was due mainly to decreases in the
machinery, basic chemical, food, metal and non-metallic products,
and furniture divisions.
</P>
<P>
The total number of sales of manufactured products for the
three months to May reflected an increase of 0.8 percent or 703

<HEADLINE> Major U.S. Cities Slow on Y2K Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the 21 big cities
in the United States won't complete work on coping with the Y2K
computer bug until the final quarter of the year, according to a
congressional report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two cities, Dallas and Boston, have finished their preparations
to ensure their computers will continue to function on January 1,
2000. Nine others are expected to be fully ready by September 30,
and 10 cities said they will be ready between October 1 and the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the
investigative arm of Congress, was released at a hearing Thursday
morning of the Senate's special committee on the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The GAO asked the cities to provide information on the Y2K
status of systems supporting such city services as electric power,
water, emergency services, hospitals, transportation and public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
It found that most cities said they have completed work on
city-run transportation and telecommunication systems, but still
have more to do in the areas of water and wastewater treatment
systems, public buildings and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem relates to older computer systems that
recognize only the last two digits of a year and could read the
digits "00" as 1900 rather than 2000. That could cause computer
systems to malfunction or break down, disrupting basic civil
services.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal agencies, at the prodding of Congress and the
White House, are generally thought to be in good shape, but there
is more concern about the efforts state and local governments are
making in fixing computers.
</P>
<P>
The GAO report noted that while most cities won't be totally
prepared until later in the year, many have made substantial
progress.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Builds Road to Slave Town for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is building a
modern asphalt road from its capital Dar es Salaam to Bagamoyo,
known as a slave town in history, in a move to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government, in collaboration with the European
Union (EU), is helping to finance the construction of the road,
according to an EU newsletter released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project will give a considerable economic boost to
Bagamoyo, which has many tourist attractions reflecting different
periods of Tanzania's pre- colonial and colonial history.
</P>
<P>
As a terminal on the coast for Arab trading caravans, Bagamoyo
naturally became a holding depot for slaves brought from the
interior. The fortified house, where slaves were kept before being
led down a tunnel to the sea and the dhows waiting to ship them
across to Zanzibar, still stands.
</P>
<P>
The small town, 70 kilometers from Dar es Salaam, gives the
impression of having slept through the 20th century for lack of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The 40-kilometer stretch, from the cement factory at Wazo Hill
to the roundabout on the outskirts of Bagamoyo, will cost 11.5
billion Tanzanian shillings (about 15.5 million U.S. dollars) to
construct. It will be financed by a grant from the Italian
government, the newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has financed the design and will finance the supervision
of works, costing one billion shillings. Construction should take
two years from May 1999 and preparatory work started at the end of
rainy season, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, repairs to the old and new Bagamoyo roads and the
road that links them in the north of Dar es Salaam, which cost one
billion shillings, are now nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
These roads were damaged during the El Nino rains of late 1997
and early 1998. Potholes have been filled, asphalt re-laid, side
drains have been cleared or newly installed, along with other
repairs to bridges and culverts.
</P>
<P>
Similar repairs are also being carried out on the road between
the Morogoro and Dodoma towns in central Tanzania at a cost of
1.3 billion shillings, according to the report that reviews EU's
efforts in rehabilitating roads in Tanzania this year.
</P>
<P>
Emergency repairs to around 170 kilometers of storm-damaged
trunk road in the northern part of the country are nearing
completion. The work of re- gravelling costs more than one
billion shillings, the newsletter said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign
travellers to South Africa shot up 16 percent to 513,989 in
January compared with the same month last year, Statistics South
Africa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was boosted by an 18.6-percent rise in the number of
 travellers from the rest of Africa, against a 13-percent increase
in overseas visitors, the national statistical bureau said.
</P>
<P>
However, there was often "quite a substantial" month-to-month
variation in tourism figures and longer periods needed to be
examined before trends could be determined, it cautioned.
</P>
<P>
South Africa attracted more than 140,000 overseas travellers in
January, compared with more than 360,000 visitors from Africa.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of all offshore visitors came from Britain, followed
by Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, France, Australia,
Italy and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight percent of African visitors were from Lesotho,
followed by Swaziland and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, nearly 114,000 South Africans returned home
from foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
Statistics South Africa said that more citizens travelled
overseas and in Africa for holidays than for business.
</P>
<P>
Leading destinations were Britain, the United States, Zimbabwe
and Australia.

WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Weather satellite data that
detect warming in the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El
Nino in the Pacific may also give an early warning about an
outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Africa, according to a study by
researchers.
</P>

The study appearing Friday in the journal Science has linked
the warming of Pacific and Indian Ocean waters with increased
rains in Africa and the periodic outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a
mosquito-borne disease that can kill humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland
State of the United States and the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research in Washington analyzed 50 years of weather and medical
data to establish the connection between warm oceans, rains and
the fever.
</P>
<P>
"We discovered a cycle of Rift Valley Fever outbreaks that
appeared to depend on rainfall," said Kenneth Linthicum of Walter
Reed. "There were large outbreaks every seven to 10 years, but the
virus apparently disappears between outbreaks."
</P>
<P>
Assaf Anyamba, a Goddard researcher who uses satellites to
study the oceans, said that East Africa gets more rain during an
El Nino, but that this effect, alone, is not enough to prompt a
fever outbreak.
</P>
<P>
A fever outbreak is more likely to occur when the Indian Ocean
warms at the same time as there is an El Nino, a phenomenon that
includes the warming of Pacific Ocean waters.
</P>
<P>
"When the western equatorial Indian Ocean is similar to the
East Pacific in sea-surface temperature, there will likely be a
large-scale outbreak of Rift Valley Fever," said Anyamba.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said their study suggests that satellite data that
measures sea surface temperature, along with measurements of
vegetation growth in East Africa, could pinpoint areas where Rift
Valley Fever outbreaks are most likely to occur.
</P>
<P>
They said that satellite data could give a two-to-five-month
warning of a Rift Valley Fever outbreak. This would give time to
vaccinate livestock and to treat mosquito habitats with
insecticides that are released upon flooding. This would prevent
the mosquitoes from hatching and, thus, break the cycle of
disease.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko: U.S. Assumes Constructive Position on Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said Thursday that the United States has already
assumed a constructive position on Belarus.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Minsk with Adrian Severin, leader of the
working group for Belarus of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, Lukashenko said
Belarus welcomes the latest contacts with the European
organizations and with the United States, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Such contacts were aimed at preserving peace and stability in
Belarus, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the (U.S.) State Department's individual statements
on Belarus may still be ringing by mere inertia," Lukashenko said,
referring to negative assessments of some of the Belarussian
authorities' moves.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said he would perceive them as "one-time
occurrences" that have nothing to do with the general policy
regarding Belarus, pursued by the European Union and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Minsk's plans to establish good relations with
the West, saying that the statement on the wish to normalize
relations with the West is not "a courtesy to Europe or the United
States."
</P>
<P>
"Neither is it a spontaneous statement," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, U.S. Ambassador to Belarus
Daniel Speckhard welcomed Minsk's efforts to strengthen relations
with the United States and the West.
</P>
<P>
In a press release circulated in Minsk Thursday, Speckhard also
welcomed Lukashenko's plans to establish a dialogue with the
opposition and with the public in general, and his plans to hold
free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the U.S. side welcomes the Belarussian
government's concrete work to establish a constructive dialogue
with the opposition, to lift limitations on the work of
independent media and nongovernmental organizations, and to free
ex-prime minister Mikhail Chigir and other people kept in prison
for political reasons, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Keeps Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB) on
Thursday decided to keep its reference interest rates unchanged
despite the weak euro.
</P>
<P>
After a regular meeting at ECB's headquarters in Frankfurt, the
17-member executive council of the bank issued a short statement,
saying its two leading rates--marginal lending facility and
deposit facility--would stay at 2.5 percent and 1.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
But, the common central bank of 11 European nations indicated a
possible future switch in its rate policy.
</P>
<P>
Wim Duisenberg, chief of the ECB, said a tendency toward
tightening was entering the bank's guideline on monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
With the expectation that the euro-zone economy will pick up
the peace after a weak begin in year 1999, a re-assessment of
European monetary policy might be appropriate, if the currency and
credit growth continue to increase, said Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
The ECB has not changed its leading interest rates since April,
when the bank lowered three main rates by a half percent. During
the following months, the euro kept dropping on international
money market to hit this week's new life-time low at 1.0124 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The euro has lost some 15 percent of its value since it had
been launched this January. Many analysts said it would soon reach
parity with the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent negative performance of euro, Duisenberg
insisted the common European currency had "clear potential for a
stronger external value", a potential neglected by the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
This was because the euro's value was firmly based on internal
price stability, stressed Duisenberg, expecting a further lower
inflation rate in the 11 eurolands despite the increasing energy
price.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Presence in Prevlaka to Extend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Thursday authorized the presence of U.N. military
observers for another six months in the Prevlaka peninsula
disputed by Croatia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously, the council extended the
U.N. mandate until January 15 and called on the parties to resume
discussions for the solution of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), consisting
of 27 military observers, has monitored the demilitarization of
the area since Croatia and Yugoslavia agreed to the U.N. presence
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to extend the observation was put forward by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan who said in his latest report that
the area patrolled by the observers had been relatively calm
during the recent months, except for the period of U.S.-British
air-strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. military observers reported several violations by NATO
military aircraft, manned and unmanned, of the airspace over the
demilitarized zone the U.N. controlled zone in Prevlaka, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav air defense fired on those military aircraft while
"on several occasions, persons in civilian clothers, but
identified as military officers from NATO countries, entered the
U.N. controlled zone without authorization from UNMOP", the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO action led Yugoslavia to postpone talks with Croatia
over the dispute, the report said. Four rounds of talks were held
from September 15, 1998 to March 9, 1999. Both parties have given
their assessment of the status of the negotiations following the
fourth round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, leaving
Prevlaka disputed.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Cyber-Shopping Taken as Next Growth Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's National Economy, one of the
G7 generators, is seeing cyber-shopping as its next opportunity for
growth.
</P>
<P>
A record 688 million Canadian dollars (about 467.84 million U.S.
dollars) was reported to go to online vendors last year, yet only a
trifle of 0.28 percent of the total was netted within the country. The
rest? Said to move into the southern Uncle Sam, whose charisma is
believed to be ranging from a more of web-sites and commodities to a
low of price.
</P>
<P>
The contrast between quick growth and poor harvest makes the
country's economists anxious for improvement. The warning is that
anyone who neglects cyber-shopping as the next wave of business is
bound to be tramped.
</P>
<P>
To be more serious, the appeal sounds like a deadline within six
month, as if the country's business stall would certainly lose unless
something is done to check the trend.
</P>
<P>
The count is a balance of "three out of every five", meaning at
least 60 percent of Canadian cyber-spending would flow south in case
the cyber-system remains what it was in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Challenge to a change for the better is obvious: half of the
top 200 U.S. retailers against a quarter of 200 Canadian counterparts
-- in terms of availability of Internet shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
Yet the catch-up of the cyber-shopping business may be viewed
differently on the other hand. Canadian economists believe the country
has solid foundation for the on-line business explosion.
</P>
<P>
With an increasing number of Canadians embracing the debit card,
the economists even envisage a growth of 1,416 percent in E-commerce
revenues by 2003, when a cyber-income is estimated up to 80.4 billion
Canadian dollars (54.7 billion U.S. dollars), from the far more
insignificant 5.3 billion (about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The pink idea beamed out of the data optimism, where about 10
million Canadians were counted as Internet users in 1998, while the
matter of course momentum could lead to a 23.9 million high out of the
then expected population of 32.5 million.
</P>
<P>
"Shopping on the Internet is clearly catching on with consumers,
and retailers need to keep pace," said the country's Retail Council
President Diane Brisebois at a recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
The president, like all others urging for an integrated
cyber-strategy for Canada, pointed to the significant opportunities to
expand business world wide.

LONDON July 15 (Xinhua) - European stocks closed higher
Thursday on the back of weak inflation suggesting US interest
rates may not have to rise again.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Lauds U.N. Kosovo Mission's Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday voiced its appreciation of the effort by the U.N. Interim
Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), which is in charge of ensuring
the law and order in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the Security
Council, Hasimi Agam of Malaysia, said that "Members of the
Council welcomed the progress achieved in the implementation of
Security Council resolution 1244," adopted on June 10 in
endorsement of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK) and international peacekeepers in Kosovo, known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed their appreciation for the
efforts being undertaken by UNMIK, including the advance work
accomplished by" U.N. Under-Secretary-General Sergio Vieira de
Mello, and his team, who arrived in Kosovo in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
De Mello is currently the acting head of the U.N. mission in
Kosovo, and Bernard Kouchner, the French health minister, is the
newly-appointed head of UNMIK. The latter arrived in Kosovo
Thursday, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council Resolution 1244, UNMIK is designed
to ensure safety and security in the multi-ethnic Kosovo, and
undertake interim civil administration in the province until the
interim autonomous administration is elected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council members called on the
international community to "cooperate in ensuring the full
deployment of UNMIK and KFOR personnel as soon as possible," the
statement said. "They also appealed to all parties in Kosovo to
cooperate with UNMIK and KFOR."
</P>
<P>
The press statement echoed remarks by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who is on an official visit to Slovakia. The U.N.
chief called on nations to do more to aid development in the
Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Italy Welcomes British-Argentinean Agreement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema Thursday viewed British-Argentinean agreement on
Falklands/Malvinas islands in the South Atlantic as "a step of
important progress" towards a peaceful solution to the islands'
disputed sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The flights were halted after the War in 1982 when the then
military junta in Argentina sent in an expeditionary force to
occupy the islands.
</P>
<P>
The force was defeated in ten weeks of fighting which left
1,000 servicemen on both sides dead.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in London Wednesday lifting a ban on
Argentinean citizens visiting the wind-swept group of islands that
Argentina has claimed since 1833.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that this agreement represents important
progress for a peaceful solution of the question of sovereignty
over the South Atlantic islands," said D'Alema, "and for greater
cooperation and comprehension between the two countries, also
within the framework of the EU."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's views were voiced in a letter to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Argentinean President Carlos Menem.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian minister said on Friday
that the economic and trade cooperation between Egypt and Eritrea
"is growing steadily."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili made the remarks
before leaving here for Asmara to inaugurate the first ever fair
of Egyptian products in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, both members of the regional Common Market
of Eastern and Southern Africa, have sealed a number of agreements
on trade and economic cooperation, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Of the agreements, the most important one is that concerning
fishing, which is expected to prevent any future disputes between
the two countries in this respect, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, leading a delegation of officials and
businessmen, is to open on Saturday a week-long fair, which falls
within Egypt's policy to open new markets for its products, the
country's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The fair will display construction material, ceramics,
medicines, chemicals, foodstuffs, ovens, TV sets, auto spare
parts and electronics, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Ambassador in Cairo Mohamed Omar said on Friday that
the two countries are considering formation of a joint committee
of foreign ministers in a bid to boost cooperation, especially in
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Omar called for the opening of maritime lines to link the two
countries in addition to the existing air routes as transport has
become the main obstacle to the growth of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and Eritrea stood at 98 million
Egyptian pounds (28.82 million U.S. dollars) last year. Medicine
was the main goods Eritrea imported from Egypt.

CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian and Belgian archaeologists
have unearthed a cave that dates back to 7000 B.C. near an ancient
Red Sea port, a senior official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Granite axes, knives and hunting tools were found in the
Neolithic-era cave 40 kilometers west of al-Qoseir, said Mohammed
el-Saghir, head of the Egyptian Archaeology Department. However,
he did not specify when the cave was found.
</P>
<P>
Primitive paintings marked the walls, el-Saghir said.
</P>
<P>
"The cave seems to be rich with important evidence of human
life during the stone age," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Another cave found 500 meters away is expected to yield similar
results, el-Saghir said.
</P>
<P>
Until the 10th century, al-Qoseir, 500 kilometers southeast of
Cairo, was the most important port on the Red Sea coast. Egypt is
now planning a major resort in the area.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Says Poverty Still Blights Human Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Poverty continues to blight the
lives of people worldwide, including people in the United States
and other developed nations, according to a report released this
week by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
When judged by the Human Development Index (HDI), which
combines average life expectancy, education, and income, the lives
of people around the world improved from 1975 to 1999, the report
said, but poverty is still pervasive in many countries like Benin,
Nepal, and Niger.
</P>
<P>
But it is not confined to developing countries. In Denmark,
average life expectancy is 76 years, but 13 percent of the
population do not reach the age of 60. In Ireland, 23 percent of
the people are functionally illiterate, and in the United States,
nearly 20 percent of the people have incomes below the national
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
More alarmingly, in the 1990s, reverse human development has
been recorded in 16 countries, largely because of the impact of
HIV/AIDS in southern and eastern Africa and economic stagnation in
sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and the countries of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The top five on the list of countries and regions according to
HDI are Canada, Norway, the United States, Japan and Belgium.
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ranked 24th while
China ranked 98th.
</P>
<P>
The report emphasized that countries do not need unlimited
income to have respectable levels of human development. Socially
sensitive policymaking, instead, is the key factor. Richard Jolly,
the principal coordinator of the report, was quoted as saying that
income is not the sum total of human lives, and that of human
development is deeper and richer than that.
</P>
<P>
Income is only a means to human development, not an end in
itself, he said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Says Internet Widening Gap Among Human Beings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide computer link-up,
the Internet, is helping widen the global gap between the haves
and have-nots and the knows and the know-nots, according to this
year's version of the United Nations Development Program report
that appeared this week.
</P>
<P>
The report has been published annually since 1990. This year's
report says that the gap is widening because access to the
Internet differs widely. The United States, for example, has more
computers than the rest of the world combined, and Bulgaria has
more Internet users than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. South Asia, with 23 percent of the world's
population, has less than one percent of the world's Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the Internet divides the literate from the
illiterate (60 percent of the users in China have a university
degree), men from women (in Brazil, 75 percent of the users are
men), rich from poor (a computer costs the average Bangladeshi
more than eight years of salary, compared with a month's wages for
the average American), young from old (the average British user is
under 30), and urban from rural, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The typical Internet user worldwide is male, below the age of
35, has a university education and high income, is urban based and
English speaking, in other words, the member of a very elite
minority, it says.
</P>
<P>
While the rich countries take advantage of the Internet's
information to help develop their technology and economies, the
needs and concerns of poor countries and poor people, who have
been denied access almost imperceptibly are being left out of the
global conversation, it says.
</P>
<P>
One way to solve this problem the report suggests is to collect
a "bit tax" on data transmitted via the Internet. A tax of one U.S.
cent on every 100 lengthy e-mails would generate well over 70
billion U.S. dollars a year.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and China
are to start negotiations on a bilateral maritime transport
agreement, the European Commission said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body described the talks as a breakthrough in

The two sides have been trying to reach agreement on the basis for

<P>
The Commission said the first technical meeting is expected to
take place before the end of the year in order to clarify scope
and issues for a bilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
The EU and China, the two regional influential powers, also

</P>
<P>

between the EU and China over the last few years and reflects the
fact that we have an overriding common interest in efficient
transport links and open markets."
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased we have taken this step forward," the vice-
president designate of the next five-year term European Commission
said in his written statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Friday afternoon that the world should be a
multi-polar one for no single management pattern can be applicable
universally.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during his meeting with Chairman of the
Mongolian State Great Hural Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world has about 200 countries and 2,500 ethnic
groups. "Every country hopes to realize development amidst
stability while keeping its own features," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorj fully agreed with Jiang's views, saying that the
stability in each region of the world is important.
</P>
<P>
The stability of both Mongolia and China and the stability of
our bilateral ties are also very important for this region and the
world as a whole, according to Gonchigdorj.
</P>
<P>
On his on-going state visit to Mongolia, Jiang said he is
delighted to have such a chance to meet old friends and get
acquaintance with new friends in his first Mongolia tour.
</P>
<P>
Again mentioning that his visit was paid before the 50th
anniversary of the forging of diplomatic ties between China and
Mongolia and the fifth anniversary of the signing of a bilateral
treaty on friendship and cooperation, Jiang extended his gratitude
to the hospitality of the Mongolian people and hoped his visit
could further promote the mutual understanding and trust, as well
as the friendship and cooperation between the two countries and
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorj told Jiang that the inter-parliament contacts
constituted an important part of state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the State Great Hural expanded its relations
with China's National People's Congress (NPC), he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reiterated that China has always attached importance to
its ties with Mongolia, saying that the bilateral friendship has
been deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
When the new century is approaching, China will make concerted
efforts with the Mongolian side to build up an even better China-
Mongolia relationship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and in line with the spirit of the 1994 treaty signed
between the two countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang believed that the exchanges between NPC and the Great
Hural have further deepened the understanding of the two peoples
and enhanced the friendly cooperation between the two legislatures.
</P>
<P>
For that, he gave positive remarks to the efforts made by
Gonchigdorj and the Mongolian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hoped the two sides to carry out ever frequent and
fruitful exchanges in a bid to strengthen and develop the China-
Mongolia good-neighborly friendship.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin Friday invited Mongolian Prime Minister Janlaviin
Narantsatsralt to visit China in October to celebrate the 50th

two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the prime minister in their meeting that the working
visit will definitely push forward the long-term, stable, healthy
and mutually trust China-Mongolia friendship of good-neighborhood,
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Narantsatsralt said one of the key tasks of his government is
to implement the principles set forth in the 1994 China-Mongolia
treaty on friendship and cooperation and the joint statement
signed during Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy's previous
China visit. He also extended his gratitude to the assistance and
help given by the Chinese government whenever Mongolia met
difficulties.
</P>

positive remarks to the prime minister's efforts to adopt a policy
friendly to China and hoped he would play a bigger role in
developing bilateral ties.
</P>

cooperation with China in all fields, particularly in the economic
and trade sector. He also hoped to strengthen consultation and
coordination with China on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China also attaches importance to its economic
and trade exchanges with Mongolia. "I have expounded our positive
attitude in this regard in yesterday's talks with President
Bagabandy and put forward certain suggestions. I hope relevant
departments of both countries would fully discuss the suggestions
and make practical measures in a bid to push forward the
development in the economic and trade cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president believed the China-Mongolia economic and
trade cooperation may enter into a new phase provided the two
countries make concerted efforts.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Remaining Center of Action Against Attempts to Divide China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The eastern China province of
Fujian, which is just opposite the island of Taiwan, will continue
to abide by the basic "one country, two systems" principle as an
essential center for China's peaceful unification.
</P>
<P>
This statement came today at a seminar of the province's Taiwan
Affairs Office and the Taiwan Studies Society of Fujian in Fuzhou,
the provincial capital. Members of the two organizations and those
of the Fujian Academy of Social Sciences participated in the
seminar and criticized Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui for his separatism.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yanjie, a deputy head of the academy's Taiwan Studies
Institute, pointed out that Lee's remark about "two states" was a
new obstacle in the path to peaceful unification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianfeng, a deputy head of the academy's Asia Pacific
Research Institute, said that Lee has seriously damaged the
interests of the people of Taiwan, destabilized the cross-Straits
situation, and jeopardized China's peaceful unification.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiaokang, of the Taiwan Studies Society, said that cross-
Straits economic cooperation should not be affected by political
problems and that exchanges and contacts between people across the
Taiwan Straits should be promoted to jointly develop the culture
of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Weng Zhiguang, an associate research fellow at the academy,
said that as an important base for the peaceful unification of the
motherland, Fujian will continue to carry out the basic principle
of peaceful unification and the "one country, two systems"
principle and that the province is against any malice caused by
the attempt to split China into "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan".

<HEADLINE> Geraniums Prove Pollution Eating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have found
that lemon-scented geraniums can be used to restore a toxic land
patch to a "Garden of Eden", reported "the Globe and Mail" Friday.
</P>
<P>
The familiar flowering plant has an uncanny ability to absorb
metal and organic pollutants which could help detoxify everything
from abandoned gas station sites to old mining lands, the daily
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The geraniums can soak up as much as 3,300 milligrams (mgs) of
Cadmium, 18,700 mgs of lead, 6,400 mgs of nickel and 650 mgs of
copper for every kilogram of plant tissue in two weeks, without
exhibiting any sign of toxic stress.
</P>
<P>
The researchers come to the conclusion after planting the lemon-
scented geraniums in contaminated soil samples in Canada. The
result is that by planting geraniums, the contaminated soil could
be used for farming.
</P>
<P>
This is in sharp contrast with other methods to get rid of
toxic metals in the soil, which can thus be cleaned but left
useless.
</P>
<P>
Metals are a key enemy of plant growth and result in stunted
plants and poor harvests in southeastern United States, Central
and South America, North Africa and parts of India and China, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> New Flood Peak Expected on Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A new flood peak is building on the
Yangtze River as a result of torrential rains in most parts of the
upper and middle reaches.
</P>
<P>
The Wujiang and Jialing rivers and areas around the Three
Gorges and Dongting Lake have all had large amounts of
precipitation since Thursday, according to the Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters caused by torrential rains have already formed in
the Three Gorges area and water levels at monitoring stations
along the main stream of the river have all risen and analysts are
predicting that, by July 20th, the discharge rate could reach 50,
000 cubic meters per second at Yichang in Hubei Province and that
a third peak could form by then.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains are still expected on many areas along the Yangtze
over the next three to five days, which will mean greater pressure
on flood prevention efforts.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentator Says Dividing Motherland Is  Historical Sin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Lee Teng-hui has made himself a
sinner in history by attempting to split the motherland when he
redefined the cross-Straits relations as "state-to-state",
according to a Xinhua commentator.
</P>
<P>
Lee gradually tore off his camouflage and changed his policy
towards the mainland from the "one China" principle. According to
reports from Taiwan, on July 9, he said that the cross-Straits
relations should be "state-to-state or at least special state-to-
state relations".
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua commentator says that Lee was trying to take
advantage of current situation in the United States, where there
has been a series of anti-China farces and he deliberately chose a
German radio station to speak out, hinting that the cross-Straits
relations were like the two Germanys.
</P>
<P>
But Lee's efforts are fruitless, the commentator says, because
relations across the Taiwan Straits have never been like those of
the two Germanys. His devisive remarks also exposed his attempt to
impose his influence on Taiwan's political situation when he
leaves office next year.
</P>
<P>
The cross-Straits relations climate has improved since last
year with the joint effort of the Chinese everywhere, it says,
adding Taiwan compatriots have expressed the hope that cross-
Straits dialogues can continue and they are looking forward to
Wang Daohan's visit to Taiwan later this year.
</P>
<P>
The progress in cross-Straits relations runs against Lee's
original idea, the commentator noted. His remark was designed to
further undermine the 'one-China' principle -- the foundation for
the cross-Straits contacts, dialogues and negotiations -- and to
wreck the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of the country, it goes on, stressing that
separation of China's territorial integrity and sovereignty is not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
There is no way out for Lee's divisiveness and he is doomed to
failure. The commentator cautions Lee's followers to consider the
long-term interests of Taiwan compatriots.

CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's insurance companies have been given three
months to raise their capital to 1.5 million U.S. dollars from the
current 200,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Saidi, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, said
in a circular that the count-down starts from July 28.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that half of Lebanon's 80 insurance companies
may either go bankrupt or sell their portfolios to bigger firms.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's officials said the move was aimed at
streamlining the country's insurance market.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is due to visit
Egypt on July 26, accompanied by a delegation of 50 Turkish
businessmen, in an effort to boost bilateral ties in the fields of
contractor activities, construction and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted President of the Egyptian
Businessmen Association Saeed Tawil as saying that Demirel will
chair on his second day in Egypt a joint conference of Egyptian
and Turkish businessmen, which will also be attended by a number
of officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will examine the prospects of economic, trade and
investment cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A round-table meeting of Egyptian and British
businessmen is due to be held in London on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will send a 30-member delegation to the meeting, to be
led by President of the Egyptian Businessmen Association Saeed
Tawil, the Arab daily "Al Hayat" reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss the issue of investment in Egypt's
Egyptian stock markets and giant projects.

<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia's share market witnessed over the
past week a rise in the number and value of circulating shares,
and a decline in the number of effected transactions.
</P>
<P>
Circulating shares have been subjected to sales operations in
pursuit of definite profits, as a result of the continuing rise in
market price throughout the past two weeks, the Arab daily "Al
Hayat" reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In turn, this development led to some decline in price, though
the market soon overcame that, by virtue of the continuing
improvement in oil prices and by the positive results attained by
most circulating companies during the first half of the current
year.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Warns India Not to Take Peace Efforts as Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday said that Pakistan firmly believes in peaceful
resolution of issues, but warned India not to wrongly construe its
peace efforts as a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
Addressing troops in the Shiok valley, near Line of Control in
Kashmir, Sharif said, "It must be kept in mind that Pakistan ...
is fully capable of defending its territorial integrity. In the
wake of any aggression, we are capable of giving a befitting
reply."
</P>
<P>
Sharif earlier this month managed to make the freedom fighters
begin withdrawing from Kargil where they had been fighting against
the Indian troops for two months, and thus extinguished the fuse
to a possible fourth Indo-Pak war in time.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Pakistan has been able to avert a
catastrophic war, which could have brought vast-scale destruction
and devastation.
</P>
<P>
"I have repeatedly stated that it is easier to start a
conflagration, while it is difficult to remain steadfast to the
commitment of no-war," he said, quoted by the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he stated, Pakistan had been thrust into three
wars with India and "in all these wars, both countries lost
immensely, and gained nothing."
</P>
<P>
Sharif, however, stressed that Pakistanis remain fully alert to
the defense of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, once again, I want to tell any adventurer that our
endeavors for peace must never be construed as a sign of weakness.
We are fully capable of confronting and surmounting any
challenge," he asserted.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of Finance Mallam
Adamu Ciroma is scheduled to launch and introduce into immediate
circulation the Economic Community for West African States
(ECOWAS) Travellers Cheque in capital Abuja on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Tony Ede, said in a
press release Thursday that Nigeria would on that date join 10
other ECOWAS members in issuing and accepting ECOWAS Travellers
Cheque (ETC) as a medium of transaction in the west African
region.
</P>
<P>
The travellers cheque is denominated in five, 10, 20, 50 and
100 West African Unit of Account which is pegged to the Special
Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund and is currently
valued at 1.36 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rate of conversion, the release said, will be published
weekly while the ECOWAS cheque is expected to be used for the
payment of goods and services within the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The idea of introducing a west African travellers cheque was
first muted in early 1987 when the ECOWAS heads of state and
government adopted a Monetary Cooperation Program.
</P>
<P>
At that ECOWAS summit, the heads of state and government
approved the introduction of a sub-regional payment instrument to
facilitate inter- regional trade, tourism and cross-border
transactions as one of the short- term objectives of the monetary
cooperation program.

Statistics show that in the first half this year, retail
commodities prices fell by 3.2 percent from a year earlier, while
per capita income of urban residents grew by only 5.9 percent. The
income of rural residents grew at an even slower rate of 2.1
percent for the period, lagging 5.5 percentage points behind the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that ebbing demand has become an obvious economic
problem reflected in the lack of investment interest in the non-
state sector, lackluster consumption, and decreasing exports and
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets by the non-state sector grew by only
5.7 percent in the first half, far below the national average
growth rate of 15.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the past six months had a year-on-year fall of 4.6
percent to 8.3 billion U.S. dollars, reducing China's trade
surplus to eight billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Actual foreign direct investment totaled 18.6 billion U.S.
dollars in the January-June period, decreasing 9.2 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Ye emphasized, the 7.6-percent growth rate in the
first half is still among the highest in the world. Noting that
the first-half year saw all-round improvement in the industrial
structure and profitability in state-owned enterprises, he said
that the country is confident of achieving this year's economic
growth target.

of the year was 7.6 percent and the annual growth target of seven
percent can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic slowdown of the past six months was
due to a slump in the growth of industrial production, sluggish
sales, and slow agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output grew by nine percent on an year-on-year basis
in the second quarter, 1.1 percentage points lower than that of
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Sales of retail goods grew by only 6.4 percent year-on-year to
147.53 billion yuan in the first half of the year, which was 1.2
percentages points lower than the economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Deflation became increasingly apparent in the January-June
period this year, with retail prices continuing to fall and
personal income growing slowly, Ye said.

<HEADLINE> Congo(K) Main Rebel Group Turns Down Kabila's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD), main rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
has turned down a general amnesty offered early this week by
President Laurent Kabila, saying that Kabila's removal from power
remained its primary objective.
</P>
<P>
"I think Kabila is the one who deserves (to be offered) amnesty
in the first place. We are not criminals to seek amnesty," the
Rwanda News Agency Friday quoted Moise Nyarugabo, vice-president
of the rebel movement, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila should seek forgiveness from the rebels and all
Congolese people.
</P>
<P>
The only way to do so is to quit power and leave the Congolese
in peace,"

Nyarugabo said late Thursday. "We do not need to be forgiven by
him."
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader denied that his movement was responsible for
some of those deaths, saying that his fighters had killed only
Kabila's soldiers on the battle front.
</P>
<P>
Nyarugabo rejected claims by Kabila and his allies that rebels
had launched attacks on several fronts in the northeast and
southeast of the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila and his allies proceeded on a well-known method of
making accusations because that is the best attack," Nyarugabo
said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and the leaders of five other African nations who have
sent troops to fight on either side of the war signed a cease-fire
deal in Zambian capital Lusaka last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nyarugabo said that soon after the cease-fire was signed,
Kabila's troops launched attacks on the rebel-held towns of
Gbadolite, Ikela and Kamitunga in the Equator and eastern regions
of the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Appoint Defense Forces Deputy Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister
General Wiranto Friday confirmed that Admiral Widodo, now the
Indonesian naval chief of staff, is slated to assume the position
of deputy commander of the National Defense Forces (TNI).
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie is scheduled to install Widodo at the
State Palace Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the reinstitution of the TNI deputy commander job
had something to do with the coming general session of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which will elect a new
president and vice president, Wiranto emphatically said: "That is
too far-fetched."
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of professionalism. It has nothing to do with
politics," said Wiranto who is also commander of the TNI.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have it that the creation of the post of deputy TNI
commander is part of the effort to pave the way for Wiranto's
nomination for vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to Wiranto, the appointment of the TNI deputy
commander was meant to step up the military's effectiveness in
safeguarding national integrity and territory.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I proposed that the TNI deputy commander post be
filled by a navy officer," Wiranto said.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Steady Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China's agricultural sector
experienced steady growth momentum in the first half this year,
reaping bumper harvests of summer crops and oil seeds and
increasing output of aquatic and orchard products.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhen, spokesman of the National Bureau of Statistics, told a
press conference here today that primary industries, predominately
agriculture, had a 3-percent growth rate year-on-year during the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that summer grain crops were over five million tons
more than a year earlier, and the output of oil-seeds crops is
expected to increase by more than 1.4 million tons, or 15 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, the Chinese government
increased investment in agriculture and water conservancy by 76.8
percent over a year ago, and the ratio of agricultural investment
to total fixed assets investment increased by 1.5 percentage
points on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye, the rural market saw steady growth during the
period, with retail sales of consumer goods rising by 6.2 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that by the end of May, restructuring of
the crop mix had helped reduce the planting area of cotton by 542,
000 hectares from last year, down to 3.47 million hectares this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the price of pork continued to drop for the past
six months due to an oversupplied market, and explained that the
fluctuation of pork prices is a normal phenomenon of market
competition.

<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a series of new
measures to improve its foreign exchange management with a view to
encouraging exports and the utilization of overseas investment, a
senior foreign exchange official told a national conference which
closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the national conference on foreign exchange,
exports, and overseas investments jointly organized by the

he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rebels Kill 50 Innocent Civilians in C. Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan rebel UNITA troops
killed some 50 innocent women and children at a village in central
Huambo Tuesday, the official Journal of Angola newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted eyewitnesses as saying that at the village of
Sachitembo, troops of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola launched a sudden attack on the market of the village.
</P>
<P>
Many women bringing with them their children were buying and
selling things at the market when the UNITA troops launched
attack. They forced the women and children to gather together,
and then shot with assault rifles in very short distance.
</P>
<P>
After the killing, most of the villagers were forced to flee
into the forest nearby.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA forces have been launching sneak attacks on innocent
people to create a wave of refugees and exert political and social
pressure upon the Angolan government in a bid to delay the
destructive hit from the army, Governor of Huambo Province Paulo
Cassamas said recently.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, the number of refugees in the
provincial city of Huambo has soared up to 230,000 from previously
172,000, the governor noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite constant attacks by the rebels, the Angolan government
troops are controlling the general situation of the country,
another senior official said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Deputy Minister of Defense Armado Cruz Neto disclosed
that the government troops have advanced at several front lines,
citing the successful operation in the town of Sanza Pombo in
northern Uige Province and the central city of Huambo.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government said repeatedly that it would launch a
large- scale offensive during the dry season so as to wipe out the
military forces of the UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN's Future to Be Basic Issue at Ministerial Meeting: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will discuss the
regional grouping's future in next week's ministerial meeting, a
Singapore Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a press conference that no fixed agenda is
arranged for the 32nd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), but the
basic issue is ASEAN's future.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers can be expected to examine fundamental
functions to see whether they need to be modified in light of new
developments.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the foreign ministers will meet without the
presence of other officials to discuss among themselves very
candidly and realistically long-term issues and challenges facing
ASEAN, said the spokesman whose country is chairing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
There are anxieties about ASEAN's future, understandably so
since its largest member Indonesia is preoccupied with internal
problems and the Asian crisis has badly damaged the ASEAN's
reputation and taken some of the gloss off its image, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's expansion with new members at different levels of
economic and political development has also made decision-making
slower, he said.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN is currently in the phase of consolidation," he said.
"We tend to use the AMM meeting to send a signal that ASEAN as a
regional grouping is still nonetheless confident of its future."
</P>
<P>
The 6th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), due to begin after the
ministerial meeting, will discuss issues in two broad areas --
regional and international issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ARF meeting will focus on "security implications of the
regional crisis, security challenges in the region, transnational
issues with security implications and most importantly the future
of ARF," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the Post Ministerial Conferences (PMC) which involves
ASEAN's ten dialogue countries, the focus will be on non-security
transnational issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members will examine the future of PMC in consultation
with dialogue partners, he added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- After a season of stagnant
offense, the NBA stars on Team USA showed Uruguay they can still
run and gun.
</P>
<P>
With a furious fast-break offense and tenacious trapping
defense, Team USA routed Uruguay 118-72, Thursday night in its
opener in the Pre-Olympic qualifying tournament of the Americas in

upset of Cuba on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seattle SuperSonics guard Gary Payton scored 15 of his 20
points in the first half, when Team USA used a 31-0 edge in fast-
break points and a 20-0 advantage in points off turnovers to build
a 62-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Americans shot 66 percent (53-of-80), including a
blistering 80 percent (44-of-55) inside the 3-point arc. They
forced 25 turnovers and made 17 steals.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett scored 20 points
on 10-of-12 shooting and Phoenix Suns guard Jason Kidd handed out
14 assists for Team USA, which has never lost with NBA players in

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit from American Company on Sydney Olympic Bands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- An American company is suing the
Sydney Olympic Games organizers for breach of contract for not
using their bands on the opening ceremony of the Games.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure of a local outcry, the Sydney Olympics
Organizing Committee (SOCOG) changed its mind last month to use
local musicians, instead of recruiting 1,500 U.S. and Japanese
college students to march at the opening.
</P>
<P>
The public forced SOCOG to drop plans to get bands from World
Projects Corp, who had contracted with SOCOG to organize marching
bands.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the U.S. company filed a writ in the New South Wales
state supreme court suing SOCOG and its president Michael Knight.
</P>
<P>
Knight said the court action was provocative and would be
vigorously fought.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Promote Pro-active Financial Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Localities and relevant
departments across China are urged to take immediate steps and
increase efforts to implement the government's pro-active
financial policy in a move to expand domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The call came at a meeting held here today by the State
Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance, a day
after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and
the State Council decided to adopt a more active financial policy
to spur the economy.
</P>
<P>
These measures are necessary and feasible to stimulate domestic
demand and guide and attract investment from all social sectors to
sustain rapid and healthy economic growth, meeting participants
said.
</P>
<P>
Investment priorities should be focused on both short-term
projects for immediate economic growth and long-term projects that
will help lay a solid foundation for long-range social and
economic progress, the two ministries said.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis should be placed on major industries and the
overall economic growth as well, in order to improve economic
restructuring and people's lives while preventing redundant
projects, the two departments said.
</P>
<P>
Increased investment should first go to projects already under
construction, technological upgrading projects, high-tech
industrialization, projects that can attract loans and social
investment, the central and western areas, and social development
projects such as university students housing and village radio and
television networks.
</P>
<P>
The two ministries also called for strict project supervision,
good quality, and proper use of project funds.
</P>
<P>
China issued an additional 100 billion yuan worth of treasury
bonds last year to ameliorate the negative effects of the Asian
financial crisis on domestic demand. A year's experience has
demonstrated that this policy is correct, contributing an
estimated 1.5 percentage points to the country's gross domestic
product growth.

Committee consisting of senior managers of various departments of
the company to supervise the progress of addressing the so-called
Y2K problem.
</P>

And then CTM worked out a detailed plan and started actions in
five areas: computer hardware and software, network equipment and
interfaces, customer equipment, products and services, and
supplier management.
</P>
<P>
Among the tasks, supplier management requires that the company'

<HEADLINE> Sudan Reserves Over U.S. Envoy for South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of Foreign
Affairs Mustafa Osman Ismail has described the U.S. decision to
appoint a special envoy for the war in south Sudan as "a step
worthy of consideration and evaluation."
</P>
<P>
But Ismail said that it is premature to term the decision
"positive or negative."
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the Sudanese government had not received any
official information from the U.S. administration regarding the
decision, Sudanese daily Al Rai Al Am reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ismail also said Sudan's response would be based on the
Sudanese government's approval of the principle of dialog, its
endeavour to normalize ties with the U.S., and Khartoum's interest
in promoting a positive U.S. role in Sudanese issues, particularly
the establishment of peace in south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Ismail pointed out that Sudan will continue to cherish dialog
with the U.S. in order to treat and normalize bilateral relations,
paving way for a positive role for the U.S. in such issues as
peace and relief work.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sudan would examine the U.S. decision, its
objectives and affiliation of the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Ismail pointed out some members in the U.S. government harbor
hostility towards Sudan and a neutral envoy is preferred.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Ismail's statement constitutes the
first official Sudanese reaction to the U.S. presidential decree
to appoint an American envoy to deal with the war in south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, certain Sudanese political sources have warned that
the appointment means placing Sudan, south and north alike, under
trusteeship, and the restoration of the era of the British High
Commissioner under British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that welcoming an American envoy was, in
effect, submitting to the design of U.S. Secretary of State
Madaleine Albright aimed at gaining control over Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old civil war between Sudanese government and
southern rebels have ravaged the country and more than 1.5 million
people have died as a result of the fighting and famines.

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The visiting U.N. technical team,
which is entrusted to remove toxic chemical agents left behind by
U.N. arms inspectors, and Iraq have agreed on the process of
carrying out the mission.
</P>
<P>
The process of removing quantities of chemical agents and
mustard gas samples has been decided at a meeting held on Thursday
between the Iraqi side led by presidential adviser Amer as-Saadi
and the U.N. team led by South African Dirk van Niekerk, the Iraqi
News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the real work of destroying these chemical
agents and mustard gas samples left behind by the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq would start Friday, but it
did not reveal how and where the work will be done.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, which comprises four chemical experts from the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague
and an independent biological weapons expert, arrived in Baghdad
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These U.N. experts are from China, Russia, Poland and
Germany. Yako Yalato, a Finnish, former assistant director of
U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center, acts as guide for
the U.N. team.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. reached an agreement last month on the
composition of the technical team to close UNSCOM's Baghdad
laboratory where one kilogram of mustard gas and VX gas were left
behind before the commission withdrew from Iraq last December.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not resumed its work of weapons inspections in
Iraq since last December when the United States and Britain
launched four-night airstrikes against Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has made
great efforts to accelerate the social development of the poor
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Due to the economic restructuring, high adult illiteracy and
fast population growth, more than 60 percent of Mozambicans are
unemployed or semi-unemployed, the Mozambican government said in
its report on the national social development to be submitted to
the United Nations later this month.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has helped train some 15,000
job-seekers through various training programs and has invested
large amount of fund in the educational and vocational training
institutions in the past five year.
</P>
<P>
The report carried in Friday's Noticias newspaper noted that
during 1995 and 1999, the government has granted loans to some
8,000 people and offered tools to some 10,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government has helped establish 281 companies,
creating some 11,000 jobs in such sectors as agriculture, civil
engineering and bakery while in the same period creating some
50,000 temporary jobs in the rehabilitation and building of such
infrastructures as roads.

<P>
According to the report, in the four years, some 245,000
Mozambicans were legally employed in South Africa with the help

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Charges 17 for Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people will be
taken to court on charge of political violence in the protest
earlier this week after the opposition Civic United Front lost
parliamentary by-elections to the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi
party, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander, Alfred Gewe, said
that a group of people waving flags of the opposition party caused
extensive damages to properties belonging to the ruling party in a
riot between 5:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Tuesday
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News Friday quoted Gewe as saying that the
mob damaged offices of the ruling party at Mtoni area in Dar es
Salaam, and threw stone at cars and broke window screens, which
caused a loss of one million shillings (about 1,350 U.S. dollars).
 A policeman was injured during the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
Candidates of the ruling party won the parliamentary
by-elections for the Ubungo and Temeke constituencies in the
capital city held last Sunday by narrow margins.
</P>
<P>
In Ubungo, former Deputy Finance Minister Venance Ngula scooped
23,790 votes, beating his nearest rival Hussein Mmassy of the
opposition party, who managed to get 21,530 votes. In Temeke,
John Kibasso of the ruling party defeated Tambwe Hizza of the
opposition party by 27,090 to 25,742.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party then alleged that the elections were not
fair and free.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Human Development Report
1999 of the United Nations has ranked Pakistan the 138th among 174
countries and regions on the basis of the Human Development Index
(HDI).
</P>
<P>
The report was launched across the world, including Pakistan,
Harumi Sukaguchi, resident representative of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) in Pakistan, Friday released the report
at a ceremony at the United Nations Information Center in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The report ranked Pakistan among the group of countries
categorized as Medium Human Development. Compared with the 1998
report, Pakistan has graduated from the Low Human Development
countries and regions to the Medium Human Development countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
"In fact this change for good has occurred not because of some
breakthrough on the human development scene of the country, but
this has occurred because of methodological changes in the HDI
calculations," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Pakistan's human development challenges
remain pressing.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 report has placed the 174 countries and regions in
three categories based on the comprehensive evaluation of per
capita income, poverty deprivation, literacy rate, life
expectancy, gender equality, and so on.
</P>
<P>
The three categories are High Human Development, Medium Human
Development and Low Human Development, with 45, 94 and 35
countries and regions separately in the first, second and third
categories.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Rate Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation rate doubled
from 6.1 percent in May 1998 to an estimated 12.2 percent in May
this year and may rise further in the next several months,
according to Joseph Sanusi, governor of the Central Bank of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a monthly luncheon of the Nigerian Economic Summit
Group on Thursday, the governor noted that the risk of further
acceleration of the inflation rate is high as the current rate had
not reflected the "lagged effect of the excessive government
spending".
</P>
<P>
Due to the "lackluster attitude of government since 1998", he
said, the federal government of Nigeria recorded an estimated
205.7 billion Naira (about 2.057 billion U.S. Dollars) deficit in
the first five months this year, The Post Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the five-month deficit is 3.7 billion Naira
(about 37 million Dollars) above the 202 billion Naira (about 2.02
billion Dollars) projected for the whole year of 1999, Sanusi
said.
</P>
<P>
As the demand for foreign exchange remained at an unsustained
level, he noted, official external reserves position plunged from
7.1 billion Dollars at the end of December 1998 to 4.6 billion
Dollars at the end of June 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to him, this is "an amount that could barely meet the
 conventionally accepted external reserve adequacy level of three
months of imports."
</P>
<P>
The governor pointed out that an estimated output growth rate
for the first half of 1999 was 1.1 percent while the unemployment
rate remained unacceptably high.
</P>
<P>
Though most of these problems are not our own making, he noted,
the Central Bank of Nigeria would accept the challenge of dealing
effectively with these problems in order to ensure the
re-establishment of a stable macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The apex bank has embarked on monetary policy actions including
the issue of the Special Treasury Bills, upward review of both the
Cash Reserve Ratio and Liquidity Ratio from 8 to 12 percent and 30
to 40 percent respectively, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Sanusi said these measures are painful but they are necessary
given the need to restore a stable macro-economic environment
which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and the external
viability of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Candidates' Performance Declining in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The general performance of
candidates for this year's university matriculation examination is
poor compared with last year, according to the Joint Admissions
and Matriculation Board (JAMB).
</P>
<P>
Board Registrar Bellow Salim made the revelation in capital
Abuja Thursday when he announced the results of the 1999
examinations, This Day newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, he said that the mean scores in Geography,
Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics showed a decline in candidates'
performance, compared with the 1998 results.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the mean score for mathematics was 38.90 as
against last year's 53.50, said the registrar, adding that there
had been a noticeable decline in the quality of performance in
science subjects over the years.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this lapse and our urgent manpower need in the
sciences, efforts should be seriously intensified to improve upon
the teaching of these subjects at the secondary school level,"
Salim stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a total of 400,194 out of 417,773 candidates
actually sat for the examination while 17,579 did not turn up for
the examination at their various centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
The registrar noted that there was a boost in women's quest for
 university education as a total of 175,897 female candidates sat
for the examination, accounting for 44 percent of the total
applicants.
</P>
<P>
As 8,073 candidates were involved in examination malpractice
this year, the results of the candidates who represented 2.01
percent of the total number of applicants, had been withheld, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the generally low incidence of irregularities and
 malpractice recorded during the examination could be attributed
to some measures put in place by JAMB, including the innovation
in which questions were joggled and segmented into "different
types".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Launch New Fight Against Superstition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars in both the
natural and social sciences today launched a new campaign against
superstition, which has been surging in China recently.
</P>
<P>
Superstitions lately emerging in China includes the belief in
ghosts, witchcraft, and supernatural abilities in the disguise of
science and traditional culture, said Ren Jiyu, president of the
China Atheism Society.
</P>
<P>
Ren said at a forum against superstition and pseudo-science
sponsored by the China Association for Science and Technology (
CAST) that superstitious activities are disturbing social
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by CAST last year showed that 35.5 percent
of Chinese citizens believe in fortune-telling and divination, a
figure nearly seven percentage points higher than the 28.7 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending today's forum shared the opinion that China
should increase people's scientific awareness and ban the
publication of books and magazines disseminating superstition.
Those who make money by telling fortunes should be punished
according to the law, they opined.
</P>
<P>
A new journal, Science and Atheism, sponsored by the China
Atheism Society, began publication today.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Probe Efficacy of New AIDS Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister
Manto Tshbalala-Msimang plans to lead a delegation to Uganda to
investigate the efficacy of a new drug which reportedly reduces
mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, 702 Radio reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, Nevirapine, was jointly developed by the United
States and Ugandan researchers.
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala-Msimang was considering introducing the drug to
South Africa, according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
The health minister appeared optimistic that the
anti-retroviral drug could be a cost-effective way of reducing the
high incidence of AIDS among infants in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"If indeed it does stop transmission from mother to child, it
will be a breakthrough," Tshabalala-Msimang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said her ministry wanted to be satisfied that the drug was
as effective as claimed by the American and Uganda researchers.
</P>
<P>
"All that remains is for us to get more information and then we
will take appropriate steps."
</P>
<P>
Studies on Nevirapine at Uganda's Mulago Hospital over an
18-month period, discovered that a double oral dose of the
anti-retroviral drug Nevirapine given to an HIV-infected mother in
labor, and to her baby at birth, reduces the risk of transmission
to the unborn child by up to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 25 and 30 percent of infected pregnant mothers usually
pass on the HIV virus, which leads to AIDS to their children,
according to Ugandan figures.
</P>
<P>
Nevirapine, which is manufactured by Germany pharmaceutical
company, Boehringer-Ingelheim, costs around 25 rand (about four
U.S. dollars) per treatment, making it significantly cheaper than
drugs currently on the market.
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala-Msimang's predecessor Nkosazana Zuma was widely
criticized for refusing to give the anti-AIDS drug, AZT, to
pregnant HIV-positive women at state hospitals. Zuma had insisted
that the government could not afford to dispense the drug.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Protect Plant Genetic Resources: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Plant genetic resources is of
great importance in the national development while all biological
resources will continue to be of concern to all the society,
Kenyan Environment Minister Francis Nyenze has said.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard genetic resources, the country's plant genetic
resources regulation will be tabled for discussion in Parliament
and the bill will surely go through, the minister said at a
three-day workshop on intellectual property right and protection
of plant genetic resources in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Nyenze noted that it was absolutely essential that
bio-diversity issues are accorded their rightful place in the
national development as industrialization has placed them on the
forefront.
</P>
<P>
It also needs to regulate the access to and the sharing of
benefits from the use of the genetic resources, local media Friday
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
G. Thitai, an expert from the Genetic Resources Expert Working
Group told the workshop that at least 18,000 species of rare
plants including coffee, barley, parsley and various fruits and
vegetables had been smuggled out of Kenya by prospectors since
1987.
</P>
<P>
"Access to genetic resources outside the protected areas has
taken place easily without local benefitting and must now stop,"
Thitai said.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the workshop urged African countries to
develop laws governing commercial use of genetic resources to
ensure they benefit from bio-technology.
</P>
<P>
About 150 participants from local institutions, U.N. agencies,
Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi attended the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Photos Show Java Rhinoceros Survives in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Photos of Java rhinoceros released
by Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD),
the Dutch Embassy in Vietnam and the Would Wildlife Fund (WWF)
prove that the precious animal has survived in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The photos of the single-horned rhinoceros (or rhinoceros
sondaicus annamiticus) were released for the first time at a press
briefing in Hanoi on Thursday, Vietnam's official news agency VNA
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven pictures showing this rare animal in four
different positions were taken by automatic cameras during May 11
and 25 at locations in the Cat Tien National Park in southern
Vietnam, 150 kilometers north of Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
One photo shows a rhino with a small horn -- a characteristic
of female Javan rhinos. Another photo shows a rhino with an open
mouth and large incisors - a characteristic of male Javan rhinos.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most exciting events in the natural history
of Vietnam, and this exercise may even prove that there are more
than eight rhinos surviving in the area," said Tran Van Mui,
director of the park.
</P>
<P>
The photo-trapping project is part of the 6-million-U.S.-dollar
WWF-Cat Tien National Park Conservation Project funded by the
governments of Vietnam and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Cat Tien park, covering an area of about 75,000 hectares,
includes a rhino sanctuary, which was created by the Vietnamese
government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Cat Tien National Park is believed to be one of the only
two places in the world currently home to Javan (or lesser
one-horned) rhinos, originally ranging from eastern India to
Vietnam and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. Ujong
Kulon National Park, Java, Indonesia, is thought to house about 60
such rhinos.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Golkar Congratulates PDI-P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Golkar Party Chairman
Akbar Tanjung Friday congratulated Megawati Soekarnoputri whose
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) has been confirmed
as the winner in the June 7 General election.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said he wants a dialogue with the winning parties to
discuss various issues related to the upcoming general session of
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet
in November to elect the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
Golkar remains open to the idea of forming a coalition with
other political parties, Tanjung was quoted by the Antara News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Election Committee (PPI) has completed the
national tabulation of votes on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The PPI recorded a total of 105.78 million votes counted,
compared with 117.8 million registered votes and 4.42 million
invalid votes. The committee also found that 93.54 percent of the
registered voters were able to exercise their voting rights.
</P>
<P>
Data from the PPI showed PDI-P winning the election with 33.74
percent of votes, and Golkar trailing behind with 22.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The PPI election returns are tentative because the final
results will be issued by the General Elections Commission (KPU).
The deadline set for the KPU announcement is July 21.
</P>
<P>
"The next process is the endorsement by the KPU. The PPI will
then calculate seats obtained by each party. After the seat
calculation is endorsed by the KPU, the contesting parties will be
notified," said PPI Chairman Jacob Tobing.
</P>
<P>
According to calculations by national newspapers, PDI-P is
expected to get 154 seats of the House of Representatives (DPR),
Golkar 120 seats, the United Development Party 59 seats, the
National Awakening Party 51 seats and the National Mandate Party
31 seats.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the election to
compete for 462 of the 500 seats in the DPR. The remaining 38
seats are reserved for the military, whose members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Woman Rescued After Months of Confinement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A young woman has been rescued by
the police in southern Egypt after her father tried to kill her by
locking her in a tiny room for more than three months, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The police found Madiha Eid Ali, 23, on Wednesday while
searching for weapons in a house next to her parents' home in the
town of Akhmim, 340 kilometers south of Cairo, and heard Eid Ali
crying for help, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>

Eid Ali told the police that her father, Abdu Ali, got angry
with her after her 80-year-old husband divorced her under pressure
from his children. She said she had married to escape her father
and stepmother's home.

Abdu Ali locked his daughter in a windowless one-square-meter
room for 108 days, the police said, adding that Eid Ali was found
weak and frail. She has been hospitalized.

her from time to time, the police said.

Abdu Ali fled after he heard of his daughter's rescue. The
police said they were searching for the man.

<HEADLINE> Voter Registration Begins in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The first day of voter
registration for East Timor's autonomy ballot was reportedly
running well, although only a few have turned up in registration
centers in the territory on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, the United Nations Mission
in East Timor (UNAMET) checked the documents brought by eligible
voters and interviewed each of them for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A UNAMET personnel said many eligible voters are still busy
obtaining such documents as baptismal and marriage certificates
are needed in the registration process.
</P>
<P>
Those eligible to register are people who were born in East
Timor, more than 17 years old and their close relatives.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the UNAMET Ian Martin visited three districts in the
western part of East Timor during the first day of voter
registration Friday.
</P>
<P>
Martin was accompanied by U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy,
U.S. Deputy State Secretary for Asia-Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth
and U.N. civilian police chief Allan Mills.
</P>
<P>
Roth arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, on Thursday to
carry out a direct assessment of conditions in the territory.
</P>
<P>
On the security in East Timor during the registration period,
Martin said the Indonesian Police have guaranteed that the
registration would be peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is organizing a direct ballot in East Timor to enable
the East Timorese to accept or reject a wide-ranging autonomy
offered by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the autonomy proposal will mean independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has delayed the direct ballot
in East Timor from its original schedule, from August 8 to either
August 21 or 22, due to logistical difficulties and security
problems. Voter registration was also delayed for two days from
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- One of the most globally threatened
species of wild goat, serow or red serow, believed to be locally
extinct, has been sighted for the first time in 20 years in the
Matiranga Forest in Khagrachhari district, 184 kilometers
southeast of the capital city of Dhaka, the Daily Star newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
An expedition of scientists from the International Union for

<P>
With its scientific name of capricornis sumtraensis, the serow
belongs to the horned ungulates family's caprinae sub-family.
</P>
<P>
Caprinae has intrinsic values as part of the ecology in a wide
range of distinct habitats, and its scientific interest is also
great because of their adaptation to the harsh mountain
environment.
</P>
<P>
Besides, serow has also great consumptive values as food,
medicine and trophy and at the same time it has non-consumptive
values for wildlife viewing and safaris.
</P>
<P>
From a purely anthropocentric perspective, the major value of
wild caprinae is that they are the ancestors of two of the most
important livestock -- domestic sheep and goats.
</P>
<P>
Most of the caprinae population are particularly vulnerable to
extinction because of their genetic isolation, specialized habitat
and low reproduction. There are threats from heavy hunting
pressure by locals and the loss of forest under-storey due to
clearing and collection of fuel-wood.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Illegal Immigrants Arrested in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 illegal immigrants
from Iraq and Syria had been arrested in Lebanon's northern port
city of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The 107 Iraqis and 14 Syrians, including women, children and
babies, reached Tripoli with the help of a network of middlemen
and waited to be smuggled to Greece, police said Friday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
According to many of the immigrants, the middlemen, who are
still being sought, reportedly charged each of the immigrants 50
U.S. dollars and promised to get them to Greece by boat, the Daily
Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were staying in a public school where they were
taken by the police, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
They will be taken to the Abboudieh crossing point at the
Lebanese northern border once arrangements for sending them home
are agreed upon with the Syrian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece have complained in recent months that
boatloads of illicit immigrants entered the two countries from
Lebanon, especially the port of Tripoli.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav national airline JAT
expects to resume its regular weekly Beijing-Belgrade flights
tomorrow after a temporary halt in March because of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
 Petar Luzazic, general director of the airlines in China,
said the company will also resume its cooperation with Air China
on the Beijing-Sydney route tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslav Airlines is gradually resuming all of its domestic

added.
</P>
<P>
 He said that Yugoslavia signed an agreement with Air China at
the end of last year to rent a certain number of seats on Air
China flights on the Beijing-Sydney route, a practice which began
in March but soon ended due to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslavia currently has 200,000 to 300,000 of its citizens

<HEADLINE> Hyacinth Under Control in Zambia's Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the notorious water
hyacinth weed on Lake Kariba, the world's second biggest man-made
lake, has been put under control, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zambezi River Authority as saying that 80
percent of the weed was killed after an initial spraying exercise
last August.
</P>
<P>
No further spraying is required because the whole Gache Ghace
and Nyaodza river mouths are cleared, said the authority.
</P>
<P>
The second phase in December last year cleared up some of the
remaining patches, leaving about 90 percent of the weed cleared in
Lake Kariba.
</P>
<P>
It said precautions were taken to avoid spraying close to
domestic water intake points and other sensitive areas and that
chemical control was adopted as the most effective short-term
control measure.
</P>
<P>
Water samples were taken before, during and after the exercise
for research.
</P>
<P>
The water weed had posed a great threat to the power generation
of the lake. Kariba power station is one of the biggest power
stations in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Panda Lives in Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- An international Pedigree of
Giant Panda has declared a 37-year-old panda as the oldest member
of the rare species, according to today's Shanghai-based Wenhui
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The panda, named "Dudu," is now living at the Wuhan Zoo in
central China's Hubei Province. "Such an age for a panda is equal
to about 110 for a human," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted zoo sources as saying that only three pandas
have reached over 30 years of age, and two died last year at the
Shenyang and Taiyuan zoos. The life span of a giant panda living
the wild is generally about 15 years, while a panda in captivity
can live as long as 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Dudu was born in 1962 at Chengdu, capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province, and was moved to the Wuhan Zoo in 1972. The zoo
has set up a special team composed of 16 panda experts who have
done their best to ensure that Dudu will "welcome the new
millennium with humankind," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are pursuing every possible means, including cloning
technology and preserving natural habitats, to try to bring the
species back from the brink of extinction. There are at present
only about 1,000 pandas in existence.

BUCHAREST -- NATO would not like to see boundaries of the

Commander in Europe, said Wednesday on a 5-hour visit here.
</P>
<P>
Clark's visit is believed for the purpose of easing the tension
aroused by what he had said in Budapest last month. He remarked
then that the Versailles Treaty which demarcated European
countries is out of date according to NATO's new strategy. The
remarks were considered a prelude to the alteration of Balkan
boundaries by Romania, who had already been fed up with the empty
promises made by NATO and the U.S. about security guarantee and
economic aid. (BC-Romania-Clark-Balkans)

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Shortage of Mortuaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- As the death toll continues to rise
due to all sorts of diseases, AIDS-related ones being on the
forefront, Zimbabwe is now faced with a crippling shortage of
mortuary space.
</P>
<P>
Mortuaries in major referral centers are congested and they are
now storing more than four times as many bodies as their capacity,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The country's biggest referral center, Parirenyatwa Group of
Hospitals in Harare, has a capacity of only 42 bodies but now
stores about 200 bodies at any given time.
</P>
<P>
Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps was quoted as
saying, " I would rather buy drugs than paying for building and
running mortuaries because we are in the business of looking after
the living not the dead."
</P>
<P>
"I am, however, not saying that mortuaries should not be
increased. We have encouraged urban councils to provide more
mortuaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is second to Botswana on the world list of countries
worst affected by AIDS. More than 700 people die every week from
HIV/AIDS- related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy of Zimbabweans, currently at 44 years, will
go down to 27 within the next 10 years due to the HIV/AIDS
scourge, a United Nations Population Division projection released
this week has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Agency human development report
shows that four sub-Saharan countries comprising Zambia, Botswana,
Uganda and Zimbabwe had experienced a 10 percent decline in life
expectancy between 1975 and 1997, the daily Herald newspaper
reported Friday.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Boundaries to Remain Unchanged: Clark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO would not like to see
boundaries of the Balkan countries change, General Wesley Clark,
NATO's Supreme Commander in Europe, said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a part of Yugoslavia, he emphasized, adding that
there is no need for Romania and other countries to worry about
boundary alterations. At present as well as in future NATO would
not like to see them change, Clark told a news conference before
concluding his 5-hour visit here.
</P>
<P>
Clark met respectively with Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu, Prime Minister Radu Vasile and the acting Defense
Minister. He expressed appreciation to them for Romania's firm
support for NATO's position during the Kosovo Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clark's visit is believed for the purpose of easing the tension
aroused by what he had said in Budapest last month. He remarked
then that the Versailles Treaty which demarcated European
countries is out of date according to NATO's new strategy.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian press reports of his statement made in Budapest
aroused uneasiness in Romania, which considered it a prelude to
the alteration of Balkan boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Clark argued that Hungarian media had quoted him out of context.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Clark didn't give any promise about Romania's
entry into NATO or NATO's aid to Romania, just like U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, NATO General Secretary Javier Solana,
and German Vice-chancellor and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
who visited Romania recently.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said Romania is displeased by Western countries'
empty promises. President Constantinescu has said that Romania
needs security guarantee and economic aid, instead of appreciation
and lip service.

<HEADLINE> Dubai to Stick to 4 Percent Customs Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Dubai will maintain its current
4 percent customs duty regardless of political decisions Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries may take to unify their
import tax, an official of Dubai customs has said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Obaid Saqr Busit, director-general of Dubai Customs, said
that he saw no rationale in hiking the tariff, the Khaleej Times
daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Dubai has been sticking to 4 percent, and we have no intention
now to increase the tariff when worldwide trend is to slash the
duty," the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dubai, the second largest emirate of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), is the region's trade hub and distribution center
accounting for almost 80 percent of all reexport trade in the GCC,
which comprises the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries are brewing a plan to unify their import tax
early next year, which might threaten Dubai's low tariff.

<HEADLINE> Global Storage Management Software Market to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The global market for storage
management software is expected to expand from 2.6 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998 to over 6.6 billion dollars in 2003, according to
a U.S. report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. market research firm Dataquest said in its report that
storage area networks (SAN), intelligent storage servers and new
data replication techniques will revolutionize the way storage
backup and recovery is accomplished, providing consistent,
integrated and automated tools for the resulting storage
management environment.
</P>
<P>
Storage management refers to the administration of any or all
backing, archival disaster recovery and hierarchical storage
management procedures within an organization.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest divides the storage management market into three
major segments: storage infrastructure products, data management
products and enterprise storage resource management products.
</P>
<P>
Storage infrastructure products provide basic data organization
functions such as file systems, volume management and physical
replication to ensure data integrity and availability by offering
fast failure recovery and data redundancy. The market reached 626
million dollars in 1998 and is expected to hit 1.9 billion dollars
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Data management products include backup, restore, archive and
hierarchical storage management tools. As a leading factor driving
the worldwide storage management software market, this segment
accounted for nearly 1.6 billion dollars in 1998 and is expected
to reach 3 billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise storage resource management products provide
management of various storage resources on the network, including
magnetic disk, tape and optical media. This segment is projected
to show the strongest growth, from 382 million dollars in 1998 to
1.7 billion dollars by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs New Karate Team Lineup for SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia Karate-Do Federation
(Forki) will hold a two-day competition to select athletes for the
20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games squad in Brunei Darussalam next
month, The Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Rustam Umbas said the selection would be held on
July 24 and 26 to pick the core squad of 21 of 35 karatekas.
</P>
<P>
Forki has been grooming 20 male karatekas for 10 divisions and
15 female karatekas for seven divisions to compete in the Games
from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The SEA Games organizers in Bandar Seri Begawan introduced a
new rule allowing each participating country to field only one
athlete per weight category in certain sports.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the National Sports Council (KONI) official in
charge of athlete development Mochammad Hindarto said the
organizers would not change the rule.
</P>
<P>
"They said they would stick to the rule," said Hindarto, who
has just returned from Bandar Seri Begawan to attend the chef de
mission technical meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Forki could submit its new team lineup as soon
as possible but he did not set a deadline.
</P>
<P>
Rustam said if there were two athletes who tied in the
selection, Forki would review each karateka's achievements and
ranking this year before choosing one.
</P>
<P>
He also said Forki would call experienced referees, who often
worked in the regional competitions, to judge the selection.
</P>
<P>
"By having experienced referees, we hope they can prevent our
karatekas fighting so hard that they could injure themselves
during the selection. The Asian-level referees should know when he
should suspend and stop the game," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said the International Swimming Federation has given
its approval for the SEA Games to serve as the pre-qualifying
round for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It was the secretary-general of Malaysia's National Olympics
Committee Sieh Kok Chi who informed me. I have told the Indonesian
Swimming Association about this matter but I have not received any
response," he said.

<HEADLINE> India's Rice Exports Dip by 54 pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- India's rice export registered a
sharp decline of over 50 percent during the first quarter of the
current 1999-2000 financial year on poor demand from major
importing nations, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Total registration for shipment of rice stood at 654,840 tons
as on July 2, down 54.55 percent from 1.278 million tons
registered for exports in the previous corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
While 543,000 tons of non-basmati rice has been registered for
exports with the Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export
Development Authority (APEDA), 111,000 tons of basmati rice was
registered till July 2, APEDA sources said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the sharp decline in rice exports was
mainly due to poor demand from Bangladesh, which was a major buyer
of Indian rice last year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Expects More Recruits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the Sri Lankan
army's recruitment drive this year will be held from August 9 to
30, a military spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We need more troops to hold on to the vast tracts of newly
liberated areas," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman declined to specify the number of
recruits.
</P>
<P>
Recruitment will take place at the army's recruitment center in
Colombo and at district secretariat offices and army camps located
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In May, the army launched a recruitment drive in a bid to
recruit 10,000 men including minority Tamils, but no Tamils
responded to the drive for fear of Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan army, plagued by a high rate of desertion, has
said it needed at least 20,000 men to step up its war against the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a Tamil homeland for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Manila Plans to Launch Venture Capital Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is on the
move to launch a venture capital fund to raise money for small and
medium-sized enterprises in Mindanao and Palawan, the Today
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Money raised through this venture will be invested in
enterprises that are not listed on the stock market and therefore
have no access to the equities market for capital formation.
</P>
<P>
Financial Assistant Secretary Ma. Eleanor de la Cruz has
already informed Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Perfecto Yasay Jr. of the plan to set up the private equities
fund.
</P>
<P>
The fund, to be called Eaga Philippine Fund, will be a
close-end venture investing strictly in private equities.
</P>
<P>
It will be incorporated as a limited company with an authorized
capital of 500 million pesos (12 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fund's shares will be available to both Filipino and
foreign institutional investors in two tranches -- one for local
investors, the other for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Eaga Philippine Fund will be managed by Capital Advisors
for Private Enterprises Expansion Inc. and Assets Managers Inc. It
will have the sole responsibility and full discretionary authority
to invest fund subject to the fund's board of directors.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Airways International
(MAI), a Myanmar-Singapore joint venture, resumed its regular
flight between Yangon and Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia Thursday after
more than five months of suspension which started on February 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
The twice-a-week flight on Thursday and Sunday is being
operated again with the use of Boeing 737-400 aircraft, The New
Light of Myanmar official newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The MAI started flying the Yangon-Kuala Lumpur route in 1993.
Later in November 1996, the Malaysian Airline System (MAS) joined
the same flight twice a week.
</P>
<P>
The MAI, a joint venture airline between the state-run Myanmar
Airways and the Highsonic Enterprise Private Ltd. of Singapore,
has been flying externally with Boeing 737-400 aircraft leased
from the MAS, to seven destinations -- Bangkok of Thailand, Hong
Kong, Dhaka of Bangladesh, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Kunming in
southwest China and Jakarta of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The MAI's Yangon-Kunming flight is learnt to have been
suspended for a time for unfavorable business operation.

include Biman (Bangladesh), Royal Brunei Airlines, Air China, Druk
Air (Bhutan), Indian Airlines, Lao Aviation Co., All Nippon
Airways (Japan), Pakistan International Airways, Silk Air
(Singapore) and Thai Airways International.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar and Macao signed a bilateral air services
agreement in Yangon in March this year to open flight between them

that Myanmar and Macao are trying to inaugurate the flight before
Macao returns to China on December 20 this year.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Calls for Compensation of Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo crisis brought Bulgaria
big economic losses, Bulgarian Trade and Tourism Minister Valentin
Vassilev told visiting Southeastern Europe Stability Pact
Coordinator Bodo Hombach on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The losses, which were mainly a result of the crisis-triggered
decline in exports, amounted to 170 million Deutsche marks (89.5
million U.S. dollars), said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian minister asked for assistance from the Stability
Pact, which was endorsed at a European Union summit in Cologne,
Germany, last month to achieve stability in the Balkan region, to
construct a bridge across the Bulgarian-Romanian section of the
Danube.
</P>
<P>
Vassilev also asked to ease the access of Bulgarian goods to
the European and American markets and eliminate export quotas and
said it was necessary to establish a fund which would guarantee
investments in the region because after the Kosovo crisis the
Balkans are considered a risk area.
</P>
<P>
He gave Hombach a catalogue of Bulgarian projects and companies
wishing to take part in the reconstruction of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator, who is visiting Bulgaria as part of his tour
of the Balkan countries, also met Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov, Prime Minister Ivan Kostov and Foreign Minister Nadezhda
Mihailova.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov told Hombach that Bulgaria attached great importance
to the participation of Bulgarian companies as subcontractors in
projects for the reconstruction of the region.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with Kostov, Hombach said Bulgaria will play a
leading role in the rebuilding of Southeastern Europe and that the
Stability Pact will not refer only to Kosovo but to all countries
of the region.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Ease Ban on Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is set to lift
a restriction on foreign workers in certain labor-intensive
businesses after expiration of their permits next month, Bangkok
Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Illegal alien workers are expected to leave Thailand before the
August 4 deadline set by the Thai government last year.
</P>
<P>
A sub-committee on illegal workers will meet soon to determine
the businesses depending on illegal workers after the deadline,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Employment of alien workers is aimed at alleviating labor
shortages in certain industries in Thailand, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Thai deputy Prime Minister Korn Dabbaransi, the subcommittee
chairman, was quoted as saying that the national committee chaired
by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai will meet on July 19 to discuss
the proposal and ways to formulate a broader framework for hiring
alien workers.
</P>
<P>
Industries facing a labor shortage in Thailand include rubber
plantations, construction, agriculture, rice mills and prawn
farms.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Thai cabinet eased restrictions on aliens
working in coastal fisheries and those employed in certain
businesses in 13 border provinces.
</P>

Over 90,000 alien workers from Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia have
been granted temporary permits in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> hke071613 -Lethal Malaria Resurgence Worries Vietnamese Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese health care officials are
worried over the resurgence of lethal malaria in Vietnam, the
Vietnam News English daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam wiped out the disease in the northern region from 1954
to 1962, but it came back with a vengeance in 1991, which saw 144
outbreaks with more than 1 million victims and 4,600 fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of the Vietnamese government and local
health care authorities, between 1992 and 1997, malaria outbreaks
fell from 144 reported in 1991 to only four in 1997. Meanwhile,
the death rate from the disease dropped by 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, malaria outbreaks mainly took place in the
four provinces of Quang Nam, Kon Tum, Lao Cai and Nghe An.
</P>
<P>
A total of 183 people died of malaria last year, mostly in
Vietnam's central provinces and the Tay Nguyen region.
</P>
<P>
There were 130,403 malaria patients nationwide in the first
five months of this year, 6.8 percent less than the same period of
1998. However, Vietnam's health care officials are worried about
the number of malignant malaria cases, which has increased to 625.
This represents a 51.7-percent increase over the same period of
1998. Meanwhile, the death toll has reached 64, a year-on-year
increase of 42.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese health officials said that the most recent upswing
in malaria cases can be partially blamed on the changing weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The weather has been unstable, with average temperatures
increasing from one to two degrees centigrade compared to the past
years. In addition, the rainy season has come early in central and
southern provinces, as well as in Tay Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese health authorities also said that large-scale
migration between provinces hinders their efforts to control the
disease.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to restrict the movement of migrant
laborers and increase investment in infrastructure and health care
to cope with the resurgence of lethal malaria.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Lowers Economic Growth Estimate for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Department of
Statistics (DOS) has revised the country's economic growth rate
for 1998 to a mere 0.3 percent from the previously-announced 1.5
percent following revision in the methodology of estimating the
added value of the financial services sector.
</P>
<P>
Using the revised methodology, the DOS also cut this year's
first- quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth from 1.2
percent to 0.8 percent, 0.4 percentage point lower than the
earlier estimation.
</P>
<P>
An Information Paper released Thursday by the DOS detailed the
revision in the methodology used to estimate the added value and
the performance of the financial services sector.
</P>
<P>
It also declared that the methodology will reflect more
accurately the performance of three financial industries:
stockbrokers, investment advisers (fund management) and insurance
services.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the revised method for estimating the
added value of stockbrokers and investment advisers is based on
improved quarterly data sources on fees and commissions received
and the new methodology for the insurance services is motivated by
conceptual changes introduced in the 1993 edition of the United
Nations' System of National Accounts.
</P>
<P>
A DOS official said at a press briefing Thursday that the
methodological improvement in the way to measure the contribution
of the rapidly-expanding financial services sector will also bring
changes to the GDP growth forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
The new economic growth forecast for this year is expected to
be announced by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in his national day
speech, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Free Artificially Bred Endangered Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Two ibises which were living in
captivity have been set free recently by an ibis breeding center
in Yangxian County, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
It marks the start of the country's drive to return ibises in
captivity to nature, said Lu Baozhong, an official of the center.
</P>
<P>
China plans to set six ibises free this year. The other four
are being trained to learn to live in wildness.
</P>
<P>
Ibis is an endangered bird native to Asia. There used to be
large flocks in most of China, Japan, and Russia, but today the
species is found only in China. Its population has grown from a
mere seven in 1981 to over 202, as a result of artificial
propagation and environmental protection measures.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 65 young ibises have been born in Yangxian
County, bringing the total number to 202. The reproduction rate of
ibis has grown at an annual rate of 40 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 100 ibises live in captivity. They are less
capable than wild ibises in finding food, seeking spouses and
avoiding attack of other animals.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Has 1.6 billion U.S. Dollars of Unpaid Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said its
tax owed in the period from 1995 to 1999 totaled 11.4 trillion
rupiah (about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars), The Indonesian Observer
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Taxation Anshari Ritonga attributed the
huge increase in the amount of outstanding tax to the recording
system and taxation procedures.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, Ritonga said, the directorate general of
taxation cannot automatically write off tax owed by a bankrupt
company. It must first be declared overdue.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, tax owed by the bankrupt company keeps on
mounting.
</P>
<P>
"That's why the amount of tax owed keeps increasing even though
the company itself lacks the capacity to pay," Ritonga said.
</P>
<P>
Companies entitled to have their tax written off are those who
have lodged an application for bankruptcy with the court, and who
have sent copies of their statements to the state auction body,
and announced their bankruptcy in the mass media and reported
details of their cases to the directorate general of taxation.
</P>
<P>
"The huge amount of tax outstanding is also due to the tax
outstanding on the debts of ailing banks which have transferred
their bad credits to the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the banking regulations contain debt write-off
provisions does not mean that they are not subject to tax, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Loans that have been written off are still treated as income
on the part of the debtors, and are thus taxable. This is part of
the tax regulations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Team USA to Play in Pre Olympic Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Team USA, comprising of nine
NBA stars and three lottery picks, is the overwhelming favorite to
win the Pre-Olympic Basketball Tournament of the Americas and
plays its first game tonight against Uruguay in San Juan, Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay upset Cuba 87-84 in overtime on Wednesday in the
opening day of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The United States has won 11 of 13 Olympics, including the last
two with star-studded NBA teams. This squad should do the same as
no country in the world can match these big Americans.
</P>
<P>
Ten teams from North, Central and South America are entered and
everyone else is playing for second place -- and the coveted
Olympic berth that comes with it. The teams reaching the gold
medal game on July 25 earn a spot in the draw for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich was selected to coach
this team but withdrew due to exhaustion, leaving the duties to
Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown. Brown's toughest task may be
finding minutes for 12 players, all of whom were selected 14th or
better in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
Team USA is led by San Antonio Spurs center-forward Tim Duncan,
who is coming off a Most Valuable Player showing in the NBA Finals.
He twisted an ankle in practice last week but is ready to go.
</P>
<P>
Joining Duncan in the frontcourt are forwards Kevin Garnett of
the Minnesota Timberwolves, Vin Baker of the Seattle SuperSonics
and Tom Gugliotta of the Phoenix Suns. The backcourt is extremely
deep, with point guards Gary Payton of Seattle, Jason Kidd of
Phoenix and Tim Hardaway of the Miami Heat. Allan Houston of the
New York Knicks and Steve Smith of the Atlanta Hawks are the
shooting guards.
</P>
<P>
The selected collegians are forward Elton Brand of the Chicago
Bulls, Wally Szczerbiak of Minnesota and Richard Hamilton of the
Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is split into two groups of five teams. The USA
is in Group A and also will play Canada, Argentina and Cuba in the
preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
Group B consists of the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Panama,
Brazil and Puerto Rico. The semi-finals are on July 24, with the
winners earning an Olympic berth and playing for the gold medal
one day later.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt Condemns Attack on Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
vehemently condemned Thursday's attack on journalists and police
officers by members of the main opposition United National Party
(UNP) during an unlawful demonstration, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News quoted Media Minister Mangala
Samaraweera as saying that the attack on journalists was a
pre-planed one by the UNP.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inspector General of Police in Colombo T.N. de Silva
said the demonstration had not obtained prior permission, and the
police had to use tear gas to bring the situation under control as
demonstrators had stoned police officers, journalists and the
public.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 were injured, including four photo journalists,
police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The UNP organized the procession to protest against the ruling
People's Alliance (PA) government's failure to abolish the
executive presidency system in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The PA promised in the election campaign to abolish the system
by July 15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday night, the Presidential
Secretariat accused the UNP of attempting continuously to sabotage
the government's sincere efforts.
</P>
<P>
It said most of the burning issues of the country would have
been solved, including that of the Executive Presidency, if the
UNP had offered support in Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Objects to Argentina's Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 15 (Xinhua)-- Brazil Thursday objected to
Argentina's new tariffs on Brazilian textile products, saying it
was a protectionist action contrary to the spirit of free trade.
</P>
<P>
Jose Alfredo Graca Lima, undersecretary of the Economic
Integration and Exterior Trade Affairs of the Foreign Ministry
said the protectionist measures which the Argentine government
intends to make official are contrary to the spirit of free trade
of the South American Common Market (Mercosur), which also
includes Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
He said Brazil will try to reach an agreement with Argentina so
that Brazil's textile industry will be less affected.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, Argentina accumulated a deficit of
2.8 billion U.S. dollars in textile imports, including 450 million
dollars in imports from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Argentina announced import limits of textile
products from Brazil, China and Pakistan for the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Juana Dreams of Winning Olympic Taekwondo Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian taekwondo athlete
Juana Wangsa Putri, who was assured of a berth for Sydney Olympic,
arrived home to a hero's welcome, with hopes of winning a medal in
her first Olympic participation, The Indonesian Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is impossible. I want a better achievement than today,
" Juana told reporters upon her arrival at Jakarta international
airport on Thursday, along with the other team members.
</P>
<P>
With the Olympics being less than one-and-a-half years away,
Juana said she would train even harder. She may indeed go back to
South Korea for training.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Juana's place in Sydney was ensured after
reaching the semi-finals at the World Championship in Croatia on
July 8-12, although she was denied further contests as she was
stopped by Kay Poe of the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, her success means she becomes the first Indonesian to
take part in Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I just leave (my fate) to God. I feel I'm very much prepared
for the tournament after training in South Korea for two months,"
said Juana, who took part in the flyweight class.
</P>
<P>
Juana may already have set her eyes on Sydney, but she may
first have to focus on a minor event as the taekwondo federation's
officials begin to ponder whether Juana needs to be included in
the Indonesian sporting delegation at the Brunei Southeast Asian (
SEA) Games next month.
</P>
<P>
"We will put forward Juana's name although the entry by name
has already been submitted to the organizing committee," the
federation's chairman Suharto said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the SEA Games plan could distract her
Olympic preparation, Juana said: "I'm ready for whatever
competition I'm told to play."
</P>
<P>
She won a gold medal in her first international career in
Jakarta two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia grabbed six of 16 gold medals on offer in taekwondo
events at the SEA Games two years ago. This year, the association
is keeping a low profile and only hopes for four of 16 golds at
stake.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Court Says News Agency Chief Guilty of Libeling </HEADLINE>

HELSINKI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A Helsinki court on Thursday
handed down a suspended jail term of 45 days to the editor in
chief of Finland's FNB/STT News Agency, Kari Vaisanen, on a libel
charge.
</P>
<P>
The court said that a dispatch, written by sports reporter
Johanna Aatsalo-Sallinen and cleared by Vaisanen in January last
year, constituted a libel against Jari Rasanen, a famous skier of
the country. The dispatch alleged that Rasanen abused banned
growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
Aatsalo-Sallinen received a 30-day suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered that the two journalists and the news
agency pay damages of 1.57 million Finnish marks (about 270,000 U.
S. dollars) to compensate Rasanen and 19 people related to the
case.
</P>
<P>
Vaisanen and Aatsalo-Sallinen defended themselves by saying
that their report was reliable but they refused to provide
adequate evidence in order to protect their source.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it will decide next week whether to appeal the
verdict.

<HEADLINE> Barak to make "painful compromise" over Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said he was prepared for a "painful compromise" with Syria
over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which Syria is intent to
take back after 32 years, according to a senior Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
But Barak told U.S. President Bill Clinton during their talks
on Thursday that Israel would not retreat to the pre-1967 lines --
its boundaries before capturing the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan
Heights in the third Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his priorities for peacemaking with the Palestinians
during the talks, Barak got encouragement from President Clinton
to recapture lost momentum in the Middle East peace process, the
Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to have this generation, our generation, end the
conflict, bring an end to the conflict...we're ready to turn over
every stone to see if there is an agreement possible that will
strengthen Israel," said Barak, according to the Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the settlements will remain under Israeli sovereignty
and Jerusalem will remain Israel's capital," Barak was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Barak also told Clinton that he was ready in the coming weeks
to begin negotiations not only with the Palestinians but also with
the Syrians and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official said the two leaders also discussed the
Wye agreement on Israel's pullback from the West Bank, but he did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a welcome ceremony in the White House Rose Garden,
Barak said it is necessary to "combine the implementation of Wye
with the moving forward of the permanent status agreement," which
obviously was at odds with Clinton's intention. The president
hoped the Wye accord should be carried out immediately with the
revival of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said after the first summit between
Clinton and Barak, "The president said that it was very clear that
this was a leader who was going to be scrupulous in terms of
fulfilling obligations and also very vigilant in terms of pursuing
peace with Israeli security in mind."
</P>
<P>
At the welcome ceremony, Clinton promised to Barak that "
America will walk with you" and be "ready to help in any way we
can," he told Barak.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan removed all
doublt today, saying he is 100 percent sure he will not return to
basketball.
</P>
<P>
Arguably the greatest NBA player of all time, Jordan announced
his retirement for the second time on January 13, saying he was "
99.9" percent sure his decision was final.
</P>
<P>
That led many to believe that the beloved superstar guard of
the Chicago Bulls had left open the possibility of returning. But
Jordan appeared to close that window today.
</P>
<P>
"It's a hundred perecent. It's a hundred right now," Jordan
said following his round of golf at the pro-am at the American
Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
"I knew that I would enjoy what I wanted to do once I retired.
A lot of you guys anticipated that I would be not happy in
retirement for long. I'm at peace with the world. I get up and do
whatever. I like doing that."
</P>
<P>
Since his retirment, Jordan has remained a very public figure.
He strongly considered buying a share of the Charlotte Homets and
last month released a new men's cologne under the Jordan Brand,
his apparel company under the Nike banner.
</P>
<P>
He also appeared at a handful of games during the 1999 season
and admitted he felt a desire to compete again. But he has found a
perfect cure.
</P>
<P>
"I got a little itch during the playoffs so I just went and
played more golf," Jordan said. "As long as I'm busy, I don't
think about it. But when I stop and think about it, I do get a
little itchy. But I haven't really played, maybe only three times
over the course of the last year."

Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"The sword is the only item buried in the tomb along with the
warrior," said one local archeologist, adding that the ancient
weapon is half-a-meter long and has many nicks on the blade.
</P>
<P>
The handle of the sword is plated with chrome and decorated
with jade is carved in a pattern of clouds.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the sword was made in the middle or late era of
the Warring States Period.
</P>
<P>
This discovery is a valuable addition to the study of ancient
Chinese weaponry and military history, he added.

3. Improvement of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the Democratic Reform 40 years ago,
the Tibetan people have been making every effort to develop their
economic, social and cultural lives with support from the Central
Government and people from all over China.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has witnessed fundamental changes in its overall social
outlook while the Tibetan people have been enjoying better
economic, social, and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
The central government has always instituted preferential
policies to encourage Tibet's social and economic development, and
has also allocated large sums of capital and provided support in
technology and professionals.
</P>
<P>
Between the 1950s and 1997, the Central Government allocated
more than 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion U.S. dollars) to Tibet
while sending large amounts of goods materials to the region.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the Central Government has allocated
over 1.2 billion yuan (144 million U.S. dollars) in financial
subsidies to Tibet each year.
</P>
<P>
In Addition to 43 projects aided by nine provinces and
municipalities with a total of 477 million yuan (57 million U.S.
dollars) in 1984, another 62 projects were also launched in 1994
by the Central Government and other parts of the country with 4
billion yuan (480 million U.S. dollars), with 60 of these projects
already completed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, groups of cadres and technicians have been
sent to work in Tibet, and 15 provinces and municipalities have
launched regular Tibet aid projects, all of which greatly
advancing Tibet's social and economic development.

BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of an
article entitled "Historical Progress in Guaranteeing Human Rights
in Tibet" by China Society for Human Rights Studies, marking the
40th anniversary of the democratic reform in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Democratic Reform
carried out in Tibet and the abolition of serfdom in the region.
</P>
<P>
Forty years is but a flash in human history, but for Tibet the
past four decades were world-shaking for the changes that have
occurred in social development and human rights.
</P>
<P>
1. Historical Turning Point for Human Rights in Tibet
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1959, people living in the old Tibet ruled by the
Dalai Lama were oppressed and mercilessly exploited by the
backward feudal serfdom system, and human rights meant nothing to
them.
</P>
<P>
During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tibetan people, led
by and with support from the Central People's Government,
conducted a democratic reform of great and profound significance
and completely abolished the feudal serfdom system, carving out a
new era for the development of human rights in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The old Tibet was a society practicing a feudal serfdom system
combining political and religious power, which was darker than the
European Middle Ages. The officials, feudal lords, and senior
monks, who made up less than five percent of the population of
Tibet, owned all cultivated lands, range lands, forests, mountains,
and most livestock. They also held power over people's lives and
property.
</P>
<P>
According to 1959 statistics, temples and senior monks were in
possession of 80,960 hectares of cultivated land, 36.8 percent of
all the 220,000 hectares of land in Tibet. Feudal lords occupied
52,800 hectares of land, feudal officials including some monks
came into possession of 85,580 hectares of land, which
respectively made up of 24 percent and 38.9 percent of the total.

<P>
The 13-point Law and the 16-point Law, which were enforced for
several hundred years in old Tibet, divided people into three
classes and nine ranks. The inequality of people's social and
political status was therefore affirmed and safeguarded by law.
</P>
<P>
The laws stipulated that "people have three classes, and each
class includes three ranks." According to the codes, serfs, who
belonged to the lowest rank of the lowest class, would be arrested
if they attacked those of the upper rank.
</P>
<P>
The codes stipulated that "anyone who resists a master's
control should be arrested; a commoner who offends an official
should be arrested; anyone who voices grievances at the palace,
behaving disgracefully, should be arrested and whipped."
</P>
<P>
The penalty measurement and penalties dealing with people of
different classes and ranks who violated the same criminal law
were quite different.
</P>
<P>
According to the law concerning murder compensation, for
instance, the lives of people of the highest rank of the upper
class were valued in gold at the same weight as the dead body. The
lives of people of the lowest rank of the lower class, such as
women, butchers, hunters, and craftsmen, were worth a straw rope.
</P>
<P>
In the law concerning compensation for injury, it was
stipulated that a servant who injured his or her master's hands or
feet must have his or her hands or feet chopped off. A master who
injured a servant was only responsible for the medical treatment
of the wound, with no other compensation required.

Statistics indicate that the gross domestic product of Tibet
reached 9.118 billion yuan (109 million U.S. dollars) last year, a
47.1-fold increase over 1959.
</P>
<P>
Investment in infrastructure projects came to 3.66 billion yuan
(440 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, 468 times greater than the
figure for 1958, before the Democratic Reform was launched.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, regional local revenue reached 364 million yuan
(43 million U.S. dollars), 96 times more than in 1958.
</P>
<P>
There was no modern industry in old Tibet, and the region had
only one small power station with a generating capacity of 92
kilowatts, a small military machinery plant, and a small mint,
with a total of 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
Now, Tibet has over 300 factories engaging in dozens of modern
industries such as power generating, mining, cement, leather
processing, textiles, food processing, and building materials.
State-owned factories employ over 50,000 workers and have begun to
be modernized while retaining Tibetan characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output value in Tibet last year reached 1.365
billion yuan (164 million U.S. dollars), up 31 times over 1959.
</P>
<P>
Prior to its peaceful liberation, Tibet was a land of backward
communications without a single modern highway or permanent bridge.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has a highway network with the regional capital of
Lhasa as its center, with modern roads to Qinghai, Sichuan, and
Yunnan provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. There
is also a highway to neighboring Nepal.

WELLINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Defending world champion Tommi
Makinen of Finland held a half-second lead over arch rival Colin
McRae of Britain after two special stages on the first full day of
the New Zealand motor rally in Auckland on Friday.
</P>

after the region was drenched overnight.
</P>
<P>
Subaru's Richard Burns of Britain held third, 22 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota pair of Carlos Sainz, of Spain, and Frenchman Didier
Auriol were only 0.5 second apart in fourth and fifth place, but
28 seconds adrift of Makinen.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- World super star Pete Sampras
will play only doubles in this weekend's quarter-final tie against
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I will say it again, that for the past couple of months after
what happened in England (U.S. beat Britain 3-2 in that first
round tie without Sampras) I was planning on playing doubles and I
wasn't lying," Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is scheduled to pair with Alex O'Brien against
Australian tandem of Sandon Stolle and Mark Woodforde in Saturday'
s doubles match. This is Sampras's first Davis Cup appearance
since he injured his thigh in the December 1997 final played in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The Davis Cup weekend opens on Friday with the Australian team
rookie Lleyton Hewitt taking on the U.S. squad's number one Todd
Martin. That match will be followed by Jim Courier facing the
Aussie top gun Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's reverse singles, Martin and Rafter are the first
match, followed by Courier and Hewitt.

Local governments and large monasteries in old Tibet all had
law courts and prisons. Feudal lords could build private prisons
on their own manor ground and serf owners could beat and scold
serfs at will.
</P>
<P>
The lords were also free to practice punishments which were
extremely savage and cruel, such as cutting off ears, hands and
feet, throwing people into water, gouging out their eyeballs and
pulling out their tendons.
</P>
<P>
The abolition of serfdom was an inevitable social development
in Tibet as well as a strong desire of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
In order to break away from the cruel rule of feudal serfdom
and to strive for human rights, Tibetans never ceased their
resistance struggles, presenting petitions, fleeing, resisting
rent and corvee labor, and waging armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
In view of the special historical and actual conditions in
Tibet, The Central People's Government and the Tibetan local
government signed an agreement on measures for the peaceful
liberation of Tibet in 1951 when Tibet realized its peaceful
liberation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, known as the 17-Article Agreement, recognized
the necessity of reforming the social system in Tibet while
presenting a cautious attitude toward reform.
</P>
<P>
According to the 17-Article Agreement, the Central Government
did not apply coercion on all matters relevant to various reforms
in Tibet. The Tibet local government should conduct reform
voluntarily. When people made requests for reform, it should be
resolved by adopting the method of consulting with leaders of
Tibet.

<HEADLINE> China Preparing To Introduce Fuel Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A Ministry of Finance official
says that Chinese authorities have drafted a detailed plan to
introduce a fuel tax, which includes dismantling institutions that
levy fees on automotive and road usage and finding other jobs for
their personnel.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have already started closing down toll booths on
roads in and around cities and they plan to crack down on illegal
petroleum processing and distributing companies.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, China has done away with 26,710 unreasonable
fees that central and local authorities levied on enterprises,
which were worth 98.5 billion yuan (11.86 billion US dollars). The
government has also dealt with more than 18,000 violations of a
ban on unreasonable fees for enterprises and has penalized 1,273
officials involved and confiscated 240 million yuan worth of
illegal fees.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to stop fees levied by government departments in
order to increase State and local revenues will take 3-5 years to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, a draft of an amendment of the Highway Law
failed to pass by only one vote less, but it postponed the passage
of a fuel tax.

The per capita living space for urban residents in Tibet now
has reached 14 square meters, five square meters more than the
country's average, and the per capita living space for rural
residents now comes to over 20 square meters, equal to the country
's average. The per capita living space for the residents of Lhasa
now exceeds 17.3 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Modern domestic appliances including colored television sets,
refrigerators, and telephones have become very popular in ordinary
Tibetan households.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Tibetan robes made of lamb and otter skin formerly
worn only by aristocrats are now common among ordinary Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, there were no modern
hospitals in the region, only three small officially run and
poorly equipped medical organs and a few privately run clinics
with fewer than 100 doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
Together with a total of around 300 Tibetan medicine folk
doctors, the region only had about 400 medical workers, less than
one doctor for every two thousand people.
</P>
<P>
In old Tibet, epidemic diseases such as smallpox, cholera,
venereal diseases, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, and tetanus was
prevalent frequently.
</P>
<P>
After peaceful liberation, and especially after the Democratic
Reform, the Central Government took steps to prevent these and
other diseases which seriously threatened the health of the people,
and they were soon basically put under control.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, Tibet has wiped out smallpox, and the
incidence of several other epidemic diseases and many local
diseases has declined sharply.

Statistics show that the State paid a total of more than 45
million yuan to more than 1,300 serf owners and agents for 900,000
ke (15 ke equal 1 hectare) of land and more than 820,000 head of
livestock during the Democratic Reform. And former serfs and
slaves were allotted more than 2.8 million ke of land, about 3.5
ke per person.
</P>
<P>
Becoming owners of land and other means of production, the
former serfs and slaves showed unprecedented enthusiasm for labor,
which dramatically promoted social and economic development in
Tibet and improved the living conditions for the Tibetan people
and conditions for their advance.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by 1960, when land reform was by and large
completed, Tibet's grain output went up by 12.6 percent from 1959,
or 17.5 percent from 1958 before the land reform began.

</P>
<P>
Under the political system combining religion and politics in
old Tibet, the Dalai Lama - one of the leaders of the Gelug Sect
of Tibetan Buddhism - was also the head of the local government
with both political and religious power.
</P>
<P>
There were both monks and lay officials in the administrative
organs of the old Tibet, with the former ranking higher than the
latter. Monasteries enjoyed a series of privileges in all aspects
of political, economic, and social life. The Democratic Reform
completely abrogated the political system combining religious and
political rule, achieving the complete separation of politics and
religion.

On the one hand, it was decreed that the freedom of religious
belief, people's freedom to become lamas and nuns and their
freedom to resume secular life, and monasteries inhabited by
patriotic and law-abiding lamas, were all protected during the
Democratic Reform.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the reform abrogated all the feudal economic
and political privileges enjoyed by monasteries, including feudal
ownership, exploitation and slavery, and the feudal administration
and hierarchy within the monasteries. The funds of the monasteries
and their properties were used as a production fund and allocated
to lamas and nuns to pay for their living and normal religious
activities. Land allocated to lamas and nuns according to their
ability to work was managed by the management committee of the
monasteries whose responsibility also included production
organization. Also, the government was to subsidize the
monasteries if their incomes could not cover their proper expenses.
</P>
<P>
Separation of politics and religion not only effectively
guaranteed the Tibetan people's freedom of religious belief, but
also laid the foundation for a democratic political system.
</P>
<P>
-- Gradual implementation of regional autonomy by ethnic
minorities.

The Democratic Reform made the former serfs and slaves the

all the political rights entrusted by the Constitution and laws of
the country.

With a general election carried out in Tibet in 1961, the
former serfs and slaves for the first time gained the right to be
the masters of their own destiny. They took part in the election
eagerly, exercising their democratic rights with great political
enthusiasm and a high sense of responsibility, and elected organs
of power and governments at all levels of the autonomous region.
And many emancipated serfs and slaves became leading officials at
all levels of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The First People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region was
successfully convened in September 1965, and it announced the
official establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Among the
301 deputies to the congress, Tibetans and members of other ethnic
minorities accounted for over 80 percent, and the higher ranking
patriotic personages of the Tibetan society and religious figures
accounted for more than 11 percent. Most of the Tibetan deputies
were former serfs and slaves.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and the
implementation of regional autonomy by ethnic minorities
systematically guaranteed the political rights of the Tibetan
people to participate equally in State affairs, and the autonomy
of the Tibetan people to manage local affairs and those of their
own ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Through the Democratic Reform, New China eliminated in just
several years the feudal serfdom that had lasted for nearly a
millennium in Tibet by emancipating the millions of serfs and
slaves in all aspects of political, economic and social life.
</P>
<P>
This was an epoch-making change in the history of Tibet's
social progress and the development of human rights, and a major
contribution to the cause of human rights in both China and the
world.

-- Emancipation of serfs and slaves.
</P>
<P>
After quelling the armed rebellion in Tibet in 1959, the
Central Government immediately disbanded the Tibetan local
government and its armed forces, courts, and prisons which had
oppressed the Tibetan people for hundreds of years, and abolished
the old code and the barbarous punishments it decreed.
</P>
<P>
Then the government initiated a mass movement against the
rebellion, the corvee system and slavery, pushed for the reduction
of rent and interest, declared the emancipation of serfs and
slaves, abolished the dependence of serfs and slaves on their
owners, and canceled the usurious debts owed to serf-owners by the
laboring people.
</P>
<P>
With their personal security and freedom guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of New China, serfs and slaves were no
longer subject to forced labor and inhuman treatment by serf-
owners. They started to claim the fruits of their labor, and no
longer suffered from heavy corvee and taxation, nor were they any
longer exploited by usury.
</P>
<P>
-- Abolition of feudal land ownership by serf-owners.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the Tibetan Autonomous Region on
September 21, 1959, passed a resolution on the abolition of feudal
land ownership by serf-owners and the implementation of land
ownership by peasants, deciding on the confiscation of land and
all the other means of production belonging to serf-owners who had
taken part in the armed rebellion, and the distribution of the
properties among serfs and slaves, and the purchase of land and
other means of production from serf-owners with State funds,
allocating the properties among the former serfs and slaves.  (

Tibet now also has Bomda, Damshune and Gongkar airports with

</P>
<P>
In old Tibet, agriculture and animal husbandry were engaged in
with very low productive forces.
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the region's total grain output was only 155,000 tons,
and the total number of livestock was 9.74 million head. In
contrast, in 1998 the total grain output reached 850,000 tons,
there were 22.1 million head of livestock, and the output value of
agriculture and animal husbandry combined came to 4.38 billion
yuan (520 million U.S. dollars), 30.4 times greater than in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Before the launching of the Democratic Reform, more than 90
percent of all Tibetans had no houses of their own, and many serfs
were forced to borrow and beg for a living.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the urban areas of Lhasa consisted of only 20,000
residents and nearly 1,000 poor households including beggars lived
in tents made of shabby gunny bags on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Now, life for the Tibetan people has been greatly improved. In
1998, the per capita disposable income of urban residents in Tibet
reached 5,438 yuan (654 U.S. dollars), higher than that of the
country's average for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income of farmers and herdsmen reached 1,158
yuan (139 U.S. dollars) and the savings deposits of urban
residents came to 3.345 billion yuan (403 million U.S. dollars) in
1998.

are treated equally in the recruitment of workers, cadres and

Since China adopted the reform and opening up policy in 1978,
the State has allocated more than 300 million yuan and large
quantities of materials like gold and silver for the repair and
maintenance of Tibet's lamaseries.

</P>
<P>
More than one million worshipers make the pilgrimage to Lhasa

The serfs and slaves, who made up more than 95 percent of the
population of Tibet, owned nothing, and without personal freedom
they had to leech onto manors of the lords, or else be slaves for
generations.
</P>
<P>
Under the feudal serfdom, serfs suffered from compulsory corvee
labor, taxation and usury imposed by serf owners and lived on the
verge of death. Incomplete statistics indicated the existence of
more than 200 categories of corvee taxes levied by the Gaxag (
Tibetan local government). The corvee assigned by Gaxag and
manorial lords accounted for over 50 percent of the labor of serf
households, and could go as high as 70 to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The serfs, with little income, often had to rely on money
borrowed at usurious rates to keep body and soul together.
According to statistics, usurious loans in total before 1958 were
almost twice the total output value of farming and animal
husbandry, and more than 60 percent of farmers and herdsman ran up
heavy debts, and the figure was as high as 80 percent for Chalba
households. In some villages, everyone was in hock.
</P>
<P>
Serfs were forced to flee from famines and became beggars, and
countless numbers died of starvation and disease. Crowds of
beggars, including the aged and women and children, were often
seen in cities and towns such as Lhasa, Xigaze, Nagqu, and Qamdo.
</P>
<P>
Serfs and slaves had no personal freedom or political status,
while the manorial lords, who owned living bodies of serfs, were
free to trade, transfer, present, mortgage or exchange serfs, who
were seen as private property.
</P>
<P>
The serf owners wielded the power of life and death over the
serfs and the power over their marriage. Male and female serfs
belonging to different lords had to pay a "redemption fee" in
order to marry, and the children of serfs were born as serfs for
life.

And in consideration of the Tibetan people's tradition allowing
polygamy and polyandry, the autonomous region approved the
Accommodation Rules for the Implementation of the Marriage Law of
the People's Republic of China, which insists on the principles of
free marriage and monogamy, but made accommodations that allow the
above-mentioned types of marriages to exist if they were formed
before the promulgation of the accommodation rules, and no party
to the marriage voluntarily applies for an end to the marriage.
</P>
<P>
The religious freedom of the Tibetan people is respected and
protected. The abolition, by means of the Democratic Reform, of
the political system which combined religion with politics
provides institutional guarantees for the Tibetan people to
observe religious freedom and conduct ordinary religious
activities.
</P>
<P>
During the period of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976),
however, in Tibet as in other parts of China, the policy of
freedom of religious belief was disrupted. But when the Cultural
Revolution came to an end, the State adopted many concrete
measures to safeguard freedom of religious belief, resumed some
traditional religious festivals, and repaired many sites and
facilities for religious activities which ensured normal religious
activities in Tibet.

Tibetan women enjoy the equal rights as men in participating in
government and political affairs. Before the Democratic Reform in
Tibet, women in Tibet were at the bottom of the social ladder and
had no political status at all.

<P>
In old Tibet, local governments had codes stipulating that "
Women should not be given the right to participate in State
affairs, and slaves and women should not engage in military and
political affairs."
</P>
<P>
After the Democratic Reform, Tibetan women began enjoying
status and rights as equals to Tibetan men in accordance with the
Constitution and law.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the first general election in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, the participation rate for women in the
elections of deputies to the autonomous regional People's
Congresses has all along surpassed 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, the proportion of female deputies at various levels
of the autonomous region's People's Congresses is above 15 percent.
At the end of 1998, the region had 22,525 female cadres, making up
32.8 percent of the total.

The social status of women has been greatly improved. The
Tibetan women who emancipated themselves in the Democratic Reform
have taken an active part in economic, social and cultural
construction and have gradually realized their equality with men
in social life. Statistics show that women account for 48.5
percent of those who have jobs in Tibet, and in rural and pastoral
areas, women make up over 60 percent of the work force. In urban
areas, over two-thirds of the women above the age of 16 are
employed.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises and institutions in the Tibet Autonomous Region
employ more than 15,000 women, or 39 percent of the total
employees, and among the professional personnel, 12,900 or 40.12
percent of the total are women.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, educational conditions for Tibetan women have
improved and the enrollment rate for girls has been increased from
45.43 percent in 1993 to 71.3 percent at present. The autonomous
region has 1,206 female university students, or 37.69 percent of
the total number of college students.

<P>
The tremendous historical change in Tibet since the launching
of Democratic Reform in 1959 indicates that the abolition of the
feudal serfdom system and the implementation of regional autonomy
for ethnic minorities are the basic reasons for the social
development and earth-shaking improvements in human rights there.
</P>
<P>
Restricted by natural, historical, and economic conditions,
many aspects of human rights conditions in Tibet have yet to be
improved. However, human rights conditions will be constantly
perfected along with social and economic development, as long as
Tibet adheres to the road of socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the implementation of regional autonomy for
ethnic minorities.

The old Tibet had no schools in the modern sense, and only some
2,000 monks and children of the nobility studied in old government
and private schools. The enrollment rate among school- age
children was less than two percent, and the illiteracy rate was as
high as 97 percent. The Tibetan people were deprived of the right
to an education.
</P>
<P>
After the launching of the Democratic Reform in 1959, a modern
multi-layer educational system, including pre-school, primary and
middle school, as well as higher education, adult and secondary
vocational and technical school education, was gradually
established in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Tibet had 4,365 schools with an
enrollment of more than 400,000 students by the end of 1998. The
enrollment rate of primary-school age children reached 81.3
percent, up nearly 80 percent over that of the old Tibet, and the
illiteracy rate dropped by 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
Education is free from primary school through university in
Tibet, and primary schools in the remote areas provide students
with free clothing and room and board. These measures have
effectively protected the Tibetan's right to an education.

However, some people of the upper ruling clique in Tibet were
simply against the reform and preached that there would be no

Confronted by surging requests for democratic reform from the

</P>
<P>
They murdered Central Government officials stationed in Tibet
and cruelly killed those Tibetan people who supported democratic

</P>
<P>
On March 10, 1959 they undisguisedly broke the 17-Article
Agreement, announced the "independence of Tibet," and launched an
overall armed rebellion.

Under such circumstances, the Central People's Government
together with Tibetan people stoutly put down the rebellion in
order to maintain the unity of the country and protect the
essential interest of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the preparatory committee for the Tibet Autonomous
Region on July 17, 1959 adopted a resolution for carrying out
democratic reform. A mighty movement was thereafter launched among
the masses to push democratic reform in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The reform smashed the feudal serfdom system and helped
millions of serfs and slaves realize their dream of the right to
be the masters of their own affairs.

-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin started his three-day state
visit to Mongolia yesterday.
</P>
<P>
China and Mongolia should join hands to develop long-term and
stable bilateral relations based on mutual trust into the new
century.
</P>

</P>
<P>
They should also have a down-to-earth attitude to foster China'

 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China yesterday again refuted the Cox Report, calling its
conclusions "utterly absurd" and contrary to the general knowledge
of basic science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Following the May 31 press conference on the report, the
Information Office of the State Council yesterday issued a 25,000-

</P>
<P>
"The Cox Report shows typical racial discrimination and a
reappearance of McCarthyism," said Zhao Qizheng, director of the
Information Office.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the report collected quite a few examples, but
they were either fabrications or distortions of facts."
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China is expected to ease foreign exchange restrictions on
foreign-funded enterprises to stimulate foreign investment inflows.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, foreign-funded enterprises will
be allowed to use funds in their foreign exchange clearing account
as time deposits, a practice that has been banned up to now. This
will allow them to receive interest and have more freedom in using
these funds.
</P>
<P>
-- A sluggish second quarter has held down the growth of China'

percent.
</P>
<P>
This figure is 0.4 percentage points lower than what the

<P>
PANAMA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuba firmly opposes any U.S.
intervention in any Latin American country, visiting Cuban Foreign
Minister Felipe Perez Roque said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before ending his visit to
Panama, Perez Roque said his country rejects any intent of the
United States to maintain permanent presence in the Panamanian
territory.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba also considers it crucial to search for a peaceful
settlement to Colombia's internal war, saying the current
situation there hinders the process of integration of Latin
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been suffering from chaos of civil wars for a
decade. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the
country's top guerrilla group, clashed with the armed forces in
the past week near Santafe de Bogota, capital of the country. The
fighting was the biggest in 40 years, leaving hundreds of people
killed.

concerns have, for the most part, been tackled.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest's report found that participants, while planning to
continue offering Y2K services over the next 12 to 18 months or
until demand disappears, would focus more toward developing
offerings targeted toward e-commerce, legacy migration/conversion
and enterprise resource planning.
</P>
<P>
Many participating companies said they would actively seek to
form partnerships or purchase companies, which would allow them to
expand new services offerings or grow already established
practices.
</P>
<P>
Although each business development strategy is unique,
Dataquest said, there is one common theme embraced by all service
firms -- Using Y2K professional services as a stepping stone for
capturing new business.

SANTIAGO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chile announced Thursday it will
renew flights to the Malvinas in mid-October following the
agreement made Wednesday between Argentina and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Chile suspended flights to the Malvinas in March in protest
against the detention of Chile's ex-leader Augusto Pinochet in
London on October 16 last year.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Britain and Argentina agreed on a package of
measures, including lifting a ban on Argentines visiting the
Malvinas islands, resumption of direct flights from Chile and
cooperation on fish preservation in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
The pact marked the most significant thaw in relations between
the two nations since they went to war over the islands in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes told the press
that the renewal of flights from Chile to the Malvinas was a
gesture of solidarity with Argentina.

LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Treble winners Manchester United
could still appear in next season's FA Cup, according to the
Football Association on Thursday.

hope during a meeting at Lancaster Gate with representatives from
various supporters' groups.
</P>
<P>
Davies told officials from the Independent Manchester United
Supporters Association, the Football Supporters Association and
the National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs that they
will consider any viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
The fans put some options to Davies, which he has promised to
examine, which would enable United to play in the FA Cup and the
World Team Championship.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to meet again in the middle of next month
and to invite the Professional Footballers Association and the
League Managers' Association.
</P>
<P>
IMUSA chairman Andy Walsh claimed he was encouraged by Davies'
attitude during the two-hour long meeting.

"We remain hopeful and David Davies said the door was not
closed," he said.

"The meeting was very positive and we've agreed to another

"That is what we've wanted all along for a full discussion
involving all the football bodies."

matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a solution, which must meet with Manchester United
's approval, we will give it full consideration.
</P>
<P>
"We have explored every avenue that we see as viable, but we
will continue to listen to any solutions that are brought to the
table," he added.

LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Rio Ferdinand has signed a new
contract with West Ham that will tie him to the club until 2005.
</P>
<P>
The London club was adamant that it would not sell the England
center-back, despite rumoured approaches by Roma of Italy and

<P>
Ferdinand, 20, had signed a seven year deal with West Ham last
year, but is understood to have agreed on an improved contract.
</P>
<P>
It seemed certain that he would stay at Upton Park after Roma
said on Wednesday that the deal to buy Ferdinand was "dead".
</P>

million pounds for the 20-year-old, with offers of a five-year
contract.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Snubs Fulham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Arsenal midfielder Stephen Hughes has turned down a four
million pounds move to First Division Fulham.
</P>
<P>
Left-sided Hughes, transfer listed after failing to force his
way above Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit in the Gunners pecking
order, had talks with Fulham boss Paul Bracewell but decided he
wanted to stay in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Hughes' agent Steve Kutner told the Daily Mail: "When he spoke
with Fulham they impressed him and the opportunity to play a part
in what they are trying to do was tempting.
</P>
<P>
"Paul Bracewell immediately won Stephen's respect with his
approach to the talks we had and we understood that this was an
opportunity where the benefits could have been mutual to club and
player.
</P>
<P>
"But his decision is based on the fact that he wants to remain
a Premiership footballer and is willing to wait until the talks we
are having with another couple of clubs in that division come to
fruition."
</P>
<P>
Liverpool, Aston Villa, West Ham, Tottenham, Middlesbrough,
Everton and Leeds have all been linked with 22-year-old Hughes.
