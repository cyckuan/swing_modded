<HEADLINE> Canada to Control Imaging Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced on Wednesday that
as the ownership of remote sensing satellites moves from the
public to the private sector, Canada is developing new legislation
to control commercial remote sensing satellites.
</P>
<P>
These high-performance satellites can be used for cartography,
natural resources management and surveillance of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
"We need to take steps to ensure that photographs taken by
these satellites are not used against Canada and its allies," said
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy in a release issued here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This new policy will protect national security, help safeguard
human lives and enhance Canadian competitiveness in the growing
space sector," added Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister is leading the government's initiative to
develop new or to modify existing legislation relating to the
commercial owership and operation of remote sensing satellites.
</P>
<P>
This policy will permit Canadian companies to own and operate
satellites in Canada. It will also enable the processing, analysis
and exploitation of data collected by high-performance satellites,
and allow this information to be made available to potential
clients without compromising Canada's security and foreign affairs
interests, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
The process leading to the drafting of the new legislation
began approximately one year ago. The legislative process to
implement the policy is expected to take up to two years, and
implementation would precede the launch of Canada's first
commercial remote sensing satellite.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Policemen to Take Special Training in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of 20 members of the
Tanzanian riot police force, the Field Force Unit (FFU), will
leave for the United States next week on a special training
mission, a police spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Adan Mwamunyange said they will join other 15 Tanzanian police
officers of the Criminal Investigative Department in Richmond
College, Virginia where they will acquire special skills on how to
curb criminal acts on various difficult working conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said at the police head office that senior police officers
like assistant inspectors from various regions of the country are
included in the groups.
</P>
<P>
According to Mwamunyange, the first group left for the United
States on June 4 on the professional training mission to upgrade
their skills.
</P>
<P>
Omari Mahita, the inspector general of police, recently told
his policemen that they need to upgrade their profession skills
through training within the country and abroad so as to be on the
same footing with the increased rate of criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had no serious crimes like treason, abduction and bomb
explosions in the past years, but now the country is facing severe
challenges by local and foreign criminals, said Mahita.
</P>
<P>
"Now there is need for the police force to embark on more
intensive training so as to be well vested in the new techniques
of criminal acts including the international crimes," the police
chief said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, a well-known peaceful land in a turbulent Africa,
suffered a terrorist bomb attack on the U.S. embassy last August
when 11 civilians were killed and more than 70 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The bombing has since enhanced the cooperation between Tanzania
and the United States in the security as well as other fields.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Recovery for Semiconductor Industry Forecasted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ENGELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The global semiconductor market
will show recovery this year and double digit growth through 2002,
according to new forecasts of a U.S. industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
Total semiconductor sales worldwide are expected to reach 140.8
billion U.S. dollars this year, up 12 percent over 1998 -- the
biggest jump and first year of recovery since 1995, said the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). In 2000, sales will
expand to 162.5 billion dollars, an increase of 15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SIA expects the market to continue its momentum in 2001
with sales of 191 billion dollars increasing 17.6 percent. In
2002, global sales will reach 215.7 billion dollars increasing
12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the SIA, the Internet has been the predominate
growth driver for the industry and has demonstrated the shift of
PCs -- a product which drove the industry in the early 1990s -- to
the Internet and e-commerce. "The electronic highway is paved with
silicon chips," said the SIA, expecting the continuation of
Internet traffic growth which will demand infrastructure growth.
</P>
<P>
The America's market will remain the world's largest in the
next four years, representing about one-third of the chip revenues
worldwide, the SIA said. The Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan,
will make a come-back and emerge as the second largest chip
market, shedding the effects of the Asian economic crisis that
contributed to the 4.4 percent decline of that market last year.
Europe will be right behind Asia-Pacific. Japan is still being
impacted by the protracted domestic recession.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says U.N. Resolution Is "Added Factor" to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUMANOVO AIRPORT, Macedonia, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The discussions
on a U.N. resolution over the Kosovo conflict is "an added factor"
to the on-going military technical talks between NATO and
Yugoslavia, said a NATO spokesman here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Robin Clifford, said that although what is
discussed here is a military technical agreement, "the fact that
there is now another moving part to this operation...obviously is
an added factor that has been taken into account."
</P>
<P>
He said: "I would not say the purpose of this resolution has
complicated the discussions" at the military technical talks on
finalizing the details regarding the pullout of Serb forces from
Kosovo, the southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council is doing its business in its own
manner and there is no reason why we should wait, " he said. "We
are very keen to have this done as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
Clifford said that what NATO and Yugoslav delegations are
discussing is the technical agreement that came out of the
political agreement reached in Belgrade among Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Russian Presidential Balkans envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Finnish President and EU envoy Marti Ahtissari
and approved by the Yugoslav parliament over a week ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are not discussing the U.N. Security Council resolution" at
this meeting, which began 9:30 p.m. local time (0830 GMT) Tuesday,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia wants the U.N. Security Council to review and adopt
a resolution on Kosovo before it signs the technical agreement
while NATO has been insisting that Yugoslavia signs the agreement
before the Security Council discusses the G-8 approved resolution
on the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China, both have veto power in the U.N. Security
Council, have been demanding an immediate end to the NATO bombing
campaign so that an environment can be created for the Security
Council to review the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The two-and-half-month-old air strikes have killed thousands of
innocent people in Yugoslavia and destroyed properties worth over
200 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's talks were called off after Assistant Foreign
Minister of Yugoslavia Nebojsa Vujovic left in the afternoon for
Belgrade to have high-level consultations.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic is a member of the senior Yugoslav military delegation
to the talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will resume Thursday morning, said another NATO
spokesman after the departure of the Yugoslav assistant foreign
minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disagrees with Germany on Bombing Stop in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States appeared on
Wednesday to have differences with Germany over suspending the
bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the bombing will be
going on if Yugoslavia fails to withdraw its forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"All the manoeuvering that Milosevic can come up with is not
going to bring this campaign to a conclusion until he makes the
fundamental decision that it's time to leave," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, German Defense Minister Rudolph Scharping
that NATO had "effectively halted" its bombing campaign in
anticipation of an agreement on a Serb withdrawal and the entry of
a NATO-led international security force into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"That is not correct," said Lockhart. "The bombing campaign
continues and will continue until we have a military-technical
agreement and until we see the beginnings of a verifiable
withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also told reporters shortly after Scharping's
statement that the bombing had been reduced but not halted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Rand Ends Weaker Due to Poor Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency,
rand, Wednesday finished the session weaker than its previous
close against the U. S. dollar as players shunned the local
currency which was weighed down by the poor gold price.
</P>
<P>
The rand was last quoted at 6.1240 per dollar from a previous
close of 6.0975. However the rand moved away from an intra-day
worst level of 6. 1290 per dollar tested after mid-day.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was quiet with both local and London
players willing to test the day's bottom and top sides.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said there seemed to be enough buyers and sellers in
the market Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We had players willing to buy dollars when the rand reached
6.1250, and we had sellers on the 6.0800 side too," a dealer
said, quoted by South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Another dealer said: "There was always interest to sell
dollars at the top side. Pity we did not see New York players
today." "There are fears that U.S. interest rates might be hiked
because the inflation rate there is increasing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rand was caught in a tight range of 6.0800 to
6.1300 in the session. The range was not expected to change
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gold price Wednesday tested new lows not seen in more than
20 years.
</P>
<P>
It edged lower to close at 260.60 U.S. dollars per ounce from
its previous New York fix of 261.15 dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
The bond market also failed to improve from its weaker opening
level in the session.
</P>
<P>
The key government bond, the R150, opened the day at a yield of
14.35 percent only to slide and close at 14.37 percent. The bond
ended its Tuesday session at a yield of 14.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> AL Welcomes Saudi-Qatari Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Wednesday
welcomed the final demarcation of the borders between Saudi Arabia
and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the 22-nation pan-Arab forum said the
border demarcation move "will cement relations" between the two
countries and help restore Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The step has proved to the world that the Arab nation "is
capable of settling problems by peaceful means" for the interests
of the Arab people and the establishment of cooperation, security
and stability in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Qatar signed final maps on Monday in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh, defining their long-disputed borders following
nearly three years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over borders had marred relations between the two
Gulf Arab countries, leading to a brief border clash in 1992 that
left two people dead.
</P>
<P>
After the clash, Qatar suspended its border pact with Saudi
Arabia, reached with British involvement in 1965, six years before
it won independence from British colonial rule.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Puppet Troupe Wins Warm Applause in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenyan Cultural Minister Shariff Nassir initiated the show and
said cultural exchanges between Kenya and China would cement the
relations between true friends and encourage bilateral cultural
activities.
</P>
<P>
Puppet is a traditional Chinese art with a history of more than
2,000 years. An Yongyu, Chinese Ambassador to Kenya, said the
performance, the first of its kind in Africa by the Chinese
puppeteers from Chengdu city in southwest China, would introduce
oriental Chinese culture to the Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The performance started with "A concert in the forest", showing
animals singing and dancing to their heart's content and
reflecting a vivid scenery of the harmonic life of people together
with animals.
</P>
<P>
The program also included "plate spinning", "a tortoise and a
crane", " ribbon dance", "happy spring festival" and "dream".
</P>
<P>
"African Dance" performed by the Chinese puppeteers, depicted
vividly a group of African women dancing to the rhythm of
drumbeats, attracted bursts of warm applause from the whole
theatre.
</P>
<P>
Among the audience were senior Kenyan government officials,
diplomats in Kenya and other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese puppeteers will give five-day public free from
Thursday to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving here, the Chinese troupe had performed in
Zambia and Zimbabwe, and after Kenya it will continue its travel
performance to Ethiopia and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Debates Cutoff of Funds for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton adminstration's
Kosovo policy came under new fire Wednesday in Congress as the
House took up Republican-sponsored legislation that would cut off
funds for the operation in the Balkans after Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense analysts estimates the deployment of 7,000 U.S.
troops in Kosovo as part of a 50,000-member international
peacekeeping force would cost U.S. taxpayers up to 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The figure does not include the cost of providing humanitarian
assistance in Kosovo to refugees, or rebuilding homes, factories
and other facilities damaged or destroyed during the NATO air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers are unhappy with Clinton's plan to keep the
peace and want the administration to present Congress with a clear
exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are also worried that the cost of peacekeeping
would be prohibitively high given federal budget constraints, and
say Washington's allies in Europe should spend more on the
operation.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Republicans didn't like the idea of going into Kosovo
in the first place," said House Appropriations Committee Chairman
Bill Young, a Florida Republican.
</P>
<P>
"And there are many who believe that if there is going to be a
peacekeeping force that the Europeans bear responsibility for the
greatest part," he added.
</P>
<P>
Convincing Congress to fund an open-ended peacekeeping
operation in Kosovo will be "very difficult," Young said.
</P>
<P>
Learning from the lessons in Bosnia, the White House has
refused to say how long U.S. troops might be there, saying only
there was no "strict timeline."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has failed to meet two deadlines to
withdraw the American peacekeepers from Bosnia, which was deployed
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Issue Rules for Sales of Food to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is expected to
issue rules to simplify procedures for the sales of U.S. food to
Iran, a top State Department official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rules should be out by the end of the month, and would be
"efficient and nonbureaucratic as possible" so that a lengthy
government approval process does not block sales, Said Stuart
Eizenstat, undersecretary of State for economic and business
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration announced a major policy change on
April 28 that exempts food and medicine from sanctions imposed by
the executive branch on foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
That clears the way for sales to Iran, Sudan and Libya on a
case-by-case basis once new regulations are issued.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the House Agriculture Committee, Eizenstat
also said that the Clinton administration would monitor
competitor activity to determine if U.S. loan guarantees are
needed to make sales to Iran and the two other countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Excluded in Provincial Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's African
National Congress (ANC) was excluded Wednesday from a coalition
government in the Western Cape province although it won most of
the votes, state television, the SABC, reported.
</P>
<P>
Former Western Cape premier, Gerald Morkel of the New National
Party (NNP), announced in Cape Town that his party, the Democratic
Party and the African Christian Democratic Party have decided to
form a coalition in the province.
</P>
<P>
In response, ANC Western Cape leader Ebrahim Rasool said it is
a great concern that the arrangement ignored the vast
constituencies represented by the ANC.
</P>
<P>
He said his party won overwhelming support from the African
voters in the region, together with about 60 percent of coloreds
and rural voters and 40 percent of urban voters.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the three parties could be persuaded in the next
few days to look beyond party political interests for the sake of
"maturity and sanity".
</P>
<P>
However, the three parties said they would not change their
mind, and a provincial cabinet would be announced in a few days,
according to the SABC.
</P>
<P>
Rasool complained that there have been no real inclusive talks
about including his party in the process of forming a coalition
and his party's victory in the region has not been recognized.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have a situation where our victory has not been
recognized.
</P>
<P>
We have not been allowed to play a meaningful role -- we've
never been asked for a dominant role -- in the provincial
government," a disappointed Rasool said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the three-party coalition was "a recipe for
instability" in the Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
In the June 2 elections, the ANC won 18 of the 42 seats in the
provincial legislature, compared with 17 by the NNP, five for the
DP and one for the ACDP.

<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Georgian government and separatist
Abkhazians have agreed on some confidence-building measures in
their three-day peace talks in Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In the Istanbul Declaration issued at the end of the peace
talks Wednesday, the two sides expressed readiness to allow
displaced people to return home, exchange prisoners of war and
encourage economic projects and carry out essential work to
prevent more outbreaks of terrorist activities in Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the talks, U.N. special envoy to the region
Liviu Bota said "the agreed measures went beyond the initial
expectations."
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, a special joint working group
will be set up next week to take up the problem of prisoners of
war.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that a security
line is to be established to separate the two sides and the
U.N. is to find a way to punish those responsible for the violence.
</P>
<P>
Two other working groups will also be formed to work for the
safe return of refugees and displaced people and stablize
agricultural activities. The conflicts have led to 275,000
refugees so far.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to intensify contacts between
political and civil leaders, as well as media representatives.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between central government troops and separatist
Abkhazians broke out in 1992 after the latter declared sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Abkhazians made up about 17 percent of the local
population in Abkhazia but they dominated the parliament of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Commonwealth of the Independent States
peace-keeping forces are monitoring the implementation of a
ceasefire agreement signed by the two sides in 1993.

UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The issue of safety and
security of United Nations personnel would always be at the top of
its agenda, the United Nations Security Council reiterated on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the second summit on the Security and
Independence of the International Civil Service being held here this
morning, Council President for the current month Ismaila Jagne of
Gambia said the safety and security of international staff was a
matter of utmost concern to the entire United Nations system.
</P>
<P>
Ismaila Jagne said as old conflicts persist and new ones
emerge, international personnel deployed to conflict areas
around the world continued to be faced with increasingly
hazardous and very often life threatening conditions.
</P>
<P>
The President pointed out that between January 1, 1992 to
August 31, 1998, 153 United Nations international and local
staff members lost their lives in the line of duty, while 43
were taken hostages.
</P>
<P>
He said this appalling situation required the urgent attention
of member states with the view to taking remedial measures.
</P>
<P>
Ismaila Jagne stressed that member states should be
continuously reminded of their obligations under international
legal instruments.
</P>
<P>
Training of the United Nations personnel on security
procedures prior to deployment was also important in preparing
them for such dangerous and delicate situations, he added.

CONEL may export electricity to Greece, Turkey, Bosnia and
Italy, as importing companies in the respective countries have
shown an interest in it, CONEL managers said.
</P>
<P>
First deliveries will start on July 1 this year and will go to
Turkey. CONEL is currently exporting to the Republic of Moldova on
a contract that started last December.
</P>
<P>
The electricity consumption has declined in Romania in the past
two years and it is going to drop further this year. According to
statistics released by CONEL, Romania consumed 9.1 percent less
electricity in the first four months of this year as compared with
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline in consumption has resulted from the shrinking of
the Romania companies' activities against the background of the
general decline of the economy.

<HEADLINE> PM: Russia-China Cooperation is of Special Significance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said here Wednesday that strengthening Russia-China
consultation and cooperation in various fields is of special
importance for fighting hegemonism and safeguarding world peace
under the current complex and turbulent international situation.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin made the statement while meeting Zhang Wannian,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of China.
</P>
<P>
Both Stepashin and Zhang stressed that the air strikes against
Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO for over 70 days had killed and
wounded a large number of innocent civilians and caused a
humanitarian catastrophe in the Balkan country. They urged NATO to
stop the bombing immediately so as to create necessary conditions
for a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who arrived here Tuesday on an official good-will visit,
said China and Russia, both permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, shoulder major responsibilities in preserving world peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have maintained excellent consultations and
cooperation and share broad consensus in major international
problems such as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He expressed China's gratitude toward President Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian government and the Russian people for their
condemnation of the criminal attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade by the U.S.-led NATO and for their solidarity with and
support for the Chinese people in the wake of the brutal attack.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said that the Russian government would do its utmost
to further implement the consensus reached by the presidents of
the two countries so as to facilitate a continuous progress of the
Russia-China strategic partnership oriented towards the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says not Concerned With Draft Resolutions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi cabinet meeting chaired
by President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday reiterated that Iraq is
not concerned with the draft resolutions submitted to the
U.N. Security Council on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting said Iraq's position
toward the U.N. sanctions is fixed: either to follow the
international law as it is or every country acts according to its
own interests.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that according to the international law, the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq must be lifted immediately and
unconditionally, and the aggressors must be punished and pressured
to compensate for their killing of Iraqi citizens and destroying
of its properties.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France, Britain and the Netherlands have submitted
their proposals on the Iraqi issue to the U.N. Security Council
while the Council remains divided as to how to deal with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq,
discussions on the Iraqi issue inside the Security Council have
reached an impasse.
</P>
<P>
Russia, supported by France and China, have proposed to lift all
the economic sanctions against Iraq while enhancing ongoing
monitoring and verification mechanism in Iraq to address
disarmament issues of the Iraqi military programs.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands have proposed to ease sanctions
against Iraq while suggesting replacing the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons
with an enlarged body to carry out more intrusive inspections of
Iraq's weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has neither agreed to the Russian proposal nor to the
British-Dutch one, insisting that UNSCOM should be allowed to go
back to Iraq to resume its work.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi cabinet meeting again strongly condemned the
U.S.-NATO aggression against Yugoslavia, and criticized the U.S.
for shifting its responsibility for the consequences of its
aggression to the U.N..

PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- France proposed on Wednesday that
two-star general Jean-Claude Thomann be the vice commander of the
Kosovo Peace Force (KFOR), which will be led by British General
Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted sources close to NATO headquarters
in Brussels as saying that France has proposed that General
Thomann assist General Jackson as the number two of KFOR.
</P>
<P>
Thomann is the commander of the Force Number Two of the French
Armed Forces, which was the former nineth division of the Marine
Infantry. He is now based in Nantes, west France.
</P>
<P>
Germany has also proposed a general to be the number two of
KFOR.
</P>
<P>
The final decision over who should be the number two of KFOR

of the NATO Force in Europe.
</P>
<P>
France has mobilized 7,000 soldiers to join the KFOR, while
Germany has mobilized 8,000.
</P>
<P>
The French contingent will be headed by General Bruno Cuche and
will be based in northern Kosovo around the city of Titova
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
Troops from some other nations will also join the French
contingent in one of the five zones to be separately controlled by
France, the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sees Progress in Trade Talks with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A remarkable progress has been
achieved in Egypt's talks with the European Union (EU) over a
trade-related partnership agreement, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting will be held between the two sides in the coming days
to finalize the agreement, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU have been discussing the agreement for more
than three years. The agreement would generally grant Egyptian
products duty-free access to EU markets, and would require Egypt
to phase out customs duties on EU goods over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the agreement have been stalled over the
sensitive issue of the level of access to be granted to Egypt's
agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, acting vice president of the European Commission,
said on Monday during a visit in Cairo that the agreement may be
reached by the end of June after "further concessions were made
(by the EU) in the agricultural area."
</P>
<P>
The EU is Egypt's largest trade partner, accounting for 638
million U.S. dollars of Egypt's exports and 3.6 billion dollars of
its imports in the first half of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Holds Coronation of King and Queen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan held an official coronation
of King Abdullah Bin Hussein and Queen Rania Al-Abdullah Wednesday
evening with thousands of people thronging the streets in Amman
for celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The main celebrations for the coronation were held in the
hilltop Raghadan Palace in Amman, in which military bands,
representatives of public and private organizations, heads of
tribes and visiting foreign dignitaries were taking part.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old monarch was coronated as Abdullah II in
distinction from his great-grandfather King Abdullah, the first
ruler of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Jordanian government announced that June
9 will be marked annually as the Throne day, the first public
holiday in line with King Abdullah II's reign.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday evening, along the main streets in the capital city,
giant portraits of the king and queen were seen here and there and
Jordanian national flags were fluttering over major government
buildings and shops.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people lined the streets, tossing
flowers, clapping and chanting "long live Abdullah," as the royal
couple passed in a motorcade procession.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah took the Jordanian throne on February 7, hours after
his father King Hussein died of cancer. He declared a three-month
mourning period for King Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Russia Against NATO's New Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Russian official said
here Wednesday that Moscow opposes NATO's new strategy because it
means that the military alliance can meddle at will in the
internal affairs of any country under various pretexts.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in the Kremlin with Zhang Wannian,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of China,
Vladimir Putin, secretary of the Russian Security Council and
Director of Federal Security Service, said both Russia and China
advocate a multi-polar world rather than a uni-polar one
championed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who arrived here Tuesday on an official good-will visit,
said the continuous and strengthened consultations and cooperation
between the two countries on major issues of international and
regional security represent an important manifestation of the
development of their strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
He said such a partnership, established in 1996 by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is a
new type of state-to-state relationship of non- alignment,
non-confrontation and against no third countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that military ties between the two countries also
witnessed a smooth and stable development in the past few years
and that frequent exchange of visits by military leaders at
various levels and cooperation in various fields face bright
vistas.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Putin reiterated Moscow's one-China policy,
saying bilateral friendly cooperation should continue to develop
in various fields so as to push ahead the strategic partnership
oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang thanked Russia for its solidarity with and support for
China in the wake of the missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade by the U.S.-led NATO. The attack was a crude violation of
Chinese sovereignty and a serious provocation towards the 1.2
billion Chinese people, Zhang stressed.

<HEADLINE> Warring Sides Urged to Cease Fire in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic courts as well as
neutral political factions Wednesday for the first time called for
a cease-fire between the forces of the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) and those of faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
At a rally well organized by the four Islamic courts in south
Mogadishu, the Moslem scholars expressed their concern over the
deteriorating civil strife and the escalating armed conflicts in
southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ten neutral political factions including the faction
led by Osman Ali Atto have issued their appeal for the cessation
of hostilities in Bay region.
</P>
<P>
They said that the RRA and Aidid's forces should practise
maximum restraint against the spread of more fightings in other
regions.
</P>
<P>
The ten neutral factions are ready to mediate the dispute
between Aidid and the RRA and each side had allegedly showed their
willingness to accept their mediation, Atto told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Islamic courts issued a six-point
declaration, appealing to the warring parties in Bay region, the
RRA and Aidid, to reach a cease-fire and solve their differences
through a peaceful dialog.
</P>
<P>
The delegates at the meeting declared unanimously that the
Islamic courts won't participate in any form of the clannish armed
 confrontations in the country and that they will only remain
confined to their normal duties endowed to them by the religion.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic courts insist that the current difficulties can
only be solved through the implementation of Islamic Sharia laws.
</P>
<P>
They hinted that the Islamic courts oppose Aidid's attempts of
recapturing Baidoa or Bakol region. Aidid's forces lost control
of the important town of Baidoa to the RRA allegedly backed by
Ethiopian forces in a heavy fighting three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic courts also appealed to the international
community, especially the neighboring countries, to stop their
non-constructive intervention into Somali affairs.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council is
scheduled to meet in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday afternoon
to discuss the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will start at 4:00 p.m. EST, and two U.N. Special
Envoys for the Balkans, Carl Bildt and Eduard Kukan, are
expected to brief the 15 Security Council members on their work,
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two special envoys held a coordinated meeting in Geneva on
Tuesday morning, which was attended by U.N. and non-U.N.
representatives, including NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is also likely to touch upon a draft
resolution, presented to the 15-nation body Tuesday by Russia and
seven major Western countries, on how to solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters on Wednesday morning,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters that "it's
possible" that the Security Council will adopt the draft
resolution Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday I told you that within 24 to 48 hours it is possible
to..., we are going to do our best," Annan said in response to a
press question.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held closed-door session on the draft
resolution, and the session adjourned because most members said
that they needed some time for further study of the text and wait
for instructions from capitals.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's acting permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters Tuesday that NATO should stop the
bombing of Yugoslavia, which began March 24, before the Security
Council kicks off the discussion of the draft.
</P>
<P>
Shen's statement was echoed by Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent
representative to the United Nations, who said that the NATO
bombing should come to a halt before the Security Council votes on
the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorization of the Security
Council, unilaterally launched air strikes, which entered its
12th week Wednesday, thus violating the U.N. Charter and
international law.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Oil Experts Discuss Iraq's Need for Oil Spare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Some United Nations oil experts
arrived here Wednesday to discuss with Iraqi oil officials on
allocating incomes from its oil sales to purchase equipment and
spare parts to upgrade the country's oil installations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Iraqi Program Office said in a statement that a
detailed list of Iraq's need for oil equipment and spare parts in
the sixth phase of the oil-for-food program will be presented to
the U.N. Security Council on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has requested that 600 million U.S. dollars be allocated
from its oil sales in the sixth phase, which went into effect on
May 25, for purchase of oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth and fifth phases of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq
was allowed to import in each phase 300 million dollars worth of
oil equipment and spare parts to rehabilitate its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid,
Iraq has only received 20 million dollars worth of equipment and
spare parts in the fourth phase and no contracted spare parts
under the fifth phase have arrived in this country so far.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is planning to increase its oil production to the
pre-sanctions level of 3.25 million barrels per day (bpd) by the
end of this year from the current level of 2.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq has been
allowed to export 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in sixth months
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22
million people.
</P>
<P>
However, it was just able to export 3 billion dollars of oil in
the fourth phase due to the severe lack of spare parts and the
sagging prices on the world oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the United States and British
representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking its
contracts to purchase spare parts and other contracted items.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade on Proposed U.N. Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade Wednesday told the
U.N. Security Council that it wants to see the proposed U.N.
resolution on Kosovo, if adopted by the 15-member Council, ensure
the respect for the U.N. Charter and the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan country also demanded that the United Nations, in
adopting a resolution on Kosovo, take appropriate steps to ensure
that "no security vacuum is created" in Kosovo after the
withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces from the Province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in a letter to the president of the
Security Council from Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
The letter was distributed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister said, "We express our expectation
that, in considering the crisis in Kosovo and Metohija, the
Security Council will, consistent with the Charter of the United
Nations, adopt a resolution that will ensure respect for the
international order established by the Charter, in the interest of
peace and equality of nations and people, and respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, as one of the founding Member States of the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
Belgrade also demanded an end to the continuing NATO bombing,
which entered its 12th week Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the negotiations of military experts are being
completed and that the withdrawal of the forces of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia can begin immediately, we are of the view
that the conditions have been created for a halt to the bombing,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to meet in a closed-door
session on Kosovo at 4:00 p.m. EST Wednesday following its
Wednesday informal consultations on a draft resolution, hammered
out by Russia and seven major Western countries.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, two permanent members who have veto power on
the Security Council, have been demanding an immediate and
unconditional end to the NATO air strikes, which they said that
has violated the U.N. Charter and international law.

<P>
KUMANOVO AIRPORT, Macedonia, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav
Assistant Foreign Minister Nebojsa Vujovic, a member of the
Yugoslav military delegation to the technical talks with NATO,
left here Wednesday afternoon for Belgrade to have high-level
consultations, said a NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
British General Mike Jackson, leader of the NATO delegation,
has decided to call a break in the meeting which will resume
Thursday morning, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described as "generally constructive" this new
round of meeting, which started at 9:30 p.m. local time (0830 GMT)
Tuesday "by the mutual agreement of principles based on the
recommendations of the liaison officers."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, there has been "some difficulties in the
timings of the timetable (of Serb forces's withdrawal from Kosovo)
which involves such things as the G-8 approved U.N. Security
Council resolution tabling," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO wants Yugoslavia to sign the military technical
agreement before the U.N. Security Council can meet to discuss the
proposed resolution over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Yugoslavia insists that before the U.N. Security Council
adopts a resolution on Kosovo, it is difficult for Yugoslavia to
sign the technical agreement, which is designed to guide the
withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, the southern Serbian
province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO spokesman said, "Until he (Vujovic) returns, there is
really nothing more (that ) can be achieved at the working level."
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the Yugoslav side took a break of more than
four hours, during which some members of the Yugoslav delegation
went to the nearby border crossing to report to the higher
authorities in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The meeting resumed around 14:30 p.m. local time (1330 GMT)
before it was called off roughly three hours later.

ROME, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Lazio's international striker
Christian Vieri has been traded to Inter Milan on a world record
transfering fee of 90 billion lire (50 million U.S. dollars), the
Rome club announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement released by Lazio said the deal involved Inter's
Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone joining Lazio for 21 billion
lire (11.36 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lazio, who won the European Cup Winners' Cup last month with
Vieri's first goal in a 2-1 win over Mallorca in the final, paid
Atletico Madrid 28 million U.S. dollars to get Vieri back to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Vieri will join Ronaldo at Inter Milan to form the most
expensive striking line in world soccer.
</P>
<P>
The deal beat the previous world's highest transfering fee of
35 million U.S. dollars which Betis paid for Brazilian Denilson in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Vieri scored 12 goals this season for Lazio, who was one point
short of the league winners AC Milan to finish second in the Serie
A.

Addressing the second summit on the Security and Independence

</P>
<P>
"This meeting could hardly be more timely. The United

the security of the U.N. staff should be dealt with as a matter of

The safety and security of staff was a non-negotiable issue
and the United Nations would use every opportunity to lead the

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China's absorbing foreign
investment has achieved satisfactory results, Ma Xiuhong,
assistant minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the nation's newly approved foreign investment
contracts were valued at 52.102 billion U.S. dollars, inching up
by 2.15 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Paid-in foreign investment stood at 45.463 billion U.S. dollars,
a rise of 0.46 percent over the year before and hitting a record
high, Ma said at a seminar on China's investment policy.
</P>
<P>
She said Hong Kong's position as the largest source of
attracting foreign investment in the Chinese mainland remains
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of April this year, the
mainland has attracted 180,653 direct investment projects from
Hong Kong with a contractual value of 30.651 billion U.S. dollars
and an actual value of 14.271 billion U.S. dollars, respectively
accounting for 54.8 percent, 51.48 percent and 51.40 percent of
its total figures for the same period.
</P>
<P>
Ma attributed the satisfactory results in absorbing foreign
investment mainly to the appropriate measures, the country's
political stability, sustained and healthy development of the
national economy as well as the increasingly improved investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese government has intensified its efforts to
encourage foreign investment in the central and western areas and
also to encourage foreign enterprises already in operation in
coastal areas to make reinvestment in the central and western
areas while continuing to expand the absorption of foreign
investment in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Ma stressed need for further expansion of the areas for opening
up.
</P>
<P>
In the commercial retailing aspects, she said the relevant
departments under the State Council are formulating methods for
the examination, approval and administration of foreign-invested
distribution enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the insurance sector, four more foreign-invested insurance
companies are approved to start operations in China. Besides
Shanghai and Guangzhou, more municipalities and cities will be
opened up, which include Shenzhen, Chongqing, Dalian and Tianjin,
she added.

<HEADLINE> Race Incidents Increasing in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of racist incidents
continues to rise, according to the Commission for Racial Equality
(CRE) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said fewer people turned to the CRE for help last year,
despite the increased prominence given to race issues following
the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death in a racist murder in 1993 at
a bus-stop in Eltham, south-east London. No one has been charged
with his murder.
</P>
<P>
The CRE warned of worrying signs that the number of racist
incidents is still going up. Since the 1980s, the ratio of black
and Asian people who are unemployed compared with the white
population has risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
The commission was calling for reform of the Race Relations Act
to include the police, and said there must be a determination to
make racial equality a reality.

<HEADLINE> Epidemics Control Possible In Africa: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
said Wednesday that Africa can prevent and control epidemics if
correct measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director Ebrahim Samba told delegates to a
five-day conference of southern African health and interior
ministers in Harare that the first major component of epidemic
preparedness and response is detailed epidemiological
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Samba said that this involved the use of various categories of
reporting sources from semi-literate people at the village level,
through nurses and doctors at the district level, to highly
qualified epidemiologists in national ministries of health.
</P>
<P>
Other components of effective epidemic control comprise the
availability of strategically placed local laboratories, effective
communication and case management, the WHO official noted.
</P>
<P>
It is also important to have adequate stocks of vaccines and
medicine to treat people, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Samba said that disease control efforts in Africa should be
cross- national, because modern transportation systems facilitated
mobility of citizens frequently traversing national borders.
</P>
<P>
"If one country is at risk, all countries are at risk," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
He also said health education is the key to public awareness
and also the role of the media in designing and disseminating
appropriate messages to facilitate community participation.
</P>
<P>
Samba emphasized the need to be open in admitting the presence
of diseases or epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will hopefully adopt a protocol of cooperation in
epidemic preparedness and control in southern African countries
and Indian Ocean islands.
</P>
<P>
The protocol is expected to promote cooperation among
signatories in the areas of integrated communicable disease
surveillance, management of epidemics, case management, the
strengthening of laboratories and international cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Targets 500 Mln Dollar Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expecting to have 500
million U.S. dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) during the
current fiscal year (July 1998-June 1999), said Chairman of the
Board of Investment (BOI) of Pakistan Humayun Akhtar Khan here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The portfolio investment remained very low during the current
fiscal year while we are expecting 500 million dollars of FDI by
the end of June," he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The BOI chairman said before 1990, foreign investment was
non-existent in Pakistan which was a closed economy at that time.
</P>
<P>
During 1990-91, the country for the first time got FDI of 216
million dollars. Pakistan obtained 350 million dollars of FDI and
288 million dollars of portfolio investment in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
During the year of 1995-96, mainly due to investments in the
power sector, FDI touched its peak with 1.1 billion dollars of
inflow.
</P>
<P>
After that year, Akhtar said, FDI began to level off and in
1996-97 it fell to 650 million dollars and around 600 million
dollars during fiscal 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, around 30 percent of FDI came in the
energy sector. Besides, the sectors of mining, chemical,
petrochemical and refining etc. also received considerable
investments.
</P>
<P>
Akhtar also informed that an investment of about 200 million
dollars is expected in the automobile sector during the next
fiscal year beginning from July.
</P>
<P>
Three foreign companies - Fiat of Italy, Daihatshu of Japan and
Oka Car of Russia - have had negotiations with the Pakistani
government on starting production in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The world-wide recession and the economic sanctions imposed on
Pakistan after it carried out nuclear tests last May have affected
the FDI inflow, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
However, with the international investment climate showing
signs of improvement and the domestic economy determined to come
out of the blue, the officials are expecting an increase in FDI
during the next fiscal year, Akhtar said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-doping Rules Should Be Changed: Pantani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am a clean rider. My conscience is clear. I have nothing to
do with doping," the reigning Tour de France champion said at a
news conference held in Toscanella Di Dozza of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Pantani was kicked out of the Giro on Saturday, two stages from
his second consecutive triumph in the prestigious race, when tests
showed unusually high levels of red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
The high counts can signal the use of the banned growth hormone
EPO, but also can occur naturally.
</P>
<P>
He called for revisions to cycling's anti-doping rules, and
referred to the test which led to his expulsion from the Giro as
an "ambush."
</P>
<P>
"We'll discuss my future at another time," said the Italian, a
member of the Mercatone Uno commercial team. "This is a moment for
reflection. I am trying to understand many things."
</P>
<P>
Pantani, 29, would not say if he will defend his crown at the
Tour de France, which starts July 3. Last year's Tour was rocked
by a doping scandal that took the race to the brink of suspension.
</P>
<P>
International Cycling Union doctors performed the tests on
Pantani and other cyclists hours before the start of the 21st
stage of the 22-stage Giro. He held a lead of more than 5 minutes
over second-place Paolo Savoldelli at the time.
</P>
<P>
Pantani was prevented from starting in the leg and barred from
competing for 15 days, and 1997 Giro winner Ivan Gotti went on to
take his second title.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble to Cut 15,000 Jobs over Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
announced on Wednesday a global restructuring program which will
eliminate 15,000 jobs, or about 13 percent of its work force, and
close about 10 plants worldwide over six years.
</P>
<P>
The changes are to be implemented beginning this year, the
Cincinnati-based consumer products maker said. They are part of
what P&AMP;G calls its Organization 2005 program designed to increase
sales, get new products to market more quickly, cut costs and make
the company more responsive to market changes, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the company, which makes Crest toothpaste,
Tide detergent and Pampers diapers among other products, will
create seven global business units based on product lines.
Currently, the company is organized with four segments based on
geographic regions.
</P>
<P>
Management said 42 percent of the job cuts will occur in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 29 percent in North America,
16 percent in Latin America and 13 percent in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The company said 10,000 of the job cuts probably would occur
through fiscal 2001, which ends June 30, 2001. The rest will come
in the following three years.
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;G's last major restructuring was a 1993 reorganization that
was designed to reduce expenses to 12 percent of sales. That
program involved closing 30 plants and eliminating 13,000
positions throughout the world. Most of those job cuts came from
early retirements, attrition and buyouts.

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday ordered federal law enforcement officials to collect
data on the race and gender of the people they stop to question or
arrest in an attempt to fight against racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced the executive order at a roundtable on civil
rights as a way of encouraging state and local officials to
examine their own law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
The president is also expected to make "a very strong
statement" about racial profiling undermining community confidence
in law enforcement and to voice support for a bill before Congress
that would provide funds for states to collect similar data, the
Associated Press said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on the Treasury, Justice and Transportation
departments to develop a proposal within 120 days to collect data
on the race, gender and ethnicity of people they stop.
</P>
<P>
The study would affect, for example, Customs agents and
Immigration and Naturalization officials at U.S. ports of entry,
as well as the police who patrol U.S. parklands.

<P>
Minorities are legally equal with the white in the United
States, but discrimination against them is common in their daily

handle confrontations with minorities.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Call Center Service Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Service providers with
capabilities in various customer care systems, especially call
centers, are in high demand worldwide, according to a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, revenues of the global call center services market
totaled 23 billion U.S. dollars, said the report from U.S. market
research firm International Data Corporation (IDC). By 2003, its
value will exceed 58.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The market growth has been driven by customer care. "In the
turn-of-millennium business world, becoming more customer-centric
is a high priority at many companies," said the IDC's report.
"competitive pressures, deregulation, and customer behavior are
all converging to push companies into developing strategic plans
for their customer care processes." Consequently, call centers and
other service providers with capabilities in various customer care
systems are in great demand.
</P>
<P>
IDC divides the overall call center service market into
consulting, systems integration and outsourcing. Outsourcing is by
far the largest part of the market. In 1998, it totaled 17 billion
U.S. dollars, or 74 percent of the call center service market. By
2003, IDC expects this segment alone to reach 42 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why many companies prefer to rely on outsourcing
partners, IDC said that companies are dealing with increased
competitive pressures, larger and more geographically dispersed
client base and more expansive technology infrastructures.
Meanwhile, outsourcing partners have the technology, processes and
people already in place.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the United States has a significant lead over
other regional markets for call center services. In 1998, its
revenues totaled 12.2 billion dollars, or 53 percent of the
worldwide market. The U.S. market will account for 30.7 billion
dollars by 2003, while other regions will increase revenues at a
compound annual growth rate of 32 percent between 1998 and 2003.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Seyed Alireza Marandi,
former Minister of Health and Medical Education of Iran, and the
Viet Nam National Committee for Population and Family Planning on
Wednesday shared the 1999 United Nations Population Award.
</P>
<P>
The Award is presented annually by the Committee of the United
Nations Population Award to individuals and institutions which
have made outstanding contributions to increasing the awareness of
population problems and to their solutions.
</P>
<P>
As Deputy Minister of Health (1983) and then Minister of Health
(1985), Dr. Marandi promoted primary health centers, extending
programs against polio, measles, diarrhoeal and respiratory
diseases.
</P>
<P>
He championed reproductive health activities, encouraging
breast-feeding, longer child spacing and raising the age of first
birth.
</P>
<P>
He convinced the government that family planning was not in
conflict with Islamic teaching and that it had great value for
individual and national health.
</P>
<P>
The Viet Nam National Committee for Population and Family
Planning was set up in 1984 as an umbrella organization to monitor
and coordinate all activities in the population and family
planning sector. It also formulates population policy and is
partially responsible for the drafting of legal, regulatory and
other population and family planning related protocols and
standards.
</P>
<P>
The award was created by the United Nations General Assembly in
1981 to raise awareness about the economic and social implications
of population trends, particularly as they relate to development.

KUNMING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest China

opened on June 6.
</P>
<P>
The projects involve a total investment of 4.49 billion yuan (
541 million US dollars), with 2.16 billion yuan coming from
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair, the seventh, comes at a time when Kunming, "the
city of spring", is the focus of world attention as it hosts the
World Horticulture Exposition.
</P>
<P>
During the trade fair, agriculture, tourism, pharmaceuticals,
construction of infrastructure facilities and transfer of property
rights of the state-owned enterprises have been warmly welcomed by
domestic and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
On June 8 alone, 13 prefectures and cities of Yunnan signed 40

<HEADLINE> NATO Troops Pouring Into Macedonia for Entering Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ABLE SENTRY, Macedonia, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Army
Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters were flying in, landing and
taking off a few moments later, busy with ferrying weapons,
military equipment and American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Apache helicopters flew in at 14:45 p.m. local time (
1345 GMT) Thursday from the Rinas Airport in Albania's capital
city Tirana to this U.S. army base, about 19 kilometers east of
Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
NATO was said to use these Apaches, known as tank-killers in
the West, to protect NATO troops when they move into Kosovo to
carry out what NATO calls a peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
This might happen within this week or early next week although
NATO officers were tight-lipped about when they would start to go
into the southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are just getting the troops in place and waiting for orders
to come," said Major Erik Gunhas, Task Force Falcon Public Affairs
Officer.
</P>
<P>
As many as 15,000 U.S. soldiers were to be moved from the Rinas
Airport to Macedonia Thursday alone, Gunhas said. U.S. marines
were also arriving from Greece, where they landed from a U.S. ship.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 16,000 NATO troops are stationed in
Macedonia and additional 14,000 NATO soldiers have started to
arrive here.
</P>
<P>
NATO has a plan to deploy some 48,000 soldiers in Kosovo to
form the Kosovo Force or KFOR, of which 7,000 troops will come
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Around 13,000 UK troops are arriving in the Balkans and another
6,000 are on stand-by, making it the largest single contingent.
Germany, which is providing a quarter of all NATO troops in
Macedonia and Albania, will be sending 8,000 troops into the
province.
</P>
<P>
France and Italy are reportedly ready to contribute 7,000 and 5,
000 soldiers respectively.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 48,000 NATO troops will enter Kosovo
through Macedonia because there is a good highway linking Skopje
and Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO mine specialists will go hours in advance to clear mines
and engineering soldiers to build bridges along the highway to
make it safe and easy for the NATO troops driving toward Pristina.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is scheduled to meet at 11:00 EST on Thursday to discuss a draft
resolution, hammered out by Russia and seven major Western
countries, on how to end the Kosovo crisis, U.N. officials
announced.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after NATO suspended its air campaign on
Thursday upon the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo, a
Serb province.
</P>
<P>
Security Council members worked hard into late night on
Wednesday in a bid to narrow the gap among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, acting Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters Wednesday that China would "find it
difficult to support" the resolution without the amendments.
</P>
<P>
"China is the best defender of the U.N. Charter," Vladislav
Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United
Nations, told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters on Thursday
morning, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters that
the adoption of the draft resolution is very important.
</P>
<P>
"I think it gives a legal basis. It authorizes the deployment
of the troops, as well as interim administration in Kosovo, and
therefore, one is on a legally authorized operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think first of all, the troops, the international security
troops are supposed to go in to secure the environment," he
said. "I hope to do some de-mining, to prepare the ground for
the refugees to go in."
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana wrote to Annan on
Thursday, saying that "FRY (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)
security forces have begun to withdraw from Kosovo in accordance
with these agreed procedures and modalities. NATO is monitoring
the FRY's compliance closely. Against this background, NATO air
operations against the FRY have been suspended."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is determined to focus on humanitarian
assistance and post-war reconstruction in Kosovo after the
adoption of the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
Car Bildt, U.N. special envoy for the Balkans, told reporters
on Wednesday the task ahead "is going to be the most challenging
and complex peace implementation operation ever undertaken by the
international community in modern times."

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes Peace Agreement for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Thursday welcomed the
peace agreement reached by NATO and Yugoslavia concerning the
terms for Serb withdrawal from and the entry of a NATO-led
multinational peacekeeping force into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Athens airport shortly before his departure for
Germany, Foreign Minister George Papandreou said the agreement
opened the way for peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The end of the war in Yugoslavia did not mean an end to all the
problems which had been created, he said, adding that the tackling
of humanitarian problems was a top priority.
</P>
<P>
He said Greece had requested some organizations coordinating
the Balkan reconstruction efforts to be based in the northern
Greek city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Nikos
Athanassakis said Thursday that Greece would continue to work for
regional peace and the return of the Kosovo refugees to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Greek troops to participate in the multinational
peacekeeping force for Kosovo were ready to go as soon as
conditions permit.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Mainland, Top Source of Visitors to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese inland areas have
overtaken Japan as the top source market for visitor arrivals to
Hong Kong since 1997, said an official from the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
This is fully reflected in the figures given by the HKTA, B. Y.
Wong, chief representative of the Beijing Office of the HKTA. He
told Xinhua in an exclusive interview recently at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center here.
</P>
<P>
-- Last year, a total of 2.6 million mainland visitors came to
Hong Kong, which showed a 13.1 percent rise over 1997 and
accounted for 27 percent of its gross visitor arrivals;
</P>
<P>
-- In the first four months of this year, the mainland visitors
to Hong Kong surpassed one million, representing one third of the
total number of visitors to Hong Kong during the period;
</P>
<P>
-- It is estimated that Hong Kong will play host to more than 2.
9 million mainland visitors this year, a 12.5 percent increase
than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wong noted that the number of Hong Kong's visitor
arrivals to the mainland is also on the rise, reaching to some 30
million.
</P>
<P>
This means that every resident in Hong Kong pays an average of
four or five visits to the mainland annually as Hong Kong has a
population of 6.8 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the reasons for the sustained increase of the
mainland visitors to Hong Kong, Wong said after Hong Kong's return
to China in 1997, the economic relationship between Hong Kong and
the mainland is closer than ever before, thus bringing more and
more mainlanders to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2.6 million mainland visitors to Hong Kong last year, 1.
8 million came here for business and the remaining 800,000 for
sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between the central government and
the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
earlier last year, the number of mainland visitors to Hong Kong
has risen from 1,142 to 1,500 everyday since last July.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's favorable outbound policies and a shorter visa
processing time keep the steady growth of the number of visitors
to Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who has been working in the Beijing Office for two years,
said other favorable factors for boosting more mainlanders to
travel Hong Kong also include the former's sustained economic
growth and the improving people's living standard as well as lower
expenses for tourism due to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the Hong Kong Tourist Association
intensified its efforts to launch various kinds of colorful
promotion activities in Shanghai, Xi'an, Guilin, Guangzhou and
Kunming, enabling more mainlanders to get a better understanding
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In order to lure more mainland visitors to Hong Kong, Wong said
the Hong Kong Tourist Association will concentrate its efforts on
setting up a good image of Hong Kong and protecting well the
fundamental interests of tourists from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
A hot line in different languages such as Chinese, Cantonese
and English especially set up by the HKTA and the Shanghai Office
of the HKTA, the nineteenth of its kind in the mainland, is
expected to be opened in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a week for Hong Kong will be held in Kunming from July
3 to 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the mainland is abundant in natural resources for
tourism while Hong Kong is a unique city meeting East with West.
</P>
<P>
By making full use of their respective advantages, he believed
that both Hong Kong and the mainland can maintain sustained
development of the tourism industry in future, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-led NATO Troops Ready to Enter Kosovo: Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday said that U.S.-led NATO troops were prepared to enter
Yugoslavia's sovereign province of Kosovo as Serb troops started
leaving.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed at a White House briefing that he had consulted
with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana before Solana announced
suspension of 79-days of bombing against Yugoslavia, which has
claimed thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
The United States was "waiting for the United Nations to pass"
a G8-drafted resolution to justify NATO's entering Kosovo, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post says that with the movement of U.S.-led
NATO troops into Kosovo, NATO is to "rule in Kosovo," the
sovereign territory of Yugoslavia, under the name of imposing so-
called Western standard of human right at the cost of the U.N.
Charter and the international norms.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Washington is trying desperately to change
the United Nations into a rubber stamp so that it could take any
actions it intends to take under its name.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China is keen to work with African
countries to develop a new world in the 21st century, State
Councilor Wu Yi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark in a meeting with African guests who are
here for the second China-Africa Seminar for Economic and
Management Officials, and ambassadors of the African participating
countries to China.
</P>
<P>
During a two month seminar which started in April, more than 20
participants from 14 African countries have made various research
tours of China and visited some coastal and inland provinces and
cities.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wu said that the Chinese government will
encourage Chinese enterprises to promote processing trade with
African countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
She said that Chinese leaders place great importance on the
development of Sino-African friendship and cooperation, noting
that the seminar proposed by Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
another reflection of the promotion of Sino-African friendship and
common development.
</P>
<P>
She said that a deep traditional friendship between the Chinese
and African people was established by leaders of the two sides,
and pointed to the fact that many African countries have offered
invaluable support for and had cooperation with China in human
rights, Taiwan and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China has provided economic and technological
assistance for Africa as much as it can, adding that Sino-African
friendship has stood the test of time and the changing
international situation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese state councilor said that China adheres to an
independent foreign policy of peace, and holds that each country
is an equal member of the international community, no matter how
big or small, rich or poor it may be.
</P>
<P>
She added that China opposes hegemonism and power politics, and
holds that a new international political and economic order should
be established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-
existence.
</P>
<P>
Wu also briefed the participants on China's experience in its
reform and opening up drive and the introduction of foreign
capital.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on Natural Disaster Management Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 120 scholars and
government officials from 40 countries gathered here today for the
opening of an International Symposium on Natural Disaster
Management.
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Chinese government and the United Nations,
the symposium will discuss effective ways to prevent and mitigate
natural disasters and exchange experience in natural disaster
relief, prevention and management.
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will also seek a way for the United Nations to
play a fuller role in preventing and responding to natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Chinese president Jiang Zemin in a congratulatory letter,
explained that in 1998 China suffered from severe flooding along
the Yangtze River, the Nenjiang River and the Songhua River. Under
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese
Government, the entire nation won a total victory against the
floods.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that reducing natural disasters is a long
term task facing all nations. The launching of the 'International
Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction" has given a boost to the
global disaster prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the Chinese government has attached great
importance and rendered assistance to the relevant activities, and
that the country stands ready to intensify international exchange
and cooperation in a bid to enhance its ability to manage natural
disasters and contribute to international disaster prevention
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Civil Affairs Duoji Cairang delivered an
opening speech and an official also spoke at the opening ceremony
on behalf of Sergio Vieira de Mello, Under Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs and the Emergency Relief Coordinator of the

<HEADLINE> Stake Deal Breaks Off Between Singapore Airlines, News Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Airlines (SIA)
Thursday issued a statement expressing its disappointment with a
decision by News Limited to withdraw its offer to sell its 50
percent stake in Ansett Airlines, the second largest airlines in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
SIA and News announced on March 25, 1999 that they had reached
an understanding on the sale which was then described by local
media as "adding a wing to SIA."
</P>
<P>
The transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half
of 1999 and SIA's top executive had envisaged it would brought
profit to his company within a year after the deal.
</P>
<P>
Noting Air New Zealand has the pre-emptive right to match any
offer to buy News' stake and SIA met with Air New Zealand several
times to discuss their waiver of this right, SIA said in its
statement that now the question of this waiver no longer applies
as News has decided to withdraw its offer to sell.
</P>
<P>
SIA said it had looked forward to partnership in the Australian
airline and believed that its presence in Ansett would benefit all
parties concerned, including Ansett and its employees, the other
shareholder Air New Zealand, Australian tourism and the traveling
public.
</P>
<P>
An ownership in Ansett would have cemented the alliance between
SIA, Ansett and Air New Zealand, SIA said, reaffirming that it
will continue to work with its two partners to ensure the success
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
SIA will continue to be a major partner in the Australian
aviation scene, carrying more travelers and cargo into and out of
Australia than any airline other than Qantas and Air New Zealand,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Confirms Serb Troops Starting Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said on Thursday
that Serb forces had began leaving Kosovo but NATO bombing had not
yet been suspended.
</P>
<P>
"We know that one MUP (special police) unit has left," Pentagon
spokesman Ken. Bacon said, adding the police unit departed Kosovo
at about 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT).
</P>
<P>
He said the United States wants to "see a lot more flow" of the
Serb troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached by NATO and Yugoslav officials on
peaceful settlement of the Kosovo crisis, NATO should end bombing
once Serb troops begin leaving their sovereign province.
</P>
<P>
But Bacon said it was too early to know whether NATO's top
commander, U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, was ready to recommend
to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana that the allied bombing
campaign be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Also, other Pentagon officials said allied warplanes were
continuing to fly over Kosovo on Thursday to monitor the situation
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 heavily armed U.S. troops were moving toward
Kosovo on Thursday, ready to "rule in Kosovo" as the Washington
Post said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Security Officials Dismissed on Courtroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Several Lebanese security officials
and police guards were dismissed Thursday, with some of them taken
into custody on charges of dereliction of duty in a courtroom
killing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Those dismissed included Bragadier General Fadi Madi, the chief
of interior forces in south Lebanon, an official statement said.
</P>
<P>
Another two security officers were also relieved of their
office and detained, along with three police guards of the court in
the southern port city of Sidon, where the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, at least two gunmen broke the windows of the
courtroom in Sidon and opened fire on a four-man tribunal which was
trying a Palestinian on currency forgery charges.
</P>
<P>
The Presiding Judge Hassan Othman, 63, Prosecutor Assem Daher,
39, Judge Walid Harmoushe, 40, and Judge Imad Shahab, 49, were
killed. Two lawyers, a court clerk and two police officers were
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen escaped after the shooting without taking away any
defendants in the courtroom. The motive behind the attack has not
been established.
</P>
<P>
Several parliament members were said to have launched a
campaign after the killing to pressure Interior Minister Michel
Murr into resignation, accusing him of being responsible for the
security gaps.
</P>
<P>
The government has ordered military control in Sidon and more
checkpoints have been set up at the entrance to the city and on
the roads leading to the Palestinian camps in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
Security officials said the attack might be linked to two
Palestinian defendants awaiting trial for murder who face
possible death sentences.
</P>
<P>
Some 356,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon, mostly in refugee
camps in and around Sidon.
</P>
<P>
The city has been rocked in the past two years by a series of
violence involving Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Govt. Presents New Budget to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Finance Gerald
 Ssendaula has presented to parliament the budget for 1999/2000
fiscal year in which defense spending is reduced and emphasis is
put on increasing household incomes.
</P>
<P>
In the budget submitted to the legislature Thursday afternoon,
the finance ministry only suggested 177 billion shillings (120
million U.S. dollars) for the defense, almost 20 percent down from
that of the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Most eye-catching in the new budget is the increase of Poverty
Action Fund. The level of funding will increase 85 percent to 154
billion shillings (110 million dollars) from 83 billion shillings
(60 million dollars) of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to improve infrastructure, and encourage
local manufacturing industries, according to the new budget.
</P>
<P>
"Non-wage expenditures have gone down because a one-time
investment to equip the force has been carried out in the current
year," said SSendaula.
</P>
<P>
However, he said in order to provide security for the country
and its national parks, the ministry will provide additional
funding by way of salaries for new recruits in the army.
</P>
<P>
In the coming financial year, the government plans to
rehabilitate 620 kilometers of feeder roads while 10,000 kms and
1,000 kms will be routinely and periodically maintained
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will, in the near future, jointly
prepare a project costing 100 million dollars with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project will focus on resettlement of displaced people,
reconstruction of public infrastructure, rehabilitation of
agriculture and others, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Economy Robust: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Thursday that the country's economy is strong and robust and
it is expected to grow faster in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks here when commenting on the
newly prepared budget for the year 1999/2000 in capital Kampala
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told Parliament that the gross domestic product (GDP)
of the east African country is expected to grow by 7.8 percent in
the current fiscal year ending this June.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very high growth rate by all standards because it is
more than twice as fast as the average for all developing
countries, which is estimated by the International Monetary Fund
at only 3.3 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's focus should be put on how to increase the
homestead incomes of farmers and get more people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visits to the north, the president reiterated
this determination at different public rallies.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 42 percent of the country's 22 million people
are still living under the poverty line of one U.S. dollar one
day.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged farmers to produce coffee, tea and other
income-generating cash crops.
</P>
<P>
Education is the key to poverty elimination, he noted. With
the launching of Universal Primary Education (UPE) program in
early 1997, the primary school enrolment has soared up to 6.5
million pupils, more than doubling the pre-UPE figure.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Young Scientists Urged to Work Harder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua)-- China's young scientists have been
urged to take up the chances offered by the country's rapid
development and work towards building a stronger China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here today that there are many
important subjects in the areas such as the economy and social
development to be tackled, which provides great opportunities for
the young scientists to put their knowledge into practice.
</P>
<P>
Looking back in history, Zhu said that the most renowned
scientists made major achievements at around the age of 30, adding
that China's development gap with the advanced countries results
mainly from backwardness in the areas of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also promised better working conditions for young
scientists and made the remarks in a meeting to mark the fifth
anniversary of the state foundation for outstanding young
scientists at the Great Hall of the People today. Tsung Dao Lee, a
Nobel prize winner, was among the scholars.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has helped over 400 people in their researches,
80 percent of whom have studied overseas and returned.

UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council

Western countries, on how to end the Kosovo crisis, U.N. officials

</P>
<P>
The announcement came after NATO suspended its air campaign on
Thursday upon the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters on Thursday morning,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters that the adoption
of the draft resolution is very important.
</P>
<P>
"I think it gives a legal basis. It authorizes the deployment
of the troops, as well as interim administration in Kosovo, and
therefore, one is on a legally authorized operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think first of all, the troops, the international security
troops are supposed to go in to secure the environment," he said.
"I hope to do some de-mining, to prepare the ground for the
refugees to go in."
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana wrote to Annan on Thursday,
saying that "FRY (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) security
forces have begun to withdraw from Kosovo in accordance with these
agreed procedures and modalities. NATO is monitoring the FRY's
compliance closely. Against this background, NATO air operations
against the FRY have been suspended."

DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister A.M.S.
Kabria Thursday proposed an annual development program (ADP) of
1,550 billion taka (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars) for the
forthcoming July 1999-June 2000 fiscal year, with 49.50 percent of
the fund coming from foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ADP outlay is 13.9 percent higher than that of the
previous fiscal year's original allocation and 10.7 percent higher
than the revised allocation.
</P>
<P>
Kabria made this proposed ADP while presenting the budget for
the 1999-2000 fiscal year in the parliament here Thursday

</P>
<P>
The ADP envisages that the country will generate 78.33 billion
taka (about 1.62 billion dollars) from its own resources while the
remaining 76.67 billion taka (about 1.58 billion dollars) will
come from donors.
</P>
<P>
Of the external resources, 83.8 percent of aid will be provided
in the form of project assistance, 12 percent in the form of
commodity assistance and 4.2 percent in food aid.

<HEADLINE> China to Crack Down On Pirated Audio-Visual Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Culture is to
launch a nationwide publicity campaign next week pitched at
fighting the pirated audio-visual products trade. The theme is
that selling pirated products is illegal and using them is harmful.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-piracy publicity, which will become an annual event,
should be deepened nationwide so as to foster a social climate
under which intellectual property rights (IPR) are well protected
and copy right violations severely punished," said a circular
recently issued by the Ministry.
</P>
<P>
China has made sound achievements in perfecting the system of
copy right protection, and eliminating pornographic and other
illegal publications.
</P>
<P>
The circular required that those running and managing audio-
visual markets should receive training in the laws and regulations
adhering to the sector. Administration staff should also be more
capable of differentiating pirated products from authorized ones.
</P>
<P>
"People or companies who are involved in infringements of IPR
will receive severe punishments," according to the circular. It
called for localities to encourage the running of piracy-free
model shops, and to guide customers to buy authentic products.
</P>
<P>
A brochure on the management and marketing of audio-visual
products has been published to support the campaign.

<P>
SINGAPORE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has become a party to
Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships, the Television Corporation (TCS) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This annex, which applies to all ships including yachts,
fishing vessels, and offshore platforms, comes into effect from
August 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 91 countries, or 83 percent of the world's merchant
shipping fleet, have joined the protocol, TCS said the annex will
also ban Singapore ships from discharging plastic into the sea and
restrict their discharge of other materials, including dunnage,
food wastes and rags.
</P>
<P>
Masters of any Singapore ship who are found to have polluted
the sea anywhere in the world with garbage, could face a maximum
fine of 20,000 Singapore dollars (11,628 U.S. dollars) and/or a
maximum prison term of two years, TCS said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police dealt with 180,000
drug cases involving more than 230,000 people last year, the
Public Security Ministry has reported.
</P>
<P>
Police seized 7.3 tons of heroin, 1.6 tons of the drug ice",
and 5.1 tons of marijuana last year. These were up 34.3 percent,
20.5 percent, and 137 percent respectively from the figures the
year before, vice-minister Bai Jingfu said at a National
Narcotics Control Commission meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 34,000 people were arrested, and some 27,000
sentenced and no large-scale growing of opium poppies has been
discovered since the ban on poppies was enforced, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the anti-narcotics work has won great
support from the public as a result of the national exhibit that
toured the country last year, attracting 160 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
China established 860 drug rehabilitation centers, using
different methods such as work, education, and medical treatment
to get 140,000 people off drugs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 344.5 tons of chemical products used for making
drugs was confiscated last year, Bai said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Environment Department Urged to Check on Dioxin Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Medical
Association (MMA) Thursday urged the Department of Environment
(DOE) to check on chemical plants and pesticide factories that
might release toxic chemical like dioxin during their operation.
</P>
<P>
President of the association P. Krishnan said dioxin, formed by
burning chlorine based chemical compounds with hydrocarbon, was
one of the most toxic chemicals known.
</P>
<P>
"Workers directly involved in this dioxin-generating processes
should be given adequate protection and appropriate training on
their work," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Dioxin is released by paper mills, by metal smelters, by many
chemical plants and pesticide factories and also factories that
make the popular plastic PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Krishnan also said usually high concentration of dioxin in
milk and animal fats has been reported to occur near to sources of
dioxin emission from industrial processes that generate or use
organochlorides.
</P>
<P>
"Since dioxin is fat soluble, it bioaccumulates up the food
chain and it is mainly found in meat and dairy products."
"Ingestion of both soil and plants by cattle in such areas can
then lead to elevated levels of dioxins in milk or animal fat," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Malaysian Health Ministry ordered a ban on all
canned meat and dairy products from EU countries which had been
contaminated with dioxin. Exposure to dioxin not only caused
cancer but also caused severe reproductive and development
problems, according to the association.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After 78 days of NATO bombing, Yugoslav military commanders
signed an agreement Wednesday night to withdraw their forces from
Kosovo beginning Thursday, making way for the entry of U.S. and
allied peacekeeping troops and the return home of more than a
million ethnic Albanians. NATO officials said the bombing would be
suspended as soon as they can verify that a pullout has begun.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Wednesday directed federal law enforcement
agencies to collect information on the race, ethnicity and sex of
people they detain for questioning, a move aimed at developing
data needed to determine whether they unfairly target miniorities.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The street lights came on in downtown Belgrade Wednesday
night for the first time in 10 weeks. Crowds who had gathered
spontaneously in the main square sent up a raucous cheer,
celebrating both an end to the war and an end to the blackouts
that have plagued residents. Joy and bravado combined to lead many
to proclaim victory.
</P>
<P>
-- North Korean and South Korean military vessels confronted
each other in the second day of a standoff over alleged intrusions
into each other's waters. No shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's slow vote count raised fears of tampering and
damped euphoria over the fairness of Monday's elections. Less than
8 percent of ballots have been tallied, well behind the promised
pace. Officials blamed technical factors, but foreign obsevers are
expressing concern.
</P>
<P>
-- Lockheed Martin halved its 1999 earnings estimates and
disclosed for the third time in six months that problems at its
military-aircraft and space divisions are worse than thought.
Analyst and investor unrest seems to be gaining. The disclosure
drove Lockheed's stock down 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's GDP Growth Falls Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's real growth rate of
gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at 3.1 percent in the
outgoing fiscal year ending on June 30 against the budget forecast
of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in the country's annual economic survey, also
known as the pre-budget document, released here Thursday by the
Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The mere GDP growth rate of 3.1 percent in the current fiscal
year is also lower than the 4.3 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The slower-than-expected GDP growth rate in 1998-99 fiscal year
was attributed to "poor performance of agriculture and "weak
performance of manufacturing and services sectors," according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
During the current fiscal year, Pakistan's agriculture, the
mainstay of its economy, grew by only 0.35 percent against the
budget forecast of 5.4 percent. The growth rate of agriculture in
the previous fiscal year was 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to what Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said unfavorable weather
conditions and reduction of growing areas, production of major
crops in 1998-99 declined by 0.6 percent against a higher growth
of 8.3 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, value added in large-scale manufactures increased by
2.7 percent in the current fiscal year against a high growth of
7.6 percent achieved in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficit in 1998-99 is estimated to be reduced to 4.7
percent of GDP from 5.4 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, the
trade deficit stood at 1.208 billion U.S. dollars against 1.322
billion dollars in the corresponding period of last year,
registering an improvement of 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to the economic sanctions imposed after the detonation of
nuclear devices last year and the overall economic recession in
the region and the world, Pakistan's exports and imports in the
current fiscal year declined remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the first 10 months of 1998-99 show that exports
declined by 11.7 percent to 6.307 billion dollars and imports
declined by 11.2 percent to 7.515 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit during the first nine months of the
current fiscal year has widened to 1.536 billion dollars, against
937 million dollars of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic survey, net foreign portfolio
investment (FPI) declined by 53 percent in the first nine months
of 1998-99, standing at a mere 300.7 million dollars as against
639.9 million dollars in same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the declining trend was less severe in foreign direct
investment inflows which declined to 296 million dollars during
the first nine months of 1998-99 as against 436.1 million dollars
in the comparable period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers' remittances, one of the major sources of
Pakistan's foreign currency, stood at 874.6 million dollars in the
first 10 months of the outgoing fiscal year, registering a decline
of 31 percent over the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR CE's Report Seeking Assistance from Central Government Made Public: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The report submitted by the
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
HKSAR) to the Central People's Government (CPG) on May 20, 1999
concerning the right of abode issue is being made public here in
Hong Kong, an HKSAR government spokesman announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CPG has accepted the report and will approach the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) for an
interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Basic law, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The report refers to the fact that the HKSAR government's
understanding of the true legislative intent of the relevant
provisions of the Basic Law is different from the Court of Final
Appeal's (CFA's) interpretation and that the effect of the CFA's
judgments delivered on January 29, 1999 would place unbearable
pressure on the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The report states that the HKSAR is no longer capable of
resolving the problem on its own. The Chief Executive has reported
to the CPG the problems encountered in the implementation of the
Basic Law, and has requested the State Council to approach the NPC
Standing Committee to interpret Articles 22 (4) and 24 (2) (3) of
the Basic Law according to the true legislative intent.
</P>
<P>
"We await the NPC Standing Committee's decision and hope that
the Central Authorities appreciate the difficulties which the
HKSAR faces," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Business Potential in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East is a market
worth pushing with untapped business potential, according to an
executive of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Anna Lai, TDC's deputy executive director, said the Middle East
is an "emerging market with vast potential."
</P>
<P>
Its "stabilizing situation, liberal trade policy and rising
demand for a variety of consumer goods all point to positive
prospects for Hong Kong companies," said Lai, who has just
returned from TDC's high-level mission to Dubai and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
To foster closer economic ties between Hong Kong and the region,
the TDC has signed a mutual cooperation agreement with the Bahrain
Promotions and Marketing Board during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both sides will step up efforts to promote
bilateral trade and business relations, and to enhance exchange of
trade inquiries, business missions and market information.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a 12-member mission, led by Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang, also met key economic ministers and influential chambers of
commerce in Dubai and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
According to the TDC, bilateral trade between Hong Kong and the
Middle East amounted to 26.9 billion HK dollars (3.4 billion U.S.
dollars), roughly two-thirds of which were exports from Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Reserves Drop in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserves stood at 1.514 billion U.S. dollars as of May 31, a
decrease of 9.3 percent from the amount 12 months ago, Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria told the parliament in his budget
speech Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The present reserves was "adequate to meet 2.3 months' import
requirements and it is satisfactory at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fall in foreign exchange reserves "is not at least
unexpected" considering the devastating flood last year, the
dramatic rise in importing food after wide-spread crop losses and
a decelerated growth in exports, said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The private sector imported 3.055 million tons of food grains
in the 1998-99 fiscal year which ended at the end of June, a sharp
increase from the 1.149 million tons in the previous year, and the
government's target of import of food from its own resources rose
from 350,000 tons to 1 million tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
The total bill for additional food import in the current fiscal
year was about 733 million dollars, while imports during the first
seven months of the year registered a growth of 5.7 percent
compared with the corresponding period of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The flood and an unfavorable international economic climate had
slowed down the export growth, according to the minister. During
the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, exports increased
in dollar terms by 2.99 percent only, with the exports of the
manufactured goods hard hit the price of primary exports
plummeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The price of jute fell by 34.06 percent, leather by 38 percent,
tea by 2.84 percent and frozen shrimp by 13.74 percent, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
To ease the pressure on the reserve situation, the government
took loans of 138 million U.S. dollars from the International
Monetary Fund and 200 million dollars from the International
Development Association for emergency imports, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir's Bid to Drop Defamation Suit to Be Heard On July 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, 10 June (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohammad's application to strike out a
100-million-ringgit (about 26.32 million dollars) defamation suit
brought against him by Anwar Ibrahim will be heard on July 2, a
High Court judge said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
High Court judge Datuk Dr R.K. Nathan said senior assistant
registrar Norliza Othman would hear the application.
</P>
<P>
Anwar filed the suit on January 25, claiming that the prime
minister had falsely and maliciously spoken to local and foreign
reporters in accusing him of committing immoral acts.
</P>
<P>
The former deputy prime minister claimed that Mahathir uttered
the words knowing that they would be published locally and
internationally.
</P>
<P>
In his statement of defense filed on March 22, Mahathir
contended that he spoke the words as prime minister on an occasion
of qualified privilege.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Anwar said the defense of qualified privilege is
not open to Mahathir because he has acted maliciously and in bad
faith by uttering and causing the offending words to be published
and republished.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked by Mahathir on September 2 last year, is
currently serving a six-year jail after being found guilty of
abusing his power.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Regions Remain Favorite Destination Of Foreign Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- When the '99 Zhejiang Investment
Promotion Fair ended here today, officials announced that this
booming coastal province in east China has signed 360 contracts
involving some 2.1 billion US dollars of foreign investment in
merely three days.
</P>
<P>
The largest investment promotion activity in the history of
Zhejiang, the three-day fair, hosted by the picturesque port city
of Ningbo, has attracted more than 2,900 overseas business people,
including 300 from Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of the fair is just great!" exclaimed a senior
official with the Zhejiang provincial government. "You know, the
total foreign capital the province attracted last year was only 1.
8 billion US dollars."
</P>
<P>
Local economists believe the success of this Ningbo fair has
conveyed a message that China's coastal regions, which have taken
the lead in the country's two decade long reform and opening up
drive, remain the first choice of many foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that every year nearly 90 percent of the
foreign investment China has attracted goes to the coastal regions,
which include the country's most prosperous and modernized cities
and provinces, such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangdong. In 1998,
many of the coastal provinces absorbed more than 10 billion US
dollars in foreign investment each.
</P>
<P>
In order to narrow the huge gap between the coastal regions and
the inland areas, in recent years the Chinese government has taken
a series of measures encouraging domestic and foreign investors to
go to the country's central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that this will inevitably lead to intense
competition for foreign capital between the coastal and inland
regions, but for the time being it seems that foreign investors'
strong interest in the coastal regions has not been diminished.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, 10 June (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's application to strike out a 100-million-ringgit
(about 26.32 million U.S. dollars) defamation suit brought against
him by Anwar Ibrahim will be heard on July 2, a High Court judge
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
High Court judge Datuk Dr R.K. Nathan said senior assistant
registrar Norliza Othman would hear the application.
</P>
<P>
Anwar filed the suit on January 25, claiming that the prime
minister had falsely and maliciously spoken to local and foreign
reporters in accusing him of committing immoral acts.
</P>
<P>
The former deputy prime minister claimed that Mahathir uttered
the words knowing that they would be published locally and
internationally.
</P>
<P>
In his statement of defense filed on March 22, Mahathir
contended that he spoke the words as prime minister on an occasion
of qualified privilege.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Anwar said the defense of qualified privilege is
not open to Mahathir because he has acted maliciously and in bad
faith by uttering and causing the offending words to be published
and republished.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked by Mahathir on September 2 last year, is
currently serving a six-year jail after being found guilty of
abusing his power.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Regions Remain Favorite Destination Of Foreign Investment (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The coastal area boasts the country's best investment
environment," commented Zhao Xiguang, a board advisor to the Sun
Chase International Group (China) Limited, a large investment
company with its headquarters in the United States. "And the
Yangtze River Delta, where many famous cities like Shanghai,
Nanjing and Hangzhou are located, has a surprisingly huge market
potential."
</P>
<P>
Zhao didn't receive an invitation from organizers of the Ningbo
fair, but he managed to fly in here one day prior to the fair's
opening and participated in it with the assistance of the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign participants of the fair acknowledged that they
were "greatly encouraged" by the fact that the coastal regions
have maintained a high speed economic growth despite the negative
impact of the Asian financial crisis. They were also attracted by
the convenient traffic, advanced telecommunications network and
other outstanding infrastructure facilities in the coastal area.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Wang Zhile with the International Trade
and Economic Research Institute under the MOFTEC, many foreign
investors stick to the coastal regions just because they have
earned profits from their earlier investment and they want to
inject more money in a place which they have become quite familiar
with.
</P>
<P>
"At present some coastal provinces have started to get more
money from foreign businessmen who invested earlier rather than
from first time investors," noted Wang.
</P>
<P>
During the Ningbo fair, several internationally famous foreign
companies, such as the US-based Exxon Corporation and the Japan-
based Mitsui &AMP; Co. Ltd., signed agreements with Zhejiang to
increase their investment in the province by a total of more than
500 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, China's coastal regions formerly attracted foreign
capital with preferential policies granted by the central
government, but now they have turned to improving the overall
investment environment, such as bettering government service and
promoting the rule of law, to maintain their appeal to the
investors," said Hiroshi Takikawa, general manager of the Mitsui &AMP;
Co. (China) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Starting its investment in China 15 years ago, the Mitsui
Company now has eight joint ventures and one representative office
in Ningbo alone, which have a total investment of 160 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Boosts Efforts to Curb Steel Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical watchdogs
and enterprises have been urged to enhance efforts in reducing
steel production in the remaining months of this year.
</P>
<P>
It must be curbed at 54 million tons or less if China is to
fulfill the targets set early this year, Wang Wanbin, director of
the State Administration of Metallurgical Industry (SAMI), said
here today at a national televised conference.
</P>
<P>
It was projected that China would reduce steel output to 104
million tons this year, 10 percent down from last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, China has to keep the monthly steel output
within 8 million tons in the next seven months, with the daily
output dropping from 330,000 tons to 270,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
China's steel output hit 114 million tons in 1998, up 27.4
percent from 1993. However, steel revenue dropped from nearly 30
billion yuan to last year's just over 2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that curbing steel production is the key for the
industry's restructuring. "China's metallurgical organizations
should strictly follow the timetable set forth by the State
Council and more efforts will be made from June to more
effectively curbing production," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that from January to April, the country's overall
steel production was decreasing on a monthly basis. However, he
stressed that it was still not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that steel producers will not enhance efficiency
merely by reducing costs, if steel production cannot be curbed.
</P>
<P>
He urged 46 key steel and iron companies to take a lead in
curbing steel production. Their steel output accounts for some 85
percent of the country's total, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Shi also called for more strictly controlling steel import.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Sets Probe on Marcoses' Bank Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate' blue ribbon
committee is set to go on with the investigation of the alleged 13
billion U.S. dollars of Swiss bank account purportedly in the name
of Irene Araneta, the youngest daughter of late president Marcos.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to establish, once and for all, whether the Irene bank
account exists, and if so, where it can be found and where it came
from," senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr., chairman of the committee,
said Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Pimentel said the committee decided to investigate the matter,
after receiving documents from former solicitor general Frank
Chavez on the alleged existence of the so-called Irene account at
the Union Bank of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Chavez, along with human rights lawyer Alex
Padilla, arrived in Manila from Australia, bringing with him a
videotape that would prove the existence of the Marcoses'
ill-gotten wealth, including tons of gold, deposited in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Chavez told a press conference at the airport upon his arrival
that he was able to secure new evidence from TV journalist Peter
Muhler in Germany and not only from Australian treasure hunter
Rainer Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
Jacobi, who will be represented by Padilla during the Senate
investigation, was tapped by the previous Presidential Commission
on Good Government to help in tracking the Marcos deposits in
Switzerland. He is supposedly in possession of documentary
evidence on the existence of the money.
</P>
<P>
Pimentel explained that the committee will merely continue its
investigation of the Marcoses' hidden wealth which started last
year.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was undertaken pursuant to a Senate
resolution after Mrs. Marcos demanded the return of 500 billion
peso (12.5 billion dollar) worth of assets allegedly belonging to
her family and allegedly entrusted into the custody of business
cronies of the late strongman.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Vietnam to Enhance Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and Vietnam Thursday
expressed their determination to bring their traditional relations
of solidarity and friendship to a new level.
</P>
<P>
In a joint declaration issued at the end of a two-day visit to
Cambodia by Le Kha Phieu, general-secretary of Vietnam's Communist
Party Central Committee, the two sides expressed their
satisfaction with the "excellent" relations existing between the
two countries and the results of Phieu's "historic" visit.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their determination to strengthen their
long-standing friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of
respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
non-use of force or threat to use force, and not allowing any
political and military force to use one's territory against the
other.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to maintain high-level meetings and
enhance contact between the two peoples, especially between the
young generations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Cambodia and Vietnam pledged to make efforts to resolve
their border issues before the end of the year 2000, in order to
transform the Cambodia-Vietnam border into one of lasting peace
and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu expressed his sincere gratitude to Cambodia for
its equal treatment to the Vietnamese residents and the guarantee
of their legitimate interests, their normal life and work like all
other foreign residents in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides shared the same view on various regional and
international issues of mutual concern. They reiterated that the
use of force is not the solution to human problems, insisting that
all disputes and conflicts must and can only be settled through
peaceful negotiations on the basis of respect for independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, the right of
self-determination of all peoples, non-interference in the
internal affairs of other states, and respect for international
laws and the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
Both countries also reaffirmed their policies of friendship
with all countries in the world, particularly with the neighboring
countries. They also expressed their determination to further
promote and uphold the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) spirit of friendship, solidarity, cooperation,
non-interference and equal and prosperous development as enshrined
in various ASEAN treaties and declarations.
</P>
<P>
Phieu and his party wounded up their visit and left here

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees Hold Demonstration in Bhutan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bhutanese police arrested 80
Bhutanese refugees who launched a peaceful demonstration Thursday
in Phuntsholing, a border town in Bhutan, the organizer said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutan Gorkha National Liberation Front (BGNLF) was
scheduled to organize a mass return to Bhutan of the Bhutanese
refugees residing in eastern Nepal but due to a heavy rainfall,
only 84 heads of the families went through India to Phuntsholing
for the demonstration led by BGNLF Secretary General R.P. Subba,
I.B. Pathak from the group told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The Royal Bhutan police arrested 79 heads of the families
along with our secretary general at 10:30 a.m. with banners,
placards and posters," the group said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It said: "R.P. Subba and all the arrested demonstrators have
been taken under custody to the office of the Superintendent of
Police, Phuntsholing, Bhutan, for interrogation."
</P>
<P>
I.B. Pathak said the mass return program will be rescheduled.
Under a treaty between Bhutan and India, Bhutanese citizens can
travel through India as passengers.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The BGNLF was formed in December 1994 to protect the refugees
or the Bhutanese Gorkha communities living in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The organization has been seeking constitutional guarantee and
protection of the Bhutanese Gorkha communities, shared
representation in the National Assembly of Bhutan, immediate
repatriation of the refugees and the establishment of an
independent judiciary in Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan had held seven rounds of ministerial talks
over the refugee issue but failed to reach any agreement. Bhutan
insisted that it would take back only those of genuine Bhutanese
origin.

<HEADLINE> Gold Management System Close Up to Market Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Frequent adjustments in the price
of gold in China in keeping with international market fluctuations
have improved China's gold market.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's
central bank, say that the bank has adjusted gold prices twice
between May 20 and June 9, cutting the purchase price by 7.2
percent and the selling price by 3.8 percent. The former is down
from 81.36 yuan to 71.64 yuan per gram, narrowing the gap between
it and the international market price.
</P>
<P>
China's prices have long been under strict controls and had big
differences between the purchase and sale price. A bank spokesman
says that although the old system had a significant role in
stabilizing prices and promoting the development of the gold
industry, it no longer meets the economic development needs along
with the economic reforms.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Anti-Drug Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's drug-control authorities
have decided to come down harder on drug dealers and to increase
education to stop the drug epidemic.
</P>
<P>
In order to stop the growing drug business, the number of
police in major drug manufacturing and trafficking areas will be
increased, according to Jia Chunwang, minister of public security
and director of the National Narcotics Control Commission.
</P>
<P>
There should be education campaigns in schools, on the street,
and in rural areas for youngsters and other high-risk people to
reduce new drug users, Jia told a commission meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that China has become both a conduit for
international drug trafficking and a consumer of drugs, making
drug-control work even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
China had 596,000 registered addicts last year, a rise of 9.1
percent from 1997, and 2,033 counties, or 71 percent of China's
total number of counties, have reported drug problems.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Public Security Bai Jingfu said that China's
drug-control situation is still critical because of both outside
and inside factors like loopholes in narcotic drug controls and
some chemicals that can be used to make illegal drugs.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raps U.S., Israel's Stance on Arrest of Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Thursday termed the stance of the U.S. and
Israel over the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on espionage charges for
Israel as "an interference in Iran's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Asefi expressed regret that the U.S. and Israeli authorities
have made "irresponsible remarks" over the arrest of Iranian Jews
and cited the remarks as a result of "lack of information and
pre-judgement."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the allegation by the U.S. and Israel that the
Iranian Jews were arrested for religious reasons, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Religious minorities in Iran enjoy their full social and
religious rights and have played an active role in the country's
affairs, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian judiciary would independently follow up the case
relating to the 13 Jews arrested for spying for Israel and their
trials would be held based on Iran's relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
Iran confirmed on Wednesday that 13 people had been arrested
in the southern Fars province on charge of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. and Israeli officials called for release of the
Iranian Jews, but they denied any links between the Iranian
Jews and the Israeli and U.S. intelligence services.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Lifts Ban on Food Products From Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Food products from Norway have
been given the green light to return to the Singapore market after
nearly one week's ban, the Singapore authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Environment Ministry (SEM) and the Primary
Production Department (PPD) said in a statement that the ban is
lifted because Norway has proven their food products free from
contaminated cancer-causing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
All Norwegian food, including processed meat, egg and egg-based
products, milk and dairy products, chocolates, biscuits and pasta,
are allowed to be sold at retailers and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
This is because Norway has provided sufficient assurance that
its products were only from within the country, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore imported from Norway 1.4 tons of canned beef and
canned pork valued at 12,000 Singapore dollars (7,017.54 U.S.
dollars) from Norway this year.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the first among 11 European Union countries, whose
food products have been banned from supermarket shelves in
Singapore, to be declared dioxin-free.
</P>
<P>
If one foreign manufacturer can certify that its products have
no links to contaminated imports from Belgium and produce from
affected farms, it would be allowed to sell them again, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Parents in the country now find it difficult to buy daily items
like infant milk powder and infant foods for their babies because
of the ban slapped on June 5.
</P>
<P>
No company which makes infant formula has been able to assure
the ENV that its products are safe and the Health Ministry has
been providing information to parents on what sort of alternatives
they can use for their babies.

<P>
Ren Hongguo, director of the Chinese Figure Skating Executive
Center, said USI gave a lesson to some bold judges, but insisted
the incident was just individual affair in the internationals.
</P>
<P>
"The USI made a fair resolution to the incident, and the
punishments are the most severe one in the skating world ever,"
Ren told Xinhua on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"But such misconduct is individual affair, and has nothing to
do with the USI," Ren added.
</P>
<P>
USI banned Russian Sviatoslav Babenko three years, while Alfred
Korytek of Ukraine two years, not to officiate at any championship
or international event under USI jurisdiction. Ren said USI has
released the suspending statement to national associations a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian journalist captured with his camera Korytek and
Babenko exchanged a glance as Chinese pair Shen Xue and Zhao
Hongbo finished their dance in the pairs event at the world
championships in Helsinki in March.
</P>
<P>
The tape was handed in the organizing committee immediately
after the final of the pair event, and China was informed of the
incident half an hour after the end of the final, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
But China filed no dissatisfaction or inquest to change the
results to USI though the Chinese favorite were beaten to the
silver medals by Russia's Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze.
</P>
<P>
"Local media asked us to hold a news conference, but we denied,
" said Ren. "Because we know the news conference could make more
damage to the skating judging system."
</P>
<P>
"We lost the gold medals, but we won the hearts of the fans.
We'll come back next year."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Economy Grows 5.2 Percent in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's gross domestic product
registered a 5.2 percent growth in the 1998-99 fiscal year ending
on June 30, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria told the
parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh never experienced such high growth rate in the wake
of a devastating flood," which "is much robust than that of other
developing countries," Kibria said in his budget speech.
</P>
<P>
Despite a prolonged catastrophic flood from July to September
last year, the country's economy bounced back to normalcy due to
effective macro-economic measures, resulting in a growth rate of
67 percent higher-than-expected average growth rate in developing
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister attributed the growth mainly to "the
remarkable success of rehabilitation program of the government in
the agricultural sector," which he said as a whole would have a
growth rate of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The highest growth was projected in the mineral sector at 21.5
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector was expected to grow by 6.5 percent,
transportation sector by 6 percent, and the growth rate of the
manufacturing sector would be limited to 2.5 percent, according to
Kibria.
</P>
<P>
The inflation in April based on the average monthly inflation
rates of the last 12 months (May 1998-April 199) stood at 8.97
percent, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The National Natural Science

</P>
<P>
Zhang Cunhao, the foundation's director, said at a meeting for
the 5th anniversary of the fund for outstanding young Chinese

backing during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Another special fund for young Chinese scientists living abroad
was set up last year to encourage them to return to China.
</P>
<P>
The average age of the scientists receiving support from the
funds is 37 and some 80 percent of them have studied abroad and
returned to China, 94 percent with a doctor degree.
</P>
<P>
Some outstanding young scientists like Chen Zhu, Bai Chunli,
Wang Zhixin, and Liu Depei, who were supported by the funds, have
been made acandemicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering.

NEW DELHI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- India held Jammu and Kashmir
Democratic Forum (JKDF) Thursday welcomed the coming Indo-Pakistan
foreign ministers' talks saying that dialogue between India and
Pakistan was the "best way" to solve the Kargil crisis.
</P>
<P>
JKDF President Bhushan Bazaz expressed the hope that the visit
by Pakistan Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz to New Delhi on June 12
would end in "de-escalation of the tension" between the two
countries due to the Kargil developments.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue is the most appropriate way of sorting out
differences and it is high time that the two countries solve the
Kargil crisis without escalating it into a war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deterioration of the situation can be dangerous as both the two
countries have got nuclear weapons," he said.

issue "permanently" for everlasting peace in the region, saying
that otherwise Kargil-like situation could arise again.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Interest Rate Cut to Benefit Economic Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's renowned economist, Xiao Zhuoji, said that the cut is
both necessary and well timed. One reason is that since the last
cut at the end of 1998, prices have continued to decline and
interest rates for one-year fixed term deposits remained above
seven percent, which is very high by anyone's terms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lowering of interest rates will have many
benefits like promoting investment, reducing the cost of issuing
treasury bonds, stimulating consumer spending, pushing capital
market development forward, and restoring investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts agree that the decision to cut interest rates was
made after taking the current economic and financial situation
into consideration and is expected to create a more reasonable
environment for enterprise reforms and economic development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they point out the fact that the cut on deposits
is bigger than that on loans will help improve financial
institutions' margin spread and their profits and enhance their
ability to reduce financial risks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Interest Rate Cut to Benefit Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's decision
to lower interest rates as of today has been called by economists
a significant way to solve the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, announced an
interest rate cut on deposits of one percentage point on average
and of 0.75 percentage point on loans.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the bank has had seven interest rate cuts on both
one-year deposits and loans of more than 50 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianing, director of the Financial Research Office of the
State Council's Development Research Center, said that the cut was
to be expected given the current economic state and that it should
play an active role in helping solve some critical problems in
economic development like the continued downward trend in prices
and lack of market demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that the move will help alleviate the burden on major
investors like enterprises and banks, improve their profitability
and eventually undo the corporate debt chains and promote the
reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the interest rate cut does not mean changes
in the country's macro-economic or financial policy, but rather
that China should stick to its tight monetary policy and continue
the economic restructuring efforts.

industries, tea, coffee, cashew, rubber, sugar cane and sugar
refining, fruit and vegetables, sericulture, cereals and
fisheries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Determined to Solve Crisis in Niger-Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
is scheduled to meet on Friday representatives of the feuding
Ijaw, Itsekiri and Urhobo communities in Port Harcourt of Rivers
State to solve the crisis in Niger-Delta region.
</P>
<P>
Following a closed-door meeting presided over by the president
at the State House in capital Abuja on Wednesday, a peace meeting
of opinion leaders and traditional rulers of the three communities
would be held in Warri on Thursday, according to Doyin Okupe,
president's special assistant on media and publicity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the resolutions to be reached at the Warri meeting
would be passed on to the Port Harcourt meeting, adding that
far-reaching decisions and final agreements leading to eventual
peace in the Niger-Delta region would be announced after the
meeting, The Post Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Okupe noted that "it is a long-standing problem and therefore
it cannot be resolved in one day but there is a lot of confidence
in the President's capacity and ability to resolve this issue."
</P>
<P>
Senator Fred Brume, one of the Ijaw leaders, was quoted as
saying on Wednesday that his group believed in President
Obasanjo's ability to address the problem in the Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Ijaw community Edwin Clark said that the Ijaws
had faith in Obasanjo's willingness to find a solution to the
problem which emanated from the regime of the late Head of State
General Sani Abacha with the relocation of the headquarters of the
Warris southwest local government from Ogbe-Ijoh to Ogidigben.
</P>
<P>
The latest violent clashes broke out in Warri last week,
prompting the Delta State governor to declare state of emergency
with security agents directed to shoot at sight any individual or
group posing a threat to peace and security.

<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States needs to conduct
an investigation of the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia in a just, thorough and responsible way,
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference that if the United States is
sincere about improving bilateral relations it should carry out an
investigation that way. However, China has not received any report
on the embassy attack from the United States so far, she added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack on the Chinese embassy has greatly affected the
feelings of the 1.2 billion Chinese people and has adversely
affected the Sino-U.S. relations, she said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministry Says China Wants New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua)-- China is calling for the
establishment of a new world order that will ensure a long-term
stable and peaceful international environment, Foreign Ministry
Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
The more than 200 countries in the world and more than six
billion people should not and cannot be put under the control of
one country or group, she said, emphasizing that multi-
polarization has become an irreversible historical trend after the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
A country's affairs should be handled by its own people and
international issues should be resolved through negotiations, she
said, adding that the United Nations, the organization that has
the largest number of member nations and that is most
representative, should play a dominant role in international
affairs and that this is common sense in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The common wish is for the establishment of a just and
reasonable new political and economic order in the world, she said,
one that must first help create a long-term peaceful environment
for the development of all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
It must also represent the common interests of all people and
embody the development and progress needs of the time, she said.
</P>
<P>
The basis of the new world order, she said, should be the five
principles of peaceful coexistence and other international norms.
</P>
<P>
The five principles refer to mutual respect for each nation's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-
interferance in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual
benefits, and peaceful coexistence.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Steps Up Agricultural Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- As the Philippines celebrates its
101st anniversary of independence on June 12, the government is
putting on the fast-track the implementation of its centerpiece
program of agricultural modernization and food security.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine President Joseph Estrada, the program
would make sure that food is available to all Filipinos, thus
empowering the small farmers and fisherfolk to achieve true
independence.
</P>
<P>
With the enactment of the Agricultural Modernization and
Fisheries Act, a law authored by Secretary Edgardo Angara of the
Department of Agriculture (DA), the president would be able to
realize his vision.
</P>
<P>
The president has ordered the Department of Budget and
Management to increase the budget of the DA next only to the
Department of Education, Culture and Sports.
</P>
<P>
The increase of DA budget would give the DA a 16.7 billion peso
(417.5 million U.S. dollars) outlay for this year, enabling it to
address the problems of lack of irrigation systems, farm-to-market
roads, post-harvest facilities, access to credit and funding for
agricultural research.
</P>
<P>
Angara has identified the construction of irrigation systems
and rehabilitation of existing ones as well as the intensified use
of high-yielding seeds to boost productivity as the DA's priority
programs for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on the establishment of food basket or Strategic
Agricultural Development Zones to maximize the productivity of
prime agricultural lands and prioritize equitable access and
distribution of benefits among small farmers and fisherfolk.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) is
speeding up the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian
Reform Program (CARP) to energize the countryside and liberate the
rural masses from poverty.
</P>
<P>
DAR Secretary Horacio Morales Jr. stressed that meaningful
agrarian reform is crucial to the government's efforts to
modernize agriculture, ensure the country's food security, and
truly free the rural folk from generational poverty.
</P>
<P>
The DAR said by putting on the fast lane the implementation of
the agrarian reform, it would be able to complete another phase of
independence, which is economic liberation.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has given a very explicit directive to the
DAR and other CARP-implementing agencies to complete the land
distribution phase of the program by year 2004, and improve
farmers' productivity and incomes.
</P>
<P>
Morales said the DAR's performance in the past nine months
indicates that these goals are being achieved.
</P>
<P>
For 1998 up to now, a total area of 175,353 hectares were
distributed to 114, 462 beneficiaries. Of these, 136,274 were
distributed to 91,269 beneficiaries during the first nine months
of the Estrada administration, who took oath in June, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 88 agrarian reform communities (ARCs) were set up,
48 of these during the first nine months of President Estrada.
There are now 1,004 ARCs nationwide, and another 1,000 are
expected to be organized soon.
</P>
<P>
Credit available to farmers reached 274.6 million pesos (6.865
million U.S. dollars), with an additional 40.6 million pesos
(1.015 million U.S. dollars) provided during the first quarter of
1999. Some 13,000 farmer-beneficiaries availed of these
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Over 25 billion pesos (625 million U.S. dollars) worth of
foreign -assisted projects have so far been generated. From July
1998 to March 1999, a total of 225 projects were completed and the
on-going projects amounted to 532.4 million pesos (13.31 million
U.S. dollars), apart from 198 projects that will be launched with
a budget of 460.7 million pesos (11.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
These projects include farm-to-market roads, irrigation,
post-harvest facilities, water supply and rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several "flashpoint" cases have been resolved in
favor of the farmer-beneficiaries, made high profile by the active
engagement of the protagonists in advocating their respective
positions.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is fitting to note that the nation is fast moving
closer to realizing its goals under CARP, as it celebrates its
Independence Day today.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada signed Administrative Order No. 65 directing
 concerned departments and agencies to implement activities to
celebrate this year's Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
This year's independence celebration emphasizes eradicating
poverty and score high growth with equity by pursuing agricultural
modernization and food security, preserving and creating jobs,
maintaining peace and order, and stamping out official corruption.
</P>
<P>
Estrada himself said during his state visit to South Korea that
 economic liberation is near for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Once the Filipino masses have been liberated from poverty, you
will still go abroad, not to work but to take a vacation," he told
the Filipino community in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Greece Allows Passage of U.S. Marines Heading for Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A convoy of about 1,200-1,500 U.S.
marines destined for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo set out
Thursday morning from the Gritsa port in Litochoro, outside the
northern Greek port of Thessaloniki en route to neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The marines, about 2,000 strong, had been waiting for nearly a
week on two warships and a helicopter carrier in the Aegean Sea
because the Greek government had issued a 10-day prohibition on
the passage of NATO troops through Greek territory in the run-up
to the June 13 European Parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
Greece, fearing that there will be a security vacuum following
the withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo, said that the
conditions are now different from when the prohibition was
enforced since the peacekeeping process has now been set in motion.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy police guard, the 1,200-1,500 marines set out
around 10:00 a.m. (local time) from Gritsa heading for the Greek-
Macedonian border while about 500 U.S. marines would remain on the
warships in administrative back-up capacity, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of 45 Canadian army vehicles also left Thessaloniki
port earlier Thursday for Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
About 300 supporters of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE)
lined up along the U.S. convoy's route near the Gritsa coast,
shouting anti-NATO slogans.
</P>
<P>
The KKE will hold a rally on Thursday evening in central
Thessaloniki to protest against the transport of NATO troops to
Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Strict Sanctions on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States reaffirmed its
support for sanctions on the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) , with an aim to end the "Angolan
tragedy" as soon as possible, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Sullivan, U.S. Ambassador to Angola, said during his
tour to the conflicting Kwanza-Norte Province, that his government
will completely implement the U.N sanctions on UNITA, which he
said, is a precondition for peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Sumbe, capital of the province, about 200 km south of
Luanda, Sullivan said that U.N. member states can only make their
contribution to the end of conflict in the country if they
unreservedly implement the U.N. sanctions on UNITA, The Angola
Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will solicit suggestions from various
parties for a strict sanction on UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi,
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations passed a series of resolutions on the
sanctions of UNITA since 1993, which cover the embargo on oil,
arms and diamond, the ban on UNITA leaders' trips abroad, and the
closure of UNITA offices overseas.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan announced that the United States will increase its aid
to Angola with other "traditional donor nations", especially in
times when the country is in a "humanitarian crisis".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Deal With 180,000 Drug Cases In 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police dealt with 180,000
drug cases involving more than 230,000 people last year, the
Public Security Ministry has reported.
</P>
<P>
Police seized 73,000 tons of heroin, 1.6 tons of the drug "ice",
and 5.1 tons of marijuana last year. These were up 34.3 percent,
20.5 percent, and 137 percent respectively from the figures the
year before, vice-minister Bai Jingfu said at a National
Narcotics Control Commission meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 34,000 people were arrested, and some 27,000
sentenced and no large-scale growing of opium poppies has been
discovered since the ban on poppies was enforced, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the anti-narcotics work has won great
support from the public as a result of the national exhibit that
toured the country last year, attracting 160 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
China established 860 drug rehabilitation centers, using
different methods such as work, education, and medical treatment
to get 140,000 people off drugs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 344.5 tons of chemical products used for making
drugs was confiscated last year, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
International law enforcement and training cooperation last
year with other countries like the United States, Canada, Japan,
France, Australia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam also helped, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Inspect All Meat Processing Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Agriculture Secretary
Edgardo Angara Thursday directed the National Meat Inspection
Commission (NMIC) to inspect all meat processing plants nationwide
to make sure that no imported meat, dairy products and feeds from
Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands are being processed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he ordered the banning of importation of feeds, meat
and meat products, including eggs and processed foods, from the
four countries following reports of dioxin contamination on these
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is a contaminant that causes cancer. It was recently
discovered to be present in Belgian animal feeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NMIC Executive Director Edgardo Dimalanta reported
that it has recently put on hold the release of two 40-foot
container vans containing some 24,000 kilos of frozen pork fat,
which came from France, and some 20,000 kilos of animal feeds that
came from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"All inventories and on-going shipment of the above-stated
products produced from January 1999 to present shall be subjected
to certification that these are dioxin-free by authorized
veterinary officers of the source country before its release,"
Dimalanta said.
</P>
<P>
He said the NMIC is currently inspecting meat processing plants
to ensure that no plant is processing meat and other by-products
coming from the four affected countries.
</P>
<P>
Dimalanta explained that once a plant is found to have the
imported products in their storage, the NMIC will issue a hold
order on the release of the said products.
</P>
<P>
"When the country of origin issues a certification saying that
their products, based on analysis are dioxin-free, only then will
we release their products," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Provides 8 Bln Rupees Annually for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Samurdhi (Social
Welfare) Authority has been providing 8 billion rupees (112
million U.S. dollars) annually in a national program for poverty
alleviation, official sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The program initiated in 1994 by the present government has
given a helping hand to 1.8 million families whose monthly income
is less than 1,500 rupees (21 dollars), said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Besides, numerous development and income-generating activities
such as the development of animal husbandry, small industries and
agro industries, have been carried out to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Easy credit has been made available to the poor at low interest
rates. Since 1995, 32,000 rural infrastructure development
projects have been completed in 22 districts of the country's
total 24 districts.
</P>
<P>
In implementing various agricultural activities at the grass
root level, the Samurdi animators have played a vital role in the
country's economy, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate in Sri Lanka is 18 percent, according to a
United Nations Development Program report. But a recent report
issued by the Department of Census and Statistics in Sri Lanka
said that 40 percent of the population live in poverty.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Seizes Abacha's Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Abubakar government had
confiscated money and real estate worth billions of naira
illegally acquired by former Head of State Gen. Sani Abacha's
family and aides, according to a recent release of a government
document.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) made public in its

Federal Government gazette No. 82.
</P>
<P>
Seven developed plots in Abuja, a house in Lagos, 30% share
holding in a Sierra Leonean refinery and hundreds of millions of
U.S. dollars and naira are among the illegal assets forfeited

</P>
<P>
Large sums of U.S. dollars, many real estates and luxurious

late general's sons, advisers and ministers.
</P>
<P>
Abacha became the head of state in November, 1993 through a

<P>
TIANJIN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The private sector is growing
rapidly in the city of Tianjin, with output value and sales for
the first four months up more than 32 percent over the same 1998
period.
</P>
<P>
The sector had 3.9 billion yuan in gross output value and more
than 8.2 billion yuan in sales during the four-month period and
paid 320 million yuan in taxes, more than double the figures for
one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid expansion of the private economy in Tianjin is
closely tied to the state's policies and the constitutional
recognition of the sector as an important part of the national
economy," a municipal official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 departments of the Tianjin municipal government
opened hot lines this year to help private ventures, with 27,000
of them registered by the end of April, an increase of more than 6,
000 over the same period last year. Their registered capital also
increased by 8.6 billion yuan to over 24.3 billion yuan.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The 13th International Travel

Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 exhibitors from 50 countries and regions all over the
world are present in the expo, which will last for four days till
June 13th.
</P>
<P>
The expo provides an excellent opportunity for members of the
international travel trade to meet for business and exchange
information on the latest development of tourism, said Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) in his written message of blessing for the expo.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong's vision is to further enhance Hong
Kong's position as a vibrant, eventful and tourist-friendly world-
class destination for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has taken steps to enhance its attraction to visitors
including planning for new facilities such as a new state-of-the-
art performance venue and an international wetland park; and
promoting the trading and heritage of this modern city, to name
but a few.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Chu, managing director of the organizer, Adsale

occupied a total area of 10,000 square meters and there are nearly
80 national and regional tourism boards at the expo.

<HEADLINE> HK Takes Measures to Promote Tourism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Secretary for
Economic Services Stephen Ip said here today that Hong Kong needs
to reinforce its strongholds and establish new market niches to
strengthen its position as a premier tourist destination in the
Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 13th International
Travel Expo, Ip said that the government will continue to work
very closely with the Hong Kong Tourist Association and the
tourist industry to promote the long-term development of tourism
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has recently appointed Mike Rowse as the first
Commissioner for Tourism to spearhead its efforts in further
developing and promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
On this score, Rowse and his team adopted a three-pronged
strategy to enable Hong Kong to ride on the millennium tides for
achieving new heights, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy takes the form of pro-actively promoting Hong Kong
to tourists, enhancing Hong Kong's attractiveness as a tourist
destination and facilitating the entry of visitors.
</P>
<P>
Ip said that since the launching of the "Hong Kong - City of
Life" campaign in March 1998, the rating of Hong Kong in Japan as
the "preferred" destination rose from 40 percent to 62 percent. In
Singapore, the figure rose from 24 percent to 33 percent; and in
Taiwan, from 8 percent to 19 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has more recently launched a "Discover Hong Kong"
marketing initiative to further play up the notion that Hong Kong
is an interesting city with a wide spectrum of tourist experiences
in terms of shopping, dining and sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong has attached considerable emphasis to
enhancing Hong Kong's many attractions. New attractions under
study or in the pipeline include a scenic cable car system on
Lantau Island, an international wetland park, an aquatic center
and a fisherman's wharf.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has also made available a 500 million HK dollar (64
million U.S. dollars) loan to Ocean Park for its lowland
redevelopment to put in place new and more attractive facilities.
</P>
<P>
What's more, Hong Kong is in intensive negotiations with Walt
Disney for bringing a world-class theme park to Hong Kong, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from working on improving our hardware, we are also
mindful of developing our software," Ip said. The efforts include
new products and facilities for tourists as well as attractive
international events.
</P>
<P>
The government is working proactively to promote heritage
tourism in Hong Kong and to enable visitors to have a better
appreciation of the cultural heritage of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A 100 million HK dollar (12.8 million U.S. dollar)
International Events Fund has been set up to support the staging
of some 50 international events in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To promote good service to visitors, a "Be A Good Host"
campaign is under way and a "Quality Tourism Services" scheme will
be launched to ensure the quality of service at participating
shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The third area of action is to facilitate the entry of visitors,
said Ip. Hong Kong has a liberal visa regime which enables
visitors from over 170 countries and regions to enter Hong Kong
visa-free.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate immigration clearance for frequent visitors to
Hong Kong, a Travel Pass Pilot Scheme was introduced in 1998 to
enable faster immigration clearance for frequent visitors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is not only an exciting, eventful and friendly
destination, it is also a viable venue for hosting prestigious
conventions and exhibitions, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Added to that, Hong Kong is also the gateway to the Chinese
mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to be the crossroads of the East and
the West where visitors from all over the world come for trade and
travel.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will host the 16th Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) Tourism Working Group meeting and the 1st APEC Tourism
Forum in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The latter forum will bring together ministers responsible for
tourism and industry leaders in the APEC economies to exchange
views on major issues that affect tourism in the region, Ip said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Outposts in Lebanon Hit by Israeli Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Five outposts of the United Nations
peacekeeping troops in south Lebanon were hit by Israeli
bombardment Thursday, a U.N. troops spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli shell fell on the outpost of Irish contingent of the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) near Hadais on the verge of
the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, UNIFIL's
spokesman Timor Goksel told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The post's water tank was destroyed, Goksel said, adding that
another four outposts for the Irish contingent were also hit by
the shrapnels of Israeli shells, which caused various material
damages.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came apparently as a revenge for the
killing of two Israeli soldiers by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which ambushed an
Israeli patrol inside the occupied zone overnight.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers, including an officer, were killed and
four others wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong UNIFIL, which was established after first
Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1978, always came under attacks
during conflicts between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an Irish soldier was killed, raising the total
death toll for the peacekeepers to 226 in the past 21 years, 40
of them from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL is made up of representatives from nine countries,
namely, Ireland, Ghana, Nepal, Fiji, India, Finland, Poland,
France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied part of Lebanon since 1978 and set up a
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
its ally South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Britain Starts European Parliamentary Election Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Voters across Britain cast ballots
on Thursday in European parliamentary elections, with the turnout
rate expected to be as low as around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Labor Party, committed in principle to ditching the
pound in the next parliament, has been anxious to keep the euro
out of their election campaign.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Conservatives have made keeping the pound
for many years a central issue of their campaign.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll for Channel 4 television on Wednesday showed a
surge of opposition to joining the European single currency. A
survey of 1,000 adults indicated that only 21 percent supported
Prime Minister Tony Blair's policy of joining the euro when
economic conditions are right.
</P>
<P>
Some 46 percent supported Conservative chief William Hague's
policy of ruling out membership for 10 years, and 30 percent were
opposed to entering the single currency under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Polling booths in Britain will close late in the day. But with
most of its European neighbors voting on Sunday, the final results
will not be announced until Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Many Britons remain indifferent to European issues and voter
fatigue has set in after recent polls for dissolving assemblies in
Scotland and Wales as well as for local government.

BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, in talks here today with Dodo Aichatou Mindaoudou, the
minister of foreign affairs and cooperation of Niger, spoke
positively of relations with Niger and described the two countries
' cooperation in various fields since they resumed diplomatic ties
three years ago as satisfying.
</P>
<P>
China places importance on its relations with Niger, Tang said,
and is ready, with joint efforts from Niger, to strengthen
bilateral friendship and cooperation so that healthier and more
stable development will benefit the two nations and their people.
</P>
<P>
Mindaoudou conveyed condolences and sympathy from the
government and people of Niger for China's embassy in Yugoslavia,
which was attacked last month.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Niger regards China as a special partner
and will make every effort to promote its friendly relations of
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Mindaoudou said that the people of Niger are pleased with the
vigorous and fruitful cooperation with China over the past three
years and hope to continue to get help from China and that Niger
fully supports China's reunification and adheres to the "one China
" policy.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers briefed each other on their respective
domestic situations, and discussed the current situation in Africa
and the rest of the world and other issues of common concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- United Technologies Corporation (
UTC) International Operation (China) says that it hopes the U.S.
government will normalize trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The statement came from Ruth Harkin, a senior vice-president
for International Affairs and Government Relations at United
Technologies, who said that her company applauds President Bill
Clinton for normalizing trade relations with China and urges
Congress to support it.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton made the announcement on June 3, which is
waiting for approval by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Opposing normal trade relations with China is like recommending
a complete rollback of trade relations and it would be unfair to
companies like UTC that are doing legitimate business in China and
detrimental to the U.S. economy, Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
China is the fastest growing U.S. export market, while economic
engagement with China, including UTC's 22 business ventures with
300 million U.S. dollars in investment, benefits the Chinese
economy, Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
The company is involved in the fields of aircraft engines,
heating and air conditioning systems, elevators and escalators,
helicopters, and flight and space systems in China.

<HEADLINE> China Spending More On Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
infrastructure and resource projects are being built in poorer
central and western parts of China to narrow the East-West gap.
</P>
<P>
Projects like the Nanning-Kunming Railway, Beijing-Kowlon
Railway, westward extension of the Southern Xinjiang Railway, and
the Three Gorges Project are the direct result of using policy to
boost economic development in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the central government's capital construction
budget in recent years has gone to these central and western areas,
according to the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
Last year, 62 percent of the central government's added
infrastructure expenditures were used in the region and investment

appointments submitted to him by President Olusegun Obasanjo last
Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Says Philippine Claims on Huangyan Island Irresponsible (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine claim that it has
the right to patrol the waters off Huangyan Island because it is
within its 200-mile exclusive economic zone is "irresponsible,"
Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo Zamora, presidential executive secretary of the
Philippines, said Monday that the Philippines will continue to
protect its territorial claims in the South China Sea with naval
patrols and that the island belongs to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
This does not stand up in international law, Zhang told a press
conference, adding that Huangyan Island is in the Chinese
territory traditionally and the international community, including
the Philippines, has never objected to that before.
</P>
<P>
The island was clearly recorded in Chinese historical documents,
she said. Maps and textbooks since 1935 all have Huangyan marked
as Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
This shows that China has exercised administration over the
island, Zhang said, pointing to three treaties that clearly define
the boundary of the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> China Says Philippine Claims on Huangyan Island Irresponsible (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three documents are the Peace Treaty of Spain and the
United States signed in Paris in 1898, the Treaty of Spain and the
United States Ceding Outlying Islands of the Philippines signed
November 7, 1900 in Washington, and the Convention of the United
States and Great Britain on the Boundary Between the Philippine
Archipelago and the State of North Borneo signed in Washington on
June 2, 1930.
</P>
<P>
All the treaties clearly defined the western limits of
Philippine territory as lying within 118 degrees east longitude
and Huangyan lies to the west of that and is part of China's
Zhongsha Islands of China, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
That boundary was reaffirmed in the 1935 Philippine
constitution's Republic Act No.3046 of 17th June, 1961, defining
the base lines of the territorial waters of the Philippines. Maps
published by the Philippines also showed Huangyan lying outside
Philippine territory, she said.
</P>
<P>
Territorial sovereignty is the basis of maritime jurisdiction,
she said. That is a basic principle of modern maritime law. "We
hope that the Philippines will respect this fact and the basic
principle of international law and not make any more irresponsible
remarks of this kind."

<HEADLINE> Australia to Take Legal Action Over Japan's Tuna Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government said
Thursday it is to take legal action against Japan over its
unilateral decision to override international quotas on threatened
southern bluefin tuna.
</P>
<P>
Japan last week announced it would recommence its "experimental
fishing program" (EFP) for the tuna, the same program under which
last year it took 1,400 tons, or 25 percent, above its quota of
the highly prized fish.
</P>
<P>
Australian Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Mark Vaile said
Japan had ignored protests from both Australia and New Zealand,
leaving Australia with no option.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that our views were disregarded by Japan and that
despite our informal protests, the unilateral EFP has been
resumed," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I understand there are several Japanese long-liners now
fishing in the Southern Ocean not far from our fishing zone," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided to act decisively," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vaile did not say how Australia would pursue its legal action,
but said the government was examining numerous options and working
with New Zealand to ensure it had the maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia had also indefinitely extended its ban on
Japanese fishing boats entering Australian ports or fishing inside
the Australian fishing zone.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he was
concerned that the dispute could harm otherwise good relations
between Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"It is disappointing that it has come to this... This is not an
issue Australia can, or will back away from," he said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities' Splitting Activities Unpopular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China strongly opposes such
splitting activities as "Two Chinas" and "One China, One Taiwan"
conducted by the Taiwan authorities in the international community
and these activities are "unpopular".
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the
remarks at a regular press conference here today in reply to a
question on the recent Taiwan's economic aids to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the splitting activities of the Taiwan
authorities have been resolutely opposed by the whole Chinese
people, including Taiwan compatriots, and it is improper for a few
countries to praise Taiwan's authorities for its economic aids to
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
She said that the declaration of the Taiwan authorities to
offer a large amount of money to Macedonia at the time is ulterior.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that many Taiwan people staged
demonstrations today on the island to oppose the offer," she said.

<HEADLINE> Regional Meeting on Refugees Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Fifty delegates from some 20
countries in the Asia and Pacific region assembled here Thursday
to hold consultations on refugees, displaced persons and migrants.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fourth Inter-Governmental Asia-Pacific
Consultations on Refugees, Displaced Persons and Migrants, U.N.
Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees Soren Jessen-Petersen
hailed as a success story the resolution of the complex and
long-standing problem of the over two million Indochinese refugees
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We should not overlook, however, the unique challenge posed by
the refugees currently residing in another Asian sub-region,
namely South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in South Asia, 35 to 40 million people have
crossed international borders since 1947.
</P>
<P>
"We need only to look at the unresolved problem of the more
than three million Afghan refugees who are still residing outside
their country, to realize the extent of the problem that the
countries in the South Asian region face today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. refugee official noted that the ethnic, linguistic,
religious affinity of communities on both sides of national
borders, the existence of extremely porous borders between states,
rapid and significant population growth and uneven economic
development have led to traditional, continuous and increased
cross-border migratory movements in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"In Asia, as increasingly also elsewhere, ethno-nationalism is
one of the principal causes of conflict and population movements,"
he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation of internally displaced persons in
Asia is often even more compelling than that of refugees since
most of them do not benefit from international protection or
assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said the plight of internally displaced persons has
attracted little or no attention from their governments which have
viewed the problem as falling within the exclusive domain of
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the two-day meeting are the role of countries
of origin and a progress report on the Asia-Pacific consultations.
</P>
<P>
Two discussion papers are scheduled to be tabled on the topic
of the role of countries of origin respectively by the
International Organization for Migration and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese government will also contribute a discussion paper
to provide an overview of the issue including an analysis of the
role of countries of asylum.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being co-hosted by the Nepalese government and
the UNHCR with the support of the International Organization for
Migration.
</P>
<P>
As an annual event, the Inter-Governmental Asia-Pacific
Consultations on Refugees, Displaced Persons and Migrants started
in 1996 with a view to promoting dialog and exploring
opportunities for greater regional cooperation on matters relating
to population movements.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Create Team for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak has decided to set up a "peace administration" in the
Prime Minister's Office designated to manage peace negotiations
with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The administration will include three separate groups, each
reporting directly to the prime minister, local newspaper Ha'aretz
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Former Mossad head Danny Yatom will coordinate between the
three arms of the administration, the government office, and the
security services that will be involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak's candidate to head the Palestinian group is Lt.-Gen
(Res) Amnon Lipkin-Shahak. The candidate to head the team for
talks with Syria is the former head of military intelligence,
Maj.-Gen. (Res) Uzi Saguy, while Maj-Gen. (Res) Yossi Peled,
ex-head of the Northern Command of the Israel Defense Force, will
head the Lebanese group.
</P>
<P>
Gilad Sher, a lawyer who was involved in writing the Oslo
Accords, is slated to be legal advisor of the peace
administration.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry, the Shin Bet security service, military
intelligence and the Mossad will all send representatives to the
administration and the Foreign Ministry will be responsible for
reviving the multilateral talks that have been frozen.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted reliable sources as saying that Barak has
made it clear in internal discussions that he is determined to
control personally every stage of the negotiations and he will not
give in any way on security issues to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak will have to complete the makeup of the negotiation
teams as soon as the government begins to function, because he
intends to suggest to the Palestinians that they forgo the
Wye agreement and move immediately on to final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have already told the United States that
this is unacceptable and they are demanding that the new
Israeli government implement the Wye agreement in full.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wye accord signed in Washington last October,
Israel should hand over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the exact format of the talks with Syria
and the level of American involvement will be discussed during
Barak's trip to Washington next month, the paper added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Latrell Sprewell and Marcus
Camby paced the New York Knicks to a 101-94 away victory over the
Indiana Pacers on Wednesday to pull within one win of the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell played all but three minutes of the game, scoring 29
points, three rebounds and three assists, while Camby came off the
bench to turn around the game with 21 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson, whose 4-point play gave the Knicks a miracle win
in Game 3, hit two big 3-pointers down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to come out today, relax, not get too aggressive,
see my teammates and just go out and play good basketball," said
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, who rallied from an early 14-point deficit, could
wrap up the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals at home on
Friday in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
In a lockout-shortened season, the Knicks is one the way to
become the first eighth seed to reach the NBA Finals, and make its
first trip there since 1994, when they fell to the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller scored the most 30 points for his first big game
of the series, but the Pacers still squandered a 4-point lead
entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
New York won the quarter 36-25 by shooting 67 percent, while
Johnson netted in two big 3-pointers 49 seconds apart, scoring 12
of his 17 points in the period.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston added 19 points and Kurt Thomas scored 10 points
off the bench for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
Mark Jackson had 16 points for Indiana and Dale Davis led all
players with 18 rebounds along with 12 points but center Rik Smits
had another disappointing outing with foul trouble to finish just
8 points on 4-for-14 shooting along with 6 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Supports Development Zones Along Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
announced on Wednesday that it will place priority on supporting
five development zones located along the expressway running from
Shanghai through Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, to Ningbo,
a coastal city in the province.
</P>
<P>
The support will be given to the Hangzhou, Ningbo and Xiaoshan
state-level economic and technological development zones, and the
Jiaxing and Shaoxing provincial-level development zones.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is currently drafting related policies to promote
development in the zones which are magnets for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The zones attracted contracted investments totaling 450 million
US dollars for 60 projects during 1998, in addition to achieving a
total import-export volume of over 1.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ningbo Economic and Technological Development Zone alone
ratified 75 foreign-funded projects during the first four months
of this year, each with an investment standing at 10 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other development zones along the expressway, including the
Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone and the Ningbo Free
Trade Zone, expect to benefit from the favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo, all of
which are located along the expressway, contribute 75 percent of
the province's GDP and use more than 80 percent of total foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo Port ranks second in the nation in terms of handling
capacity and Hangzhou is one of the world's major tourist
destinations.
</P>
<P>
The province has approved eight state-level and 51 provincial-
level development zones since 1984. Said zones account for 52.9
percent of the total contractual foreign investment flowing into
the province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archaeologists Find Original Site of Ancient Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists said
recently that they had found the original site of the capital of
the Shang Dynasty (16th century B.C.- 11th century B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Scholars previously believed that the village of Xiaotun near
the city of Anyang in Henan Province was the site, but the new
find is two kilometers north of the village.
</P>
<P>
When China's earliest characters were discovered as
inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells about 100 years ago at
Yinxu, the Shang Dynasty capital, it was a stunning discovery.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jigen, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the newly-discovered ruins cover a 150,000-sq.
m. area in the village of Huayuanzhuang, where archaeologists
found earthenware and utensils used near the ruins, and it was
thought that Huayuanzhuang might be the center of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Currently the archaeologists are still working on the
excavation in hopes of finding other evidence to support their
view.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Unearths Two-Million-Year-Old Stone Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The discovery in Kenya of early
stone tools and other artifacts dating back to 2.34 million years
is set to revamp on- going debate on the evolution of man.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan archaeologist Mzalendo Kivunja and his French
counterpart Hellen Roche unearthed the tools at Lokalalei near
Lake Turkana in northern Kenya during a 10-year study funded by
French government, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They found the expertise and skill it took to make such tools
was beyond the capabilities of the Hominids (pre-human) who
existed during that time.
</P>
<P>
"They employed a very judicious way of flaking and chose the
best raw materials available," the researchers Wednesday told an
audience at the National Museums of Kenya, in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The scientists could only guess that the tools, which bear
sharp edges, could have belonged to the Homo habitants who are
the direct ancestors of the human beings.
</P>
<P>
The finding dubbed the "Lokalalei discovery", the
archaeologists said, would radically change the way human beings
interpret their past.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Trade Deficit Hits 700 Million US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's trade deficit has

slumped to 1.3 billion NZ dollars (more than 700 million U.S.
dollars),
the worst in 14 years, according to official figures issued by
Statistics
New Zealand Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A double whammy of a growing demand for New Zealand's imports
and
falling prices for its exports has led to the worsening trade
balance.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's international trade balance has been steadily
worsening
in the past seven months, Deputy Government Statistician Ian Ewing
said.
The figure of 1.3 billion NZ dollars is for the 12 months to April
this
year.
</P>
<P>
The worsening balance of payments deficit, the difference
between what
New Zealand earns and spends overseas, has implications for its
credit
ratings with international rating agency Standard and Poor's
warning this
week the country's ratings could be downgraded if the balance of
payments
deficit worsened.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Arrests 2,500 Poachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has arrested over
2,500 poachers over the past two decades in an effort to protect
wild animals, said an official with the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Wildlife Department of the ministry, Emmanuel
Severe, warned that the government will continue to crack down on
poaching activities, The Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's wildlife population has decreased considerably in
recent years. A survey conducted in 1976 in the world-famous
Selous Game Reserve showed that there were more than 3,000 of
rhinos then, but the number dwindled to between 100 and 200 at
present due to poaching especially in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In 1960s, the country's elephant population stood at 375,000
but drastically dropped to 44,000 in 1988. With the ban of ivory
trade and the government crackdown on poaching, the number has
rose to 110,000 currently.
</P>
<P>
"Communities around game reserves and national parks should be
involved in protecting wildlife for future prosperity," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Anti-Poaching Squad should be regularly
trained and well-equipped so that they could combat illegal
hunters who are using advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
The squad has also pointed finger at refugees from Rwanda and
Burundi, who were responsible for a great number of poaching
activities in west Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Province Improves Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
has extended great effort to improve investment environment in
recent years in a bid to attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Li Dachang made the remarks recently at the
ongoing '99 Kunming Trade Fair in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Li said Sichuan had approved 4,993 overseas-funded enterprises
by the end of 1998, with the volume of funds actually used
reaching 5.77 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan had established economic and trade ties with 120
countries and regions by the end of 1998, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The actual use of overseas funds in 1998 surpassed one billion
US dollars, up 21.4 percent on the previous year, said Li, adding
the increase was achieved in spite of the adverse impact of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan ranks first on the list of 10 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions in western China in terms of comprehensive
economic power.
</P>
<P>
The province ranks first in the country with hydroelectric
power resources, which are estimated at 140 million kilowatts.
Sichuan also has 130 kinds of minerals, 28 of which rank the first
three places among all the provinces in China in terms of reserves.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is also the major goods collection and distribution
center in west China. The province's labor force accounts for 6.6
percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan will expand its highway system some 600 km by the end
of this year, and its installed generating capacity will reach 14
million kilowatts. Four generators at the Ertan Hydroelectric
Power Station, the second largest of its kind in Asia, are
scheduled to go online by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Each of the station's six generating units will have an
installed capacity of 550,000 kilowatts, and the station is
expected to produce 17 billion kilowatt hours of electricity
annually.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has listed more than 1,000 projects on an international
website and established service centers for foreign investors in
an effort to further improve the local investment environment.

<HEADLINE> UAE Engineering Spending High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has the second highest per capita engineering spending in the
world, the Dubai-based Khaleej Times reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the top 50 global construction markets, which
registered a total spending of more than 3.2 trillion U.S. dollars
last year, Japan held the highest per capita spending with 4,975
dollars, while the UAE came the second with 4,339 dollars, the
paper quoted a report on global construction as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other countries with high per capita spending on construction
are Germany, 3,873 dollars, Switzerland, 3,695 dollars, and
Denmark, 3,618 dollars, said the report prepared by the
U.S. Census Bureau and some leading world engineering companies.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is one of the world's most lucrative construction
markets, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the combination of good government planning and
vibrant private sector development will ensure a continuing trend
of sustained growth in the construction sector throughout the
country," said sources who sponsored the report.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is becoming a regional hub for construction and
development, which sees the continuing influx of
internationally-renowned developers and an increasing number of
large-scale projects that are about to begin in 1999.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's plunging currency
rupiah is proving an attractive lure to bargain-hunting Australian
tourists, according to official figures released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Australia's nearest neighbor Indonesia
muscled up from fourth to second in the list of top 10 countries
for Australian travelers, with 12 percent, or 279,600 Australians,
choosing to visit Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
That put it just behind New Zealand (16 percent) and ahead of
the United States (10 percent) and the U.K. (9 percent), according
to figures released Thursday from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Most Australians (81 percent) listed holidays as their main
reason for visiting Indonesia, while business travel slumped 30
percent to account for only eight in every 100 people.
</P>
<P>
The drop in business travel coincided with Indonesia's slide
into economic chaos, which began in 1997 and deepened throughout
the course of last year.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Communist Party
General Secretary Le Kha Phieu left here Thursday by a special
plane after wounding up his two-day official visit to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Phieu arrived in Cambodia on Wednesday as guest of King Norodom
Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk.

Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
After paying respect to Head of the Buddhist Monks of Mahanikay
Sect of the Kingdom of Cambodia at a Pagoda, Phieu said "his visit
to Cambodia has yielded positive results," adding that his "visit
has opened up a new phase of the relations of traditional
friendship between Vietnam and Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"The good-neighborly relations and friendly cooperation serve
the interests and needs of both countries and its people as well
as the people of the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believed that the relations of friendship and cooperation
between the two countries are sure to be further consolidated and
developed," Phieu added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rare Deer Returned to Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Eight rare David's Deer raised in
captivity have thrived since their return to nature over six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The eight animals were the first David's Deer China has
returned to the wild, according to Yan Xun, an official with the
State Forestry Administration's Department of Forest and Wild
Animal Protection.
</P>
<P>
The deer have exhibited certain wild characteristics since
their release in the nature reserve in Dafeng County, east China's
Jiangsu Province, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that first fawn born in the wild wandered with the
herd and quickly learned the grazing instinct. The species mainly
feeds on reeds and other plants near bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
Yan said the David's Deer were returned to the wild as part of
an effort to rebuild wild deer herds. Futures plans call for
expanding the experiment to other habitats.
</P>
<P>
David's Deer have been described as having the antlers of a
deer, the head of a horse and the body of a cow. The species was
named after Pere David, a French Catholic priest and naturalist
who first recorded the existence of the unique deer in China in
1865.
</P>
<P>
The rare species, a animal native to China, was found in the
country until the early years of the 20th century when invading
Westerners sent the remaining deer housed in an imperial park to
their own countries. The rare species was returned to China in the
mid-1980s thanks to cooperation between the Chinese and British
governments.
</P>
<P>
Research has verified that the Dafeng area was the original
natural habitat of the species, and their numbers, breeding, and
survival rate there are better than they are in other parts of the
world.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Exports to India Unlikely to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's exports to India in the
current July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year is not anticipated to
increase over the export in the last fiscal year, the Financial
Express newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of the fiscal year, Bangladesh's
exports to India had been recorded at 45.8 million U.S. dollars
against 44.3 million dollars in the same period of the last fiscal
year, competent sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's trade gap with India during the five-year period
from 1993-94 fiscal year would stand at over 3.8 billion dollars,
they said, adding that Bangladesh's export to India during this
period was only 246.3 million dollars against the import of over
four billion dollars through official channel, and in the current
fiscal year, the import from India is likely to exceed one billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had a number of meetings at different levels
in the recent past to narrow the trade gap, but no meeting or
agreed minutes could reduce the trade gap between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC ( South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation)
preferential trade arrangement (SAPTA), which was made effective
from December 1995, has been proved to be an effective mechanism
to reduce the massive scale of yearly trade gap between the two
countries, they observed.
</P>
<P>
But, they pointed out that SAPTA preferential certificates for
export to India issued till date are only 92 in number, and these
cover only 12 items including accumulator battery, melamine
tableware and artificial flowers.
</P>
<P>
The total value of the above-mentioned items exported to India
during the last two and a half years would not exceed two million
dollars, they stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been trying to obtain special treatment as
weaker partner in the form of zero tariff on a number of items for
export to India, but so far the attempt yielded no result.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's major export items to India are frozen food, tea,
fertilizer and raw jute, and these items are enjoying zero tariff,
but this was not due to SAPTA, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 30 suspects of the bomb
blasts, have been arrested in Uganda's capital city of Kampala in
the last two months.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Security Muruli Mukasa made this revelation
Wednesday when addressing local leaders in Mpigi District near the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrested are believed to be rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF), Thursday's New Vision paper quoted the
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels resort to terrorist activities these days by
bombing people at social gatherings because they believed they
could get power through the force of arms, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the work done by the security organs and
warned local people against any laxity in security, saying that
the terrorists might resort to attacking towns neighboring
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
There have been altogether eight bomb blasts in the capital
city so far this year. About 60 people have been killed and more
than 170 injured in bomb blasts since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Records Rising Garment Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing witnessed a surge in
garment exports in the first four months of the year in spite of
the slide in the city's overall foreign trade during the period.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that the national capital exported
garments valuing at 190 million U.S. dollars in January-April, up
2.5 percent on the 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) exported garments valued at 128
million U.S. dollars during the first four months, up 15.5 percent.
SOE's export represented the only garment exporting sector to
maintain growth among various types of garments exporters.
</P>
<P>
The surge proved the effectiveness of the efforts to adjust
market operations in line with the formation of a multipolar
export market. Beijing exported 88.99 million U.S. dollars of
garments to Europe, up 63.7 percent, with Europe replacing Asia as
Beijing's No. 1 garment importer.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and four others wounded during conflicts with Lebanese guerrillas
in south Lebanon Thursday morning, the Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that an Israeli
patrol was ambushed by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, at Rihan in the eastern sector of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the fighting, the fiercest in the past weeks, two Israeli
soldiers, including an officer, was killed and four others
wounded. Two injured Israelis were in a serious condition.
</P>
<P>
In Soujud, three kilometers south of Rihan, two members of the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) were also wounded in
Hezbollah's attacks, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes blasted a number of hills and
villages in south Lebanon that are believed to be hideouts for
Hezbollah guerrillas. There have been no reports about casualties
from the raids.
</P>
<P>
The latest fatality, which has not been confirmed by Israeli
army, raised to 11 the number of the Israeli soldiers killed in
south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
the SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Newspapers See Fall in Ad Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The amount spent on advertising in
newspapers and at outdoor sites in Thailand fell further in the
first four months of this year, The Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, revenue from television, radio, magazine and cinema
advertising picked up, the newspaper quoted Media Data Resources,
an independent agency which monitors advertising expenditure, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from newspaper advertising dropped by 8.6 percent and
that from outdoor advertising dropped by 27.2 percent in the first
four months of this year compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, revenue from TV advertising increased by 8.6
percent, radio by 11.3 percent, magazine by 5.8 percent and cinema
by 23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total amount spent on advertising in the six major media
sectors showed sluggish growth of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Media Data Resources said that the economic downturn had put
curbs on the amounts firms were prepared to spend on advertising
and they had turned from newspapers to other forms of media which
they perceived as being more effective and giving better value for
money.
</P>
<P>
But advertisers of consumer goods, department stores and mobile
phones had remained loyal to newspapers on the basis that these
products needed written details of promotions and the services
offered.
</P>
<P>
Advertisers also cut their budgets for billboard advertising
since these required a high investment per unit, especially in
prime locations.
</P>
<P>
The agency's figures show that TV took the biggest slice of the
advertising cake with 68.4 percent of the total, followed by
newspapers 13.7 percent, radio Bangkok 9.5 percent, magazines 5.3
percent, outdoor billboards 2.8 percent and cinemas 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total spending on media advertising in 1998 was 38 billion baht
(about one billion U.S. dollars), a drop of 8.6 percent from the
41.7 billion baht (1.13 billion dollars) spent in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUMANOVO AIRPORT, Macedonia, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia
demanded Wednesday that NATO immediately halt its 11-week air
strikes against Yugoslavia as the country has signed the technical
military agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nebojsa Vujovic, Assistant Foreign Minister and a member of the
senior Yugoslav delegation to the military talks with NATO, said
after the signing of the agreement: "Bombing should stop
immediately even as I speak or before."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Yugoslav delegation signed the agreement in
good faith and that Yugoslavia will fulfill each every obligation
it has taken in the six-page document.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation and peace are the only option for the future, the
Yugoslav assistant foreign minister said, describing the
atmosphere at the military talks as "one of tolerance."
</P>
<P>
"We played a very constructive role from the very beginning. We
worked hard day and night in order to achieve a technical military
agreement. Now we paved the way for the bombing campaign and for
the invasion of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to stop
immediately," Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
"The language of war should be changed with the language of
peace, " he said, adding that the policy of Yugoslavia and the
political wisdom of the Yugoslav leadership "proves once again
that we are a major peaceful factor in the region."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to pursue the political agenda with full
force in order to achieve peace and stability. A solution today is
absolutely based on the political document reached in Belgrade
between (Finnish President Marti) Ahtisaari, (Russian Presidential
Balkans envoy Viktor) Chernomyrdin and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pacific Rim Economies Start Slow Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The weighted average real growth
for Pacific Rim economies is expected to reach 2.6 percent this
year, higher than the 1 percent in 1998 but lower than the 4.3
percent in 1997, Business World newspaper quoted Thursday an
independent report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report was released Wednesday via satellite by Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), the official private
organization acting as observer to Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The economies included in the report are APEC members of Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, China, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore,
Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Colombia, Peru,
Chile, Canada, Mexico, the United States and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 1999 will be a recovery year for the
region. However, only South Korea is expected to have a "V" shaped
recovery, while most of the other economies that either contracted
or had slow growth in 1998 will have only a modest pickup in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the economies expected to post a recovery
this year are forecast to be bolstered by "domestic absorption,"
with expansionary fiscal programs seen providing the energy that
will stimulate activity.
</P>
<P>
Monetary policies are also expected to be easier for these
nations forecast to get back on the growth track, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted an average growth of 4.6 percent in
exports this year, almost twice that of 1998, while the imports
will grow by 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report, while taking on an upbeat mood, identified risks --
either "too optimistic" or "too pessimistic" -- that could affect
the ascent growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, these risks, among others, included
the development on the Japanese yen, stock market of the United
States, the increasing U.S. trade deficit as well as the Y2K
problem.

<HEADLINE> NATO Approves Accord with Yugoslav Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said here early Thursday morning that NATO's
decision-making body had approved the military agreement signed
between NATO and Yugoslav military officials Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the North Atlantic Council (NAC), Solana
told reporters that the agreement specifies the modalities in the
procedures for full withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have said from the beginning of the Operation Allied Force,
we are ready to suspend air operations once we have a verified
effective beginning of the withdrawal of the Yugoslav security
forces," he said at NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that as soon as NATO supreme commander in Europe,
Wesley Clark, has confirmed the beginning of Serb troops' pullout,
"I intent to instruct him to suspend NATO operations."
</P>
<P>
The NATO head said NAC also approved an operational plan for
deployment of international security forces in Kosovo under the
United Nations mandate.
</P>
<P>
Since Yugoslav military forces has agreed the pullout accord
and NATO was watching verifiable Serb troops' withdrawal, the next
step will be stoppage of the NATO bombing, and approval of a UN
Security Council resolution will follow for deployment of
international security forces, according to a so-called
"sequencing" procedure repeatedly mentioned by NATO spokesmen.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Sets New Banana Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador, the world's largest banana
producer, announced new prices on Wednesday for bananas destined
for export.
</P>
<P>
Exported Ecuadoran banana will have two new official prices: 2.
20 U.S. dollars per 43-pound box for eastern European countries,
Russia, China and South Korea, and 2.60 dollars for the other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Emilio Gallarda and Foreign Trade Minister
Jorge Guzman signed an agreement on the new prices on Tuesday,
saying that they had sought fair prices for both producers and
exporters.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gallardo warned that exporters who do not
respect the new prices will be sanctioned by the withdrawal of
their business licenses.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of the new prices, the producers staged
a protest in Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador, saying they
would not accept a price lower than 2.80 dollars -- the cost price
of such a box of bananas. The producers would have no profit
margin if prices are lower than that, according to Simon Canarte,
vice-president of the National Association of Banana Producers of
Ecuador.

<P>
KIEV, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
held talks on Wednesday with his Bulgarian counterpart Petar
Stoyanov who is paying a visit here. Both sides agreed to enhance
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will strengthen cooperation in the Black Sea
area, and re-establish the "Old Silk Road" which links the Black
Sea area and the Baltic Sea area, Stoyanov told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He will sign a medical cooperation agreement with Kuchma during
his visit.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma suggested that Ukrainian experts could help Bulgaria in
some construction projects, such as building a railway between
Sofia, Bulgaria's capital, and Skopje of Yugoslavia, and a gas
pipeline from Russia to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said he was interested in Bulgaria's farm product
processing and expected cooperation with Bulgaria in this field.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed a cooperation agreement on education
and a memorandum on labor and social policy after their talks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov also met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and Chairman of the parliament Alexandr Tkachenko.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries fell to 39 million U.S. dollars
in 1998 from 61 million dollars in the previous year due to a
slump in the exports of oil products, electronic products and
medicines from Bulgaria to Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Warns Protectionism Could Threaten Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress' approval of
the imported-steel quota measure could set off a chain-reaction of
trade protectionism in the country, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he was worried about demands for the erection of U.S.
trade barriers and a retreat from further integrating the U.S.
into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"In our country, some argue that we should turn inward and
retreat from the world," Rubin said in a speech expected to be one
of his last speeches as a member of President Bill Clinton's
cabinet. "I believe... just the opposite -- that we turn inward at
our peril."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he was particularly concerned by a House-passed
measure that would impose quotas on shipments of foreign steel
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, U.S. steel companies have been arguing that
without increased protection from cheap imported steel, they will
be forced to lay off thousands of U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
Rubin and others in the administration contend that the bill is
clearly in violation of global trading rules administered by the
World Trade Organization and would trigger copycat protectionist
moves by other countries against U.S. exporters.
</P>
<P>
The measure was passed by the House on a 289-141 vote in March,
and Senate supporters are hoping for a vote in the full Senate
later this month.
</P>
<P>
"That bill could well pass the Senate, and such action in the
strongest major economy in the world creates a real risk of
strengthening the already increased protectionist pressure being
felt around the world," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's comments marked the second effort by a top economic
policy-maker to blunt rising protectionist pressures spawned by a
U.S. trade deficit that has soared to record levels because of the
world financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned in two major
speeches in recent weeks that increased protectionism threatens
the U.S. prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Greenspan's speeches, Rubin said, "We must broaden
understanding of our stake in the global economy." That
understanding is "not broadly shared among the American people,"
and the voices of "those advocating that we turn inward are
growing more numerous and getting stronger," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the finance ministers of the world's seven
industrial countries will take up a U.S.-supported agenda for
overhauling the global financial architecture during meetings this
Saturday in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said the annual economic summit on June 18-20 would also
focus on reconstruction needs in the Balkans and proposals to
reduce debt levels of the world's poorest countries.

JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign exchange
reserves slid to 15.89 billion U.S. dollars on June 4 compared to
the previous week's level, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to the repayment of government foreign
debts, Bank Indonesia said in its latest weekly report.

<P>
Net international reserves, however, were still above the
International Monetary Fund's adjusted target of 15.4 billion U.S.
dollars despite the drop, The Jakarta Post Thursday quoted the
report as saying.

<P>
Meanwhile, gross international reserves -- net foreign exchange

dropped by 18.5 million U.S. dollars to 25.95 billion U.S. dollars
from 25.97 billion U.S. dollars in the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Tri-Coloured Pottery Kiln Ruins Discovered In Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese antique lovers have
discovered a workshop for making tri-coloured glazed pottery of
the Tang Dynasty ((618-907) at a construction site in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was found at an airport in the western suburb of
Xi'an, Shaanxi's capital. Zhang Guozhu and Li Li started finding
large amounts of earthenware shards and some semifinished products
at the construction site and were able to put pieces together into
figurines in animal and human shapes and decided that they were
blanks that failed to meet standards and were thrown out as waste.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered a slate with the characters "Tianbaosizai",
which was very important for determining the age of the kiln. Tri-
coloured glazed pottery kilns have been found in Gongxian County
in Henan Province, Tongchuan in Shaanxi Province, Neiqiu in Hebei
province, and Qionglai County in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
However, they are all small and couldn't meet the immense
demands of the Tang Dynasty. Shipping large amounts of tri-
coloured glazed pottery to Chang'an, the capital of the Tang
Dynasty from remote areas was also impractical, a Shaanxi Cultural
Relics Department official explains.
</P>
<P>
So, Chinese archeologists have theorized that Chang'an could
have had its own kilns but had no document or material evidence to
support their thesis and the recent discovery gives greater clues
to pottery making for that period.

<HEADLINE> Competition Needed in China's Telecom Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's specialized
telecommunication networks -- many of them idle -- could be used
to help end China Telecom's telecommunications monopoly, asserted
some experts and officials.
</P>
<P>
A country's telecommunications industry must have unified
networks and standards, but it need not necessarily be run under a
monopoly, experts with the State Development Planning Commission
were quoted as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
With the planned economy, China developed at least 70
specialized telecommunications networks in sectors including
railways, radio and television, but these networks were not
allowed to enter the domestic telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that allowing these networks to join the telecom
market and set up new and modern telecom enterprises based on them
could be a shortcut to create a competitive mechanism in China's
telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways has applied to the State Council for
permission to create a telecommunications company by using its own
nationwide telecom networks.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peng, a railway ministry official, said that
telecommunication services could become an economic pillar of the
state-owned railway industry.
</P>
<P>
China's telecom market has long been dominated by China Telecom,
with the rest two other telecom companies -- China United
Telecommunication Corp. (China Unicom) and China Jitong -- holding
limited market shares.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Genetically-Enhanced Cotton With Rabbits' Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
a strain of cotton from rabbit genes, using genetic-engineering.
</P>
<P>
The rabbit keratin cotton strain was developed by researchers
at the Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology to have the benefits
of ordinary cotton fiber and rabbit fur and analysts say it has a
good chance of being widely used and could account for 10 percent
of China's total cotton output in the near future and change this
traditional textile industry.
</P>
<P>
China is a world major cotton producer whose 1998 cotton output
was 4.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The research team was headed by Chen Xiaoya. It began in 1997
with the use of keratin genes from rabbits in hundreds of cotton
plants. By the end of 1998 there were more than 30 of the plants
in their lab. The new strain is now grown on experimental farms
and could be used on a larger scale in one or two years.
</P>
<P>
The stems and leaves of the new strain are similar to those of
ordinary plants, but the cotton fiber is bright and as soft as
rabbit hair. A test by China Textile University and the Ministry
of Agriculture's Cotton Quality Inspection Center in May found
that the new fiber is 60 percent longer than ordinary fiber and is
more resilient with greater tensile strength and better ability to
maintain warmth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 2 More Seats Produced in Nepal House of Representatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The seat number of the Communist
Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) in the
205-member House of Representatives grew to 70 as it won in two
constituencies of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Ishwar Pokhrel and Pradip Nepal from the party were declared
elected Wednesday evening and Thursday morning in the No. 3 and
No. 1 constituencies which went to the polls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The last hope of Bam Dev Gautam, general secretary of the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML), was battered
in Kathmandu-1 where he came third only. He was defeated in his
home turf of Bardia district on May 3.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML, which broke away from the CPN-UML in March 1998,
has failed to win even a single seat in the house.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections held on May 3 and May 17 had
produced 201 seats in the house. The Nepali Congress, which
clinched a majority of 110 seats, formed on May 31 its majority
government headed by Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.
</P>
<P>
The No. 5 constituency of Siraha district and the No. 3
constituency of Sunsari district, which were rescheduled for June
23 and June 26 respectively due to the death of candidates, will
produce the remaining two seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and the National Democratic Party (RPP) had agreed
to an electoral alliance in the last four constituencies. The RPP
agreed to support the CPN-UML in Kathmandu-1 and -3 and Siraha-5
while the CPN-UML will throw its weight behind the RPP in
Sunsari-3.

<HEADLINE> Better Economic Outlook Predicted for Mexico, Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and Brazil, the two
largest economies in Latin America, will have better economic
development over the next few months, the international brokerage
company JP Morgan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here Wednesday, the company predicted
an economic growth rate of 2.8 percent for 1999 for Mexico, higher
than its former prediction of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said Brazil would suffer a less severe economic recession
than they predicted a few months ago, after the abrupt devaluation
of the Brazilian currency, the real, in January.
</P>
<P>
Over the next quarter, there would be a general improvement in
the economic climates in both Mexico and Brazil, the company said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the improvement in the economic panorama and the
exchange rate between the dollar and the Mexican peso over the
last few weeks is supporting the internal consumption of national
and imported goods, which will lead to higher growth.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Brazil, the company said that the lowering of
interest rates and the control of inflation would help improve the
general performance of the economy, determined by the devaluation
of the real.

measure was introduced to help speed up the debt restructuring of
the local business groups.
</P>
<P>
Under the new decree, foreign investors would have a clearer
legal framework in converting bonds issued by local business
groups into equity stake.
</P>
<P>
"Previously, there was no ruling on the matter. So we set up
the rule to accommodated such interest in order to attract foreign
investors and speeding up the revitalization of the country's real
sector," Marzuki was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring foreign debts through debt-to-equity-swap scheme
is currently a popular alternative to the country's debt-ridden
business group.
</P>
<P>
Several giant business groups, including the widely-diversified
Bakrie and Brothers have adopted the scheme for resolving its
debts.
</P>
<P>
The debt-to-equity swap deals, however, could not be
implemented because foreign investors were still barred from
owning stake in a local holding company.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that they were controlling the holding
companies, Marzuki said, foreign investors were still restricted
to control the subsidiaries which operating in closed sectors for
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Those business sectors include ports, airlines, shipping,
public railways, drinking water supply, telecommunication, mass
media, atomic energy reactors, explosives and others.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki, who is also the chairman of the Investment
Coordinating Board, said the new decree is part of a series of
policies the government would introduce to lure back foreign
investors to the country.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful general elections on June 7 were expected to
improve the investment climate in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment approval in Indonesia plunged 89
percent to a mere 935 million U.S. dollars for the period from
January 1 to April 15 from the same period last year as foreign
investors continued to avoid the country on social and political
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment fell by 60.7 percent last year to
13.3 billion U.S. dollars, while domestic investment approvals
shrank to 59.4 trillion rupiah (7.42 billion U.S. dollars) from
199.9 trillion rupiah in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Generals Sign Military Technical Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUMANOVO AIRPORT, Macedonia, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and
NATO signed a military technical agreement here Wednesday evening
on the withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo, the southern Serbian
province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Lt. General Mike Jackson, leader of the NATO delegation at the
talks, confirmed in a short statement that Yugoslav Col. General
Svetozar Marjanovic and Lt. General Obrad Stevanovic have signed
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovic, leader of the Yugoslav military delegation, is the
deputy chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav armed forces
while Stevanovic is an assistant minister for internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jackson put his signature on the six-page document on behalf of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The document provides "a clear legal base" for the deployment
of the international security force known as the Kosovo Force, or
KFOR.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a "phased, verifiable and orderly"
withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo. That would allow for an
international security presence to be stationed there, Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
The verifiable compliance of the agreement will create the
conditions for the suspension of the 11-week NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
As soon as an initial verifiable pullout is confirmed, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana will order the suspension of air
strikes, said the British general and commander of the NATO forces
in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for a resumption of air strikes if
it is breached, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to conduct "even-handed" implementation of the
agreement with a robust military presence to establish a secure
environment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, NATO spokesman Lt. Col. Robin
Clifford had said that the talks were adjourned and would resume
Thursday morning as Assistant Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia
Nebojsa Vujovic left for Belgrade for higher-level consultations.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Vujovic came back one hour later with new "
instructions" from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
They signed the military technical agreement after the latest
talks which lasted about 80 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A previous round of talks between the senior military
delegations over the weekend broke off early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said NATO air
strikes are continuing as "nobody has taken any decision to halt
them or suspend them yet because we haven't yet seen any
withdrawal of the Serb forces."

<HEADLINE> Three-Phased Pullout Defined from Kosovo--U.S. Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said on Wednesday
that there would be a three-phased pullout of Serb troops from
Kosovo under a NATO-Yugoslav agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Serb forces will withdraw from a northern section of Kosovo
on Thursday to trigger a suspension of NATO bombing, Air Force
Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
That would be the first part of an 11-day phased withdrawal, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Within five days after that, all forces would be out of the
southern part of Kosovo, and three days later all troops would be
out of central Kosovo and two days later all forces would be clear
northern Kosovo, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of NATO's vicious bombing against Yugoslavia
"could come within 24 hours," said Under Secretary of Defense
Walter Slocombe. "We would like this to happen as quickly as
possible, but we will verify," he said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said U.S. Army Gen. Wesley
Clark, commander of all NATO forces, would have authority to
decide on a bombing pause and any bombing resumption.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Qualifies for Euro 2000 Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic became the first
country to qualify for the European Championship finals with a 3-2
victory over Scotland in Prague on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech team rallied from two goals down to clinch the
victory of a group nine match.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs, beaten finalists in Euro'96, clinched first place
in their group by reaching a maximum 21 points from seven matches -
- a total none of the chasing pack can catch.
</P>
<P>
The winners of the nine qualifying groups and the best placed
runner-up are guaranteed an automatic place in the finals along
with joint-hosts Belgium and the Netherlands. The eight other
runners-up then play-off for the four remaining spots.
</P>
<P>
With the Czechs clear on 21 points, Scotland lead the scramble
for second place with eight points, the same tally as both Bosnia
and Lithuania. Estonia have seven points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in group five, Poland, who have never appeared in the
European Championship, boosted their chance of reaching the finals
with a 3-2 win over Luxembourg while their group rivals England
could only draw 1-1 in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Poland, whose next match is at home to England on September 8,
raced into a 3-0 lead against Luxembourg who came back with two
late goals to keep the outcome in doubt until the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
But that result, together with a disappointing draw for England
against a Bulgarian side reduced to 10-men for the last 30 minutes
in Sofia, favored Poland in group five.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, who did not play on Wednesday, lead the group with 13
points from five matches, followed by Poland, 12 from six and
England nine from six. Poland are now favorites to finish at
least second and qualify for the play-offs.
</P>
<P>
Romania also took a huge step to ensuring their place in the
play-offs at least with a 4-0 thumping of Azerbaijan in group
seven. Romania now have 17 points from their seven matches --six
points clear of third placed Slovakia who won 1-0 in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who crushed Liechtenstein 8-0, are top of the section
with 18 points and are also virtually certain to finish either
first or second although Slovakia do have an outside mathematical
chance of catching them.
</P>
<P>
In other major match of the day, tiny Andorra made world
champions France fight all the way for a hard-fought 1-0 win in
the game played at Barcelona's Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
France, beaten 3-2 at home by Russia on Saturday, only scored a
late penalty through Frank Leboeuf in a game marred by the
sendings-off of France's Christophe Dugarry after only 24 minutes
and Andorran Tony Lima six minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
It was Andorra's best-ever international result and although
they remain bottom of group four they were the moral victors on
the night.
</P>
<P>
The result lifted France into second place in group four on 14
points, behind leaders Ukraine who drew 0-0 in Armenia.
</P>
<P>
But it is getting close at the top. Russia moved into
contention with a 1-0 win over Iceland in Moscow -- Iceland's
first defeat in 11 matches.
</P>
<P>
With seven matches played Ukraine have 15 points, France 14,
Russia 12 and Iceland 12. Ukraine play France when battle
recommences in September, with Iceland at home to Andorra and
Russia at home to Armenia.
</P>
<P>
In Group One, Italy stayed top despite being held to a 0-0 draw
by Switzerland in Lausanne, but Denmark revived their hopes with a
2-0 win over Wales in Liverpool thanks to goals in the last six
minutes from John Dal Tomasson and Stig Toftig who scored with a
90th minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
Italy have 14 points from six matches, followed by Denmark on
eight, Switzerland on seven and Wales out of it on six.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, whose government refused to allow Yugoslavia into the
country for Saturday's group eight qualifier in Dublin,finally got
down to business and beat Macedonia 1-0 with Niall Quinn scoring
the second half winner.
</P>
<P>
That result lifted Ireland joint-top of the section on nine
points along with Yugoslavia, who beat Malta 4-1 in neutral Greece
on Tuesday. They have identical records and are ahead of Macedonia
(7) and Croatia (7) who remain in contention.
</P>
<P>
But Ireland's campaign could yet be derailed if UEFA decide to
penalize them for their failure to play Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Terms Military Agreement as Important for U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia said Wednesday
that the military agreement signed Wednesday between its
commanders and NATO is important for the Balkan country and also
important for the United Nations to regain its authority in
maintaining the world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told reporters the military accord
"indicates the end of the war and the beginning of the peaceful
period."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav and NATO commanders Wednesday signed a military
agreement in Macedonia, under which Serbs are expected to complete
the withdrawal of its military personnel from Kosovo, a Serb
province, in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
The agreement "is important for the United Nations because it
enables the U.n. to enter into the political scene and regain some
of its own standing and authority," said Jovanovic, who was former
foreign minister of his country.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping forces, Jovanovic
said, "We also expect the Mission of the United Nations to provide
full protection to all population in the province."
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force are to be set up after the U.N. Security
Council adopts a draft resolution, hammered out by Russia and
seven major Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is on standby to have a meeting late on
Wednesday to discuss the resolution as its members are working
hard to narrow gap among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, acting Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, said that "We still have some difficulties" with
the resolution text.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Wednesday as investors remained in fears about higher interest
rates while expectation of rising in chip sales encouraged the
market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 75.35 at
10,690.29. The Index fell 143.74 Tuesday after two Federal Reserve
officials made comments that suggested the central bank would
raise interest rates to cool off the economy at the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
Fears about higher interest rates hit the Treasury market,
pushing price of the government's 30-year bond down and its yield
above the psychologically important 6 percent barrier to 6.02
percent late today. The higher rate of bond yield prompted
investors to shift to bond.
</P>
<P>
But shares of technology stocks were higher after the
Semiconductor Industry Association said chip sales in 1999 are
expected to grow faster than anticipated. The technology heavy
Nasdaq index rose 44.79 at 2,519.35.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoys See Most Hard Work Ahead in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The two U.N. Special Envoys
for the Balkans said Wednesday that the world will face "the most
challenging, the most complicated" in peace operation and post-war
economic reconstruction in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt and Eduard Kukan, the two U.N. special envoys, made
the statement after they briefed the Security Council on their
work. The statement came as the 15-member Security Council was
meeting in a closed-door session to deliberate on the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the work in Kosovo will be "the most challenging,
the most complicated peace implementation and operation ever
undertaken by the international community in modern times," Bildt
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take Kosovo from virtually nothing to practise
everything in the next few years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kukan echoed the statement by Bildt, saying that the work ahead
is the most hard for the international community.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, beginning March 24, launched air strikes on
Yugoslavia, creating serious humanitarian crisis and destroying
numerous civilian infrastructures in the Balkan country, in
addition to a large number of civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
If the Security Council adopts the draft resolution,
hammered out Tuesday by Russia and seven major Western
countries, the United Nations will take most efforts to render
humanitarian assistances to Kosovo refugees and displaced people.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to appoint a
civilian administrator to take care of the establishment of the
interim administration in Kosovo, where residents can enjoy
substantial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The two special envoys held a coordinated meeting in Geneva on
Tuesday morning, which was attended by U.N. and non-U.N. actors,
including NATO.

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Wednesday that a peace agreement reached by NATO and
serb officials lays out the terms for Serb withdrawal and the
entry of a NATO-lad security force.
</P>
<P>
"The military Technical Agreement reached by NATO and Serb
military leaders lays out the terms for Serb withdrawal and the
entry of a NATO-led force," Cohen told a briefing at the Pentagon
after the announcement of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He called the deal a "sound agreement" as it meets "all of
NATO'S demands.
</P>
<P>
When asked under what condition the U.S. troops would begin
moving into Kosovo, Cohen expected that would occur right after a
resolution is passed by the U.N. Security Council. "Then we would
have KFOR moving in very quickly to make sure that there's no gap
between the Serb forces who are leaving and the KFOR forces coming
in," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the first step would be the verification of Serb
withdrawal from Kosovo in an accordance of the agreement, "then it
would go to the Security Council, and the Security Council could
then pass the resolution. And once that is passed, then we would
see the forces flowing into Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen confirmed that U.S.-led NATO troops have already been
"prepared to go in very quickly, so that there will not be any
kind of a significant gap between Serb forces leaving and the KFOR
going in."
</P>
<P>
As regard to Kosovar refugees' return, Cohen said he hoped
they would return as quickly and safely as possible. "But we
can't put any specific time frame on this," he said.
