<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Clarity in EU-Turkey Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting on Greece's stance toward the
neighboring country's bid for the EU candidacy, Simitis said that
Turkey's participation in EU procedures as a candidate country
would be a positive step, but this candidacy would lead to
problems and tension and would not allow the realization of the
goal it serves if there were no previous clear positions on
existing problems such as the Cyprus issue and the strained Greek-
Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
"Clarity will allow us to avoid crises and to provide the
solutions necessary if we are to achieve a satisfactory result,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was necessary that there be clear positions in
regards to the ways and the rules of behavior of all the
participants, European partners, Greece and Turkey so that they
could be led to solutions and not to impasses with the new
relations of Turkey with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The premier hoped that European partners would share Greece's
position that the interest of all and particularly of the members
of the EU demanded workable solutions which would ensure the
common goals of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
Wednesday that the stance Athens intends to take at the EU
Helsinki summit would depend more on the actions of the EU and
less on Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hesitates to Place Capstone Atop Pyramid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has yet to decide whether
to place a golden peak on the Great Pyramid of Cheops in Giza in
the millennium celebrations, the minister of culture said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
French rock composer Jean Michel Jarre is due to give a 12-hour
overnight concert on December 31 in front of 50,000 people at the
Giza Pyramids to usher in the millennium.
</P>
<P>
The concert, including lasers and fireworks, is to incorporate
Oriental, Western and traditional Egyptian songs and to last from
sunset to sunrise. The placing of the golden capstone atop the
missing peak of the Cheops Pyramid, the largest of the three, had
been billed as the centerpiece of the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"We have not reached a final decision regarding whether to
place the capstone on the pyramid. It is still under consideration
by experts," Farouq Hosni told reporters at the site of the
concert on the Giza plateau.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the small four-meter-high capstone has already
been built did not necessarily mean that it would be placed on the
pyramid, Hosni said during an inspection tour at the site.
</P>
<P>
Local officials and media have recently spoken out against the
decision to place the golden capstone made of light metal on the
Cheops Pyramid, saying it would tamper with a great historical
monument and might damage it forever.
</P>
<P>
Antiquities officials have argued that the crowning of the
pyramid mirrored an ancient Egyptian rite that marked the
completion of the building of the pyramid 4,500 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets Albright on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday evening started talks with visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on ways of overcoming difficulties in
the final-status talks and in the interim period.
</P>
<P>
Albright will brief Arafat on the outcome of her talks with
Syrian President Hafez al Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy, observers have said.
</P>
<P>
Albright started her four-day Mideast tour in Saudi Arabia
Monday. She arrived in Israel Tuesday evening after a stopover in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat will explain to Albright Palestinian
position in the final-status talks with Israel, especially on the
Jewish settlement issue, which deadlocked the final-status talks
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks in Ramallah will in general probe ways of
implementing the Sharm el Sheikh accord signed in early September,
with the delayed second Israeli troops redeployment at the core of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
During her visit to church in Bethlehem earlier in the day,
Albright promised that the U.S. would do its best to push forward
the peace process and enhance the U.S.-Palestinian ties.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to return to Israel to meet Barak on the
peace talks and then to Sharm Al-Sheikh to meet Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Approves Aid For Dioxin-hit Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it has authorized state aid in Belgium for firms
producing, processing, transporting or marketing foodstuffs or
animal feeding stuffs affected by the dioxin crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under a protocol concluded between the regional authorities and
the Belgian Banking Association, the banking sector may grant
loans to healthy firms with cash-flow problems due to the
destabilization of the market caused by the dioxin contamination
of certain animal feeding stuffs and by the measures taken to
remedy the crisis, said the commission, the European Union (EU)'s
executive branch for drafting and implementing laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
The loan scheme is based on the combination of a 50 percent
guarantee from the public sector and a 50 percent guarantee from
banking sector, which would also waive its usual interest-rate
margin.
</P>
<P>
The interest ceiling is fixed at the Belgian prime rate less 30
basis points (cost price for banks), the commission said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive authorized in September a similar protocol
between the Belgian government and the Belgian Banking Association
where the recipients were agricultural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In connection with another state aid measure, the commission
did not object to a draft Belgian law which forms the basic legal
framework providing for the necessary powers to take specific
steps to assist agricultural enterprises affected by the dioxin
crisis, the commission said
</P>
<P>
The dioxin crisis broke out in May this year after certain
cancer-causing chemicals containing dioxin were found in some
animal feeds, provoking fears for food contamination.
</P>
<P>
The public fear led to product recall from store shelves and
also losses in many food related companies due to a widespread
boycott of the Belgian food exports.

<HEADLINE> S. African Health Dept. Says New Tobacco Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The new tobacco
regulations will not impact negatively on South Africa's economy
or the tourism industry, South African Department of Health said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Regulating tobacco does not erode tobacco tax revenues, nor
does it cause permanent job losses," the department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It will only lead to a slow decline in tobacco use and that
will ultimately reduce tobacco-related deaths over time, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The tourist industry would not be affected because "tourists do
not leave their countries to smoke in South Africa", it added.
</P>
<P>
The regulations do not completely ban smoking in public places
but restrict smoking to designated areas only.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Enhance Maritime Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has promised to cooperate with the Merchant Navy Officers
Association of Tanzania to develop a sustainable shipping industry
and enhance the safety of shipping and protection of the marine
environment.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the government is to enhance public maritime safety
awareness, especially for those groups that are directly involved
in maritime activities, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Communications and Transport Salim Msoma said in Dar es Salaam
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said if maritime safety awareness is improved,
accidents will be reduced and accompanying losses to lives and
property will undoubtedly be diminished.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reduce maritime accidents which lead to loss of
lives and properties, the Tanzanian government is seriously taking
steps to ensure that all crafts are seaworthy and all vessels are
efficiently and sufficiently manned, Msoma said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is very important that all the sea and lake users
are instructed with maritime safety knowledge through all
appropriate and available means.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that most of the maritime accidents are
attributed to human errors.
</P>
<P>
"These errors, on the other hand, can be reduced through
appropriate training, public lectures or other means to
disseminate the essential safety information knowledge," he added.

<HEADLINE> Economists Project U.S. Economy to Grow 3.9 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will
increase 3.9 percent in 1999 and 3.2 percent in 2000, compared
with the 4.3 percent growth in 1998, according to a report
released by the National Association for Business Economics (NABE)
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report presents the consensus of macroeconomic forecasts
made by a panel of 35 professional forecasters from the membership
of the NABE. The survey was conducted in late November.
</P>
<P>
During the last survey in September, NABE economists expected
the economy to grow 3.8 percent this year and 2.7 percent next
year.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts by NABE panelists for the rate of real growth in the
economy continue to move higher and the government's benchmark
revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts data since
last survey provided a convenient opportunity for a sizable boost
in many forecasts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts for inflation were also boosted, however, so the
revisions reflected both an increasing willingness to assume a
higher rate of trend-growth for productivity and the economy, as
well as growing concerns that the economy is posting a traditional
overheating said the report.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is expected
to rise from 1.6 percent in 1998 to 2.2 percent in 1999 and 2.5
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.2 percent in
1999 following the 4.5 percent last year, but is expected to
stabilize around a 4.3 percent rate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The median forecasts of the NABE panelists continue to support
the view that economic growth will decelerate in the year 2000,
but by less than previously assumed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Quarterly forecasts revealed expectations that economic growth
will slow to only 2.3 percent in the first quarter following 4.3
percent in the final quarter of 1999, and will then stabilize
around 3.2 percent in the remaining quarters of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Panelists expected the slowdown to be led by weakness in the
interest sensitive sectors of the economy, which were boosted with
the global financial crisis when U.S. interest rates fell in 1997
and 1998.

ANKARA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish frighter ship sank off
the Turkish coast in the Black Sea after it collided with a
Russian tugboat overnight, the Anatolia News Agency reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-ton Yalikoy-2, which was carrying a load of iron from
the Ukrainian port of Yalta to Burgaz of Bulgaria, went down after
a Russian-flagged tugboat crashed into it at about 22:00 local
time (2000 GMT) Tuesday in international waters of the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Russian tugboat escaped from the scene, some 190 kilometers
northeast of the Eregli county in the Black Sea Region, said
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Captain Nihat Dogruyol and nine other crew members got on
life-boats shortly after the accident and signaled SOS with
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
They waited for four and a half hours in the open sea before
being picked up and brought to Istanbul by the Italian-flagged
Kriton.

accidents in the Bosporus Strait this week. The strait is an

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russia, Belarus Sign Union Treaty, Start Practical Unity Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his Belarussian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, signed a
treaty here Wednesday to create a Russian-Belarussian union state.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also signed a program for implementing the
treaty's principles.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Yeltsin said, "It is a remarkable
day in the century-old history of the two fraternal peoples."
</P>
<P>
"The tasks which Alexander Grigoryevich (Lukashenko) and I set
before ourselves a year ago have been fulfilled. Our countries are
entering the 21st century in a new quality," said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Russian-Belarussian cooperation is rising to a new level and
the two countries have obtained an efficient instrument for
creating a common foundation for work and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our union state is being created on the basis of respecting
the member states' sovereignty and independence and is not
targeted against any other one, even Bill Clinton," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to work together for creating a peaceful and
civilized life for our citizens. I'm sure our work will be
adequately assessed by our descendants," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko assured that Belarus will make a weighty
contribution to the development of the union state.
</P>
<P>
"In the West, you (Russia) have a reliable and strong friend
who has never betrayed the Russian people and has always been with
them," said Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the signing ceremony, Lukashenko
said he and Yeltsin agreed to submit the treaty to the parliaments
of both countries for ratification Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty should come into force before the end of 1999 so
that it can begin to promote economic changes as of January 1,
2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
"After that, we will meet for a session of the Supreme State
Council, discuss problems related to common government bodies, and
address personnel matters," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also agreed that a first meeting of the
Supreme State Council of the Russian-Belarussian Union would be
convened in Moscow in January 2000. Yeltsin will be confirmed as
the first chairman of the union at the upcoming meeting, Yeltsin's
spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
While asked who will head the unified nation, Lukashenko said "
it depends on the Russian side."
</P>
<P>
He said it is more important for Belarus who becomes the head
of the Executive Committee -- the union's common government. In
keeping with current practice, if the president of one country
heads the Supreme Council, the prime minister of the other should
head the Executive Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko confirmed that Belarus will not change its role as
regards the North Caucasus following the signing of the union
treaty with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to interfere in this internal Russian conflict,
" Lukashenko said at a Wednesday news conference, noting that "
Russia should deal with the problems in the North Caucasus on its
own."
</P>
<P>
During their meeting Wednesday, Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed
to create a joint army group of the two states.
</P>
<P>
The army will be a formidable force, include the Moscow
Military District and the Belarussian Armed Forces, Lukashenko
said. The army will effectively protect Russia from the western
direction and the entire area beyond the ocean can be kept under
surveillance from Belarus, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not plan to fight with anybody. We simply want to
protect ourselves," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus has not
been discussed since they were withdrawn from the country,
Lukashenko said. This will be discussed if the need arises, he
said, regretting that the West does not support Minsk's proposal
that a nuclear-free zone be set up in the center of Europe.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Yeltsin, the understanding was reached
that a common currency and common foreign, defense and customs
policies would be adopted in the future union-state, Lukashenko
said.
</P>
<P>
"Experts and bankers have not agreed on the kind of currency,
but equality should be the principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
Equality is the cornerstone of the treaty signed Wednesday and
Belarus will not agree to any kind of unequal cooperation, he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the signing of the union treaty evoked widely
positive repercussions in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the union state treaty "meets national interests
of both countries, is in the channel of world and pan-European
integration."
</P>
<P>
"It is important that unification is accomplished on a
voluntary and equal basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the Federation Council (upper house
of the Russian parliament), hailed the treaty to merge Russia and
Belarus in a single state.
</P>
<P>
"The people of the two countries need the accord," he told the
press.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed "in an atmosphere of absolute unanimity
among all the members of political parties and movements (present
at the signing ceremony) in the Kremlin," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, which requires ratification by the two
countries' parliaments, a union parliament would have to be
elected to build a legislative base for "closer union," Stroyev
said.
</P>
<P>
"There will also be a supranational executive branch as well as
other integration treaties. I think practical needs will speed up
the process," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and Belarussian presidents "stepped over themselves
and over pressure on the part of those who were against the union
and the treaty," the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of this, the presidents opted for this union and its
creation is an extremely necessary and well-timed step," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus have set an example for other CIS states,
Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
The union will also solve many strategic security problems for
both countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Belarussian opposition activists protested against the
signing of the Russian-Belarussian Union Treaty in Minsk Wednesday,
said an Interfax news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Around 30 demonstrators blocked a central avenue in the capital
of Minsk, demanding an independent state. Law enforcement
servicemen freed the avenue for traffic 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of this treaty would "inevitably lead to a
radicalization of the situation in Belarus and a conflict,"
Belarussian Popular Front Chairman Vyacheslav Sivchik said.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian opposition activist Mikhail Pastukhov said that
unification with Russia might entail changes to Belarus' nuclear
free status.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear arms will doubtless be deployed in Belarus at least to
shield Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
A clause of the treaty clears the way for a regional military
group in the western direction, he noted. It will "permit Russia
to deploy a so-called limited contingent to defend its strategic
facilities, to freely transit oil, gas and electricity to Western
countries and support the Belarussian authorities," he said.

<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that the
EU would make decisions on "the cruel question" of Chechnya during
the Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
France's threat to impose sanctions on Russia followed that
made by Britain Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has made a mistake by closing itself in a logic of
repression and not looking for the road for a political solution,"
said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot take a civil population hostage while asking us to
show understanding at the same time," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian army has sent an ultimatum to the civilians in the
Chechen capital of Grozny, asking them to leave the city before
Saturday or face death.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma to Pass Union Treaty Monday: Deputy Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma will
convene an additional session next Monday to ratify the Russian-
Belarussian union treaty, signed by the two countries' presidents
here Wednesday, said a Duma leader.
</P>
<P>
Deputy speaker of the State Duma (lower house of the Russian
parliament) Sergey Baburin said that this decision was reached at
a Wednesday meeting of the Duma Council attended by Russian
Defense Ministry leaders and Secretary of the Security Council
Sergei Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will be passed by the deputies undoubtedly and
definitely, believe observers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the heads of Russia and Belarus demanded the
treaty forming a unified nation be ratified before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the signing of the treaty,
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko said that he and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin are of one mind: "The treaty must
be ratified by the current Duma."
</P>
<P>
The treaty should come into force before the end of 1999 so
that it can begin to promote economic changes as of January 1,
2000, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said the two presidents agreed to submit the treaty
to the parliaments of both countries for ratification Wednesday
and Russia Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov promised to convene the
deputies to ratify it very soon.
</P>
<P>
"After that, we will meet for a session of the Supreme State
Council, discuss problems related to common government bodies, and
address personnel matters," Lukashenko said.

<HEADLINE> The Netherlands To Provide Aid To Employment Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government said
Wednesday that it is planning to provide aid to subsidize
employment projects next year.
</P>
<P>
The minister of social affairs and employment, Klaas de Vries,
said during a meeting that the government plans to make available
40 million guilders (18.6 million U.S. dollars) to aid the
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the projects are aimed at the "social activation" of
people who have ended up outside the employment process.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to "seek out people's hidden capabilities and
offer them opportunities to participate in our social system, even
where there is no immediate prospect of a paid job," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, about 1 million additional people have
found work. In addition, the Dutch government plans to help create
60,000 subsidized jobs and work experience placements, Klaas de
Vries said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister warned that "splendid figures" such as
these are no reason to "sit back with a satisfied smile."

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Hails Agreement On E-Commerce Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it welcomes the political agreement reached Tuesday
by the European Union (EU) foreign ministers on a common position
for the proposed Electronic Commerce Directive.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said in a statement that the directive would
ensure that information society services benefited from the EU
internal market principles of free movement of services and
freedom of establishment and could be provided throughout the EU
if member states complied with the law at home.
</P>
<P>
The proposed directive would establish specific harmonized
rules only in those areas strictly necessary to ensure that
businesses and citizens could supply and receive information
society services throughout the EU, irrespective of frontiers,
said the European Commission, the EU executive branch mainly for
proposing and enforcing regulations EU-wide.
</P>
<P>
Those areas include definition of where operators are
established, transparency operations for operators, transparency
requirements for commercial communications, conclusion and
validity of electronic contracts, liability of Internet
intermediaries, on-line dispute settlement and the role of
national authorities.
</P>
<P>
In other areas, the directive would build on existing EU
instruments which provide for harmonization or mutual recognition
of national law.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Plans to Sue Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal government
is planning to file its first lawsuit against the gun industry in
a move to pressure gun makers to adopt safe ways of making and
selling weapons, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The White House and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development have been laying the groundwork in recent months for
the suit on behalf of the country's 3,191 public housing
authorities and their 3 million people who live in public housing
projects, where shootings have taken a heavy toll for years.
</P>
<P>
The decision could dramatically strengthen the hand of more
than two dozen cities that have sued or threatened to sue firearms
manufacturers, seeking redress for the public cost of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is trying to force the gun industry to
settle those lawsuits by making a variety of concessions, such as
preventing "straw purchasers" from buying weapons -- a popular
method for convicted felons to obtain new guns.
</P>
<P>
Other concessions being sought include manufacturers including
safety locks on new guns; mechanisms that keep a gun from firing
when the magazine is removed; and technology that personalizes
guns so that only the owners may fire them.
</P>
<P>
If the gun industry does not agree to the concessions, the U.S.
government will file a class action lawsuit against the arms
industry for marketing and selling weapons irresponsibly.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a clear signal to the manufacturers that enough
is enough. The status quo is unacceptable," said Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo.

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Uganda to Restore Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and Uganda will exchange
ambassadors by the end of February, and restore full diplomatic
relations according to an agreement signed here on Wednesday by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudan counterpart Omar
al Bashir.
</P>
<P>
 After one-day talks in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, the two
presidents signed the agreement and both sides agreed to take
steps for reestablishing their diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement was witnessed by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
Uganda severed its diplomatic ties with Sudan in 1995, accusing
Sudan of financing and arming rebels who want to topple
Museveni's government, while Sudan accuses Uganda of aiding the
rebel Sudan Peoples Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
According to the 11-point document, Sudan and Uganda will
renounce the use of force to resolve differences, and will take
steps to prevent any hostile actions against each other.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to disband and disarm terrorist groups and to
prevent any acts of terrorism or hostile actions that might
originate in each other territory and endanger the security of
the other nation.
</P>
<P>
Among their pledges in the document, the two leaders agreed to
respect each country's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
cease support to any rebel groups, return all prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to make special efforts to locate and
return abductees to their families and offer amnesty and
reintegration assistance to all former combatants who renounce the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for formation of a joint ministerial
committee and technical support teams to establish a timetable of
specific steps to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Jimmy Carter said President Bashir
and President Museveni have taken an important step to restoring
diplomatic relations and encouraging peace in their countries and
in all of East Africa.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets On Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The 15-member United
Nations Security Council is meeting on Iraq Wednesday morning to
discuss a new U.N. policy towards the country.
</P>
<P>
U.N. diplomats said the remaining days of this week are
crucial to future policy on Iraq, with some members of the
Security Council seeking to put the draft resolution for a formal
vote by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said key members of the Security Council are
still far apart on some terms of the draft resolution, mainly on
the creation of a new arms monitoring regime and the laying out of
a rough timetable to test Iraq's compliance.
</P>
<P>
The council must have to make a decision on the current oil-
for-food program which will expire Saturday, according to the
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been sharply divided on the issue of
Iraq since the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq last
December which led the U.N. weapons inspectors to withdraw from
the country and the long suspension of their work.
</P>
<P>
 The current oil-for-food program has been held hostage by
some members of the Security Council of the new U.N. policy on
Iraq, namely the United States and Britain which pressure the
Security Council to adopt the resolution this week.
</P>
<P>
 The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented late
1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian situation in
Iraq which has been under stringent U.N. sanctions for nine years.
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
 The current phase six of the program began on May 25, 1999
and should have expired on November 20. But it has been extended
by the Security Council for two short periods of time.

<HEADLINE> Progress Seen at Conference on Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Delegates at an international
environment conference in the northern Swiss city of Basel are
close to agreement to further limit dangers posed by hazardous
waste, according to a report by Radio Switzerland International
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Swiss officials were quoted as saying that the more than 130
signatory countries are close to agreement on a protocol defining
liability in case of accidental spills. They also said Western
countries supported providing developing nations with more money
to help them dispose of hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
"Adopting the protocol would be a major breakthrough for
environmental protection," Klaus Topfer, executive director of the
U.N. Environment Program, said Monday when the week-long meeting
began.
</P>
<P>
"Greater efforts to minimize the generation of hazardous waste
and its transport across borders, and the introduction of a
liability and compensation regime, would provide an additional
safety net for the world's most vulnerable communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
A key target for the participants is to approve a new protocol
to the Basel Convention which has been adopted by more than 130
countries. The new protocol will define liability and compensation
in cases where waste disposal damages people's health or the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls Farmers to Uplift Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
called farmers in the country to uplift agricultural production in
order to promote employment and growth in the manufacturing and
processing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day meeting on poverty reduction here on
Wednesday, Land and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said
agricultural development has secured the country a better net
balance of payment through increased exports and decreased
imports.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released recently, agricultural
production accounted for 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
in the African country and contributed a third of its total
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The country's agricultural exports also grew from 300 million
U.S. dollars in 1997 to 444 million U.S. dollars in 1999, an
increase of 32.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Kangai, the government has carried out a land
reform program to make 73,000 families resettled on 3.5 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The government, together with the World Bank, has designed
schemes beneficial to communities through the provision of loans
for farming activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public and private sectors to strengthen
partnerships through the National Economic Consultative Forum task
force to ensure the land reform a success.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official to Visit Lebanon to Mend Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Farouk al Kadoumy, director of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)'s political department,
is due in Lebanon Thursday night in efforts to smooth worsening
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Kadoumy will hold talks with
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who is also the country's
foreign minister, over a crisis triggered by the death sentence on
a Palestinian, foreign ministry sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Lebanese military court sentenced Sultan
Abul-Ainayn, Arafat's top representative in Lebanon, to death in
absentia on charges of forming and leading an armed gang with the
purpose of committing crimes against the people and their
properties and defying the authority of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn is PLO's secretary general in Lebanon and also
heads the Lebanon branch of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
mainstream faction Fatah Movement.
</P>
<P>
While decrying the ruling, Abul-Ainayn said "it is not a
judicial verdict but with political motives that target the
entire Palestinian people and their cause."
</P>
<P>
He refused to turn himself in to Lebanese authorities and is
still living in the heavy-armed Rashidieh Palestinian camp, near
Lebanon's southern-most port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the surprise move against Abul-Ainayn might
have been motivated by the recent re-emergence of Fatah at the
Ein El-Hilweh camp near southern port city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
The camp is the biggest among the 12 shanty towns that house an
estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Ein El-Hilweh camp was dominated by the rival
Syrian-backed Palestinian factions, which are opposed to Arafat's
peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the death sentence was handed down, the
Palestinian National Authority accused the Lebanese government of
"conducting an oppressive policy" against the refugees living in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Greek Students Protest Against Educational Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- High school students and
teachers in Greece Wednesday staged demonstrations in the capital
city of Athens and other cities to protest against the country's
educational reforms and the government decision to allow public
prosecutors to intervene in sit-in protests at schools.
</P>
<P>
With a strong police presence in central Athens,
representatives of the protesters were allowed to enter the
Education Ministry building to deliver a list of demands which
include increased spending on education.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, some protesters
threw stones, firecrackers and eggs at police.
</P>
<P>
In other marches, seven people were reportedly detained but not
charged when students blocked the Kozani-Florina road.
</P>
<P>
High school students effectively closed down schools throughout
Greece for about three months late last year in protest against
the Education Ministry pushing through new examination and grading
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Greek cabinet decided Friday that a legislative act should
be drawn up to allow public prosecutors to intervene at any
schools being occupied to determine if damage had been caused or
non-students were involved in the protest.
</P>
<P>
The act will forbid sit-in protests and impose penalties on
those persons found to be hindering the normal functioning of
schools.
</P>
<P>
After Friday's sit-in ban, which brought the number of occupied
schools all over the country down from 225 last week to 84,
teenage activists are focusing on street protests and road
blockages.
</P>
<P>
Occupations at schools last year reportedly caused an estimated
6 billion drachmas (about 18.7 million U.S. dollars) in damage.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Parliament Ratifies U.N. Genocide Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss parliament has
ratified the United Nations genocide convention, which has already
been ratified by 129 other nations and is one of the most broadly
accepted international conventions.
</P>
<P>
According to Swiss Radio International, the House of
Representatives Wednesday voted unanimously to adopt the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide. It was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 1948 and
came into force in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Swiss ratification became possible after legal amendments were
adopted, making genocide a crime and listing prison terms for
violations of between 10 years and life.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss underlined that for years,
Switzerland had observed the spirit of the convention. But he
welcomed the fact that his country had finally joined the
international community in this realm.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations defines genocide as "acts committed with
intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial
or religious group."
</P>
<P>
Conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to
commit genocide, attempt to commit genocide and complicity in
genocide are all also considered crimes by international standards.

here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the department accounts for more
than 80 percent of the national revenue.

He said due to changes in the fiscal year from January to
December of 1999, it is difficult to make a comparison of the 1999
target with that in the previous financial year.
</P>

Zimbabwe's 1997/98 fiscal year operated on an 18-month period

<HEADLINE> Coalition Partner Threatens to Quit Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's National Religious
Party (NRP) on Wednesday threatened to quit the coalition
government if Prime Minister Ehud Barak freezes settlement
activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Barak's decision to freeze new
settlement-building is only for the purpose of serving the
final-status talks with the Palestinians or a long-term policy,
but it is clear that if Barak freezes settlement activities, the
NRP will leave the coalition, said Minister of Construction and
Housing Yitzhak Levy.
</P>
<P>
Levy, also NRP chairman, said he is asking for a meeting with
Barak to ask him to clarify the settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
The NRP, which has five members in the Knesset (parliament), is
a right-wing party which strongly supports the settlement
expansions and opposes making any concessions over the settlement
issue to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Construction and Housing Ministry on Sunday issued another
500 new housing tenders for settlement expansions, which caused
the Palestinian side to hold up the final-status talks the next
day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shas Party, which holds 17 Knesset seats, also
on Wednesday requested Barak to explain why he has decided to halt
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Barak announced Tuesday that he will, at least during the next
three months, freeze plans to add 1,800 more houses to Jewish
settlers in the West Bank in order to push the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Building more houses in the Jewish settlements will hinder
Israel's efforts to strike a final peace accord with the
Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side said Barak's offer was insufficient
to bring about the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Wednesday that
Israeli government would still permit "natural growth" of the
settlements to continue with the construction that is already
underway.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived here
Tuesday night, met with Barak Wednesday in an effort to help break
the deadlock of the final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Rebels Violate Peace Accord in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan, in a report to the U.N. Security Council, said that
despite progress in implementing a peace plan, the former rebel
leadership "should prove by their actions that they are indeed
committed to the peace process" in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord signed in the Togolese capital of Lome in
July, Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF), were given positions in the government in return for a
promise to disarm fighters and end the eight-year civil war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
So far, only some 6 percent of 45,000 ex-combatants have
surrendered to camps for demobilization, which U.N. peacekeepers
are to help supervise.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the RUF and other rebel groups continued to
move troops and weapons around Sierra Leone, targeting
international humanitarian personnel as well as their countrymen.
Attacks in areas they control include murder, rape and looting.
</P>
<P>
"The continued violence against the people of Sierra Leone and
international personnel is unacceptable and perpetrators should
expect to be held accountable for their actions," Annan said in
his report.
</P>
<P>
"The delivery of assistance continued to be obstructed by
arbitrary clearance procedures and threats," he said. "This should
stop."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, called the UNAMSIL, has
fielded the first few hundred of 6,000 expected peacekeepers, from
India, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have died in the civil war in
Sierra Leone.

<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, which was issued
here Wednesday, Annan said there are still problems over who
should be eligible to vote, including a large number of appeals
against exclusion from the election rolls.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, the prospect of holding the
referendum within a reasonable period of time, instead of becoming
closer, has become even more distant," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The problems posed by the current number of appeals and the
opposing positions taken by the parties on the issue of
admissibility seem to allow little possibility of holding the
referendum before 2002 or even beyond," he said.
</P>
<P>
The most recent target date for the referendum in the former
Spanish colony was July 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Morocco controls most of the phosphate-rich territory while the
Algeria-based Polisario Front has long been campaigning for
independence.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Passes Law Against Illegal Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese parliament Wednesday
passed a long-awaited law that prohibits the illegal accumulation
of wealth by civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that the civil servants as well as
presidents, ministers and lawmakers should declare their assets in
sealed envelops when they assume their public offices.
</P>
<P>
The envelops will be opened only if and when illegal wealth
charges are pressed and an investigation is conducted to enable
the investigative magistrate to compare the defendants' assets.
</P>
<P>
The law also bans anybody from leaking the information in the
envelop, otherwise the person responsible will face up to one year
in jail.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is not new for Lebanon, which had similar laws
in the 1950s. But they have never been enforced because the
ensuing governments have never set up the executive mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Since elected on a platform of combating corruption last
November, President Emile Lahoud has been pressing parliament to
pass the law which will be seen a main pillar of his regime.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein President Protests at "Bug" in Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
Wednesday made a formal complaint to the British and Irish
governments following the alleged discovery of a bugging device in
a car.
</P>
<P>
Adams said in Belfast that it was "a highly sophisticated
listening and tracking device" found in a car which he and
Northern Ireland Education Minister Martin McGuinness used during
the Mitchell review, and to travel to meetings with the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
Adams, who had been expected to launch his party program for
government Wednesday, instead produced the device which he
claimed was placed in a one-year-old Ford Mondeo owned by a Sinn
Fein supporter.
</P>
<P>
He said it was discovered during a routine search of the
vehicle and demanded to know who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a hugely serious breach of faith," Adams said.
"I think it is the securicrat agenda once again coming to the
surface."
</P>
<P>
He said the people involved in these "dirty tricks" were
clearly against the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Adams said his suspicions were that people in the military
establishment in Britain were behind the placing of the device.
</P>
<P>
He said the onus was now on Prime Minister Tony Blair to answer
the questions he had posed about the device and to find out who
was responsible.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the device had been built to the specifications of
the car and it had a digital tracking capability which could
possibly have been picked up by satellite.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political ally of the Irish Republican Army, was
involved in marathon negotiations to revive Northern Ireland's
1998 Good Friday peace accord which resulted in the transfer of
powers to a home-rule government in Belfast on December 2.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant Group Agrees to Join Arms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ulster Freedom Fighters, one
of Northern Ireland's main Protestant guerrilla groups, announced
Wednesday that it was ready to join talks on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant, pro-British UFF said it would appoint
representatives to meet retired Canadian general John de
Chastelain, who heads a commission set up to oversee guerrilla
disarmament under the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The UFF said its decision to join disarmament talks "was aimed
at enhancing the prospects for attaining a peaceful and democratic
resolution of the conflict," BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
But it added that "disarmament would only be considered in the
context of the IRA having already begun to decommission its
arsenal."
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, brokered by former U.S.
senator George Mitchell, Catholic and Protestant politicians have
this month formed a cross-party home-rule government for Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The main Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, agreed to go
into government with Sinn Fein before its Irish Republican Army
allies give up the guns they have used to fight British rule.
</P>
<P>
But the Unionists will meet again in February to review
progress and have made clear they want to see IRA disarmament by
then.
</P>
<P>
The UFF is expected to begin its dialogue with de Chastelain in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
De Chastelain's commission is preparing an interim report on
disarmament this week after meeting the IRA and one of its rival
paramilitary groups on the other side of the sectarian divide --
the Protestant, pro-British Ulster Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
The UVF has already appointed as its arms go-between a "
loyalist" politician, Billy Hutchinson, who met de Chastelain
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has also nominated a go-between who has not been
publicly identified. The group confirmed Sunday that its
representative had talks with de Chastelain.

<HEADLINE> Strike affects Cyprus' Two International Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Air traffic controllers and
ground staff staged a four-hour strike at Cyprus' two
international airports Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which started at 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT),
affected a total of 37 flights in and out of the Larnaca and
Paphos airports and thousands of travelers suffered delays for
hours as flights were rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
The strike was launched to protest against a government plan to
privatize the civil aviation department. A statement by the Civil
Servants Trade Union (PASIDY) complained that the government has
been stalling for years over restructuring the department.
</P>
<P>
On the privatization issue, PASIDY said the Ministry of
Communications and Works has tabled to the parliament a proposal
to bring in consultants at a cost of 900,000 Cyprus pounds (1.8
million U.S. dollars) to draw up a plan to attract strategic
investors for the restructuring and management of the two
international airports.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government intends to bring in strategic investors
to handle the operation of the two international airports and has
asked the parliament to approve bringing in an advisor to prepare
the legal framework to implement its plans.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the air controllers expressed regrets for
the inconvenience which was caused by the strike. However, they
threatened to escalate their measures if the government goes ahead
with its plans.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Raises Fares by 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's dominating airline, Air
Canada, has raised its domestic fares by 3 percent at the
extension of its takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
The hike was unveiled Tuesday when the country's top carrier
announced the extension to December 23 of its bid of 92 million
Canadian dollars (about 62 million U.S. dollars) to merge the
losing Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada spokeswoman Laura Cooke said the increase would
apply to all domestic fares. Tickets for U.S. and other
international flights were exempted, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada attributes the hike to the rising cost of fuel,
saying that the price of crude oil has jumped to nine-year highs
above 26 U.S. dollars a barrel, from a low of 12.70 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Each U.S. dollar change in the price of fuel adds 19 million
Canadian dollars (about 13 million U.S. dollars) to its annual
operating expenses, according to Air Canada.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Air Canada is expected to announce a deal with AMR
Corp. as early as Wednesday on the takeover of Canadian. The Texas-
based parent of American Airlines holds a 33 percent stake in
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
The takeover would give Air Canada an 80 percent market share.
Currently, the carrier is yet to gain sweeping approval from the
federal government, Canadian's shareholders and AMR by the
extended deadline of the bid.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is to be held in Togo's
capital Lome on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS, which was established in May 1975 in Lagos,
Nigeria, is the largest African regional organization aimed at
promoting economic cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
The organization, with its headquarters located in Nigeria's
capital Abuja, has currently 16 members. They are Benin, Burkina
Faso, Cape Verde, Gote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea
Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra
Leone and Togo.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment, the ECOWAS has held 21 summits, the
last one being in Abuja in 1998. Togo is the current chairman
state of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Summit is the highest authority organ of the organization.
Other institutions include the Council of Ministers, the Executive
Secretariat, the Community Court of Justice, and Specialized
Technical Commissions.
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, although the ECOWAS has been
criticized for its tardiness in promoting West Africa's growth and
integration, it did launch many remarkable activities such as the
ECOWAS traveller's cheques, the West African Gas Pipeline project
and the sub-regional financial institution the Ecobank.
</P>
<P>
The organization is widely praised for its role in peacekeeping
 operations in the sub-region with a population of nearly 250
million. The West African Peacekeeping Force or ECOMOG has
successfully restored peace in the former war-torn Liberia and
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the organization is striving for the establishment
of a crisis prevention mechanism to secure a lasting peace in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Russians Capture Chechen City of Urus-Martan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ministry press service cited preliminary front-line reports
saying that about 80 militants defending the town were killed,
while only one federal serviceman died during the combat and three
wounded. Damage in the city is minimized, said the military.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the Eastern Federal Grouping that seized
Urus-Martan said the volunteer unit led by former Grozny mayor
Bislan Gantamirov took an active part in liberating the city.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen militants' command late Wednesday confirmed the
fall of Urus-Martan situated 20 kilometers southwest of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The rebel "fighters abandoned their positions when it became
clear that it was practically impossible to hold them with Russian
air raids and artillery fire going on around the clock," said a
Chechen command spokesman, cited by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops completely encircled Urus-Martan on Monday and
started to storm it Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Russian groupings successively freed the second and the
third biggest Chechen cities of Gudermes and Argun, closed the
surrounding of Grozny. By now, Russian units have reportedly
controlled two thirds of Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
Russia began its military offensive against the Chechen
separatists in late September after Chechen rebels' armed
incursions into neighboring federal republic of Daghestan and a
spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in
Moscow and two other Russian cities. Russian authorities blamed
Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out the terrorist
acts.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Dismantles 13 Road Checkpoints Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government Wednesday
began demolishing 13 road checkpoints around capital Monrovia
erected by the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG in early
1997, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor had ordered the dismantling
of the road checkpoints, Police Director Paul Mulbah was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Mulbah, who led the demolition team, said that "this is an
additional sign that security in the country has generally
improved."
</P>
<P>
Two of the checkpoints in the west African country will be
maintained in Careysburg along the country's major highway, and in
the western suburb of Gardnersville, according to the police
director.
</P>
<P>
Road checkpoints had been manned by members of the police
special operation division when the ECOMOG withdrew early this
year as part of a count-down to its pull-out from Liberia.
</P>
<P>
A teeming crowd looked on as bulldozers razed the pre-stressed
concrete checkpoints and one of the on-lookers said the removal
of the checkpoints was "like wiping away a scar of the war."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council is expected to renew the oil-for-food program in
Iraq for another period of six months by the end of this week, a U.
N. diplomat said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council met on the program this morning,
and the United States and Britain tried to link the renewal of the
program with a new U.N. policy towards Iraq, which is opposed by
some members of the Council, said the diplomat who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
The current phase six of the oil-for-food program has been
extended by the council for two short periods of time and will
expire on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The program, which began to be implemented in late 1996, is
designed to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by
stringent U.N. sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and
other necessities for its people.

WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
announced on Wednesday that Israel and Syria had agreed to resume
the peace talks, suspended in 1996, next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright held separate talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak during her trip to the
Middle East this week.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Barak and
President al-Assad have agreed that the Israeli-Syrian peace
negotiations will be resumed from the point where they left,"
Clinton said in a nationwide televised news conference from the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not say whether Israel had agreed to give up the
Golan Heights for the resumption of the peace talks. Syria has
insisted that Israel's concession on the strategic heights must be
the condition for the resumption of the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said he would not get into the details about how the two
sides had agreed to resume the talks, only saying: "They want to
make peace and they have now concluded that they can do it on
terms that will meet both their interests."
</P>
<P>
Clinton pointed out that the negotiations were to resume "on
the basis of all previous negotiations ... between Syria and
Israel."
</P>
<P>
He warned against any illusion about the peace talks, saying: "
On all tracks the road ahead will be arduous."
</P>
<P>
"They face hard choices. They will have to stand firmly against
all those who seek to derail the peace, and sadly there are too
many of them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Leaders Join Summit in Montevideo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, December 8 (Xinhua)-- The final summit of the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) of this century was formally
inaugurated Wednesday in this capital to analyze an integration
policy and the challenges of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, Uruguay's President, Julio Marias
Sanguinetti, made a call to the block's partners to overcome
differences and face common tasks.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti highlighted the need to establish a macroeconomic
coordination for Mercosur, in order to prevent disorder, surprises
and forays.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session began Tuesday with meetings between economy
and foreign ministers of the four member nations including
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The two associate members:
Bolivia and Chile also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation, trade among the four member countries of
the block grew enormously, passing from 11.801 billion dollars in
1994, to 20.373 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, hit by Brazil's devaluation last January, the
region entered a period of crisis and economic recession, which
provoked fierce trade confrontations between Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti said that in order to prevent a similar crisis,
common fiscal objectives must be established.
</P>
<P>
Following Sanguinetti's speech, Uruguay's Foreign Minister
Didier Opertti made an evaluation of the integration and solution
to commercial controversies between Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of the six countries gather twice yearly for
the regularly scheduled summits.
</P>
<P>
Present at this summit are also Argentine President Carlos
Menem, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Paraguay's President
Luis Gonzalez Macchi and Chilean President Eduardo Frei. Bolivian
President Hugo Banzer wasn't present due to municipal elections in
his own country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Attention to Informal Sector in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
Wednesday called for attention to the informal sector in African
countries, saying that it forms important element of urban
economies and helps to address challenges of the urban development
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"A key challenge facing most cities in developing countries is
appreciating the dynamics of the informal sector and its positive
contributions to development," acting Executive Director of the
U.N. Commission for Human Settlements (Habitat) Klaus Toepfer said
in a speech at the opening of a four-day seminar on the informal
sector.
</P>
<P>
The informal sector accounts for some 60 percent of the urban
labor force in African countries and contributes 20 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP), Toepfer said in a speech read by his
deputy Daniel Biau.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer pointed out that the informal sector suffers from
constraints created by regulatory instruments which limit its
growth.
</P>
<P>
"In some countries, legal provisions give municipal authorities
the right to confiscate merchandise, to remove any unauthorized
physical structures and to impose fines," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official urged participants of the seminar to review
and discuss the ways of improving the informal sector in Africa,
namely policy, legal, regulatory, institutional and organizational
means.
</P>
<P>
About 50 experts from Asia and Africa attended the workshop
sponsored by the U.N. Habitat, U.N. Development Program and the
Office of the Special Coordinator for African and Least Developed
Countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Accept Renewal of Oil-for-food program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Wednesday
that it would accept a straightforward six-month renewal of the U.
N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Saeed Hasan, Iraq's Ambassador to the
United Nations, said Iraq would resume oil exports after the
program was renewed.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said after the Security Council passes the renewal,
there would be a pricing mechanism submitted to the U.N.'s oil
overseers and approved, then Iraq begins to export oil.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said his country wants the program to be
enhanced but will accept a straight renewal this time.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has suspended its oil export since the Security Council
on November 19 extended the current program, which should have
expired on November 20, for a further period of two weeks until
December 4. The Council last Friday once more extended the
program for an additional week until December 11. The moves by the
Security Council are stopgaps amid its sharp division on the issue
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late 1996
and is aimed to ease the suffering of the Iraq's people caused by
the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil in every six months to by humanitarian necessities
for its people.

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a year-end press conference at the State Department,
Clinton said it would be a mistake for the United States to cut
off aid to Russia because of its military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that a sanction regime against Russia has to be
imposed by the United Nations. "But I am not sure that would be in
our interests or in the interests of the ultimate resolution of
the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our interests would be furthered by terminating
that," Clinton said, adding such a move would alienate Russia from
the international community, and "that's a bad thing."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to point out to the American people
that two-thirds of the aid that we spend in Russia is involved in
denuclearization and safeguarding nuclear materials. And I think
it is plain that we have an interest in continuing that," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has launched a military operation against the rebels and
bandits in Chechnya. The West asked Russia to stop the operation,
accusing that civilians were killed. Moscow said this is a
domestic issue of Russia and the West has no rights to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Despite his criticism over Russia's operation in Chechnya,
Clinton told reporters that he had no sympathy for the rebels in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"I think Russia is already paying a heavy price... I don't
think the strategy will work. As I said, I have no sympathy for
the Chechen rebels. I have no sympathy for the invasion of
Dagestan. I have no sympathy for terrorist acts in Moscow,"
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Olympians Vow to Play More Active Role in Promoting Olympic Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Olympians vowed to increase
their activities towards the promotion of Olympic Ideals worldwide
at the end of their summit in Launsanne today.
</P>
<P>
The World Olympians Association (WOA) brought together 65
representatives of National Olympians Associations and individuals
Olympians, according to a press release by the International
Olympic Committee (IOC). All together, the Olympians attending the
Summit participated 138 times in the Olympic Games and won a total
of 74 medals (35 Gold; 23 Silver; 16 Bronze) in 21 sports.
</P>
<P>
Participants expressed their views on the role that Olympians
must play in the Olympic Movement as the ambassadors of the
Olympic Ideals. The actions of the National Olympians Associations
were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that Olympians should play an increasing role in
the following area:
</P>
<P>
- Anti-doping educational programs;
</P>
<P>
- Women Athletes in the Olympic Movement;
</P>
<P>
- Carry on and respect the IOC's code of Ethics taking in to
account the specificity of all cultures of the world;
</P>
<P>
- Develop a chain of solidarity to reach out to Olympians in
need, young athletes and the society as a whole;
</P>
<P>
- Achieve universality by encouraging and assisting developing
countries in the creation of a National Olympic Athlete
Association.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals all National Olympians Associations will
have to develop their communications to go beyond language
barriers and socio-economic differences:
</P>
<P>
- First, on the technical side, participants agreed that an
extensive usage of all kind of communications tools is needed.
</P>
<P>
- Second, the level of co-operation among all organizations
working for the Olympic Movement should be intensified.
</P>
<P>
All participants of the Summit unanimously support the reforms
proposals submitted by the IOC 2000 Commission to the 110th IOC
Session and call upon the IOC members to pass them.
</P>
<P>
Finally, it was pointed out that Olympians, through the WOA and
the IOC Athletes Commission, are becoming the fourth pillar of the
Olympic Movement along with the three pillars so often referred to
- the IOC, the International Federations and the NOC. In that
perspective, Olympians have to work together to promote,
strengthen and develop the Fundamental Principles of Olympism and
the Olympic Movement.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The 15-member United
Nations Security met on Wednesday for the first time in weeks to
discuss a new U.N. policy towards Iraq and the United States
sought to have a quick vote on it, a U..N. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said a draft
resolution on Iraq is expected to be introduced on Friday by
Britain, who holds the presidency of the Security Council this
month, and the United States would push for a vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So far, Russia and China had said that it is difficult to
expect a vote this week, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution would create a new arms inspection regime
in Iraq to replace the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, which
was established by the Security Council after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not been able to function in Iraq since the U.S.-
led military strikes against Iraq last December and Iraq barred
their return after the military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq so far has rejected the proposed resolution.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria to Resume peace Talks Next Week in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced on Wednesday that Israel and Syria had agreed to resume
the peace talks, suspended in 1996, next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright held separate talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak during her trip to the
Middle East this week.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Barak and
President al-Assad have agreed that the Israeli-Syrian peace
negotiations will be resumed from the point where they left,"
Clinton said at a nationwide televised news conference from the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not say whether Israel had agreed to give up the
Golan Heights for the resumption of the peace talks. Syrian has
insisted that Israel's concession on the Strategic heights, Syria'
s territory snatched by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, must
be the condition for the resumption of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would not get into the details about how the
two sides had agreed to resume the talks, only saying: "They want
to make peace and they have now concluded that they can do it on
terms that will meet both their interests."
</P>
<P>
Clinton pointed out that the negotiations were to resume "on
the basis of all previous negotiations ... between Syria and
Israel."
</P>
<P>
He warned against any illusions about the peace talks, saying:
"On all tracks the road ahead will be arduous."
</P>
<P>
"They face hard choices. They will have to stand firmly against
all those who seek to derail the peace, and sadly there are too
many of them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Concerned with Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials on Wednesday
expressed concern over the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks, saying they might harm the progress made on the
Palestinian-Israeli track, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced at a press conference in
Washington Wednesday evening that Syria and Israel agreed to
resume peace negotiations next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be held between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa "at the point
where they left off" in 1996, as demanded by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria has vowed not to restart peace talks with Israel until it
promised to return the Golan Heights seized from Syria in the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Barak, who came to power in May on a
platform to make peace with his Arab neighbors, holds that every
issue should be settled through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's announcement came after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who is on a four-day Mideast tour, held talks
with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Barak.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that Barak has informed Israeli President
Ezer Weizman of the decision before Clinton's announcement.
</P>
<P>
Weizman expressed his congratulations on Barak, saying that the
upcoming Washington talks will pave the way for peace between
Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the news of the planned Syrian-Israeli talks, a scheduled
joint press conference by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Albright, who have just concluded their talks, was postponed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and
about 100 others injured when a gas leak caused an explosion in a
restaurant here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that around six p.m., the police got a urgent
call from the owner of the Lijing Restaurant, saying that a gas
meter had cracked and he needed repairmen.
</P>
<P>
About three minutes later, an explosion occurred in the
restaurant, breaking windows and causing the building in downtown
Shanghai to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Among those pronounced dead at the scene were some patrons and
restaurant staff. Dozens of others were severely injured.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said broken glass and splintered furniture were
scattered over the street outside. Some taxis standing-by also got
their windows smashed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the injured were passersby walking on the street, the
witnesses said. And police said over 20 of the most seriously
injured were rushed to five local hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police rushed to the scene immediately after receiving the call.
City officials have been at the scene to coordinate rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion is under investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has given over one million U.S. dollars to
researchers trying to develop a foolproof way to catch athletes
taking the banned drug EPO, it was announced in Lausanne on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
EPO increases the amount of oxygen in the blood, dramatically
boosting an athletes performance, but scientists have still to
find a way to test for it.
</P>
<P>
IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch revealed on Thursday
that one million dollars have been given to an Australian research
team and 250,000 dollars to another research team in South
California.
</P>
<P>
"A further 750,000 dollars has been set aside for other dope
testing research," said Schamasch, following a report presented to
the IOC executive board.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that despite the extra spending there was little
to no chance of a workable test being in place for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that the IOC carried out over 105,000 dope
tests in 1998, nearly half of them in out of competition testing.
Only 1,926 were positive.
</P>
<P>
The most tested were athletes with 14,954 followed by cyclists
with 10,458 tests and footballers 9,029.

<HEADLINE> SOCOG Scraps Ticket Plan to Calm Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Organizers decided Thursday to
cancel a controversial ticketing plan which has angered official
sponsors of the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Kevan Gosper, a vice president of the International Olympic
Committee(IOC) and member of the Sydney organizing committee, said
that the decision was made Thursday night in Sydney in a bid to
calm sponsors.
</P>
<P>
Gosper, in Lausanne for IOC meeetings, said SOCOG dropped plans
for 200,000 tickets to be set aside for asset sales and
hospitality packages at prices above face value.
</P>
<P>
The plan has received negative response as official sponsors of
the Games complained about the idea of non-sponsors getting
premium tickets and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
The decision came on the same day that the beleaguered
organiser suffered a second embarrassing blow when host
broadcaster and sponsor the Seven Network said it had suspended
Games advertising.
</P>
<P>
Seven is concerned its Olympics sponsorship has been undermined
by the sale of premium ticket packages which may have been bought
by its competitors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. sports good manufacturer Reebok on Wednesday had ended its
sponsorship of the Sydney Games, citing breaches of its
sponsorship contract.

<TEXT>
<P>
FOSHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of a criminal gang in
Foshan City of south China's Guangdong Province, which was
controlled by a larger and more notorious gang in neighboring
Macao, have been apprehended by local police.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 28 people who have been involved in more than
30 cases of blackmail, gambling, illegal use of guns and other
crimes. The gambling cases involved more than 50 million yuan (
about six million U.S. dollars) of illicit money.
</P>
<P>
Police also seized a number of guns and ammunition, including
eight military pistols.
</P>
<P>
The gang was established by Zeng Qiqiang in 1996, as a branch
of the "Shuifang Bang," a large criminal gang in Macao. The gang
in Foshan, with more than 100 members, used to help the "Shuifang
Bang" run its gambling operations and collect money from people by
force.
</P>
<P>
To date, the provincial public security department of Guangdong
and the local police in Foshan have completely uprooted the gang
which seriously threatened the security of Foshan and Macao.

<HEADLINE> New Jobless Claims Rise in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims for
jobless benefits jumped last week to the highest level in two
months in the United States, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that 293,000 people filed new claims
for unemployment benefits for the week ending December 4, up by
just 1,000 from the previous week. It was the highest level since
October 2 when claims were at 314,000.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out
week-to-week volatility, was also up slightly last week to 286,750.
That was the highest level since November 13, when claims were at
287,500. Jobless claims under 300,000 have been for nine straight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
That's good news for workers but it is worrisome to economists
and some members of the Federal Reserve. One of the Federal
Reserve's chief concerns is that the tight labor market could lead
to wage and price inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
Today's report said that for the week ending November 27, 18
states and territories reported increases in new jobless-claims
applications, while 35 reported decreases. The state data lag one
week behind the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest increase is Wisconsin, up 9,887,
while the state with the biggest decrease is California, down 22,
463, due to a shorter workweek because of the Thanksgiving Day
holiday.

<HEADLINE> Sydney to Practice Blood Tests for Triathlon, Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that competitors in cycling and
triathlon will recieve blood tests before they are eligible to
compete at next year's Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch said those competitors
who failed would be stopped from competing at the Games.
</P>
<P>
However, the tests, being introduced for the first time in the
Summer Games, are regarded as health rather than drug tests and
competitors will not face long bans if they fail them.
</P>
<P>
The blood testing, which are aimed to stop the use of banned
drugs such as EPO that boost red blood cells, have been used
before at Winter Games for distance events such as biathlon.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and the United States
signed an agreement on framework guarantee and an agreement on
project incentives here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Duong Thu Huong, deputy governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (
SBV), and Jackie Clegg, vice chairwoman of the U.S. Import and
Export Bank (Eximbank), signed the two agreements on behalf of
their respective banks, Vietnam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on framework guarantee specifies obligations of
guarantors and lenders, provisions on taxation, fees and
settlement while providing direct transactions between Eximbank
and guarantee agencies of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
It simplifies procedures of negotiations and signing and
reduces transaction time and costs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on project incentives facilitates Eximbank's
legal operations through provisions on non-interference, non-
taxation to avoid debt obligations and permission of opening
overseas accounts for debt payment.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the two agreements marked a new development in
the
finance and banking relations between Vietnam and the United
States, said SBV Deputy Governor Duong Thu Huong, adding that
these agreements would give Vietnamese businessmen more options.
</P>
<P>
Huong noted that the two agreements will also enable U.S.
companies to expand cooperation with Vietnam in finance, trade and
investment.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Russia Capable of Countering U.S. ABM System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia has the technologies to
develop new weapons capable of neutralizing the national missile
defense system planned by the U.S., Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia could in a few years show prototypes of new types of
deterrent weapons, to demonstrate among other things the
hopelessness of developing a national missile defense system in
the U.S. to neutralize Russia's strategic nuclear potential,"
Sergeyev said in an article in the Thursday edition of Krasnaya
Zvezda, an army newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the upheavals of the past decade, Russia still has
a margin of safety that permits it to count on equipping its armed
forces with new armaments and military hardware," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that in the next few years, "Russia will be unable
to maintain military strategic and technical parity with leading
Western military powers on an asymmetric basis, especially in non-
nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
In the face of limited funding, priority should be put on "the
limited production of strategic nuclear and non-nuclear weapons"
that allow Russia to neutralize existing defense threats and
preserve its capacity for the comprehensive development of weapons
systems and arms for service in the next few decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said he was alarmed by the growing military
technological gap between Russia and the leading powers in the
development of new weaponry and military hardware, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This leads to a qualitatively new stage of the arms race and
fundamental changes in the content, form and means of warfare,"
the minister said.

NEW DELHI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- India and Kenya agreed here
Thursday to enhance cooperation in political, economic, cultural
and technical fields.
</P>
<P>
In an agreement signed Thursday between visiting Kenyan Foreign
Minister Bonaya A. Godana and Indian External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh, the two sides decided to set up a joint inter-
governmental commission to enhance cooperation in various fields
which also included agriculture, information technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Godana, who arrived here Wednesday for a five-day visit, called
on Indian Prime Minister Atal bihari Vajpayee earlier Thursday and
expressed Nairobi's desire for greater interaction in new areas
like sugar and dairy industries, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Godana's visit, the first by a Kenyan foreign minister in the
last ten years, marks the resumption of substantive contacts at
political level between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On issues relating to the World Trade Organization (WTO), both
sides said they stood for a world order which was globally
accepted and not on the dictates of domestic priorities of any
individual country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Albright's Visit to Israel Achieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright flew to Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm
El-Sheikh to continue her current Middle East tour after winding
up her two-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
During her stay, Albright held separate talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and other senior officials of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Her visits to Israel and the Palestinian territories achieved
some positive results.
</P>
<P>
One of the major achievements for Albright is that she
persuaded Syria and Israel to agree to return to the negotiating
table next week to resume their stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down three and a half
years ago amid a wave of terrorist attacks against Israel. During
this period, diplomatic efforts were made to bring the two sides
back, but failed.
</P>
<P>
This time Albright did put some pressure on Israel to make some
concessions for resuming the talks and at last Barak accepted the
Syrian condition of restarting the talks from where they broke off
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are now ready to discuss a comprehensive peace
package focusing on the depth of an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, the character of peace and the security
arrangements between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright has promised to Arafat that the United states will
continue to try its best to help push the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks forward until the two sides reach a peace
treaty under the Sharm El-Sheikh peace deal.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the final-status talks proceed smoothly,
Albright did ask the two sides not to take unilateral actions,
such as Jewish settlement expansions, but to build mutual trust
and create an environment helpful for both sides to strike a
framework agreement on final-status by next February as stipulated
by the new peace deal.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Israel, Albright stressed that Israel's
security is in the interests of the U.S. and pledged to continue
military and economic aid to Israel to facilitate the Middle East
peace process.

JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government announced Thursday that it will refuse to re-negotiate
the trade deal it signed with the European Union (EU) a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a news conference in Pretoria, Trade and Industry

re-negotiate the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible for the EU to expect South Africa to
re-negotiate those issues already agreed upon, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, if there is something else to be
done in the wines and spirits agreement, which is still in the
negotiation process, South Africa would agree.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Reiterates Importance of Egyptian-Libyan Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail has reaffirmed the importance of an initiative
proposed by Egypt and Libya to help realize peace in his country,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libyan initiative is "the only proposal that
provides a framework for a comprehensive solution to the conflicts
in Sudan," Ismail told MENA Wednesday night during a stopover at
Cairo airport after attending a foreign ministers' meeting of
France and African countries in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt and Libya "are playing a pivotal role in" helping
solve the problems in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Ismail's remarks were believed to placate the two Arab
neighbors following a controversial agreement signed last month
between Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir and Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi,
leader of the opposition Ummah Party.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya put forward a five-point peace plan earlier
this year, calling for permanent cease-fire between the Sudanese
government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and
a conference aimed at seeking national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties have
accepted the proposal. But SPLA has expressed reservations over
the plan, saying it favors the peace initiative proposed by the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) of Eastern
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Al-Bashir-Al-Mahdi agreement, Ismail said the
accord is not an alternative to the existing initiatives but
rather a step to intensify the efforts in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ten-point agreement outlined solutions to the conflicts in
southern Sudan and called for establishment of a democratic
multi-party system and confidence building in a four-year interim
period.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, however, expressed opposition to the agreement, saying
that it went away from the consensus reached among the concerned
parties on promoting the Sudanese peace process and that it may
lead to Sudan's disintegration.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA, which forms an alliance with the Muslim political
parties, has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy in the
south. The Muslim parties want to share power with Al-Bashir's
Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has deeply involved in the Sudanese conflicts and
expressed keenness in helping guarantee Sudan's territorial
integrity, in fear that a possible separation of southern Sudan
will endanger the Nile, its main water source.

<HEADLINE> EU Has No Power over UEFA Club Ownership Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission stated
on Thursday that it falls outside its jurisdiction that UEFA
limits ownership of more than one club by the same company.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission's preliminary view is that the rule in question,
which does not allow more than one club belonging to the same
owner to take part in the same competition, could fall outside the
(EU) treaty's competition rules," the Commission said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, however, added that it would study whether less
restrictive means could be found to ensure the integrity of
competitions before making the final decision.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary ruling came when more and more media magnates
have sought stakes in leading European clubs.
</P>
<P>
English National Investment Company has large stakes in four
European soccer clubs. French TV company Canal Plus owns Paris St
Germain and has a major stake in Swiss club Servette, while sports
marketing firm International Management Group has a controlling
interest in Strasbourg and is thought to be looking at other clubs.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Underlines Promotion of Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday stressed the importance of
promoting Iran's relations with Islamabad by fighting against
"sectarian sedition" in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Pakistani Chief Executive Pervez
Musharaf, Khamenei said that consolidated historical and cultural
bonds between the two Muslim neighbors are important factors in
promotion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the sectarian sedition which broke out in
recent years in Pakistan was an impediment hampering progress of
bilateral relations, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen of Iranian nationals were assassinated in
Pakistan during the past few years, casting a shadow over
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Musharaf voiced Pakistan's readiness to exert efforts for the
removal of the existing obstacles blocking the way to expansion of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He called for consolidation of historical, cultural, political
and social interests between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Accusing certain people in Pakistan of attempting to "preserve
their interests through terrorist activities," he said serious
efforts will be made to curtail influence of those people and
create an atmosphere for peaceful coexistence of all religious
sects within Pakistan. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani military ruler, who came here on Wednesday
evening for his first official visit, expressed regret over the
killings of Iranians in Pakistan and assured that he will spare
no effort for carrying out the rulings against the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the Iranian leader of his efforts for the
improvement of relations between the two countries, especially
cooperation in the settlement of Afghanistan issue and regional
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> S. Somalia Sets Up Autonomous Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- An autonomous administration
for the regions of Bay and Bakol of southern Somalia has been
established, the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to RRA secretariat Nur Aden Nur, the announcement of
this administration is the fruits of almost six months long
successive and exhausting meetings by the various Rahanwein
communities in Baidoa town, the headquarters of the local
government.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Mohamed Nur Shargudud, Chairman of the RRA, presided
over the meetings attended by more than 320 traditional
chieftains, Muslim scholars, intellectuals and politicians.
</P>
<P>
In the new administration, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, former
spokesman for the RRA, has been nominated as the regional governor
of Bay while Aden Hassan Malaq made his deputy.
</P>
<P>
Ali Robleh Mohamed has been chosen to the post of district
commissioner for Baidoa town, while Mahad Abdurahman Ahmed
nominated as the head of police division in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretariat, these appointments were made
through clan and priority based consensus. The priorities were
given to those who had been fighting for what they called the
liberation of the region from the grip of Hussein Mohamed Aidid's
militiamen who controlled the region for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
The present administration is a temporary one, having a mandate
for six months beginning from Thursday, Nur said.
</P>
<P>
This period can be extended, renewed or can be totally changed
according to the secretariat of the meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Qalinleh, the new governor of Bay region, his
administration will give a high priority to the restoration and
rehabilitation of the public services including the water,
electricity and hospitals of the town.
</P>
<P>
Huge effort would also be directed towards the resettlement of
the war displaced Rahanwein communities in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second autonomous administration the Rahanwein
people have ever erected since the downfall of the late military
regime in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The first administration was established in 1994 with the
presence of the multinational forces of UNOSOM (U.N. Operation in
Somalia). But that administration was dispersed by late General
Mohamed Farah Aidid on September 17, 1995, who attacked and
conquered the town.
</P>
<P>
Baidoa town has fallen for the RRA in early June this year with
the help of huge Ethiopian forces who kicked Hussein Aidid's men
out of the town inflicting them heavy losses.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel's Resuming Talks May Make 2000 Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Thursday that the planned resumption of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks will make 2000 a year of peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright wrapped up a four-day Mideast tour with a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el
Sheikh to brief him on the breakthrough on the Syrian-Israeli
track and the latest problems in the talks for a final peace
agreement between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Before Egypt, she has visited Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East is "at a historic crossroad" and "I believe
that we can seize the moment and help make the year 2000 a year of
peace" in the region, Albright told a news conference held with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in Washington on
Wednesday that Syria and Israel have agreed to resume their peace
talks in the U.S. capital next week after a gap of nearly four
year due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Moussa stressed that the new Syrian-Israeli talks
did not mean the Palestinian-Israeli track would slow down and
that there was no competition between the two tracks.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she and Mubarak agreed that the multilateral
talks should resume as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral talks, which cover issues including water,
disarmament, environment and Arab-Israeli economic cooperation,
began in 1992 but stalled since 1996 when hardline former Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has said the Arabs would not resume those talks with
Israel until the Jewish state restarts negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon. With the movement on the Syrian-Israeli track, Egypt has
apparently dropped its objection.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Owns Most of Canadian Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada, the country's top
carrier, has owned most of arch-rival Canadian Airlines
International, moving closer to a final merger of Canada's two
biggest airlines.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada declared the winning of more than 50 percent of the
shares in Canadian Wednesday, with Canadian's shareholders turning
over their stock to Air Canada for 2 Canadian dollars (about 1.35
U.S. dollars a share).
</P>
<P>
Texas-based AMP Corp., the parent company of American Airlines,
has also agreed to give up its one-third control of Canadian in
return for about 140 million Canadian dollars (about 95 million U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Air Canada's takeover bid of 92 million Canadian dollars (about
62 million U.S. dollars) is yet to win a federal government
approval in early February.
</P>
<P>
The hard won control will make Air Canada the 10th largest
airline in the world, with 37,000 employees and 238 jetliners. It
will own 80 percent of domestic aviation plus lucrative routes to
the United States, Europe and Asia.

Habibi made the offer at a meeting with visiting Ethiopian
Minister of Mines and Energy Izedin Ali. He expressed hope that
the disputes between the two countries would be resolved through
peaceful means.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expels Russian Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Associated Press report said that the mid- or low-ranking
diplomat was detained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a State Department official as saying that
the Russian diplomat has claimed diplomatic immunity from
prosecution and was released to Russian custody.
</P>
<P>
A State Department statement distributed to reporters in Egypt,
where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is visiting,
identified the diplomat as Stanislav Borisovich Gusev, a second
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering
summoned Russian ambassador in Washington to his office Wednesday
to protest the eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred one week after Moscow decided to expel a
female U.S. diplomat in Russia on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
Pickering informed the Russian Embassy Wednesday that the
United States wanted the diplomat to leave by the end of the week,
a U.S. official was quoted by AP as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the FBI
and the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service had been
watching the diplomat for some time.
</P>
<P>
The listening device was found in what more than one official
described as a "sensitive area" of the State Department, but
officials would not specify when or where. The diplomat was trying
to use the listening device when he was apprehended, one official
said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the U.S. and Russia have been strained
recently because of their disputes on Kosovo and Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Russia Regrets U.S. Action Against Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The detention of a staff member
of the Russian Embassy in the United States is "regrettable" if
this is a response to the detention of U.S. diplomat Cheri
Leberknight in Moscow, Russian Foreign Intelligence Service
Spokesman Boris Labusov said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Labusov described as "improbable" the U.S. charges that the
Russian diplomat attempted to plant a listening device in the U.S.
State Department building, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Washington Wednesday declared Russian Embassy's second
secretary Stanislav Gusev persona non grata and ordered him to
leave within 10 days, saying he had been caught monitoring a
listening device found in a State Department conference room.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Intelligence Department refused to comment
on whether this or that individual was involved in intelligence-
gathering activity, Labusov said.
</P>
<P>
However, a high-ranking source close to Russia's special
services expressed serious doubt about the fairness of the charges
brought against Gusev, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"How can a representative of a foreign embassy enter a guarded
room and plant any equipment there?" the source said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moscow gave Leberknight, a second secretary in the
U.S. Embassy, 10 days to leave after Russian counter-intelligence
said it had caught her red-handed equipping with spy gadgets such
as invisible ink and an electric device preventing eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes the latest U.S. action was a response to the
Leberknight incident.
</P>
<P>
"An unbiased analysis of the situation shows that this is a
response of the American side to the detention of U.S. embassy
official Cheri Leberknight in Moscow during a spying operation,"
Interfax quoted a spokesman for one of Russia's security services
as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russia has not declared Leberknight persona non grata, which
means she could still enter Russia in the future. The 33-year-old
U.S. diplomat will leave Russia on Thursday or Friday, Russian
media reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moscow has indicated it will not play tit for tat
to the U.S. action, Interfax reported, citing a high-ranking
source in the Russian special services.
</P>
<P>
"The eye-for-eye principle is not ours. It is a thing of the
past Cold War," the official said, adding that Russia detains or
expels foreign citizens only if there is weighty evidence of
illegal activity.

There had been reports alleging that Zimbabwe had agreed to

The troops would withdraw in exchange for the opening of supply
routes to several thousand Zimbabwean, Namibian and Congolese
soldiers trapped behind rebel lines at Ikela, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> French Intransigence on Banning British Beef Risks Negative Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The beef war between the French
and British governments intensified as the former decided
Wednesday to keep its embargo on British beef despite the risk of
harming bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In a late-night statement on Wednesday, the French government
said that it would maintain the embargo in order to protect the
health of French consumers. It said British beef still presents
the risk of spreading bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
commonly named mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The British government reacted by announcing that it is ready
to bring France to the European Court of Justice for violating a
European Union decision that called for lifting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Thursday that he was
not worried about the reactions from Britain.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible today for the government to lift the
embargo," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the country's Food Health Safety Agency (AFSSA) as
saying that "non-negligible risks" still exist when eating British
beef.
</P>
<P>
However, other French government ministers did not hide their
worry about the outbreak of a crisis with Britain.
</P>
<P>
"There is not the slightest intention on the part of France to
have a crisis with Great Britain," said French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
"We should explain to them (the British), theirs is a friendly
government, a very good government, with whom we have cooperated
on a series of issues," said the Minister of European Affairs
Pierre Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that maintaining the embargo could have a
negative impact on the cooperation between the two countries in
building a European defense, which is yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain presented a plan last month in London on
establishing a European force of about 50,000 men within the EU
for solving future crises.
</P>
<P>
The intransigence of the French government came as a surprise
as the EU countries will discuss the British-French-drafted plan,
which has already been approved by Germany and Italy, in the
forthcoming Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
France has been maneuvering for years to have other European
countries accept his initiative on European defense autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with Albright on Mideast Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met on Thursday with United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Sharm El-Sheikh to discuss the latest developments of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Egypt's Red Sea resort in southern Sinai
within a regional tour, which has taken her to Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
She will brief Mubarak on the outcome of her talks on resuming
the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations and the final-status talks
between the Palestinians and Israel, stalled due to Israel's
continued settlement activity on the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Albright said after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Wednesday that progress has been made in restarting the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations, suspended in early 1996 due to
disputes over the fate of the Golan Heights that Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak has announced that his government will refrain
from approving new settlement projects in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in a bid to create a good atmosphere for talks with the
Palestinians for a final peace agreement on the toughest issues
including the settlements, Jerusalem, final borders and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
Mubarak-Albright meeting will also deal with the Sudanese issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. opposes an Egyptian-Libyan initiative aimed at helping
end the 16-year-old civil war in Africa's largest country and
realize national reconciliation there.

<HEADLINE> Levy: Israel not to Return Whole Golan to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said here Thursday that Israel will not return the
whole Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Levy said Israel never
agreed to accept preconditions for conducting peace talks with
Syria and never agreed to pull back to the June 4, 1967 lines
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The June 4 lines were the border lines between Israel and
Syria separating the two countries before the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
Levy's remarks were apparently made to counter the opposition
from certain political parties and Israeli residents in the Golan
Heights to the government's decision to resume peace talks with the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party Thursday criticized the government
led by Ehud Barak for caving into the pressures from the United
States and Syria to resume peace talks with Syria while Israeli
residents in Golan Heights accused the government of selling them
out by promising to return all the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Likud chairman Ariel Sharon said the party is to hold a meeting
Thursday afternoon to discuss what action the party will take to
"protect the Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in Washington Wednesday
that Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa will meet
in Washington next week to discuss issues relating to the
resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement, Barak phoned Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to offer his
greetings on the start of the holy month of Ramadan and updated
them with the development.
</P>
<P>
Barak also contacted with Jordanian King Abdullah Ben Hussein
on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Within Barak's coalition, the majority parties welcome the
resumption of peace talks with Syria, except the National
Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
The Shas, which has 17 members in the Knesset (parliament),
said the resumption of peace talks with Syria is a good news.
</P>
<P>
"Shas supports the Middle East peace process and also supports
the resumption of peace talks with the Syrians," the religious
party said.

<HEADLINE> Working Hard for Macao Handover Ceremony (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- "After completing work on the
building for the Macao handover ceremony, we all need a good sleep,
" said Li Weiquan, deputy general-manager of the China Machinery
Industry Installing Corporation (CMIIC).
</P>
<P>
The building, covering an area of 6,000 square meters and with
a height of 20 meters, is located near the Macao Cultural Center
not far away from the Hong Kong-Macao Ferry Terminal.
</P>
<P>
The structure of the building is made of steel and built by the
Beijing-based CMIIC and Jiangmen Machinery Plant in south China's
Guangdong Province. Designed by a Portuguese architect, the
building would have taken at least five months to complete.
</P>
<P>
"But we got only two and a half months to complete the building.
No delay was allowed," Li recalled.
</P>
<P>
The building's structure, weighing 2,100 tons, is composed of
11,3000 pieces which were welded without employing even a single
screw. And the whole work was done under the inspection of
Portuguese construction supervisors.
</P>
<P>
From July 26 to October 8, more than 120 CMIIC workers,
including 23 women welders, worked at the construction site round
the clock, he said.

"The sunshine in Macao is too strong for mainlanders," Li said,
"and only days after the women welders worked on the site, their
delicate skins were tanned by the sun."
</P>
<P>
One day, some of the women welders went shopping only to be
rounded up and taken to the police station on suspicion of being
illegal immigrants. The women tried to explain their identities,
but to no avail, for the police did not believe there are women
welders in the world.
</P>
<P>
Only when CMIIC officials reached the station and proved their
identities were they released. After that, the police showed due
respect to the women.
</P>
<P>
The 75 days of sweat and tears brought Li and his colleagues
the joy of success. On October 8, construction of the structure
was concluded two days ahead of schedule, and passed a quality
check on November 17. And they were praised by China's Foreign
Ministry, the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, and the chief
contractor of the project.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the structure got an unexpected test on
September 17 when an especially powerful typhoon hit Macao. Many
buildings on the island were heavily damaged and a number of big
trees uprooted, but the structure remained intact.

BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 people and 20
units were awarded today by the Ministry of Science and Technology,
the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC)
and the All-China Journalists Association for their outstanding
work in poverty relief through science and technology.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Military Logistics Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese military forces
must step up reforms in the field of logistics, a top military
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said that more concrete efforts are needed to push forward the
reforms designed to commercialize and redistribute the logistics
responsibilities of the country's military forces by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national working conference on military logistics
reform, Zhang noted that it is imperative for the military to
commercialize its logistics in this period of its modernization,
so that the armed forces can concentrate the limited human,
material and financial resources on military affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the country's social and economic developments
over the past two decades have also made it possible for the
military to commercialize its logistics, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of military logistics will be a huge and complicated
task. All related departments should cooperate more closely and
ensure the success of the reforms, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ke, a member of the Central Military Commission and head
of the General Department of Logistics of the People's Liberation
Army, chaired the conference.

<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday welcomed the news
that U.S. President Bill Clinton will host the resumed peace talks
between Israel and Syria in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in a press
statement that he was happy about the announcement and that he
appreciated the U.S. efforts in arranging the Israel-Syria peace
talks, which have been suspended for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also expressed his hope that the talks will soon result
in a "fair and lasting" peace agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is possible. It will bring about similar progress
on the Lebanese track," he said, referring to a possible
resumption of peace talks between Israel and Lebanon at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
"France remains available to contribute to the conclusion and
implementation of the agreements expected for the completion of
peace process," the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
He then recalled that France has made great efforts in
persuading Israel and Syria to resume peace talks in the past
several weeks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Uganda, Sudan Ink Pact to Seek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and the Sudan have
signed a peace agreement to end years of hostilities, opening a
new chapter in bilateral relations between the two east African
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudanese
counterpart Omar al-Bashir agreed to take steps to resume full
diplomatic relations at the end of February next year after their
one-day talks in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the 11-point document signed by the two leaders, they
pledged to renounce the use of force to resolve differences, and
refrain from backing rebel groups from each other's territories.
</P>
<P>
The two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1995, accusing
each other of backing rebel groups of the respective countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for such foes to reach the peace accord is
that peace and stability is a pre-requisite for development and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, who have witnessed the untold sufferings of
their people in the abyss of war and insecurity, could no longer
turn a deaf ear to the loud outcry for peace, for they recognized
that peace is the only way out for the two countries following
long years of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, cease of hostilities will alleviate the burden of war
on their small and fragile economies.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which has been
fighting for autonomy since 1983, has controlled half of the
biggest African country.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum government fought 16 years of war with the SPLA,
making its economy stagnant and the country one of the poorest in
the world. The civil war and famines have claimed 1.5 million
lives in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's military involvement in the 16-month civil war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) costs the country nearly
one million U.S. dollars each passing day, provoking harsh
criticism from home and the Western donors, who threatened to
suspend their aid to Uganda if it fails to control the defense
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, peace is conducive to economic cooperation and
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Northern Uganda and southern Sudan are economically
complementary.
</P>
<P>
Southern Sudan is rich in oil and minerals like copper, gold,
iron and also a huge market for products of land-locked Uganda. It
badly needs foreign investment to fully develop these resources.
</P>
<P>
Northern Uganda could have oil from the Sudan's Benti oil field
directly.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, northern Uganda and southern Sudan are socially and
culturally linked.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's six tribes are said to be divided by the Uganda-Sudan
border. The restoration of peace in the region would boost their
cultural exchanges and promote social activities, which in turn
would further contribute to peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement, witnessed by former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, was
expected to promote the Sudan's long running peace process and
encourage peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although border monitoring mechanisms contained in previous
agreements between Khartoum and Kampala remained only on paper, it
is hopeful that the handshakes between the two leaders in Nairobi
can be binding.

<HEADLINE> China to Kick Off Antidumping Investigation over Japanese, U.S., German Acrylate Esters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade authorities will
take action against alleged dumping cases concerning acrylate
esters from Japan, the United States and Germany, according to
sources of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the ministry will issue a bulletin Friday,
which states that MOFTEC and the General Administration of Customs
will immediately kick off antidumping investigation over these
cases according to China's Antidumping and Countervailing
Regulation.
</P>
<P>
The harmonized system code of acrylate esters is 29161200,
including methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and 2-
ethylhexyl acrylate.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC)
and other relevant departments of the State Council will start to
assess the extent of the damage to China's domestic industry by
the importing of acrylate esters from the three countries, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Those parties concerned can respond to the action and get
information on how to contest it from MOFTEC and SETC within 30
days, the sources said.

<P>
"The government is set to enforce a unilateral decision to call
off offensive operations by its troops against the NPA from
December 10 to January 9, 2000 in observance of the Christmas
season," Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican told a press
conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Barican said
the government sealed a cease-fire agreement with the group in
1997 so both sides can conduct peace negotiations and that pact
stands up to now.
</P>
<P>
"The government entered into a ceasefire agreement with the
MILF in 1997 for the purpose of cessation of fighting between MILF
elements and government troopers while the peace talks are ongoing,
" Barican said.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is still in effect to this date," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Joseph Estrada reminded the government
troops in Mindanao to respect the traditional period of Ramadan
observed by members of the MILF, but stressed that violations of
an existing ceasefire with the rebel group should not be tolerated.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Nepalese Military Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao today called for enhancing the friendly cooperation between
China and Nepal and the two armed forces in line with the
consensus of top leaders of both countries, in order to build a
good-neighborly partnership geared toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to work with Nepal to fulfill the goal, said
Hu, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, in a
meeting here with Nepal's army chief Prajwal Shumshere Jung
Bahadur Rana.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Sino-Nepalese relations have proceeded smoothly on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence since the
establishment of diplomatic ties over 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government appreciates Nepal's valued support of
China on the issues of Tibet, Taiwan, and human rights, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
China believes that all countries are equal members of the
international community regardless of their size, wealth, or
strength, and they have the liberty to decide their own internal
affairs, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Rana stressed that Nepal will never allow the use of Nepalese
territory for activities intended to split China, and Nepal will
devote itself to promoting friendship between the two countries
and the two armies. He also said that Nepal will adhere to the "
one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army, also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Uganda, Sudan Ink Pact to Seek Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and the Sudan have
signed a peace agreement to end years of hostilities, opening a
new chapter in bilateral relations between the two east African
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudanese
counterpart Omar al-Bashir agreed to take steps to resume full
diplomatic relations at the end of February next year after their
one-day talks in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the 11-point document signed by the two leaders, they
pledged to renounce the use of force to resolve differences, and
refrain from backing rebel groups from each other's territories.
</P>
<P>
The two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1995, accusing
each other of backing rebel groups of the respective countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for such foes to reach the peace accord is
that peace and stability is a pre-requisite for development and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, who have witnessed the untold sufferings of
their people in the abyss of war and insecurity, could no longer
turn a deaf ear to the loud outcry for peace, for they recognized
that peace is the only way out for the two countries following
long years of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, cease of hostilities will alleviate the burden of war
on their small and fragile economies.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which has been
fighting for autonomy since 1983, has controlled half of the
biggest African country.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum government fought 16 years of war with the SPLA,
making its economy stagnant and the country one of the poorest in
the world. The civil war and famines have claimed 1.5 million
lives in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's military involvement in the 16-month civil war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) costs the country nearly
one million U.S. dollars each passing day, provoking harsh
criticism from home and the Western donors, who threatened to
suspend their aid to Uganda if it fails to control the defense
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, peace is conducive to economic cooperation and
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Northern Uganda and southern Sudan are economically
complementary.
</P>
<P>
Southern Sudan is rich in oil and minerals like copper, gold,
iron and also a huge market for products of land-locked Uganda. It
badly needs foreign investment to fully develop these resources.
</P>
<P>
Northern Uganda could have oil from the Sudan's Benti oil field
directly.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, northern Uganda and southern Sudan are socially and
culturally linked.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's six tribes are said to be divided by the Uganda-Sudan
border. The restoration of peace in the region would boost their
cultural exchanges and promote social activities, which in turn
would further contribute to peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement, witnessed by former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, was
expected to promote the Sudan's long running peace process and
encourage peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although border monitoring mechanisms contained in previous
agreements between Khartoum and Kampala remained only on paper, it
is hopeful that the handshakes between the two leaders in Nairobi
can be binding.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets 10 Percent GDP Growth for 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved a four-year economic blueprint aimed at reviving the
nation's economic growth and set a 10 percent GDP growth rate at
10 percent for the year of 2003 from the current 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint was endorsed by the Federal Executive Council at
its weekly meeting on Wednesday in capital Abuja chaired by
President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Dapo Sarumi told reporters in Abuja that
the government plans to increase the nation's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rate from current 2.4 percent to 10 percent
by the year of 2003.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government hopes to bring down inflation from
the 1999 level of 13 percent to a single digit in the next four
years, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that both targets are part of the government
 comprehensive plan to revive the economy and "to significantly
raise the standards of living of Nigerians and put people back to
work".
</P>
<P>
Under the blueprint, he noted, the economy should be
market-orientated and private sector-led as well as being
competitive internally and globally.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the government would give
priority to agriculture, manufacturing, small and medium scale
enterprises and the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
Sarumi said that the government would ensure market
stabilization through a responsive but predictable exchange rate,
reduce interest rate to a single digit within the shortest
possible time and cut tax burden to a maximum of 30 percent on
both corporate and personal incomes.

<HEADLINE> Angola Advised to Lay off Boeing 747 at Turn of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Air Transporter
(TAAG) has been advised to put up its Boeing 747 planes at the
turn of the year to avoid possible accidents caused by information
chaos, an official source said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the producer of the planes who made this recommendation,
said Angola's Vice Minister of Science and Technology Pedro Teta,
who is responsible for eliminating the "millennium bug" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But the final decision is up to the management of the civil
aviation company, he said.
</P>
<P>
The information chaos problem Y2K, known as the "millennium
bug" in computers, has thrown shadow over the Angolan civil
aviation sector which has to spend a lot money in dealing with the
fatal problem and avoiding disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
Teta further suggested that the banks in the country should
also close from December 27, 1999 to January 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan government, the country has yet to
spend 20 million U.S. dollars in curbing the "bug", which will
probably threaten the country's telecommunication, civil aviation,
financial sector and banks.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Respecting Sovereignty in Fighting Financial Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The fight against financial
crimes needs international cooperation but state sovereignty
should be strictly respected at the same time, a Chinese official
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Financial crimes are crossing state and regional borders every
day. So the combat against financial crimes has become a subject
of international concern," said Zhao Yongji, Chinese Vice Minister
of Public Security, at an international conference on fighting by
judicial, banking and financial institutions against financial
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese judicial organs have made relentless efforts in
enhancing bilateral and multilateral cooperation with their
foreign counterparts and international organizations especially in
exchanging information and expertise, said the head of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as there are differences in economic development
and difficulties encountered by developing countries in financial
supervision, international cooperation should be based on strict
respect for state sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Neither intervention should be allowed in the judicial,
financial and domestic affairs of these countries, nor the
disturbance should be allowed to their normal banking behaviors,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is jointly organized by the Crans Montana Forum
and the Monaco World Summit under the auspices of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE), the Council of
Europe, and the Supreme Court of France, with the cooperation of
the Center for Democracy and of the International Law Institute in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that China is willing to enhance collaboration with
law enforcement agencies of various countries in criminal
investigation, retrieving illegal proceeds, delivering criminal
suspects and exchanging criminal information.
</P>
<P>
"We are also ready to learn the successful experience from our
colleagues of other countries and join hands with them in the
crackdown upon financial crimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, plenary sessions will focus on what
governments can do to deal with financial crimes and what
international institutions such as the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Council of Europe can
contribute to the fight against financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
The methods and proceedings of organized criminal groups, such
as money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption will be discussed,
and the situations in specific regions, including Africa, China
and Central and Eastern Europe, are to be introduced to the
session.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention will be paid to Russia, which is
undergoing the process of privatization and need transparency in
the process, according to a conference news release.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Filipinos to Meet New Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada urged Filipinos Thursday to join hands with the government
in promoting economic growth in order to meet the challenges of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to mark the Urban Poor Solidarity Week here,
Estrada renewed his pledge to transform the economy into an
effective tool that will help bridge the gap between the rich and
the poor.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration hopes to achieve this goal by
implementing programs aimed at ensuring food security through
agricultural and fisheries modernization; providing the masses
with affordable, decent shelter; and enhancing their access to
quality education and primary health care.
</P>
<P>
"One of my administration's priority programs is to strengthen
the economy, which will represent a society where all Filipinos
are equal. Our government continues to implement programs that aim
to provide long-term solutions to poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from putting these programs in place, Estrada said, the
Philippines should also be able to attract foreign capital and
technology needed to invigorate the economy, set up new factories
and create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said that China now enjoys a food surplus despite having to
feed over one billion people because it decided to open its doors
to foreign capital and new technologies.
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast, he said, the Philippines continues to
scrounge for funds to implement its anti-poverty programs and to
export its labor force instead of selling world-class products
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back at the previous century and facing the future in
the new millennium should bring us new hope so that we can work
together in confronting the challenges of globalization," he said.

"There is no point in saying we must grow tourism as an industry
and have more tourists coming here if we as South Africans ... do

<HEADLINE> Life Science Industry Grows Rapidly in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
has said that the Life Science industry has been seeing robust
growth over these years and has become a major contributor to the
growth in Singapore's manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
"The life science industry is poised for rapid growth and we
expected this cluster to become a significant contributor to the
growth in Singapore's manufacturing sector, contributing its
double-digit growth over the next few years," Philip Yeo, chairman
of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), told a half-day
inaugural Life Science investment seminar here Thursday which was
attended by some 130 professionals and managers as well as CEOs
from Life Science companies and the venture capital and investment
community.
</P>
<P>
According to data given by EDB to the seminar, Life Science
cluster comprises the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical
devices, health and nutrition sectors and in 1998 Singapore has 37
establishments in pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device
sectors which employed more than 5,300 people and contributed 3.8
billion Singapore dollars (about 2.26 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
EDB also said that Singapore has established a solid R&AMP;D
infrastructure for the Life Sciences in the past 10 years and the
Life Science sector recorded growth of 19 percent in 1998 and
contributed 12 percent of the manufacturing value-added or three
percent of the GDP of the city state.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the life science activities are of high value-add,
EDB drew attention to the fact that the manufacturing output of
life science industry expanded by 60 percent in the first months
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Yeo reaffirmed his country's commitment to developing the
country into a world-wide Life Science hub and the government's
strategy to provide quality capabilities and excellent
infrastructure to support companies to undertake the whole value
chain of knowledge-intensive activities.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to realize this goal, Singapore has embarked on three
key thrusts. These are to encourage companies to move into higher
value-added manufacturing, to promote companies to undertake more
R&AMP;D activities and to commercialize local technologies and build
local vehicles as value-adding partners for collaboration.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar is part of EDB's efforts to develop and grow
the Life Science industry in Singapore and to marry the great work
done in the laboratories with their commercial potential in the
world market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC),
warmly welcomed visiting Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the trip of Yeltsin, who came to China for an
informal meeting with President Jiang Zemin, falls at this special
trans-centennial moment, signifying that the strategic partnership
of cooperation between China and Russia will step smoothly into
the next century and the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
China advocates multi-polarism of the world, as a uni-polar
world is dangerous, Li said, adding that the world's multi-
polarization will contribute to world peace.
</P>
<P>
Russia, with rich resources, a profound scientific and
technological foundation, and talented people of all kinds, has
the potential to become an important pillar of the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that there are no problems standing between the
two countries -- only friendship and cooperation. China highly
appreciates the friendly policy towards China consistently pursued
by President Yeltsin and the Russian government, and is happy
about the considerable progress made in cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that cooperation in the political,
diplomatic, economic and trade sectors would be increased on the
existing basis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he is pleased with every advancement of bilateral
relations. Cooperation between Russia and China is characterized
by pragmatism, mutual-benefit and peace, he said, stressing that
nothing can damage such a friendship.
</P>
<P>
He echoed Li by noting that Russia also supports the world's
multi-polarism regardless of pressure of any kind.

MACAO, December 9 (Xinhua) - A tourist guide from the Republic

Macao International Airport as he is lucky enough to be the
airport's 8 millionth passenger.
</P>
<P>
To mark the event, airport managers presented as gifts to the

duty-free coupons and free sight-seeing in Macao.
</P>

The airport, at a cost of 9 billion Macao dollars (1.125
billion U.S. dollars), opened to traffic on December 8, 1995, and

</P>
<P>
As of 2000, the airport will be able to receive 2.5 million

MOGADISHU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A World Food Program (WFP)
official kidnapped in South Mogadishu Wednesday by unidentified
gunmen was released unhurt Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Iddiris Mohamed Osman, the official in charge of the WFP office
in Mogadishu, looked pale but fine as he was taken back to his
house in Waberi district.
</P>
<P>
According to Osman's relatives, he was treated well during his
 captivity in Bermuda area, the most troubled part of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
There is no word as yet from the WFP office here in Mogadishu
over the abduction of the official. However, relatives close to
Iddiris said no ransom had been paid to secure the safe release of
the aid worker.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Weheliye Afrah, one of the local elders in Bermuda area,
said the aid worker has been released on humanitarian ground.
</P>
<P>
The people in the area, together with the relatives of Iddiris,
have managed to persuade the gunmen to release him
unconditionally, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Afrah, his people do not want to create a bad
impression on the world community.
</P>
<P>
"Bermuda has generally been isolated, but we don't want to
extend this isolation any further," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Wanda held the newly-
crowned league champions Shandong Luneng to a 1-1 tie at home
court on Thursday in the first leg of the Chinese Football
Association Cup final.
</P>
<P>
It was also a draw between two Yugoslavians: Slobodan Santrac,
who has just earned the Coach of the Year award for guiding Luneng
historically to the league title, and Kosanovic Milorad, who
signed a three-year contract with Wanda on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milorad, who failed to salvage the Wuhan Heart K from being
relegated in the just-concluded season, was upbeat on revitalizing
the reeling Wanda, the former four-time league champions who
luckily escaped from being demoted this season.
</P>
<P>
"It is a big difference between Wanda and Heart K. Wanda has
many talented players and I am confident to make Wanda permanent
front-runners," said the Yugoslavian after the match.
</P>
<P>
Wanda underlined the new coach's words as they showed character
and commitment on the court to fight from behind to force the tie.
</P>
<P>
Luneng came out aggressively from the outset and converted
their dominance on 42 minutes when forward Su Maozhen deflected
home a rebound after his two efforts were both blunted by the
goalie.
</P>
<P>
Under the inspiration of local crowds, the home side fought a
spirited battle and pulled one back through substitue Wang Tao in
the 74th minute.

</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, China's central bank, started to

"the People's Republic of China" in Chinese, the issuing year, the
Tian An Men with brilliant rays surrounded and peonies.
</P>
<P>
The 5 ounce gold coin and 5 ounce silver coin are the same in

<HEADLINE> 9th Session of Final Status Talks Convenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The ninth session of the
final-status negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel
began Thursday morning in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Ramallah said the session will only center
on the issue of Jewish settlement, as demanded by the Palestinian
side.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation was led by Yasser Abed Rabbo and the
Israeli delegation led by Oded Eran
</P>
<P>
Eran is due to expound the decision made by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak two days ago to stop issuing new tenders for
settlement constructions.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeine, advisor of Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat, told the Voice of Palestine radio Thursday that the
Palestinian stance is firm and clear, asserting that the Israeli
side ought to adhere to and implement the transition agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the radio said Arafat has received two phone calls,
one from Barak and the other from United States President Bill
Clinton with whom he exchanged views on the peace process
developments in the light of the announced resumption of
Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asserted in his meeting Wednesday evening with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that all efforts will be
made to overcome the differences over Israel's withdrawal from 5
percent of the West Bank and to pursue the final-status talks
which hit a snag due to continued settlement activity.

CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
achieved an operating surplus of 3.556 billion U.S. dollars in the
1998 financial year, which ended last June 30, Finance Minister
John Fahey announced Thursday.
</P>

This is the second successive year that the Australian
government had enjoyed an operating surplus. There was an
operating surplus of 2.6035 billion U.S. dollars in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Fahey was quoted by AAP as saying, "This reflects a continued
strengthening in the underlying position brought about by the
government's medium-term fiscal strategy, management reforms and
sound performance in major sectoral areas."
</P>
<P>
Budget surplus is seen as one of the keys to the economy by the
Australian government.
</P>
<P>
The government has lowered the budget surplus for the next two
years as a result of the East Timor commitment. It has been
forecast that there would be a surplus of 2.159 billion U.S.
dollars for 1999/2000 and 317.5 million for 2000/2001.

Fahey said the whole government debt had been lowered by 6.096
billion or 8.3 percent to 67.37 billion U.S. dollars while general

PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- France will ask the European
Union (EU) summit to be held in Helsinki Friday to focus on the
crisis in Chechnya, said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
``We will propose that the agenda be changed and that we begin
with this subject from Friday morning,'' said Vedrine on Radio
Europe 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that France "is absolutely determined to make Russia
return to a political solution" to the crisis in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
``In Caucasus, a military solution will not work,'' Vedrine
asserted.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France and its EU partners would not ``throw
to the ground all the policy that we began toward Russia 10 years
ago, which is to accompany this nation in the construction of a
great modern country.''
</P>
<P>
``The objective (of EU) is that the Russians stop this blind
military policy which takes as hostage a whole people, which is
intolerable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine admitted that ``there is a real problem of terrorism in
northern Caucasus, which has been going on for years.''
</P>
<P>
``No one disputes the right of Russia to fight terrorism. No
one disputes the Russian sovereignty over northern Caucasus. What
we dispute is the methods, this disproportionate military action,
being used,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Non-Performing Debts Down to 51 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Non-performing debts of South
Korean financial institutions stood at 57.9 trillion won (some 51
billion U.S. dollars) as of September, down 5.5 trillion won from
63.4 trillion won in June.
</P>
<P>
However, non-performing loans at non-banking institutions
increased by 1.5 trillion won to 27.8 trillion won, the Financial
Supervisory Service (FSS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bad debt ratio against total credit slipped 1.2
percentage points to 10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bad debts in commercial banks slipped by 6.9 trillion won to 19
trillion won from 25.9 trillion won in June while special-purpose
and state-invested banks edged down debts to 11.1 trillion won
from the June's 11.2 trillion won.
</P>
<P>
The FSS attributed the decrease of bad loans to the takeover of
8.4 trillion won bad debts in Seoul Bank and Korea First Bank.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that bad debts will increase in the final quarter
due to tougher credit regulations effective as from this month.
</P>
<P>
The regulations require financial institutions to strictly set
aside loss reserves amid restructuring in financially-troubled
Daewoo Group.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which suffered a financial crisis caused by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions in
late 1997, is recovering from the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Russian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
told Russian President Boris Yeltsin today that the strategic
partnership of cooperation oriented towards the 21st century
between China and Russia scored great achievements thanks to both
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark during his meeting with Yeltsin here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the current international situation, cooperation between
China and Russia in all fields is in the fundamental interest of
the two countries and has influence for world peace and
development, he said. "The Chinese government highly commends the
historic contribution made by President Yeltsin to the growth of
Sino-Russian friendly and cooperative relationship," he told
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin highly praised the economic achievements made by the
Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese government and
the unremitting efforts made by the Chinese government for the
growth of Russia-China ties. In his view, the most noteworthy
characteristics of the Russian-Chinese relationship can be summed
up as "trust, friendship, peace and cooperation," as Yeltsin put
it.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israel, Syria to Benefit From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between Israel
and Syria will resume next week in the form of a first ever
high-lellowing the meeting, intensive
talks will begin at a site to be determined in order to arrive at
a peace treaty between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Concurrently and in parallel, negotiations on the
Israeli-Lebanon track will commence.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic announcement on the resumption of Israeli-Syrian
peace talks was made by Clinton Wednesday in Washington. It came
after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's meetings in the
region this week with Barak and Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
For Barak, the resumption of peace talks with the Syrians has
many implications. The Syrian track appears to him far easier to
handle than the complex permanent settlement with the
Palestinians, which touches upon ultra-sensitive issues such as
holy sites and national aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Barak is also well aware that any breakthrough with Syria will
instantly not only help Israel to complete the final-status talks
with the Palestinians, but also enable Israel to pull out its
troops from South Lebanon within the framework of a peace treaty
with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The Syrians, too, can credit themselves with an achievement in
the current breakthrough. The peace talks with Israel will at last
bring the Golan Heights back to them.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with the current breakthrough, Syria will avert a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon to protect its
interests in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
As announced by Clinton, the Israeli-Syrian peace talks will
resume at the point where they left off in 1996, but the talks
will be arduous and the two sides will face hard choices.
</P>
<P>
The formula for resuming peace talks, prepared by Israel and
accepted by the Syrians, includes such key points:
</P>
<P>
Borders -- Israel will withdraw from the entire Golan Heights
to the June 4, 1967 lines with "adjustments."
</P>
<P>
Security -- the Golan will be demilitarized, the Syrian army
will be thinned out in the Qnneeitra-Damascus sector, while a
U.N. force will be deployed in the Golan;
</P>
<P>
Water -- the water of the Jordan River and the Kinneret will
flow entirely into Israel and the Syrians will not have access to
the Kinneret;
</P>
<P>
Relations -- embassies will be opened in both countries and
borders will be opened;
</P>
<P>
Lebanon -- the Israeli Defense Forces will deploy on the
international border and Syria will ensure tranquility in return
for recognition of its special status in Lebanon;
</P>
<P>
U.S. aid -- the U.S. will provide aid package to Israel while
Syria will receive economic aid from the West.
</P>
<P>
Objectives set by both sides are clear, and the success of the
talks will no doubt bring lasting peace to the whole Middle East.

N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, and contribute to
achieving a comprehensive, equitable and lasting peace in the
Middle East, benefiting regional states and peoples, she added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. Launch Environment Protection Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the United States have
launched a program on cooperation in protecting Egypt's
environment, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The program was launched on Wednesday by Egyptian Minister of
State for Environmental Affairs Nadia Riyad Ebeid and
Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) Brady Anderson
</P>
<P>
The launching came after a meeting of the Sub-Committee for
Environment of the Egyptian-U.S. Partnership for Economic and
Development Cooperation, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The four-year Egyptian environmental policy program, estimated
to cost 170 million U.S. dollars, provides a mechanism for
attaining the goal of the sub-committee, namely protection of
Egypt's environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Government bodies including the Egyptian Environmental Affairs
Agency, the Tourism Development Authority and the Organization for
Energy Planning will join efforts in carrying out the program,
funded by the USAID.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the program will try to enhance public
awareness of environment protection by promoting policies on
encouraging use of clean and efficient energy, reducing industrial
pollution and improving solid waste management.
</P>
<P>
An additional goal of the program is to help foster
opportunities for Egypt's private sector and non-governmental
organizations to play an active role in environmental improvement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the closest Mideast allies of the U.S., which
provides it with nearly 800 million dollars in economic aid. The
joint initiative is designed to contribute to Egypt's efforts in
creating an environment for sustained and balanced development.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Adjust Won's Appreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will take appropriate
measures at the Seoul foreign exchange market to prevent the won's
appreciation against the U.S. dollar so as not to hurt the
competitiveness of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned over the pace of the won's appreciation
and its level," said South Korean Finance and Economy Minister
Kang Bong-kyun Thursday
</P>
<P>
"The steady inflow of direct and indirect investment fund by
foreigners since this month spurred expectations of the won's
appreciation, leading to the rapid appreciation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks were believed that the government is
ready to intervene in the Seoul foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
To curb the won's rally, the government is expected to issue 4.
3 trillion won (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars) worth of foreign
exchange bonds and will pay back one billion dollars in foreign
debts ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state-run Korea Asset Management Corp. will be
directed to buy an estimated 500 million non-performing foreign
currency loans from financial institutions this week, said
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The won strengthened to 1,126.5 against the greenback Wednesday.
It was the highest level since the December 4,1997 when the South
Korean currency changed hands at 1,135 won per dollar due to a
financial crisis in Asia triggered by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions in late 1997.

<HEADLINE> Former President to Run for Iranian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani has announced to run for the 6th Majlis
(parliament) elections slated for February 18, 2000, the English
daily Iran News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was currently chairman of the powerful advisory
State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believed that the decision would help the
moderates and reformists in their efforts to win the sensitive
parliamentary polling, which would create a new balance of power
in the conservative-dominated Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Abdullah Nouri, a reformist hopeful for
future Majlis Speaker, was sentenced to five years imprisonment by
the conservative-controlled Special Cleric Court.
</P>
<P>
As managing director of the daily Khordad, Nouri was also
given five years of dismissal from his post and a cash fine of 15
million rials (5,000 U.S. dollars) on charges ranging from
publishing anti-religious materials to insulting the late Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Mussavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Nouri, former Interior Minister and
Vice President for Development and Social Affairs, is a victim of
the country's spiraling power struggles and that the powerful
hard-liners attempted to ensure their dominance in the Majlis by
disqualifying key figures of the moderate factions from running
for the parliamentary polling.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Nouri's conviction, Rafsanjani said he has bitter
memories of the proceedings and eventual conviction of Nouri and
he has made every effort to forestall "the sorry turn of events."
</P>
<P>
Expressing hope that Nouri's case will be resolved
satisfactorily in the future, he said he has discussed relevant
issues with Nouri personally and has intervened on his behalf with
the Special Cleric Court.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1934 in Iran's central Kerman province, Rafsanjani was
a prominent political activist before the 1979 Islamic revolution
and served as Majlis Speaker during the period from July 1980 to
July 1989, and Iranian President from July 1989 to August 1997.

bus, which was on its way to Jakarta, fell into the valley, Antara
said, adding that the injured were taken to a nearby hospital to
get medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was engine trouble.

<HEADLINE> Somali Gunmen Kidnap U.N. Aid Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified Somali gunmen
have abducted a senior aid official from the United Nations in
Waberi District of south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The abducted aid worker, Iddiris Mohammed, has been the officer
in charge of the World Food Program (WFP) office here.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, three gunmen have attacked Iddiris
in his house late on Wednesday afternoon. According to the
neighbors, Iddiris was standing right in the front gate of his
house when the gunmen had arrived.
</P>
<P>
The five gunmen armed with assault rifles were driving a FIAT
124 car, which they had parked beside the house of Iddiris before
the abduction took place.
</P>
<P>
One of the eyewitnesses said Iddiris who was shocked by the
guns did not show any kind of resistance. "He smoothly followed
them to the car with the guns firmly pointed at his back and they
sped away to an unknown destination."
</P>
<P>
One of the relatives of the aid worker said they still don't
know the whereabouts of Iddiris nor the identity of the gunmen who
took him away.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been much easier for us to spot him if we knew
which clan the gunmen belonged to," said one of the relatives.
</P>
<P>
The search for the identity of the kidnappers and where they
are hiding him still continues, but some unconfirmed reports
indicate that he is being kept in a house in Bermuda area, the
most troubled part of the capital.
</P>
<P>
No one knows the reason for the abduction, but speculations are
that the gunmen wanted some ransom for the exchange of his
release, something that had been happening all the time throughout
the years of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Somali gunmen in South Mogadishu
kidnaped Iddiris. It was early 1998 when gunmen took away Iddiris
and through some negotiations, his relatives had managed to secure
his release.
</P>
<P>
The abduction is taking place at a time when the humanitarian
situation especially in Southern Somalia is deteriorating with
floods from heavy rains devastating hundreds of farmlands and
endangering entire towns and villages in Lower Shabelle, Middle
and Lower Jubba regions.

<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission and a state councilor, said China and Nepal share the
similar historical experiences of being exploited and oppressed by
colonialism, and that developing bilateral friendly relations
conforms to the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of high-level visits in recent years have further
enhanced the bilateral friendly relations, adding that it is China
's consistent policy to develop good-neighborly and friendly
relations with its neighbors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi went on to say that the Tibet Autonomous Region, as known
to all, is part of the territory of the People's Republic of China,
and that the living standards of the Tibetan people have raised
tremendously thanks to the democratic reform carried out after the
peaceful liberation of Tibet and subsequent economic development
in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Support for a so-called "independence of Tibet" by some foreign
forces which harbor evil intentions, is unacceptable, and it will,
beyond any doubt, be resolutely opposed by the entire Chinese
people, including the people of Tibet, noted Chi.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the Nepalese guests on China's principled
position on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Rana said his current visit to China is aimed at further

their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that China is an important force for
safeguarding regional and world peace, and wished China continuous
development.

<HEADLINE> Initial Progress in Sino- U.S. Quake Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and United States
seismologists have recorded the entire processes of the four
recent strong earthquakes in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region since August, 1998 as an initial part of their
cooperative project in the region.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of China Disaster Reduction Press described
the recorded data as "valuable for accurate positioning of
epicenters, design of quake-resistant structures in quake-prone
areas, and rehabilitation construction in these areas."
</P>
<P>
It said the advanced U.S. monitoring facilities installed
around the epicenters of four strong quakes that hit two small
cities in Xinjiang in August, 1998 and June, 1999 recorded the
entire quake process, together with China's own monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
The facilities, 11 sets of high-tech mobile, digital, wide-
frequency quake monitors, went into operation early this year
after their installation over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the American experts will use their advanced
digital processing and analyzing software to develop models of the
quakes in Jiashi and Beicheng in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiashi was hit by two strong quakes with a magnitude of six on
Richter scale, and while Beicheng was hit by two quakes with a
magnitude of five on Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative project, known as Tianshan Mountain Geodynamics
Research, between the Xinjiang Regional Seismological Bureau and
the New York State Institute of Technology, was launched in June,
1998, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Professor Steven Lake, the American expert
involved, has been praised by his Chinese colleagues as
responsible, professional and hardworking.
</P>
<P>
The professor was awarded the "China Tianshan" cooperation
prize for 1998-1999 for his contribution to the project by the
government of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the paper
concluded.

<P>
TOKYO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China will stick to the policy of
actively developing the relationship with Japan, which is also an
important component of China's foreign policy, China's top
consultant Li Ruihuan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), reaffirmed China's
consistent policy when meeting with Soichiro Ito, speaker of the
House of Representatives, and Juro Saito, president of the House
of Councilors, of the Japanese Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are close neighbors and important countries in
the region. To further strengthen friendly relations and deepen
mutual cooperation will conform to the fundamental interests of
the two peoples and benefit peace and stability in the region and
the world at large, Li said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li also briefed them on the basic policy of
China's multi-party cooperation featured by "long-term co-
existence and mutual supervision." Li quoted Deng Xiaoping as
saying that a political party needs to hear different voices.
</P>
<P>
The two parliament leaders extended congratulations to China on
the forthcoming resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao and great achievements China has scored since the
introduction of the policy of reform and opening up to the outside
world. They also shared the view of promoting exchanges with the
CPPCC.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it is ready to give assistance to residents near Mt.
Mayon should an eruption of the volcano force them to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview, Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado said that contingency preparations were made as early as
June,and that the vigilance of local authorities has paid off.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism is in place. The Regional Disaster Coordinating
Councils, local government units and officials know what to do,"
Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mayon reportedly spewed an ash column which was
more than a kilometer high and spangled with pyroclastic materials,
prompting some reports to describe it as a "pre-millennium" blast.
</P>
<P>
Residents of nearby villages were reported seeing the ash-fall,
along with the volcanic materials thrown up by Mayon.
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who also chairs the National Disaster Coordinating
Council(NDCC), added that evacuation centers are ready to
accommodate residents who need to leave their homes and that
provisions such as food are sufficient.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that as of Thursday morning, the
monitoring of the NDCC shows there is still no immediate need to
evacuate the residents in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The alert level is still level two. We will need to evacuate
residents when the alert level goes higher," he added.

<HEADLINE> Some Foreign Investors in Tanzania Discovered as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has discovered that some of the foreigners who are posing as
investors are just crooks, the local Guardian newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an one-day workshop held Wednesday here on the
National Anti-Corruption Strategy, Minister of State in the
President's Office Wilson Masilingi said some of the so-called
investors showed up saying they wanted to invest in the country
but they were not doing so.
</P>
<P>
After failing to meet the required conditions for investing in
the country, he said such crooks moved around the world tarnishing
the good name of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, Masilingi assured serious investors of the
government's good cooperation, saying they should feel free to get
in touch with his office in case they suspected bureaucracy within
relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized by the Prevention of Corruption
Bureau (PCB) of Tanzania and sponsored by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
It was the first workshop organized to discuss the National
Anti- Corruption Strategy which was published last month and
offers a roadmap for coordinated and effective attack on
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Housing Sector Stagnant in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya experienced a big slump
in its real estate industry this year due to the flagging economy,
a Kenyan newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates in the first half of the year, ranging from
25 to 45 percent, further undermined investment in the sector, the
East African Standard said.
</P>
<P>
Although the rates came down to an average of 20 percent a few
months ago, most investors still adopted a "wait and see"
position.
</P>
<P>
Many private and public companies that initially offered their
employees loan schemes to develop housing units froze the plan in
1999 as the economy took a downward turn, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The National Social Security Fund continued investing over
three billion shillings (40 million U.S. dollars) annually on land
and housing programs, but the funds were not enough to meet the
growing demand for housing.
</P>
<P>
Experts here observed that the problems of housing will
continue if the economy can not recover in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Expects Still Closer Cooperation With Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A mechanism of coordination
should be instituted to facilitate still closer cooperation
between south China's Guangdong Province and Macao after December
20, the date when Macao will return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from geographical terms, Macao is closely related to
Guangdong. It fell under its jurisdiction in ancient times. At
present, 96 of the population in Macao are Chinese, and an
overwhelming majority of them are from Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism to be worked out would be similar to the high-
level joint conference system now existing between Guangdong and
Hong Kong, which is working toward common prosperity in Guangdong,
Hong Kong and Macao, said Lu Ruihua, Guangdong provincial governor,
said in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong and Macao are very economically-complementary,
whereas tourism is the most ideal linkage to beef up their multi-
dimensional cooperation, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
As a major tourist destination, Guangdong Province is capable
of handling about 160 million tourist arrivals annually. In
December 1993, tourism authorities from Guangdong, Hong Kong and
Macao established a joint institution to promote tourism programs
in the Greater Pearl River Delta that covers the three regions. To
date, some 130 travel agencies from over 20 countries are engaged
in organizing 72-hour visa-free tours to the Greater Pearl River
Delta.
</P>
<P>
With a high-level coordinating organization to be set up in the
tourism industry after Macao's return to the motherland, experts
said, tours to Greater Pear River Delta will be even more inviting
and attractive to tourists through unified planning and packaging.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges and cooperation between Guangdong and Macao after
December 20 will keep growing in the fields of economy and trade,
science and technology, financial sector, transportation,
telecommunications, education, culture, sports, environmental
protection and in rectifying social order.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades from early 1979 to October this year,
businesspeople from Macao have actually invested a total of 2.47
billion U.S. dollars in 7,584 projects in Guangdong, said local
sources.
</P>
<P>
At least 163 Macao-financed businesses are in Guangzhou, the
provincial capital, with the volume of the placed-in investment
totaling 320 million U.S. dollars. And another 457 Macao-backed
businesses are in Zhongshan, another city of the same province,
which involve a direct investment of 370 million U.S. dollars and
the shipment of 44.85 million U.S. dollars worth of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from Guangdong have also launched 86 businesses in
Macao, said the sources.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Prospects Bode Well for S. Africa in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Grappling with the
negative consequences brought about by the financial crises in
developing markets, South Africa has gone through the year of 1999
with strides in its economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The country is greeting the new millennium with bright
prospects for its economy which is expected to see a growth rate
of 3.7 percent in the coming year, representing a giant leap
forward after this year's expansion of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country, affected by the financial crises sweeping across
the world, registered an economic growth of only 0.1 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts were upbeat about the economy in South
Africa, saying the task ahead would be to consolidate the upturn
and translate it into a sustainable growth rate approaching five
percent.
</P>
<P>
The prediction, buoyed in part by the recent surge in the gold
price, a 1.9-percent inflation rate at a 30-year low and
increasing confidence that the spate of financial crises in
developing markets has abated, exceeds the 3.5 percent growth rate
forecasted for the South African economy in the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) World Economic Outlook report.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the recovery to the following
factors -- accelerated drop in interest rates, speedup of
privatization process, sound measures to ensure a stable currency
and commodity prices, and strong foreign buying of local bonds
since the general elections in June.
</P>
<P>
The 7.5 percentage point cut in interest rates this year will
steadily bolster consumption expenditure as they work through the
economy lagging about two quarters behind the interest rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated privatization process is creating "huge
possibilities" for all types of investors to come to South Africa.
The defense industry, railways, ports and electricity utilities
will offer attractive opportunities for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Giving one example, the arms manufacturer Denel would be split
into four business segments -- aerospace, ordnance, commercial and
information technology.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has been up 44 percent this year, compared
with 34 percent globally among emerging markets, according to
International Finance Corporation (IFC) indices.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1999 has also seen an expansion of South Africa's
exports. The country's exports into Africa, in particular, now
totals some 20 billion rand (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
This represented an expansion of 335 percent since 1992 when
trade sanctions against South Africa were lifted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa signed a long-awaited free trade agreement with
the European Union (EU) in October and this will, undoubtedly,
further stimulate the country's recovering economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, the EU will liberalize 95 percent of South
African imports over 10 years, while South Africa will liberalize
86 percent of European imports over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that the agreement could boost the economic
growth in South Africa by 0.5 to one percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the pact, foreign direct investment could
increase by an extra one percentage point of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) within the next two to three years, said Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is however looking forward to increasing its
foreign investment by 2.5 percent within the next two to three
years, which would help boost the annual economic growth to the
target of six percent set by the government.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit has been controlled at about three percent,
indicating that the country's economic fundamentals are sound and
set to further improve.
</P>
<P>
Although South African economy is beginning to find life again
after the protracted slowdown, there is still a whole lot of hard
work ahead.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, rocketing unemployment, poor
competitiveness and rampant crime may discourage foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also has to compete for portfolio flows against
fast- recovering Asian economies as well as an expected bounce in
Latin America next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the difficulties, the creation of macro-economic
and political stability and the improvement of governance are
among the key determinants that can help the country improve its
economic performance in the new millennium, economic analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Makes Progress in Anti-Corruption War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Head of Civil Service
Richard Leakey has declared that the government is winning the war
against corruption in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"During the first 100 or 120 days in office, we have made a
dent on corruption. We are digging into the files and people being
taken to court," Leakey said in a prime-time program on Kenya
Television Network Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Leakey said that he was optimistic about the resumption of a
205 million U.S. dollar loan suspended by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1997 to protest against inefficiency and
corruption in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear to me that we can get the IMF back. If we can have
IMF support, we can rebuild our infrastructure," Leakey was quoted
by Thursday' s East African Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have totally changed the budgetary process, reformed public
 procurement and downsized the government," said Leakey, adding:
"We have also introduced checks on government spending."
</P>
<P>
Leakey was picked as Head of Civil Service by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi in July as part of an economic recovery plan,
which also ushered some other technocrats into the government.

<HEADLINE> Archeological Finds Rewrite History of One Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The recent discovery of
four ancient wells and a tomb demonstrates that one Chinese city
is actually 700 years older than was previously thought.
</P>
<P>
 Written records indicate that Baoding, in north China's Hebei
Province, came into being in the year 477 during the Northern Wei
Dynasty (386-534), but the wells and tombs discovered dated to 202
B.C.in the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The shape and structure of the wells and pottery unearthed
from them show they were created in the Western Han Dynasty,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
In the tomb, believed to be that of a poor family,
archeologists found pottery kettles, jars, basins, and dishes with
striped decorations, as well as pottery earrings and copper coins
of the Western Han.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the wells and tombs are evidence that as long
ago as the early and middle period of the Western Han Dynasty,
settlements of some size had already been formed in Baoding.
</P>
<P>
The four wells and the tomb were discovered by workers last
month at two construction sites in downtown Baoding, some 140
kilometers southwest of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They also found four other wells belonging to the period
between fifth and tenth centuries, and two tombs from the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911).

<HEADLINE> Public Transportation Fares Up in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The fares for public buses and
the Beijing subway will rise by more than 50 percent beginning
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The ticket price for public buses in the city proper will be
increased from the current 0.5 yuan to one yuan (12 U.S. cents),
and the subway price will increase to three yuan (35 U.S. cents)
from two yuan, according to sources from the local Public Traffic
Company and from the Beijing Metro Company.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the price of monthly tickets will also be up some
40 to 50 percent at the end of this month. For example, the price
of a monthly ticket available for bus service in the urban area
will rise from the present 15 yuan (1.8 U.S.dollars) to 30 yuan (3.
6 U.S.dollars), and the price of a monthly ticket available for
both bus and subway will be doubled to 80 yuan (about nine US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials with the companies said that most of the money from
ticket sales will used to improve transportation facilities
including new buses and better maintained roads.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 10 million residents living in Beijing and
they often have difficulty moving about town in cars and on public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has pledged to further improve traffic
facilities to the benefit of most commuters. It has also been
reported that Beijing will build a light railway system and a new
subway line in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing number of private cars, the majority of
commuters in Beijing, whose average monthly salaries range from
100 to 250 U.S. dollars, have to rely on buses and the subway.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Improve Seed Production, Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
is committed to ensuring its food security through improved seed
production and supply, the local Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day workshop on seed supply strategies for the
new millennium, which ended here on Wednesday, Deputy Minister for
 Agriculture and Cooperatives Ismail Iwvatta said poor seeds
production and supply system has made the country perform poorly
in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying that recent studies suggested
that major constraint to sustainable food supply and security is
linked to seeds supply.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said the government is making efforts to
ensure peasants that they would get the needed seeds.
</P>
<P>
Although Tanzania liberalized its seed production and
distribution system in early 1990s, the private commercial seed
suppliers have confined themselves to high value crop varieties
only, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said commercial seed producers and suppliers prefer to deal
in export- oriented varieties like hybrid maize and horticultural
crops and have lost interest in serving peasants.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Singapore Shares Shine on Rosy Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulls running loose on the
Singapore Stock Market Wednesday continued to buck a regional
downward trend less than one month before the turn of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) steamed
ahead 51.46 points, or 2.24 percent, to end at 2,351.33, the third
all-time high in as many days and a figure far above the 2,300-
point psychological barrier.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, most other key Asian markets such as Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Taiwan retreated to negative territory after the Dow
Jones Average tumbled 118.36 points, or 1 percent, to 11,106.65 on
Tuesday, its sharpest one-day fall since October 15.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hefty 107.49-point or 4.8-percent gain in just two
days, many analysts here projected that after a possible breather
over the next few days, a long-lasting, rather than meteoric, bull
run will prevail as favorable factors bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
The soaring of share prices before a feared Y2K crisis
reflected investors' relaxed nerves after the Singapore government
had taken concrete steps in various fields, especially in the
financial sector, to combat the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) declared last month
that the financial sector, with 99 percent financial institutions
having confirmed Y2K readiness, will continue to function normally
during the rollover into the new century.
</P>
<P>
The MAS assurance came with the announcement of detailed
contingency plans, including the setting up of around-the-clock
operation centers during critical periods and a liquidity scheme
to cope with temporary Y2K-related liquidity shortages.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore should have no problem with this (Y2K bug), as
everywhere has already become Y2K compliant," a local investor
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Singapore market looked appealing to many
investors in the long run as the government adopted sweeping
measures to liberalize the financial sector, thus winning the city-
state a good reputation for the pro-business environment.
</P>
<P>
These measures include the opening-up of the domestic banking
market to foreign players in June and the recent freeing-up of its
capital market which came with the inauguration of the Singapore
Exchange providing combined equity and derivatives services.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city-state has impressed investors most with
its emergence as the least-affected economy in comparison with its
hard-hit Southeast Asian neighbors in the last two years during
the height of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is now undergoing a fast and all-around economic
recovery with its gross domestic product (GDP) in the second and
third quarters of 1999 registering the same gain of 6.7 percent
over the respective periods of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government was prompted in November to raise
its 1999 economic growth forecast to around 5 percent, from its
previous projection of between 4 and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The better economic outlook has enhanced investors'
anticipation of more lucrative corporate earnings early next year,
thus resulting in a spate of advance buying-ins which pushed up
the prices of blue chips and technological shares.
</P>
<P>
Companies in the electronics sector, which contributes about 23
percent of Singapore's GDP, is expected to see their profits up 20
percent or more, according to a local analyst.
</P>
<P>
As for the banking sector, the outlook is all the more
favorable as the already well-capitalized banks are now well-
positioned to profit from the regional economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The STI surge was also due to the investors' growing
inclination to take their cue from the U.S. Nasdaq composite index,
rather than the Dow Jones, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq, home to many Internet stars like Yahoo! and other
hot technology stocks, closed 30 points higher at 3,617 on
Wednesday, its fifth consecutive record-high close in a series of
record-breaking sprees.
</P>
<P>
Following similar cases on Nasdaq, the Singapore market also
saw the rise of Internet-related issues like MediaRing, a newly-
listed web-based communications company, and technology-related
issues like Creative Technology, an electronics product
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Given the encouraging circumstances, many analysts forecast
that it is possible that the current heating-up will continue till
at least early next year and there are already signs of a spill-
over effect on second liners such as property and retail counters.

<HEADLINE> Power Rationing Continues in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
announced that power rationing would continue, but not be
intensified.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made following some speculations that
power rationing would ease after recent rains in some areas of the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Thursday quoted Energy Minister
Francis Masakhalia as saying that the rains were not enough to
raise water levels at major power stations.
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia also ruled out on Wednesday the possibility of
purchasing an emergency power generator, which would cost the
government 94 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that importing such equipment was too costly and likely
to impact negatively on the financial situation of the country.
</P>
<P>
"With this deteriorating situation, the ministry was faced with
two options -- to enhance the current level of power rationing or
to import an emergency power generator," he said. "But either
option is going to hurt the economy."
</P>
<P>
Over three-month long power rationing has badly hamper Kenya's
industrial sector and caused inconvenience in residents' daily
life. It is also scaring off the potential foreign investors.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the largest
municipality in southwest China, was covered by a thick cloud of
fog this morning. The city has long been renowned as China's "
foggy capital"
</P>
<P>
Although traffic was disrupted, no accidents have been reported.
But flights at Jiangbei Airport in the northern part of the city
have not been affected because of its higher geographic position.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists attributed the occurrence of dense fog to
heavy humidity in the air caused by incessant rains over the past
few days.
</P>
<P>
Though the fog began to clear away by noon, meteorologists
predicted that there are still possibilities of fog over the next
few days.

<HEADLINE> Making More Japanese Friends, Says Chinese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China will further develop the
relationship with Japan on the existing basis to meet the
challenge of the new century, a top Chinese leader said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation and development of Sino-Japanese friendship
need more people to be involved in. "No matter how different are
their beliefs, positions and occupations, so long as they devote
to the Sino-Japanese friendship cause, we shall have common
language and will become sincere friends," Li Ruihuan, chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, told a luncheon jointly hosted in his
honor by seven friendly organizations of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people will not forget those old
friends who rendered outstanding contribution to the Sino-Japanese
friendship and we are looking forward to seeing more young people
become successors of the older generation.
</P>
<P>
The long-term friendship between the two countries lies
fundamentally in the young people. And the young people of the two
countries should go with the historical tide, treasuring and
safeguarding the peaceful and friendly situation at the moment, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
To broaden and enliven bilateral cooperation, it is essential
to have not only government-to-government contacts, but also
people-to-people exchanges in economic, political, social and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not forget the past but should all the more look to
the future," Li said. It is hoped that young people of the two
countries will inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of the
older generation and continue to make new contribution to
enhancing mutual understanding, trust as well as friendship.

SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Inter-Korean processing-on-
commission trade is expected to hit a record 100 million U.S.

</P>
<P>
The processing-on-commission trade, in which South Korean

SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will print a new 10,

The central bank will add several faking-proof features to the

</P>

The number of found counterfeit notes has been on the rise due
to rapid spread of personal computers and color copiers in the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Prospects Bode Well for S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Grappling with the
negative consequences brought about by the financial crises in
developing markets, South Africa has gone through the year of 1999
with strides in its economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The country is greeting the new millennium with bright
prospects for its economy which is expected to see a growth rate
of 3.7 percent in the coming year, representing a giant leap
forward after this year's expansion of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country, affected by the financial crises sweeping across
the world, registered an economic growth of only 0.1 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts were upbeat about the economy in South
Africa, saying the task ahead would be to consolidate the upturn
and translate it into a sustainable growth rate approaching five
percent.
</P>
<P>
The prediction, buoyed in part by the recent surge in the gold
price, a 1.9-percent inflation rate at a 30-year low and
increasing confidence that the spate of financial crises in
developing markets has abated, exceeds the 3.5 percent growth rate
forecasted for the South African economy in the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) World Economic Outlook report.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the recovery to the following
factors -- accelerated drop in interest rates, speedup of
privatization process, sound measures to ensure a stable currency
and commodity prices, and strong foreign buying of local bonds
since the general elections in June.
</P>
<P>
The 7.5 percentage point cut in interest rates this year will
steadily bolster consumption expenditure as they work through the
economy lagging about two quarters behind the interest rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated privatization process is creating "huge
possibilities" for all types of investors to come to South Africa.
The defense industry, railways, ports and electricity utilities
will offer attractive opportunities for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Giving one example, the arms manufacturer Denel would be split
into four business segments -- aerospace, ordnance, commercial and
information technology.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has been up 44 percent this year, compared
with 34 percent globally among emerging markets, according to
International Finance Corporation (IFC) indices.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1999 has also seen an expansion of South Africa's
exports. The country's exports into Africa, in particular, now
totals some 20 billion rand (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
This represented an expansion of 335 percent since 1992 when
trade sanctions against South Africa were lifted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa signed a long-awaited free trade agreement with
the European Union (EU) in October and this will, undoubtedly,
further stimulate the country's recovering economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, the EU will liberalize 95 percent of South
African imports over 10 years, while South Africa will liberalize
86 percent of European imports over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that the agreement could boost the economic
growth in South Africa by 0.5 to one percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the pact, foreign direct investment could
increase by an extra one percentage point of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) within the next two to three years, said Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is however looking forward to increasing its
foreign investment by 2.5 percent within the next two to three
years, which would help boost the annual economic growth to the
target of six percent set by the government.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit has been controlled at about three percent,
indicating that the country's economic fundamentals are sound and
set to further improve.
</P>
<P>
Although South African economy is beginning to find life again
after the protracted slowdown, there is still a whole lot of hard
work ahead.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, rocketing unemployment, poor
competitiveness and rampant crime may discourage foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also has to compete for portfolio flows against
fast- recovering Asian economies as well as an expected bounce in
Latin America next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the difficulties, the creation of macro-economic
and political stability and the improvement of governance are
among the key determinants that can help the country improve its
economic performance in the new millennium, economic analysts
said.

Zambian deputy minister of local government Elizabeth Kalenga

Kalenga, who could not confirm whether any houses were

BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese edition of "The Man
Who Loved Children" , a heart-wrenching tragedy of a modern family
set in the early 1940s by Australian female writer Christina Stead,
was launched today in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> New Row Arises on Opener of Sydney Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia arose to defend its
arrangement for the 2000 Olympic Games opening.
</P>
<P>
According the Age Thursday, a spokesman for prime minister John
Howard said last night that the Queen had been fully briefed on
the arrangements for the Games opening while attending the
commonwealth heads of government meeting in Durban.
</P>
<P>
It was an answer to a challenge from Dick Pound, a Canadian
International Olympic Committee vice president who said earlier
that the plan for the Australian Governor-General to open the
Games was against the Olympic Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Charter asks a head of state to open Games.
</P>
<P>
Pound insisted the Queen should be invited to open the 2000
Sydney Games. "The invitation ought to go to her majesty and if
she is not available, presumably she would ask the Governor-
General," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rebuffing the challenge, the spokesman for Howard said that "it
would appear that Mr pound does not have a full appreciation of
how the Australian Constitutions works in relation to the powers
of the head-of-state."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, John Howard had insisted the Games be opened by
himself. After the November referendum refused a republic proposal,
he was under increasing public pressure and forced to leave the
honors to governor-general William Deane.

<HEADLINE> Birds Reside in Yellow River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 9 (Xinhua)-- More than ten million birds have
built their homes in the estuary area of the Yellow River this
winter, turning the former desolate region into a habitat for
birds.
</P>
<P>
The estuary in the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve, which is
China's largest wetland, covers an area of some 150,000 hectares.
About 269 kinds of birds reside in this well-preserved natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
There are larks, swans, over 1400 black-mouthed gulls as well
as many other precious birds at the estuary.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Delta is situated in the Binzhou Prefecture
near the City of Dongying in northwestern Shandong Province. It
has a population of 5.2 million and covers an area of 18,000
square kilometers. The delta is very rich in arable land and other
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
China began establishing nature reserves in 1956. By the end
of 1999, China has set up 926 nature reserves, including the
Wolong Nature Reserve in the southwest. Six other nature reserves
have been listed as internationally important wetlands and
habitats for birds.

<HEADLINE> Gas Pipeline Explosion Injuring Four in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A natural gas pipeline
explosion on Wednesday morning in downtown Xi'an left four people
injured and a chunk of the surrounding area without power for
nearly a full day.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which occurred at 11:40 a.m. yesterday, blew off
blocks of slabstone and bricks for at least 500 meters. According
to today's "China Daily", the pipeline, full of natural gas, is
located in underground tunnel, which runs in front of a four-star
hotel and also contains a major electric cable as well as several
communication cables.
</P>
<P>
The hotel, the Grand New World Hotel, was unaffected with the
exception of the unexpected blackout. Fortunately enough, only a
few people were on the spot when the accident occurred, Fu Yufeng,
a witness, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the four injured, three were senior citizens -- a cyclist
and two elderly sitting roadside. And the fourth victim, a taxi
driver, was slightly injured as he waited for hire in front of the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
"Our investigation showed that the explosion was accidental,
not deliberate," said the official who wished to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
Xie Dianli, a director of the city's Power Supply Bureau,
predicted that the accident may have been resultant from a natural
gas leak in the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> Affordable Housing Hot in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- New, affordable housing priced
about 2,600 yuan (330 US dollars) per square meter has become the
hottest real estate in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
"This is not buying, it's snatching," said a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
Han Song, a sales manager with a real estate company, said that
24 affordable apartment buildings offered by his company have been
sold out and more than 1,600 people are on waiting lists for four
newly-completed buildings.
</P>
<P>
The low-cost housing is an important step by the Chinese
government to improve people's housing conditions and expand
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Beijing Construction Committee said that the
government is scheduled to build about 3.1 million sq meters of
low-cost housing, and more than 55 percent of the one million sq
meters finished housing has been sold.
</P>
<P>
The housing is built on the land allocated by the local
government and enjoys a series of favorable treatments including
tax reduction, and a cheap sales price which is much lower than
the average cost of 600 US dollars per square meter.
</P>
<P>
With a down payment of 100,000 yuan (13,000 US dollars), a
buyer can move in and pay the rest in installments of about 130 to
250 US dollars each month.
</P>
<P>
"Around 1,000 yuan (130 US dollars) per month is not a problem
for me and my husband," said a woman surnamed Cao, who is working
for a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"My newspaper office is not likely to give me a house," she
said. "Even if it did give me one, it would be a small one. So why
not to buy a large house myself?"
</P>
<P>
China's enterprises and institutions used to distribute houses
to their employees, but the distribution system, which is usually
based on experience and rank, ordinary young couples have to wait
a long time for their own home.
</P>
<P>
In late 1998, the Chinese central government announced it would
stop this housing distribution, saying that each worker must buy
his or her own home.
</P>
<P>
This past September, the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, cut the loan interest for home buyers and extended the
longest term of repayment from 20 years to 30.
</P>
<P>
However, housing is still too expensive for people whose salary
is lower than 150 US dollars per month, especially the laid-off
employees of State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest government survey, the ordinary
families are guaranteed low-cost housing, and the government will
continue to offer subsidies and build a certain number of houses
for these families to live in.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government has pledged to increase the
average housing area of urban residents from 8.47 sq meters per
person in 1996 to 9 sq meters in 2000. It also planned that each
urban resident will have at least 6 sq meters of living space by
2000.

with strides in its economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The country is greeting the new millennium with bright
prospects for its economy which is expected to see a growth rate
of 3.7 percent in the coming year, representing a giant leap
forward after this year's expansion of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country, affected by the financial crises sweeping across
the world, registered an economic growth of only 0.1 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts were upbeat about the economy in South
Africa, saying the task ahead would be to consolidate the upturn
and translate it into a sustainable growth rate approaching five
percent.
</P>
<P>
The prediction, buoyed in part by the recent surge in the gold
price, a 1.9-percent inflation rate at a 30-year low and
increasing confidence that the spate of financial crises in
developing markets has abated, exceeds the 3.5 percent growth rate
forecasted for the South African economy in the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) World Economic Outlook report.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the recovery to the following
factors -- accelerated drop in interest rates, speedup of
privatization process, sound measures to ensure a stable currency
and commodity prices, and strong foreign buying of local bonds
since the general elections in June.
</P>
<P>
The 7.5 percentage point cut in interest rates this year will
steadily bolster consumption expenditure as they work through the
economy lagging about two quarters behind the interest rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated privatization process is creating "huge
possibilities" for all types of investors to come to South Africa.
The defense industry, railways, ports and electricity utilities
will offer attractive opportunities for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Giving one example, the arms manufacturer Denel would be split
into four business segments -- aerospace, ordnance, commercial and
information technology.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has been up 44 percent this year, compared
with 34 percent globally among emerging markets, according to
International Finance Corporation (IFC) indices.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1999 has also seen an expansion of South Africa's
exports. The country's exports into Africa, in particular, now
totals some 20 billion rand (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
This represented an expansion of 335 percent since 1992 when
trade sanctions against South Africa were lifted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa signed a long-awaited free trade agreement with
the European Union (EU) in October and this will, undoubtedly,
further stimulate the country's recovering economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, the EU will liberalize 95 percent of South
African imports over 10 years, while South Africa will liberalize
86 percent of European imports over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that the agreement could boost the economic
growth in South Africa by 0.5 to one percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the pact, foreign direct investment could
increase by an extra one percentage point of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) within the next two to three years, said Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is however looking forward to increasing its
foreign investment by 2.5 percent within the next two to three
years, which would help boost the annual economic growth to the
target of six percent set by the government.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit has been controlled at about three percent,
indicating that the country's economic fundamentals are sound and
set to further improve.
</P>
<P>
Although South African economy is beginning to find life again
after the protracted slowdown, there is still a whole lot of hard
work ahead.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, rocketing unemployment, poor
competitiveness and rampant crime may discourage foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also has to compete for portfolio flows against
fast- recovering Asian economies as well as an expected bounce in
Latin America next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the difficulties, the creation of macro-economic
and political stability and the improvement of governance are
among the key determinants that can help the country improve its
economic performance in the new millennium, economic analysts
said.

<P>
DHAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Three by-elections were held in
Bangladesh on Wednesday as major opposition parties boycotted all
the polls.
</P>
<P>
Expelled Awami League leader Chayan Islam, who contested as an
independent candidate, won a by-election by beating former Deputy
Minister for Industries Hasibur Rahman Swapan, who had lost the
seat for floor crossing, according to unofficial results reaching
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, ex-State Minister for Water Resources Dr. Mohammad
Alauddin, who also lost his seat on the same charge, was poised to
retain it in a poorly contested by-election. A third by-election
was won by former Vice Chancellor of Jahangir-nagar University Dr.
Alauddin Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
There were a few stray incidents during the by-elections, but

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges Contribution to Palestine Through U.N. Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has pledged to
contribute 20,000 U.S. dollars to the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) 2000
budget, Bernama news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Representative on the Ad Hoc Committee of the U.N.
General Assembly, Jasmi Mohamed Yussof, announced the commitment
at the committee meeting in New York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's contribution to the agency is over and above its
direct bilateral assistance and cooperation programs for the
Palestinian people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jasmi said Malaysia attaches great importance to the work and
support provided by the 50-year-old agency.
</P>
<P>
He lauded UNRWA's contribution to helping Palestinians, saying
that since its establishment in December 1949, UNRWA has
contributed tremendously towards alleviating the sufferings of
Palestinian refugees caused by the conflict in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the agency's worthy efforts deserve the
continued strong support of the international community," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA was set up to assist some 750,000 Palestinian refugees
who fled their homes and lands in the wake of the 1948 Arab-
Israeli conflict, and refugees and their descendants now number
more than 3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries including Malaysia have so far reportedly
pledged some 172 million U.S. dollars of the 360 million 2000
budget for the agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian men's bridge
team is vying for a place in the top eight at the Bermuda Bowl
next January.
</P>
<P>
"Our target at Bermuda is reaching the best eight as
recommended by the meeting of the bridge federation," team manager
Lufti Hamid was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen countries will take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
Lufti said that the team would be seeking a place in the top
four when the tournament is held at home, scheduled to be staged
at Nusa Dua, Bali, in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The male team comprises long standing pair Henky Lasut/Eddy
Manoppo, Denny Sacul/Franky Karwur and Santje Panelewen/Robert
Tobing.
</P>
<P>
He conceded the team will meet tough opposition in the other
contenders who go to the championship as the best teams in their
respective qualifying zones.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's best achievement at the tournament was finishing in
seventh place in Beijing in 1995. Indonesia failed to make it
through the qualifiers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Leaving with the team will be their female compatriots who will
compete in the Venice Cup for their inaugural appearance at the
world women's championship. The event takes place at the same time
as the Bermuda Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The women's team consists of Lusje Bojoh/Joice Mandolang,
Sartja Pontoh/Elvita Lasut and Elita Sofyan/Uki Tedjo.
</P>
<P>
Women's team manager Juniarto Hadimartono said that the team
has yet to fare as well as their countrymen and that they will
simply be happy by scraping into the best 16 places.
</P>
<P>
"The women's chance at the Venice Cup is tougher than the men
because it will be their first appearance," Juniarto said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley's final game
in Philadelphia ended on Wednesday night when the Houston Rockets
forward suffered a ruptured quadriceps tendon in his left knee
during a game against the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who spent his first eight seasons with the 76ers, came
down on his left leg after contesting a shot by Philadelphia
forward Tyrone Hill with 4:15 left in the first quarter. He sat on
the court until a time-out was called six seconds later, then had
to be helped off by two teammates.
</P>
<P>
Barkley, 36, refused to go to a hospital and returned to the
bench in the second quarter on crutches and wearing a cast on his
left leg.
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be Barkley's night in his final trip to
the city where he began his NBA career in 1984. Highlights of his
career in Philadelphia have been shown during all game stoppages.
</P>
<P>
Barkley's mother and grandmother were among those in attendance,
but were brought downstairs after the injury.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets re-signed the forward to a one-year contract on
October 4. During the preseason, he announced this would be his
final NBA campaign.
</P>
<P>
Barkley averaged 16.1 points and 12.3 rebounds last season, his
15th in the NBA and third with the Rockets. He was second on the
team in scoring and second in the NBA in rebounding.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Sues Honduras Over Territorial Dispute at Hague Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua Wednesday sued
against Honduras at the Hague Tribunal for a settlement of the
territorial dispute, Foreign Minister Edward Montealegre told a
press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Montealegre said Nicaragua's agent before the International
Court of Justice, Carlos Arguello Gomez, presented a demand
against Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Honduras' congress ratified on November 30 a treaty of maritime
delimitation signed with Colombia in 1986, which, according to
Managua, cuts off 130,000 square kilometers of its territorial
waters in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
In this treaty, Colombia recognized that Honduras' maritime
limit with Nicaragua at north 15th latitude, while Nicaragua
considers its limits in this zone at 17th latitude.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua reserves the right to "reclaim indemnities for
natural resources that may have been extracted by Honduras or may
be in the future, south of the delimiting line the Court may
determine," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his country rules out the use of force as a means
to resolve the international disputes.
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first territorial dispute between Nicaragua and
Honduras. In the fifties, the two countries had territorial
disputes over la Mosquita region on the eastern border.
</P>
<P>
A decision from the International Court of Justice at The Hague
in favor of Honduras ended the dispute in 1969.

GUANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua)-- South China's Guangdong
Province hosted 48.47 million tourists from home and abroad during

The province earned tourism revenues amounting to 2.621 billion

<P>
During the first ten months, Guangdong received 1.986 million

Thanks to steady economic recovery of Southeast Asia, the
number of tourist arrivals from the region to Guangdong increased
remarkably.
</P>
<P>
With Macao's return to the motherland approaching, the number
of tourists from Macao rose sharply at a rate of 22.58 percent to

<HEADLINE> Original Features of Tibetan Religious Street to be Retained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous Region will
renovate Bargor Street, a bustling religious, tourist and
commercial center in Lhasa for over 1,000 years, to make it a
historical site in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The renovation project is expected to cost 37.6 million yuan (4.
53 million US dollars) and require approximately five years. So
far, some six million yuan (720,000 US dollars) have been raised,
said An Li, director of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Cultural
Relics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Tibetan cultural fund in Germany has provided 2
million yuan for the project. Norway University has signed an
agreement with Lhasa on cooperation in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The Bargor street, located at the foot of the incense-coiling
Johkang Monastery in the downtown Lhasa is renowned as Tibet's
largest marketplace. This street with a history of 1,300 years,
prospered upon the completion of Johkang Monastery, which was
built in the center of Lhasa in 647 AD.
</P>
<P>
Most of local residences along the street are typical white,
Tibetan-style houses with black doors and windows which are draped
with pretty colored curtains. And long and narrow colorful flags
over roofs of residences. The 1.3-sq-km street was designated as a
"historical and cultural center" in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The current renovation includes the maintenance of 93 old
dilapidated buildings and dismantling of 516 buildings local built
willfully without the approval of local authorities and are not in
symmetry with the street's traditional style.
</P>
<P>
The city government stipulates that all new buildings along the
street should be in symmetry with original features in terms of
architectural style, height and colors.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan President Criticizes Extraterritorial Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan President Julio
Maria Sanguinetti Wednesday has criticized extraterritorial
practice by Spain in the case of Chile's former leader Augusto
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the South American Common Market (
Mercosur) summit, Sanguinetti said that extra-territorial practice
alters rules and norms set within Mercosur, which groups Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay with Chile and Bolivia as associate
members.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation "tests the political solidarity" of
Mercosur countries, which are opposed to extraterritoriality that
Spain intends to impose on Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London on October 17, 1998, for
alleged persecution against Chilean Spaniards and their offspring
during his rule.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti urged the bloc to intensify talks on the creation
of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and with the European
Union for a transoceanic free trade zone, following the failure of
global negotiations concerning free trade in Seattle last week.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Balks At Implementing Sea Accords: Russian Navy Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia Wednesday accused Ukraine
of delaying the implementation of three agreements on the division
of the Black Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in the Federal Council, the upper house of
parliament, Russian Navy Chief of Staff Viktor Klavchenko said it
is necessary for Russia and Ukraine to negotiate some detailed
accords to make these agreements more concrete, since the
agreements only stipulate some basic principles.
</P>
<P>
He added that current Russian-Ukrainian talks on the issue have
progressed at a snail's pace, and only two of the 17 documents
proposed by Russia were signed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
No progress has been made on many issues, including the
preferential tariff treatment for goods needed and imported by the
fleet, he said.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing dispute over the Black Sea fleet has been a
strain on Russian-Ukrainian relations since the disintegration of
the Soviet Union in 1991. And it was not addressed until May 1997
when the two countries signed the three agreements on the split of
the fleet.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Develop Memory-Enhancing Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers at the
Shanghai Biochemical Research Institute have developed a memory-
stimulating formula containing memory-enhancing peptide (MEP).
</P>
<P>
The formula's components have won patents in China, the United
States and Britain, according to Du Yucang, the leading MEP
researcher.
</P>
<P>
Clinical experiments have shown that people with poor memories
have sharpened them after taking the MEP synthesis for a certain
period of time, while the memory of others who were given placebos
remained the same.
</P>
<P>
Both the intelligence and memories of children who took the
formula were found higher than those who took the placebos,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
No toxic side effects were found in the course of these
experiments, said Du.
</P>
<P>
Du and his colleagues made their first synthesis of MEP in 1993.
In the following years, they undertook systematic research on the
relationship between peptide's molecular structure and neural
functions, and then demonstrated MEP's position and the mechanism
by which it enhances memory.
</P>
<P>
This finding is of great value for scientists attempting to
develop intelligence-enhancing formulas, scientists here have
noted.

<HEADLINE> Finland Increases Funding to High-Tech Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Research funds in Finland have
been on the rise in recent years, Finland's Statistic Center said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Money spent on research and development (R&AMP;D) in 1999 is
expected to reach 22.3 billion Finnish marks (4.05 billion U.S.
dollars), up 12 percent from 19.9 billion marks (3.6 billion
dollars) last year. The 1998 figure was up 13 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Funding from the private sector is also seen on the increase.
Last year, two thirds of the research funds came from the private
sector. This year, the private sector is expected to account for
15.5 billion marks (2.82 billion dollars) of the R&AMP;D funds, some
70 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 6.8 billion marks (1.24 billion dollars) of the R&AMP;D
funds were spent in the field of electronics and household
appliance alone, making up half of the industrial investment.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the increase in the R&AMP;D funds, Finland's economy has
grown by an average of 4 percent yearly since the mid-90s, the
second fastest growing economy among European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Pays Heavy Price for Entry into NATO, EU: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov said that Bulgaria has paid an exorbitant political and
economic price for its bid to join NATO and the Europe Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
But he said that Bulgaria will not change the policy of
European integration.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Telegraphic Agency reported that Kostov made the
remarks on Tuesday in interview with the German weekly "Der
Spiegel."
</P>
<P>
Kostov said that Bulgaria was one of the countries which
suffered the heaviest losses resulting from the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's (NATO) bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bulgaria's direct economic losses from NATO
bombing added up to 196 million German marks (about 100 million U.
S. dollars) because of the impeded foreign trade and
transportation, especially the blocked traffic on the Danube river.
The indirect losses have totaled 27 million German marks (13.9
million dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government had to readjust this year's growth
target from 3.7 percent to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Bulgaria had provided an air
corridor for NATO planes during its bombing operations, which
caused many protests from the Bulgarian people.
</P>
<P>
Politically, Kostov said, his party "unbelievably lost many
ballots" in the local elections in last October. And the main
opposition party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party, has "almost
caught up with us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reluctant closing-down ahead of schedule of
the first four generating units of a nuclear power station in
Bulgaria, Kostov said it was like "selling a good horse for money,
" and the "EU doesn't know much about East European issues."

<P>
CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia arose to defend its
arrangement for the 2000 Olympic Games opening.
</P>
<P>
According the Age Thursday, a spokesman for prime minister John
Howard said last night that the Queen had been fully briefed on
the arrangements for the Games opening while attending the
commonwealth heads of government meeting in Durban.
</P>
<P>
It was an answer to a challenge from Dick Pound, a Canadian
International Olympic Committee vice president who said earlier
that the plan for the Australian governor-general to open the
Games was against the Olympic Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Charter asks a head of state to open Games.
</P>
<P>
Pound insisted the Queen should be invited to open the 2000
Sydney Games. "The invitation ought to go to her majesty and if
she is not available, presumably she would ask the Governor-
General," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rebuffing the challenge, the spokesman for Howard said that "it
would appear that Mr pound does not have a full appreciation of
how the Australian Constitutions works in relation to the powers
of the head-of-state."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, John Howard had insisted the Games be opened by
himself. After the November referendum refused a republic proposal,
he was under increasing public pressure and forced to leave the
honors to governor-general William Deane.

<HEADLINE> Chinaware Capital Presents Priceless Bowl to Honor Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China has transported an
exceptionally big crafted bowl to Macao to greet Macao's return to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The super-quality, exquisite bowl, ten times the size of an
ordinary one, is inferred to as the "bowl of the century." It has
a diameter of 100.1999 centimeters, with a height of 50
centimeters. This bowl of art, made of old clay preserved for
centuries and special water tapped from a well sunk centuries ago,
has been completed with 99 typical traditional technological
processes, and fired under a heat of 1,300 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The glittering and transparent bowl, with a vivid and distinct
image of the magnificent Great Wall on it painted with great care
by a famous master craftsman named Sun Lisheng, produces a
melodious sound only with a flip of finger.
</P>
<P>
The gifted bowl is made by the Tangshan Huamei Pottery Ltd.,
based in the prestigious city of Tangshan, reputed nationwide as
the "chinaware capital of north China."
</P>
<P>
A Tangshan city government official said both chinaware and the
Great Wall symbolize the great motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Special Regional Administrative (SAR) Government has
signed a special document in recognition of the gifted bowl.
</P>
<P>
Along with another 8,000 pieces of chinaware that have also
been transported to Macao, the bowl will be placed at the official
residence of the Chief Executive of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government of south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous is also reported to have presented a gemstone "picture"
threaded or wired together by 73,800 gemstones as a special gift
to the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
It shows Guangxi's beautiful landscape with a background that
a wild geese flock hovering home, indicating Macao's return to the
motherland after over a century of foreign colonial rule.

<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal
government has completed government procurement contracts worth
160 million yuan (19.3 million US dollars) this year and 40
million yuan (4.82 million US dollars) was saved, according to a
government report released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Finance

He described open bidding as an efficient method for government
purchases because it cuts expenses and prevents corruption.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Improving Ecological Environment for Bird Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest
China recently initiated a project aimed at improving the
ecological environment of Qinghai Lake, China's largest inland
saltwater lake, and turning its bird island into a bird paradise.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve an investment of 4.5 million yuan (542,
000 US dollars), and 44.4 hectares of trees and 1,933 hectares of
grass will be planted in the Qinghai Lake nature reserve in
accordance with the plan.
</P>
<P>
The number of birds on the bird island on Qinghai Lake is on
the rise, and the number of species has risen by 40 percent over
10 years ago thanks to the improving environment.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 4,500 square kilometers, Qinghai Lake is a
nature reserve listed under state protection, and the bird island
was cited as an important international wetland by the United
Nations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that approximately 100,000 birds of 189 species
migrate to Qinghai Lake every summer.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, since the early 1970s, the number of birds had
been declining owing to a deteriorating ecological environment,
increased human activity around the lake, and the lake's dropping
water level.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government issued rules and regulations to
protect the birds in 1985 and again in 1994, and put a seven-year
ban on fishing for the protection of the birds' food source.

ROME, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Vice Foreign Minister
Umberto Ranieri and Vice Defense Minister Paolo Guerrini on
Wednesday expressed concern over the escalation of violence led by
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) against the Serbs in the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
Guerrini declared "the ethnic cleansing to the harm of the
Serbs conducted by the KLA takes the risk of transforming the
entire mission into a failure," referring to the mission conducted
by the international peacekeeping forces (KFOR) in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a trip to Pristina, Ranieri said that "it will
be necessary to reaffirm the principle of coexistence among the
different ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
He said Italy has been worried about the situation in the
region six months after the technical and military agreements
reached by NATO, Yugoslavia and the KLA, noting that he saw "
desolate scene of violence, maltreatment, intimidation against
minorities."
</P>
<P>
The minorities were driven to an exodus by unbearable ethnic
intolerance, the vice foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ranieri called for respect for the U.N. resolutions on Kosovo "
to ensure a climate of peaceful ethnic coexistence and help
organize administrative elections in the near future in which the
Serb refugees could also take part."

<HEADLINE> French Beef Decision "Totally Wrong"- British PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Wednesday that France's decision not to end its ban
on British beef was totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister has spoken tonight to (French Prime
Minister) Lionel Jospin to protest at the French decision. He said
it was totally wrong given that the United Kingdom had Europe law
and science on our side," Blair's office said.
</P>
<P>
"It now means we have to go through the courts to get the ban
lifted in France, a process which everyone had hoped to avoid,"
said his official spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The government has already been in touch with the (European
Commission to ensure the relevant legal steps were being taken
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made after the French government said on
Wednesday that it was not yet in a position to end the ban on
British beef despite intense pressure from London and the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
France cited again their safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
The European Union decided earlier this year to lift their ban
on the importing of British beef. But France and Germany kept on
saying that they are still worrying about the safety.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Accuses One party of Cyprus Talks of making Public Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Wednesday accused one party of the ongoing Cyprus talks of
violating a ban on making public statements during the course of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman's office issued a statement, saying that "
The undertaking made at the Secretary-General 's request by both
sides at the outset of the current round of proximity talks on
Cyprus was to abstain from making public statements on any issues
relevant to the talks."
</P>
<P>
"This undertaking notwithstanding, a public statement
attributed to one of the two sides, has appeared in yesterday's
Cypriot press," said the statement, while refusing to say what
statement or which side it was referring to.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that such statements cannot reflect accurately
what is going on in the proximity talks of which only the
Secretary-General can provide an authoritative version," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore hoped that the moratorium will be strictly
adhered to," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks between Glafcos Clerides, President of
Cyprus and the leader of the Greek Cypriot and Rauf Denktash, the
leader of the Turkish Cypriot, opened at the Headquarters of the
United Nations Last Friday and are expected to conclude on
December 15. The proximity talks mean that the two parties are
within reach but do not meet face to face, with U.N. coordinators
shuttling between them.

ROME, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Wednesday evening that if Russia fails to heed
international pressure mounting against a Russian troop offensive
against Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, Europe could suspend
financial and economic aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a talk here with NATO Secretary General
George Robertson, the minister went on to say, however, that in
spite of the "great worry" about the Chechen crisis shared by the

<P>
"Today, we are beginning to understand that it was addressed to
the terrorists and not to the population," he added.

Robertson said that "the last 24 hours have shown that Russia
is listening and learning. The international community is
committed to avoiding the conflict, which has an international
dimension, a conflict which is a priority not only for Russia,
with consequences which will go beyond its borders."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the one-hour meeting, the
NATO secretary general added that "meetings with Russian
authorities are being pursued at all levels."
</P>
<P>
On the prospect that Moscow will ignore international
expectations and attempts to find a political solution, Dini said:
"if Russia does not respond to pressures from the international
community, this will involve European Union financial and economic
suspension, as had already been done by the International Monetary
Fund."

<HEADLINE> China Builds New Grain Distribution Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China is developing a new grain
distribution network with the aid of the World Bank, a senior
planning official has said.
</P>
<P>
Development of the system, covering 15 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities, is expected to enable China to
increase its grain distribution and transportation capabilities by
millions of tons annually, said Hao Jianxiu, vice-minister in
charge of the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Construction of four grain distribution corridors, respectively
in the northeast, Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, the Yangtze
River valley, and the southwest, and launching of complementary
projects are expected to complete by the end of next year, Hao
said during a recent fact-finding tour to the northeastern port
city of Dalian, in Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The network would bring a revolution to China's system of grain
distribution, from transporting it in bags to more efficient means
which are easier to load and unload, and which are similar to
other grain projects financed by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Hao pointed out that the network will reduce the cost of grain
distribution and boost the transportation of grain from northern
parts of China to the south, and also boost farmers' enthusiasm
for planting agricultural crops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the network, which has 281 sub-projects, will help
increase grain quality and promote grain exports, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said less grain will be wasted during the
process of distribution after the network is set up.
</P>
<P>
The network will also enable the central government to exercise
better macro-control over grain distribution, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Presses US to Repeal Cuban Adjustment Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 8 (Xinhua)-- Cuban Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday reiterated its request that the United States must
repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act.
</P>
<P>
In a note presented to the United States and released the same
day, Cuban Foreign Ministry said the Act "promotes, stimulates and
hurries illegal emigration of Cubans toward that country".
</P>
<P>
The note also requires the United States to put an end to the
permanent initiation of illegal emigration through radio broadcast
to Cuba from Florida.
</P>
<P>
This is for safeguarding the safe, legal and orderly emigration
between the two countries, said the note.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Adjustment Act automatically grants permanent
residence to any Cuban arriving upon U.S. soil, whatever the way
and means used for this, without taking into account prison
antecedents and the committing of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
No other country is singled out in this way under U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
Cuban government insists that if the Cuban Adjustment Act,
already 33 years in force, is not abrogated, United States will
never fulfill truly the migratory accords signed between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the United States and Cuba over the custody of
a six-year-old boy have escalated.

Cubans have been demonstrating in front of the U.S. Interests
Section building in Havana since Sunday, asking for the return of
the six-year-old Elian Gonzalez, rescued at sea after a disastrous
migrant-smuggling bid across the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
"The arbitrary retention of the boy in U.S. territory can only
be described as an act of kidnapping and shameless piracy," Cuban
Foreign Minister Felope Perez Roque wrote in a letter to his
counterparts around the world.
</P>
<P>
Elian was found Nov. 25 clinging to an inner tube off the
Florida coast and then released to his relatives in Miami who want
the boy to stay. U.S. State Department and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service say Elian's fate should be decided in
Florida family court on the basis of humanitarian considerations,
unless his relatives can reach on agreement on their own.

<HEADLINE> Fed Survey Finds Continuous Economic Growth With Low Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its most recent snapshot of the U.S. economic activity, the
Fed reported that continued "moderate to strong" economic growth
in October and November is keeping labor markets tight, which
could lead to wage and price inflation in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that "there were some reports of larger recent
salary increases in some industries and regions." But, in general,
the rate of increase in wages and salaries didn't appear to be
picking up, it said in the survey based on reports from 12 Fed
regional banks.
</P>
<P>
It also said that reports of larger wage increases had not
contributed to a worrisome up-tick in product prices, and "prices
appear to be mostly steady at the retail level."
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey, known as the "beige book", will be used when
Fed policy-makers meet next on Dec. 21 to review the central bank'
s stance on interest rates. The survey is based on information
collected before Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predict the Fed will leave interest rates
unchanged until next year, citing concerns about possible problems
stemming from the Y2K computer changeover. But some still say the
Fed will boost rates in February or March to slow the red-hot
economy. The Fed's latest survey would support such a move,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year to slow
the economy and keep inflation under control.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Resumption of Israeli-Syrian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Wednesday expressed
welcome to the announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton that
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks will resume next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced in Washington Wednesday at a press
conference that the talks will be held between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Frouq al-Sharaa
"at the point where they left off" in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's announcement came after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held talks with Barak and Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad during her ongoing Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the announcement, Barak informed Israeli
President Ezer Weizman of the decision on the Israeli-Syrian track
and Weizman expressed congratulations on Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak said this is a very important development for the Middle
East peace process and the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks will pave the way for realizing peace between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said this is good
news for all Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have been stalled since February
1996. Syria demands that the talks be restarted from where they
were left off while Israel wants the negotiate every issue from
scratch.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for More Attention to African Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan made the statement as he was delivering a speech to the
54th General Assembly session on the follow-up to his report on
Africa, presented to both the Security Council and the General
Assembly in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since his report was issued, "I have been gratified to see an
intensification of the international community's engagement with
Africa," he said. "From debt relief to conflict prevention to
confrontation the crisis of HIV/AIDS, Africans and non-Africans
alike have invested their efforts with new energy and new ideas."
</P>
<P>
"And yet statistics make clear how far we still have to go," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Annan identified three general areas which deserved
particular attention.
</P>
<P>
First, "Africa had to demonstrate the political will to rely
upon political rather than military solutions to problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community, too, has shown a stronger
commitment to finding political solutions to political problems --
notably through new initiatives in the area of conflict prevention
and in the use of 'smart sanctions' to target the leaders of
regimes and rebel groups acting in violation of international
humanitarian law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, "I urged that Africa summon the political will to take
good governance seriously -- ensuring respect for human rights and
the rule of law, and promoting transparency and capability in
public administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Third, "I called on African governments to enact and adhere to
the various reforms needed to promote economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the release of his report last year, "a dramatic
deterioration" is "the effect of HIV/AIDS on every aspect of the
Continent's prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 25 countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, 24 are in Africa.
Recent U.N. figures show that now for the first time, women
infected by the disease outnumber men; fifty-five percent of all
Africans infected are women. The impact of HIV/AIDS on skilled
human resources, already in short supply, has the potential to
imperil any progress in social indicators.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report, first of its kind in the U.N. history, has shed
light on the causes and effects of African conflicts and how to
achieve sustainable development in Africa. The report was seen as
one of the most important reports by Annan since he became the
first black African to head the United Nations in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Welcomes Resumption of Israeli-Syrian Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has expressed welcome to the upcoming resumption of
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, according to the Voice of Palestine
radio.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in the West Bank city of Ramallah
Wednesday night, Arafat said the Palestinian people and the Arabs
welcome progress in peace-making on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the contributions made by U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Albright to the peace process, particularly the
efforts they made in moving the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
forward.
</P>
<P>
He wished the Israeli-Syrians talks a success.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Albright said her talks with Arafat was fruitful
and very constructive and the talks touched upon all aspects of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Albright said, she informed Arafat about the
resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks next week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Albright reassured the Palestinians that the resumption of the
Israeli-Syrian talks would not harm their negotiations with Israel
on a final peace.
</P>
<P>
"We fully understand that the Palestinian issue is at the core
of a comprehensive peace settlement," she said. She told reporters
that Arafat pledged at the meeting that the Palestinian side would
continue the final-status talks with Israel in order to work out a
framework agreement by February next year.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiators have refused to discuss other issues
than the expansion of Israeli settlements, unless Israeli
government calls a halt to settlement activities in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
This was because the settlement issue concerns the final
borders between Israel and the future independent Palestinian
state, according to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright relayed a message to Arafat from Clinton,
who invited him to visit Washington early next year to hold
another summit meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Ramallah earlier in the evening after
holding talks with Barak and her Israeli counterpart David Levy.
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to fly to Egypt's Red Sea resort Sharm el
Sheikh Thursday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Majority Backs New Constitution in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 8 (Xinhua)-- Majority of the Venezuelan
people will approve the project of a new Constitution in spite of
strong opposition, according to a survey of "Datanalisis" company.
</P>
<P>
67 percent of those scanned gave a "yes" and 33 percent the
opposite, while 61.9 percent didn't answer, according to the probe
published Wednesday by the press.
</P>
<P>
The consulting was carried out on December 4 and 5 in Caracas
metropolitan zone, Maracaibo, Valencia, San Cristobal, Puerto la
Cruz, Barquisimeto, Puerto Ordaz and Barinas.
</P>
<P>
60.8 percent of those consulted are ready to vote again for
President Chavez, while 33.9 percent wouldn't do this and 5.3
percent didn't answer or weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
A new constitution drafted by the National Constitution
Assembly - the centerpiece of his radical reform program - is put
to the test in a national referendum on December 15.
</P>
<P>
Hugo Chavez was elected president a year ago in a landslide
victory. He contends that a oligarchy of politicians, businessmen,
media owners and church officials have turned this oil-rich nation
into a wasteland of poverty and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitution was drawn up by his supporters. It
has set off fierce debate between millions of poor people and
wealthy elite in the oil exporting country.
