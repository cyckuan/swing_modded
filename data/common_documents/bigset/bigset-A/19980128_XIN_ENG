<HEADLINE> Hillary Calls Attacks on Clinton Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton
Tuesday called the current allegations of sexual misconduct
against U.S. President Bill Clinton part of "a vast right-wing
conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
On NBC television's "Today" show, the first lady said the
attacks on her husband are part of a continuing campaign
undertaken by the political opposition since the day he announced
for president.
</P>
<P>
She said, "Bill and I have been accused of everything including
murder by some of the same people who are behind these
allegations."
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was a "smear," she said "it's a pretty bad one,"
adding, "I don't know what it is about my husband that generates
such hostility."
</P>
<P>
She said there is a "firestorm" of a media "feeding frenzy"
putting out "rumor and innuendo."
</P>
<P>
Hillary accused special counsel Kenneth Starr of being
"politically motivated," trying to dig up "dirt" and questioned
his tactics in using the "justice system for political ends."
</P>
<P>
Starr has expanded a nearly four-year, 30 million-dollar
investigation of the Whitewater land venture to probe allegations
that Clinton had an affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
William Ginsburg, the intern's attorney, is negotiating
immunity for Lewinsky who denied in an affidavit having a liaison
with the president.

<HEADLINE> German Firms Advised Not To Shy Away from Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- German companies should not be
hesitant or reluctant to invest aggressively in Asia because of
the financial crisis, but rather to move forward and exploit new
opportunities, a leading German industry group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Bonn, the umbrella organization of
German industrial lobby groups and the chambers of commerce, known
as the DIHT, said that German companies should do everything
possible to survive the Asian crisis without contemplating a
retreat from the region.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot abandon the market position that we have built up
over the recent years," the DIHT said.
</P>
<P>
It also observed that opportunities had emerged in Asia
especially for German companies that have local production
facilities there for exports. There were now many more chances to
buy into local companies or to increase holdings, the DIHT said.

</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Yeltsin called for a European security charter

<HEADLINE> Lucent Innovation Boosts Capacity of Fiber Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 27 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Lucent Technologies
Incorporated has developed a system that can transmit as many as
400 billion bits of data per second over a single strand of fiber,
a spokesman for the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The development is a new achievement of Lucent in its race to
meet the demands of phone companies for a more robust transmission
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The system, which delivers five times the bandwidth of current
systems, raises the standards for systems that use a technology
known as dense wavelength division multiplexing.
</P>
<P>
When configured to work with eight fibers, the system can
transmit as many as 3.2 trillion bits of data a second--the
equivalent of 90,000 encyclopedia volumes in one second, Lucent
said.
</P>
<P>
Lucent plans to begin shipping the product world-wide in the
fourth quarter of this year. That could give competitors time to
develop and deploy their own transmission systems.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T said Monday it plans to deploy Lucent's new system to
double the capacity of its 40,000-mile fiberoptic network by the
end of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday recommended that the Security Council consider
establishing a United Nations Peacekeeping Operation in the
Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General's recommendation follows a recent
technical mission to the country to assess the Security
Council-approved Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Bangui
Agreement, which heavily relies on France for its logistical and
financial support.
</P>
<P>
France, however, is preparing to withdraw its more than 1,400
troops and its logistical support by mid-April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the Secretary-General's view is that
"the only viable option for the maintenance of stability in the
Central African Republic appears to be the establishment and
deployment of another peacekeeping operation authorized by the
international community."
</P>
<P>
Annan said the peacekeeping mission will be composed of 1,400
military personnel with a limited duration which should be
completed in two or three months after the legislative election due
to be held in August or September 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the UN chief recommended an extension of the
inter-African Mission to Monitor the Bangui Agreements until
mid-March.

PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that the
on-going crisis in Iraq over U.N. arms inspection should be dealt
with within the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"We are very committed to the role and the unity of action of
the Security Council in the solution to the Iraqi problem," said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He also said that diplomatic consultations aimed at reaching a
common stand are going on at the U.N. and in several western
capitals.
</P>
<P>
The United States has indicated that it will act alone in a
military action against Iraq, if Baghdad does not allow U.N. arms
inspectors to carry out their work by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on Tuesday once again
insisted that France opposes a military attack upon Iraq, and
prefers political or diplomatic ways to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, we should continue political and diplomatic
efforts to find a solution. The solution is an Iraqi acceptance to
cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq
(UNSCOM)," said Vedrine following a meeting with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan in Paris.

<HEADLINE> 1.1 Million Flood Victims Need Emergency Aid in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
said Tuesday that some 1.1 million flood victims in Somalia and
Kenya need emergency assistance and the on-going airdrop
operations should be prolonged until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
WFP appealed Tuesday to international donor community to
pledge additional 12 million U.S. Dollars assistance, saying that
"unless donors provide new funding it will be forced to halt
emergency airlifts and airdrops of food and other vital
supplies."
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here Tuesday, WFP noted that
additional funding was urgently needed to prolong the emergency
operations because the unusually heavy rains continued until
mid-January in Kenya and much of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
WFP initially predicted that the rain which began in
mid-October would stop in mid-December and conditions would
return to normal by early February.
</P>
<P>
According to WFP, the hardest hit areas in Somalia are Middle
and Lower Juba, Lower Shabelle, Gedo, Bay and Bakool districts
where flooding has severely affected 657,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The floods in Somalia killed 1,980 people and 33,500 heads of
livestock, and destroyed 31,000 tons of food stocks and crops
planted on 60,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, food is most urgently needed by 390,000 people in
Tana River, Garissa, Mandera, Isiolo, Wajir and Marsabit
districts in northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
WFP has so far delivered 4,500 tons of food, medicines,
shelter and other supplies to flood victims in the two countries
by airlifts and airdrops starting from mid-November in Somalia
and early December in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. body is also airlifting 500 tons of food a week from
Kenya's port city Mombasa and East Provincial capital Garissa to
125,000 refugees in the Dadaab camps along the border area
between Somalia and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are totally dependent on the airlift because the
main roads leading to the camps are still impassable.

ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece would lodge a protest
against Monday's violation of rules of safe passage by Turkish
torpedoes boats inside Greek territorial waters in the Aegean Sea,
a Greek government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described the incident as "not common and
dangerous" for peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Two Turkish torpedoes boats entered Monday Greek waters west of
the uninhabited Imia island, and their crews fired weapons at sea,
according to Greek Foreign Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the vessels returned to the Turkish side
only after a patroling Greek gunboat warned them of the violation
of the maritime safety rules and asked them to leave the Greek
waters.
</P>
<P>
Greek-Turkish relations have been deteriorated in recent months
and some Greek officials do not rule out the possibility of a
conflict between the two countries in the Aegean Sea in the
future.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Focus on Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank President
James Wolfensohn on Tuesday urged African countries to give
priority to rural infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
African countries should make efforts towards the expansion of
infrastructure in rural areas in order to spur growth in
agriculture, the backbone of African economy, he told officials
from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as well as the Ethiopian
government.
</P>
<P>
According to Wolfensohn, human resource development, the
expansion of social services particularly in health and
educational sectors, are imperative for speeding up economic
growth in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He called upon African countries to encourage the involvement
of the private sector through creating viable conditions for
investors and promote good governance as part of endeavors to
overhaul their economies.
</P>
<P>
It is through the integrated efforts of governments,
international and non-governmental organizations as well as the
private sector that sustainable economic prosperity could be a
reality in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to recent Kampala summit of heads of state and
government from southern and eastern Africa, he said the summit
discussed strategies, challenges and constraints to economic and
social development in Africa, and called on Africa to establish a
new partnership relations with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged the Bank's support to and cooperation with
Africa in its effort for economic up-swing.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn is on a four-day working visit to Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> France Backs UN Peacekeeping Proposal for CAfrica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday backed a proposal
by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to deploy a
U.N. peacekeeping force in the Central African Republic from
April.
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what France wants," said French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine after a meeting with the U.N. secretary
general in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Annan proposed Tuesday that U.N. establish a peacekeeping
operation in the Central African Republic from April to take care
of the security and supervise a legislative election scheduled for
August or September this year.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General's recommendation follows a recent
technical mission to the country to assess the U.N.-approved
Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Bangui Agreement (MISAB).
</P>
<P>
MISAB, manned by 750 soldiers from six African countries with
French logistical and financial support, will end its mission by
February 6 after serving in Central African Republic since January
1997.
</P>
<P>
France is also preparing to withdraw its more than 1,400 troops
from Central African Republic by April as part of its military
re-deployment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic, one of the poorest in Africa, was
torn apart by several army mutinies in 1996 and tribal tension
remains high since then.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is not ripe for a total withdrawal of the force.
The idea is to have a U.N. force which can work with the
government during the transitional period for ensuring an open and
balanced election," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping mission will be composed of 1,400 military
personnel with a limited duration which should be completed in two
or three months after the legislative election, according to the
U.N. chief.

ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the
late French President Francois Mitterrand, Tuesday urged Europe to
formulate a policy in order to resolve the immigration problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Mrs. Mitterrand said that
the question was not whether Western countries wanted to or were
able to have these immigrants in Europe, but to give them the
opportunity to return to their homes without any problems.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mitterrand, also president of the "France Libertes"
foundation, is currently in Greece to attend a conference on
"Racism against Democracy" held in Athens by the Institute for
Strategic and Developmental Study (ISTAME) - Andreas Papandreou.

their mission today was to attack the true cause of this
catastrophe, to protect the people and to offer them their
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
She also said that measures taken by European countries to curb
unemployment should not be turned against immigrants because such
policies could result in Racism.

Mrs. Mitterrand today also met with the Greek leadership
including President Costis Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister

UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Permanent
Representative of France to the United Nations Tuesday reiterated

maintained to monitor the implementation of the Security Council's
resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Alain Dejammet, who is the current President of the

<HEADLINE> State Employees in Greece Stage Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- State employees in Greece staged
another 24-hour nationwide strike Tuesday in protest against a provision
in the Greek government's new tax bill that allows a change in the
status of workers at loss-making or bankrupt public enterprises and
corporations in the framework of their reform.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions in northern Greece said Tuesday that the participation
rate in the strike ranged between 95 percent for Greek post offices
and the Thessaloniki sewage company and 60 percent for banks, Greek
railways and Greek telecoms organization, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
All Olympic Airways domestic and international flights at
Thessaloniki's Macedonia airport were cancelled, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Panayiotis Avramopoulos, president of the Thessaloniki Labor
Centre, warned that if the Greek government continued its reform
plans, it would have to deal with the full force of the labor
movement.
</P>
<P>
Greece almost came to a standstill last Thursday as transport
workers held a similar strike which was also taken part in by
employees at post offices, state banks, electricity, telecoms and
water companies.
</P>
<P>
But the Greek government refused to bow to the trade unions'
growing pressure with Prime Minister Costas Simitis saying that the
government would not withdraw the legislation.
</P>
<P>
He said on Monday that state employees must realize that what was
good for the national interest was also good for them because Athens
was seeking a position as an equal partner in the European Union (EU)
and in European Monetary Union (EMU).

</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass, these agreements include an

medical industry, an intergovernmental program of cultural and
scientific cooperation for 1998-2000 and an interbank agreement on
cooperation in the training of bank personnel.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Angola's former rebel movement
UNITA General Artur Vinama left here on Tuesday for UNITA
headquarters in Bailundo to discuss differences between Angolan
government and UNITA over the issue concerning guards of UNITA
Chairman Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here to the press by Horacio Junjuvile,
acting head for the UNITA team in the joint committee of the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA leadership will soon make a reply after studying the
government program, Junjuvile said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the two sides have agreed on 400 as the
preliminary number for Savimbi's guards, but remain divided on
the time when the number will be finally reduced to 15.
</P>
<P>
The government suggests a term of three to six months while
UNITA wishes for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusaka Peace Accord, the number of Savimbi's guards
will be cut to 15 at the end of the peace process from 150 in the
first phase.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the meeting between Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos and Savimbi in February, Junjuvile said, the meeting will
be very helpful in promoting the implementation of the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA general arrived here last week to discuss with
Angolan government on the agenda for the next summit between
Savimbi and dos Santos as well as security issues for Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that the summit will be of major
importance for the end of peace process before February 28.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Annan's Statement on Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus welcomed on Tuesday a
statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on exchange of
information about missing persons between the Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides told his daily press
briefing that the Cypriot government was particularly satisfied
with the Secretary-General's reference welcoming developments
concerning the exchange of information about the location of
graves of missing persons in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Christofides also welcomed Annan's assurance that he would
appoint a U.N. member to a tripartite Committee on Missing
Persons (CMP) as soon as he was informed of the exchange of
information between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters Monday that the
Secretary-General has been in touch with the International
Committee of the Red Cross concerning the selection of the third
member of the CMP to replace Paul Wurth, who resigned in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The CMP was established in 1981 following an agreement between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides, who are represented in the
committee with one member each, along with a representative
appointed by the U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. spokesman, Annan also welcomed a meeting
here last Friday between Greek Cypriot Humanitarian Affairs
Commissioner Takis Christopoulos and Turkish Cypriot
representative Rustem Tatar in the presence of Gustave Feissel,
U.N. resident representative.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side handed over information on 200 missing
Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriot side gave information
about 400 missing Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held under an agreement reached on July 31,
1997 by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks were listed as
missing after the 1974 Turkish invasion. The Turkish Cypriot side
listed some 500 as missing since clashes erupted between the two
sides in 1963 on the island.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Soldiers to Be off Streets, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean soldiers,
deployed at the height of last week's food riots to stop the
massive destruction of property and looting, will only be
withdrawn after the situation is back to normal, Defence Minister
Moven Mahachi said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists after signing a defence protocol with
the government of Rwanda, Mahachi said the soldiers will be
withdrawn after Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said there
is now peace and calm in the two areas.
</P>
<P>
He said accusations by the western media that Zimbabwe was
turning its army against its people were unjustified and
sinister.
</P>
<P>
''Those people who were looting were not representing the
whole of Zimbabwe, and if our media endorses such behaviour
saying the government should take a back seat and just look then
that is irresponsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''The state would have made a serious mistake if it did not
urgently deploy the army to help the police,'' he said, adding,
''That would have been a serious negligence on the part of the
government because those looters were crooks bent on destabilising
the country.''
</P>
<P>
He said the face that the police were failing to cope with the
riots did not mean that they have failed to deliver their duties.
</P>
<P>
''They did not anticipate such destruction and looting. They
were technically over stretched. In the past 17 years we never
deployed the army to deal with disturbances because there wasn't
such unruly behaviour,'' said Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
The Home Affairs Ministry had to summon help from the army
last week to stop the wanton destruction of property and massive
looting that was taking place in some parts of Harare's high
density areas and the dormitory town of Chitungwiza.

<HEADLINE> US Accused of Pursuing Policy Against Iraqi People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the U.S. of
relentlessly practicing a policy of mass annihilation against the
Iraqi people, particularly children.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday to the Iraqi News Agency, an official
source of the Iraqi Ministry of Commerce said the U.S. was still
obstructing the approval the contracts of foodstuff in the second
phase of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods under the oil-for-food deal with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi source noted that the amount of milk for January was
not sufficient for distribution among children because it was
about 33 percent below the fixed quota.
</P>
<P>
The source indicated that February would be the second month in
a row that the ration cards would not cover the amount of milk
fixed for children in conformity with the distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the delay in the approval of Iraqi contracts
with foreign companies by the U.N. Sanctions Committee which is
dominated by the Americans, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. administration was still practicing the
same policy which had already led to the death of more than 1.25
million Iraqis over the past seven years of embargo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. does not feel such policy sufficient, and is currently
threatening to launch a military aggression against Iraq. But Iraq
is still withholding and is forcefully and firmly challenging the
U.S. hostile policy, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. The embargo, which barred Iraq from exporting oil, its
economic mainstay, can not be lifted unless U.N. arms inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.

PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary of
state Madeleine Albright will visit Paris on Thursday to discuss
with her French counterpart Hubert Vedrine the Iraqi crisis and
the Mideast peace process, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Tuesday in Washington that the aim of
Albright's tour to Europe is aimed at convincing European leaders
the need to launch a military attack against Iraq, according to
reports from Washington.
</P>
<P>
France has repeatedly expressed its opposition to a military
action against Iraq, and has insisted that the Iraqi crisis,
caused by Baghdad's confrontation with the United Nations arms
inspectors, must be solved within the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The United States has indicated that it will act alone in a
military operation against Iraq if Baghdad fails to let U.N.
inspectors to carry out their work by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
France has also expressed its deep worry over the persistent
blockade of the Mideast peace process by Israel, after the effort
by U.S. President Bill Clinton to relaunch the peace process was
disrupted by a sex scandal last week.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac said Monday that he was deeply worried
about the perspective of a relaunching of the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will
arrive in Paris Tuesday night and will meet with President Chirac
and Foreign Minister Vedrine Wednesday on the Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Row Over Possible Links Between ANC, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Shang Xuqian)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A row has broken out over
possible links between senior officials of South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) and crime syndicates reportedly
involved in a string of multi-million cash-in-transit robberies
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The dispute boiled up when a newspaper reported Monday that a
multi-million Rand heist suspect attended the birthday party of
Peter Mokaba, Deputy Minister of Environment and Tourism, two
weeks ago in his Johannesburg home.
</P>
<P>
Colin Chauke, who escaped from Pretoria Central Prison early
last month with five other highly dangerous men in detention, was
allegedly seen at the 40th birthday party of Mokaba on January 10
by a police informant.
</P>
<P>
Mokaba quickly denied any knowledge of the presence of the
escapee at his birthday party. But opposition parties demanded an
immediate suspension of Mokaba and a full investigation into the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Mokaba, a member of the all-powerful decision-making National
Executive Committee of the ANC, is an active politician
advocating the divorce of the ANC and its alliance, the South
African Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Mokaba said he had never known or met Chauke and would not
have known if the fugitive had been at the party.
</P>
<P>
There were hundreds of people at the informal party, many of
whom he did not know, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chauke was arrested in connection with a 12.6-million-Rand
(2.6-million-Dollar) robbery at a cash depot of the joint bank
security company, SBV, in Pretoria last October. He was believed
to belong to a crime syndicate which possibly designed several
military-style cash-in-transit ambushes.
</P>
<P>
He was a former cadre of Umkhonto we Sizwe (spear of the
nation), the now-defunct military wing of the ANC, also known as
MK. He was also a former ANC local government councilor.
</P>
<P>
The indications of possible links between ANC officials and
criminal MK members sparked a wave of harsh criticism from the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Several opposition parties have demanded that the ANC
government should immediately dissociate itself from "friends"
and former Mks involved in criminal activities and act to halt
crime.
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP), the biggest opposition in the
country, said the ANC owed the country an explanation about the
relationship between criminal MKs and present ANC members.
</P>
<P>
NP spokesman Daryl Swanepoel said the Mokaba party attended by
an escaped robbery suspect was but "the umpteenth example of ANC
links with former MK cadres."
</P>
<P>
"The NP reiterates its call for an independent investigation
into the involvement of MK in crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said questions needing answers included whether the
ANC derived funds from crime to finance its election campaign,
and if so, were President Mandela or other ANC top leaders aware
of this.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP) and the Freedom Front (FF), both
white-based opposition parties, also called for a thorough
investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
DP leader Tony Leon said it was "shocking" that ANC members in
positions of public trust, and who handled public money, should
consort with thieves and hijackers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a shocking confirmation of this government's
inability and unwillingness to deal with crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on President Mandela to suspend Mokaba instantly,
pending a full investigation of his relationship with Chauke.
</P>
<P>
However, the ANC said Mokaba was not accountable for the
presence of the suspect in his house.
</P>
<P>
To make the matter more complicated, Chauke was one of the
three suspected armed robbers, all former MK members, who were
reportedly visited by Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi in prison.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer acting for one of the three at the time threatened to
seek an urgent interdict against Mufamadi, who, he claimed,
interviewed his client for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi denied interviewing the suspects, but admitted
speaking to them during a prison visit to examine the jail
condition.
</P>
<P>
Chauke and the five other prisoners, all suspected members of
various syndicates behind a number of brutal cash robberies,
staged a daylight breakout on December 5 with a firearm smuggled
into the prison.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, ANC Women's League President Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela alleged that Mufamadi personally knew some of
the MK members involved in heists, but had failed to take action
against them. Mufamadi denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi Saturday threatened to be tough on former MKs who
should take part in violent crimes. He said the government would
have no mercy whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
The government had "no sentimental attachment" to former MK
cadres who were using their military training to steal and kill,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a special team, which began an investigation into
over a dozen military-style robberies since 1995, at least four
former MK members have been arrested in connection with
well-planned highway ambushes over the Christmas and New Year
period, in which several security guards were shot dead and
millions of Rand stolen.
</P>
<P>
Military specialists said the training former MK cadres
received made investigations extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
Another factor complicating the problem is corrupt elements in
the criminal justice system. Dockets go missing, prisoners are
sprung from jail and car thieves are given blank car registration
forms by those in a position to do so, said Bushie Engelbrecht,
head of a special team to investigate military-style heists.
</P>
<P>
Critics complained that in spite of increasing indications
that police know who is behind the heists, the gangs are picking
their targets at will.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi had to admit that "the government has an obligation
to be inward looking. Some of the syndicates are pulling off
their operations because of a connection with state
institutions."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Paper Slams Butler for Breaching Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily has slammed
chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler for breaching rules of
his work in his capacity as an international envoy representing
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jumhuria (The Republic) newspaper said Wednesday that
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, told mass media
that Iraq possesses biological weapons enough to annihilate the
population of Tel Aviv, capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that at the peak of America's
preparation to launch military actions against Iraq, Butler made
this kind of accusation in order to thwart the Russian special
envoy's mission in Baghdad and to give America additional pretext
to launch its aggression.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy Victor
Posuvalyuk is now in Baghdad to seek a peaceful solution to the
crisis triggered by the Iraqi proposal to freeze discussions or
actions regarding UN arms inspectors' access to presidential sites
during Butler's visit to Baghdad a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The daily stressed that Butler should not release statements
concerning a subject still under discussion and should not "poke
his nose in political dispute" between two states.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that Butler's duty is to present information,
if he has, to the Security Council, not to publish it through mass
media.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton warned President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
against defying the U.N., and Clinton sent senior officials to
consult with American allies in Europe and the Middle East.
Residents of Baghdad, a low-rise city of four million, worried
that possible American air attacks, would inevitably bring
substantial civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
-- Hillary Rodham Clinton charged that the Whitewater
prosecutor's sex-scandal investigation of her husband was part of
a "vast right-wing conspiracy" dedicated to destroying his
presidency. No proof has been offered to support Mrs. Clinton's
allegations, but several figures in the case against President
Clinton have common ties in conservative groups and causes.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Tuesday night presented a glowing review
of a nation prospering and secure because of his policies. In a
72-minute State of the Union address, Clinton was interrupted by
applause 104 times -- a vast relief to a White House team that had
anguished about giving a nationally televised speech in the wake
of the adultery and obstruction-of-justice allegations that
engulfed Clinton last week.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Tuesday night urged Congress to provide
more money to the International Monetary Fund, which has led the
financial rescues of South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia in recent
months. The packages are not at stake, but the IMF's ability to
deter or contain new crises will depend on congressional action.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Albright is to meet with Netanyahu and
Arafat next week during her tour of allied capitals, expected to
begin Thursday, to seek support for military action against Iraq.
The Palestinian leader dismissed a U.S. proposal for a gradual
Israeli West Bank pullout. Israel's prime minister demands
cooperation on security.
</P>
<P>
-- After plunging 43 percent since 1989, Russian gross domestic
product inched up 0.4 percent last year. Behind that tiny rebound,
some economists see the classic beginnings of an expansion. GDP
has risen for two consecutive quarters, the first such
back-to-back gains in seven years.

WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A state of emergency was
posted for all 100 counties in North Carolina because of a fierce
winter storm that dropped up to two feet of snow in the mountains
in the state and in Virginia and Tennessee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Highways were shut and schools were closed Tuesday, while power
outages left 62,000 homes in the dark and cold Tuesday night. Two
motorists died in separate weather-related accidents in North
Carolina, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
A gale warning was posted Wednesday for North Carolina's
coastal waters. Wind gusts of 45 mph and seas of 12 feet were
possible. A coastal flood warning was posted from Ocracoke Inlet
north to the Virginia line.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, a new storm knocked out electrical service for
75,000 of customers in Maine because of a storm that piled snow up
to 10 inches deep and glazed it with ice. Dozens of people were
killed in the storm.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, an ice-storm blacked out hundreds of
thousands of people across the Northeast and Quebec. By Friday,
about 1,000 business and residential customers were still without
power.

PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov Wednesday called on Iraq to respect the United
Nations resolutions on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"The solution to the on-going crisis resides in the respect of
the resolutions of the United Nations by Iraq, with the
perspective of lifting sanctions if these resolutions are
respected and the work of the special commission achieved," said
Primakov after meeting with French President Jacques Chirac in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Russia and France think it is necessary to do
everything possible to keep the situation stable and to persuade
Iraq to respect the demands of the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Primakov, Chirac said that it is in the
interests of Iraq to cooperate instead to confront the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the need to enable the United
Nations arms inspectors to enter all the "presidential sites," and
rejected the demand by Iraq to impose a moratorium on the
inspection of these sites.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that he and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine
had exchanged views on the Iraqi situation this morning. He also
briefed Chirac on the contacts being made by an envoy of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin with Iraqi leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister will fly to Madrid to meet with
King Juan Carlos on Thursday and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Divergence of Views Leads to Sri Lankan Minister's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Deputy Defense
Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte decided to resign from his post
because he disagrees with President Chandrika Kumaratunga on the
government's plan of the 50th independence day celebrations, a
reliable military source disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte, who is also minister of irrigation and power,
submitted a two-page resignation letter to the president Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said in the letter that he decided to
resign because he felt responsible for a massive bomb attack by
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Kandy Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, the source said that the real reason was that he
disagrees with the president on canceling the main celebrations
scheduled to be held in Kandy, the ancient capital of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Wednesday morning that the Golden
Jubilee celebrations of independence, which falls on February 4,
will be shifted from Kandy to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte said the move would only satisfy the LTTE, which by
bombing Kandy city has humiliated the government and marred the
celebrations. Thus he insisted the government should stick to the
original plan.
</P>
<P>
However, Kumaratunga rejected Ratwatte's proposals and decided
to hold the celebrations in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Both the president and the deputy minister deliberately hid
their divergence of opinion to the public, the source said, adding
that Ratwatte's real motive to resign is an open secret among the
military circle. The president holds the post of defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
A truck bomb detonated by LTTE rebels killed 16 people and
damaged the holiest Buddhist shrine, the Dalada Maligawa (Tooth
Relic Temple), arousing the nation-wide anger against the
organization and serious criticism on security lapse.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition, the United National Party, on learning
Ratwatte's resignation decision, has further requested him to quit
his portfolio in the Irrigation and Power Ministry too.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear whether the president has accepted the
resignation or not.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Seeks Funding for Road Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a major port city in
northern China, will require funding of 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars) over the next three years to improve its urban
highway network.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used mainly for the construction of eight
expressways stretching several hundred kilometers, according to a
local official.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the municipality will rely mainly on
state and local government funding, but will also seek funds from
diversified sources in order to complete the ambitious plan.
</P>
<P>
One method centers on strictly evaluating the existing roads
which will be repaired or rebuilt, with a second approach centered
on finding foreign partners to join in cooperative projects to
upgrade existing roads or undertake new construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Other methods include using World Bank loans, BOT (build,
operate, transfer) or granting exclusive operational rights.
</P>
<P>
The plan has attracted the interest of investors from Hong
Kong, Canada and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Hong Kong into Lunar New Year Soccer Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Nigeria
defeated Asian power Iran 1-0 while a Hong Kong League XI side
downed the Chilean national team 3-1 in the 1998 Carlsberg Cup
Lunar New Year soccer tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
1998 is the Year of Tiger according to the Lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will then play host Hong Kong in the championship tite
clash this weekend while Iran and Chile, the two losers of the
opening matches on Wednesday, will meet on the same day for the
third place of the annual two-day tournament.
</P>
<P>
Garba Ahmed scored Nigeria's lone goal at the 50th minute,
after a goalless first half.
</P>
<P>
Chile's only goal was scored by Rodrigo Barrera at the eighth
minute while Hong Kong League Selection's equalizer was put in by
Joakim Grandelius at the 13th minute.
</P>
<P>
Paul Anthony Foster was the local hero as he made it two at the
34th and 89th minutes, which made the local fans at the Hong Kong
Stadium jump for joy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's newly-appointed Brazilian coach Sebastiao Pereira
Araujo fielded an all-foreign line-up on Wednesday, which came as
totally unexpected. He wanted a best possible side ever available
for the Lunar New Year celebrations, he had so explained for his
choice.
</P>
<P>
"If we could play as well as today, we could beat Nigeria,
Chile or Iran," the satisfied Araujo claimed after Hong Kong's
victory over Chile.
</P>
<P>
But he will need some magic if he wishes to beat a much
stronger and tougher Nigerian team, winner of the Atlanta Olympic
Games, three days later in the final.
</P>
<P>
Chile, Iran and Nigeria, all qualifiers for the World Cup
finals in coming June in France, are playing here without their
top draw cards. But their line-ups were still as impressive as
they did in the World Cup qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Nigaria's newly-appointed Yugoslav-born coach Bora Milutinovic
has brought here a young side which he said would be "future
stars". "They might not be very known now, but they'll be after
the World Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic has set winning the Carlsberg Cup as his first
mission on the new job. And he had played down the absense of
some big-name European-based professionals on the squard.
</P>
<P>
He had admitted that he knew little about his Super Eagles
side. "It is impossible to change the style with such little time
as I'm just getting to know the players. But what is important is
that they can all play well," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Reports of UNITA Bases in Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia on Wendesday denied
categorically a report that the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has military bases in its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Keli Walubita said his country is irrevocably
committed to peace in the neighboring country and assiduously
works for the full implementation of the Lusaka Peace Accord
signed by the Angolan government and the UNITA in 1994 under the
auspices of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Voice of America reported on Tuesday that Zambia has UNITA
bases and that Zambezi town in north western province is being
developed as a major supply base for the former anti-government
forces and now an opposition party of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The minister said these baseless allegations are being
perpetrated by those who, for their own selfish motives, are bent
on destroying "the warm, cordial and friendly relations" between
Zambia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's commitment to the Angolan peace process was
exemplified by its support for the U.N. sanctions against the
UNITA as well as a quick and decisive action against a South
African airline company which abused Zambian territory on a
number of occasions last year to fly into UNITA-controlled
territory.
</P>
<P>
Walubita said Zambia did not and will not allow its territory
to be used for hostile activities against any neighboring
country.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Witnesses Revival in Its Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The economy of the island
province of Hainan, China's largest special economic zone,
continues to recover from a 1995 economic slump triggered mainly
by sluggish real estate development.
</P>
<P>
The province's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 6.7 percent
in 1997. Its annual growth rate of GDP is expected to stand at an
average eight percent over the next three years, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Hainan in 1996 shifted its development priorities to agriculture,
industry, tourism, and various other pillar industries. As a
result, the proportion of investments in capital construction in
agriculture grew from 3.9 percent to 5.2 percent, while the
percentage for the manufacturing sector rose from 19.2 percent to
23.8 percent and that for tourism jumped from 11 percent to 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995-97 period, the province's vegetable output rose
from 1.63 million tons to 2.11 million tons, fruit output from
360,000 tons to 390,000 tons, and aquatic products output from
430,000 tons to 520,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Thirty enterprises were reorganized through bankruptcy or
merger, thus making better use of 660 million yuan in capital
assets, offseting debts of 803 million yuan, and increasing
investments in enterprises by 347 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The island, a major tourism attraction, hosted 5.5 million
tourists in 1997, 1.89 million more than the figure for
1995.

<HEADLINE> France Criticizes UNSCOM Chief's Remarks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday criticized the
remarks made by Richard Butler, Chairman of the United Nations
Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq, that Iraq owns enough
biological and chemical weapons to blow up Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
"This is not exactly what comes out of the reports of the
Special Commission in charge of disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM), and
I wonder if he (Butler) has gone too far from his role," said
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
At a conference organized by American Jewish organizations in
New York Tuesday, Butler declared that Iraq possesses missiles
carrying bacillus dust and botulismotoxin which are capable of
annihilating the population of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said Butler's
declaration does not conform with information sent by UNSCOM to
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Butler was not in his role when he made such estimations,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The French ambassador to the United Nations, Alain Dejammet,
who has resumed the rotating presidency of the Security Council,
will express his concern over the declaration by Butler to the
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, said French
diplomatic sources.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader to Visit Egypt Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Palestinian Islamic
resistance movement "Hamas", Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, announced that
he looks forward to meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
in Cairo soon.
</P>
<P>
This came in a telephone interview conducted by Egyptian
newspaper "Al-Ahram" with the founder and spiritual leader of
Hamas, which appeared on Wednesday's edition of the paper.
</P>
<P>
Yassin is scheduled to visit Egypt on February 5 to hold talks
with Mubarak and to acquaint him with the real positions of Hamas
on a series of issues.
</P>
<P>
Yassin called on Mubarak and his government to help make the
dialogue among the Palestinians a success and unite Palestinian
ranks in the face of hard conditions in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said the dialogue between Hamas and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) has not ceased, yet Israeli and American
pressures have made the PNA no serious about this dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Yassin had addressed a message to PNA President Yasser Arafat,
urging him to stand firm against Israeli intransigence and work
together with Hamas to counter Israeli hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent meeting in Washington between Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Hamas leader said it had
been destined to failure, and it was only a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel, supported by the U.S., has closed all
doors to achieving a peaceful solution, and that the Palestinians
have nothing to do but to resist, in view of the fact that it is
the only language that occupiers can understand.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has been violently opposing peace-making between the
Palestinians and Israel, and insisting that peace can only come
until Israel returns all occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
It was held responsible for two suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem's open market and shopping mall last year, which killed
more than 20 Israelis and injured about 200, sending the peace
process into further recession.

<HEADLINE> Bidding System Proves Effective in Central China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The bidding system has yielded
economic results in the purchase of equipment in central China's
Hunan Province, according to local government sources.
</P>
<P>
The province introduced the system a decade ago in purchasing
equipment for capital construction and technical innovation
projects.
</P>
<P>
By now, the bidding system has been introduced in the purchase
of 200 million US dollars' equipment from outside China and of 200
million yuan's equipment from inside China for 180 projects in the
province.
</P>
<P>
An equivalent of some 300 million yuan was saved during the
purchase of the equipment, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Corporation saved 2.1
million US dollars by accepting open bidding for imported steel
wire.
</P>
<P>
Open bidding has also effectively prevented corruption and
helped build clean government.

BAGHDAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hammadi Wednesday accused the United
States of misleading the world public opinion and setting the
stage for an aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi made the accusation in response to Speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich's statement saying that
the U.S. could not tolerate Iraq's acquisition of mass-destruction
weapons and that He would not let his country under threat of
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. speaker also said that both Republican and Democratic
parties were committed to ensuring an effective U.S. role in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi warned that if the U.S. launched an aggression against
Iraq, it would be met with resistance from the people in the
region and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi speaker said that Gingrich is still speaking the
language of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich and other U.S. officials are well aware that Iraq
has not possessed weapons that could threaten the United States
which is thousands of kilometers away from Baghdad, said Hammadi.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has been massing up troops and
fleets to wage a new aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq proposed to freeze any discussions or actions with
respect to U.N. arms inspectors' access to presidential and
sovereign sites a week ago during chief U.N. arms inspector
Richard Butler's visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The United States responded to the Iraqi proposal by warning
of military actions against Iraq unless It complies fully with
relevant Security Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Budgetary Deficit Crosses IMF Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's budgetary deficit
in the first half of 1997-98 fiscal year has reached 6.3 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) against the whole year target
of 5 percent fixed by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the fiscal year starting from July
1, 1997, the Pakistani government has borrowed 170 billion rupees
(3.86 billion U.S. dollars) from banks, non-bank and external
sources, official sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The budgeted overall borrowing for the whole year, however, is
only 200 billion rupees (4.54 billion dollars), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The heavy borrowing was mainly because of the disappointing
situation of revenue collection in the first six months, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the government collected tax revenue of 135
billion rupees (3.07 billion dollars), showing 27 billion rupees
(614 million dollars) short of the target.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the absence of any downsizing of the government,
slow privatization and failure of schemes for the recovery of bank
defaults, the current expenditure has shot out of the budgeted
limits, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
If the shortfall in revenue collection expands further in the
coming months and less than budgeted resources flow in from
privatization and bad debt recovery schemes, the sources said that
the budgetary gap is expected to expand further to over 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pakistan's GDP growth rate, which was fixed at 6
percent in the budget, has been revised downwards recently by the
government.
</P>
<P>
While explaining the revision, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
said that the country would only be able to achieve a growth rate
of 5.2 percent because of slow-down in the large scale industrial
sector and the damage sustained by cotton crop due to heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a 5.2 percent growth is expected to take
the GDP to around 2.7 trillion rupees (61.4 billion dollars) from
last fiscal year's 2.56 trillion rupees (58.18 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Against this anticipated GDP of 61.4 billion dollars for the
whole year, the government had so far already borrowed 3.86
billion dollars in the first six months, which is 6.3 percent of
the GDP, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has agreed to provide a loan of
1.6 billion dollars to Pakistan under a three-year structural
adjustment agreement, under which the budgetary deficit for the
whole year was fixed at 5 percent of the GDP.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
local citizens and foreign visitors poured into the streets
Wednesday to admire the Lunar New Year Parade and Fiesta, a
festive celebration to start off the Year of the Tiger.
</P>
<P>
At an opening ceremony of the party in the afternoon,
Administrative Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) Anson Chan said that she was delighted to have this
opportunity to wish all the Hong Kongers "a very happy and
prosperous Chinese New Year."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong had faced many challenges in the past and each time
we overcame these challenges and emerged stronger and more
resilient. Our economic fundamentals remain very strong," Chan
said, stating that she is confident that "with the concerted
efforts of the (SAR) government and the community, Hong Kong will
continue to prosper in the years ahead."
</P>
<P>
She repeated that she "wishes all a very, very happy year of
the Tiger."
</P>
<P>
The parade army composing of over 15 colorful floats and some
40 performance teams started at 14:00 local time (GMT 06:00) in
Kowloon, Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular pageantry that led the parade symbolized the
numbers "1," "9" and "98" -- one column of red and gold flags;
nine dragons representing longevity and good fortune; and 98 lions
representing the spirit and vitality of Hong Kong and its people.
</P>
<P>
The parade took a 1.35-kilometer route along Salisbury Road,
Chatham Road South and Mody Road to the Urban Council Centenary
Garden, Tsim Sha Tsui East, where its arrival heralded the opening
of the fiesta.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Refer Slaney Case to Arbitration Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) has asked its arbitration panel to
decide whether former world champion Mary Slaney is guilty of
doping.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Wednesday in Monaco, spokesman Giorgio Reineri said
the IAAF's council had decided by postal vote to refer the case to
its arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
Slaney, champion over both the 1,500 and 3,000 meters at the
inaugural 1983 world championships, tested positive at the 1996
U.S. championships for excessive levels of the male sex hormone
testosterone. She has consistently denied taking any banned
substance.
</P>
<P>
Last September the U.S. governing body cleared the 39-year-old
American of any offence but the IAAF doping commission called for
further scientific evidence before deciding whether to accept the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Reineri said the doping commission had since studied
conflicting opinions from experts throughout the world and finally
recommended that the case go to arbitration.

<P>
Together in the parade, some 15 floats designed around two
themes -- "Traditional Chinese New Year" and "Modern Hong Kong" --
were a one-of-a-kind spectacle.
</P>
<P>
Some of the designs celebrated a new beginning, like "The Year
of the Tiger," which features the New Year mascot, and "Bauhinia
Flowers in Blossom," which represents a new era for Hong Kong.
Others, such as the Hong Kong Tourism Association's float,
"Dynamic Hong Kong," "HK -- The World of Telecommunications" and
"The World's Treasure Chest," celebrated Hong Kong as a vibrant
and cosmopolitan city.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands spectators along the parade route were
dazzled by local performers, including stunt cyclists and a
mini-rugby demonstration team, as well as international acts such
as an award-winning mummers parade, a renowned cheerleading team,
a traditional cloth horse dance troupe, drummers from Japan, Samba
dancers, and folk dancers from South Korea and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"This colorful parade and fiesta enables us to share the
excitement and joy of this special time of year with people from
all around the world, as well as promote Hong Kong as a major
center for Chinese New Year festivities," Executive Director of
the Hong Kong Tourism Association Amy Chan said. "Large-scale
events such as this one enhance Hong Kong's image as the Events
Capital of Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The parade was followed by a two-day fiesta, which started at
16:30 (GMT 08:30) at the Centenary Garden. Eight floats were on
display, enabling the public to take a closer look at the
craftsmanship that went into their creation.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, Virginia Yung, Miss Hong Kong, is
expected to take part in the official "Lighting-up Ceremony" which
will not only illuminate all the floats but the entire garden.
</P>
<P>
The more than 20 stalls and booths, with fortune-tellers,
refreshments and arts and crafts, and an array of live stage
performances, created and are creating a lively and fun
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official admiring the party, more than 300
retail outlets and restaurants stay open over the traditional
Chinese New Year holiday this year against that in the past years
when almost such outlets and restaurants were closed over such a
holiday.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that our support over the Chinese New Year is a useful
step to strengthening Hong Kong's position as one of the world's
most popular travel destinations," said a restaurateur.

</P>
<P>
Westpac bank improved 11 cents to 9.83 Australian dollars and

</P>
<P>
The gold index jumped 64 points to 1,126.0.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
continued to gain momentum Wednesday as it heads towards 68 US
cents.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 67.87 US cents, from 67.23 US
cents late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The general sentiment seems to be on the upside," Nick
Volanakis, Colonial State Bank foreign exchange trader said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar would need to keep up the momentum to
break through 68 US cents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the local unit began the day on a stronger note,
aided by a rise in the price of gold, improving Asian currencies
and a depressed US dollar.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said the Australian dollar initially came off its
highs Wednesday morning following good inflation figures and
comments by Federal Treasurer Peter Costello which indicated
interest rates would remain on hold.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello said Wednesday's lower inflation data
was good news for the economy and if it continued would also keep
interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session Wednesday at
85.28 Japanese yen, from 84.47 yen in Sydney Tuesday and at 1.2152
German marks from 1.1904 marks.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Optimistic About Peace Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here Wednesday that peace talks between the government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will continue next month
despite fresh outbreak of hostilities in Maguindanao, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told a press conference that both sides have made
commitments to hold the peace talks as scheduled from February 4
to 6.
</P>
<P>
On the part of the MILF, the commitment was made by MILF deputy
chief Ghazali Jaafar, he said.
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting erupted early this week after the MILF
attacked a government army outpost and Consunji Timber Co. in
Buldon, Maguindanao. The government force retaliated by pounding
the main camp of the MILF with 105mm howitzers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the fighting will not affect the resumption of peace
negotiations in the Southern Marawi city next month.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that he ordered Jesus Dureza, the newly named
presidential assistant for Mindanao, to go to Buldon Wednesday "to
bring about an improvement in the peace and order condition."
</P>
<P>
Both sides are working "for the purpose of improving the
atmosphere for the resumption of their negotiations in accordance
with the agreement on the general cessation of hostilities"
reached last July.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's Need to Innovate Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Bill Gates, chairman of the
U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp. Tuesday asserted his company's
need to innovate free from government interference.
</P>
<P>
Gates expressed the idea while talking with Californian
reporters on the ongoing antitrust case brought about by the
U.S. Department of Justice against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a federal judge ordered Microsoft to stop requiring
computer makers to get its Internet Explorer Web browser software
when they buy its Windows 95 operating system, pending a final
court decision.
</P>
<P>
But Gates insisted that his company has nothing to apologize
for, saying that the antitrust case had not damaged his company's
reputation. He said his company should innovate and put new
features in the operating system.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the reason his company doubled R &AMP; D in
the past three years is that it wants to maintain its position in
the market.
</P>
<P>
"We know unless we do that we will be replaced," he said. "All
the factors that drive the popularity are available to anybody out
there in the marketplace and there are many other operating
systems out there competing."
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, Gates criticized some Justice Department officials
for lacking even a basic understanding of technical issues.
</P>
<P>
Some recent polls had indicated that Americans have a generally
favorable impression of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
But those polls also revealed a broadly negative reaction to
Microsoft's aggressive stance in its court battle with the Justice
Department, a stance that almost brought the company to a contempt
of court citation.

JINAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Looking at thousands of blooming
peony in his greenhouse, Zhao Xiaodong, a floral planter in Heze
County of east China's Shandong Province, said proudly: "They are
my money trees."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, each sapling of Zhao's peony is worth 300-to-400 yuan
(36-48 U.S. dollars) and each of his peony buds is worth 50-to-60
yuan. The Spring Festival of China's Lunar New Year drew orders of
1,200 peonies cultivated in his two greenhouses, worth 300,000
yuan (36,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The floral industry has a long history in Heze County, titled
"Hometown of Chinese Peony" by the state floral
authority. Greenhouse peony flowers accelerate the ripening of
this spring bloomer, making it a hot-seller.
</P>
<P>
Heze currently has more than 1,800 peony greenhouses and 164
specialized floral enterprises, most of which are share-holding
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The county had 119 million yuan (14.3 million U.S. dollars) in
peony sales in 1997, with 3.8 million U.S. dollars of export
earnings. Last year's per-capita income in its Peony Township to
which floral planter Zhao Xiaodong belongs, exceeded 3,000 yuan.

YINCHUAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Experts in northwest China's

resists ultraviolet rays and radiates infrared rays.
</P>
<P>
They note that the new material will be used to manufacture a
line of environmentally-friendly clothing.
</P>
<P>
Tests revealed that the high-quality fiber materials invented
by the Yinchuan Haoge Functional Materials Development Co. Ltd.,
resist 98 percent of ultraviolet rays and radiate more than 90
percent infrared ray. The fabric is nontoxic and nonallergenic.
</P>
<P>
Industrial emissions have seriously damaged the ozone layer,
with the irradiation of high volumes of ultraviolet rays leading
to a possible dramatic worldwide rise in skin diseases.

LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- About 10 more people have been
reportedly killed in the renewed bloody violence between rival
Ife and Modakeke communities in west Nigeria's Osun State.
</P>
<P>
The hostilities, which started early Monday morning, has
extended to adjourning villages, with the Ifes alleging that the
police killed their innocent kinsmen, The New Nigerian reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official daily, seven people were killed by
some group of assailants believed to be Modakeke youths, while
the other three were killed by mobile policemen.

seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
Total toll of the latest violence has been no fewer than 18

<HEADLINE> Howard Allows Free Vote in Constitutional Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
would allow a "conscience vote" for his coalition MPs at next
week's Constitutional Convention, that was believed to boost the
chances of Australia becoming a republic with a directly elected
president.
</P>
<P>
The move comes a week after the Australian Labor Party (ALP)'s
national conference backed away from its insistence that a
president be appointed by the parliament, and also gave the Labor
MPs the freedom to back a popularly elected president.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Party, the ruling partner of the Liberal
Party, still refused to bow to republican sentiment and at a
meeting Wednesday reaffirmed its support for the monarchy, and
urged its leadership to put this position at the forthcoming
convention.
</P>
<P>
Although Howard has warned that a directly elected president
would be a disastrous development, he had told the other 11
federal government members attending the convention that they were
free to vote as they saw fit.
</P>
<P>
Liberal MP Chris Gallus, one of only two publicly declared
republicans in the federal government delegation, said the prime
minister's move could allow the coalition MPs to back an elected
president, increasing the chances of Australia becoming a
republic.
</P>
<P>
While the federal opposition's six delegates are likely to vote
as a bloc at the convention, a spokesman for the Labor's
delegation said the national conference vote had freed up the
party's options.
</P>
<P>
"The conference has given the Labor MPs a considerable degree
of flexibility as to which republican model they support," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Party MPs meeting in Canberra Wednesday
made clear Howard's statement would have no impact on them.
</P>
<P>
"The Parliamentary National Party meeting Wednesday in Canberra
reaffirmed the position of the National Party in support of the
existing Australian constitution," a statement released by the
party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"The party leadership would represent this position very
strongly at the Constitutional Convention."

<HEADLINE> Yunnan's Ethnic Economy Showing Healthy Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The ethnic areas of southwest
China's Yunnan Province have experienced a fast, healthy economic
growth in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the annual growth rate in the gross
domestic product (GDP) in the ethnic areas was 11.5 percent for
the past five years, reaching 49.77 billion yuan (6.22 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This represents an increase of 0.6 percent over the provincial
average. And the GDP increased by 31.5 billion yuan (3.94 billion
U.S. dollars) over 1993.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the grain output of the provincial ethnic
areas grew from 5.83 million tons in 1993 to the present 6.78
million tons. The output of steel, raw coal, sugar, cigarettes and
generated energy have all increased more than 8 percent, according
to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The annual sales volume in the ethnic areas has topped 13.4
percent with 15.36 billion yuan (1.92 billion U.S. dollars) in
1997, 5.5 billion yuan more than 1993.
</P>
<P>
Economists said these achievements should contribute to
increased efforts to tap local resources and to develop industries
with local characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Most of the province's ethnic groups are located in remote
areas with poor economic conditions. To promote economic progress
in these areas, Yunnan province annually invests more than one
billion yuan in the construction of water conservation
projects. Two-thirds of the investment is in the ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
And 37 of the 76 medium- and large-size water control projects
under construction or completed are distributed in the
poverty-stricken ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen hydroelectric power stations are scheduled to be built
along the Lancang River, with a combined generating capacity of 22
million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yunnan raised six billion yuan to build roads to
connect most of the towns and villages. Eight of 10 airports have
been put into operation, and seven of eight are in the ethnic
areas.
</P>
<P>
Telephones and mobile phones also have become readily available
in most of the ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
The improved basic facilities have promoted border trade and
tourism in the ethnic areas and increased their overseas funds,
according to economists.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Plays Major Role in Northwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The output value of the private
enterprises in northwest China's Guansu province reaches two
billion yuan every year.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the private sector has emerged as a major
force in the local economy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The province's 450,000 private enterprises now have 800,000
enmployees and a registered capital of 6 billion yuan (750 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the number of private enterprises and
employees, their registered capital and output value have all
increased by 15 percent over 1992.
</P>
<P>
To develop the private sector, the province since 1994 has
provided favorable terms for private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
For example, the province has reduced the varieties of taxation
from 200 to 33.
</P>
<P>
To help private enterprises overcome difficulty, a special
organization was established jointly by 23 departments in June of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province annually invests 800 million yuan (100
million U.S. dollars) in technical innovation for the private
sector. So far, 120 technical innovation projects have been
completed.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Deputy Defense
Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte has decided to resign from his post,
well-informed sources said on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Ratwatte, who is also minister of
irrigation and power, has submitted a two-page resignation letter
to President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>

the bomb attack by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in
Kandy Sunday morning.

<P>
A truck bomb exploded by LTTE rebels killed 16 people and
damaged the holiest Buddhist shrine, the Dalada Maligawa (Tooth
Relic Temple), arousing a nation-wide anger against the
organization and serious criticism on security lapse.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition, the United National Party, has request the
minister to step down from his post following the incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has been
estimated at 21 billion yuan (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) for 1997,
said Ma Qizhi, chairman of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
This represents a rise of 7.5 percent over the previous year,
but 1.3 percent lower than the national level.
</P>
<P>
Though an undeveloped and inland region, Ningxia obtained 1.36
billion yuan (170 million U.S. dollars) of revenue for the year,
increasing by 12.1 percent over 1996, according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the region's foreign trade grew rapidly in 1997, with
the total import and export volume estimated at 290 million
U.S. dollars, an increase of 23.9 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The region has promoted technological and economic cooperation
with the country's coastal areas. It introduced 110 million yuan
(13.7 million U.S. dollars) from the coastal areas and completed
65 cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
Because of close attention paid to the construction of farmland
and water conservation, the region's 1997 grain output could
reach 2.57 billion kg in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income of rural residents in the region
should reach 1,540 yuan (192.5 U.S. dollars) in the year, a real
growth of some 7 percent, he said. And 200,000 farmers have risen
above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the region's fixed-asset investment reached 8.5
billion yuan, a 10 percent increase compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen company groups have been set up in 1997, and 68.5
percent of small state-run enterprises have completed their system
transformation.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead toward 1998, the region should maintain its
steady economic growth, he said.

HANGZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou, a major tourist city
in China, attracted 504,200 overseas tourists in 1997, up 9
percent over the previous year.

<P>
The tourism sector of the city, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province, earned 208 million U.S. dollars last year, an

<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
celebrated traditional Chinese Lunar New Year with two local
families and some 400 elderly people on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive and Mrs. Tung first visited two families
with each comprising four members -- a couple and their
daughters. They had a nice chat with them on housing purchase.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, they proceeded to two care and attention homes in
Tai Po, "New Territories", and called on some elderly in their
dormitories and the common rooms and chatted with a gathering of
more than 100 elderly people in a hall.
</P>
<P>
The couple also distributed fruits to the elderly as a token to
wish them health and happiness in the Year of the Tiger.
</P>
<P>
In his Lunar New Year message, Tung highlighted the
government's commitment to taking care of the senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
"The government must ensure that the elderly, the poor and the
underprivileged are well cared for and are provided with a sense
of security," he said.
</P>
<P>
In relation to this, the SAR government is pressing ahead with
the introduction of the Senior Citizen Residence Scheme to provide
housing for the elderly in the middle income group. Implementation
of the pilot housing scheme is at hand and targeted for
completion by 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Caring for the elderly is also the responsibility of every
family. Young people should treat the elderly with love and care
so that they would have a sense of belonging and a feeling of
health and worthiness," Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Goodwill Abounds on Unforgettable Spring Festival Eve in Quake-hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in the
earthquake-ravaged Zhangjiakou Prefecture of north China's Hebei
Province spent an unforgettable Spring Festival eve on the ruins
of their hometown.
</P>
<P>
In Luanshishan Village of Zhangbei County, farmers had a
bonfire party together with soldiers participating in the relief
work to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
Amid the deafening sound of fireworks, gongs and drums,
villagers and soldiers were singing songs for the loving kindness
to farmers of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the People's
Liberation Army (PLA), and people's profound gratitude to the
Party and the PLA.
</P>
<P>
Pop singers Sun Yue and Zang Tianshuo hurried from Beijing to
the quake-hit area and joined the gathering, providing an
unexpected surprise to farmers.
</P>
<P>
"I have never had such a happy festival as this in my
20-odd-year life. It is the PLA that has brought us pleasure, and
I will never forget the unusual eve of the Spring Festival," said
female farmer Yang Fenglan, dancing with a PLA man.
</P>
<P>
In the county's hospital, 150 villagers wounded in the quake
also received warm and tender support. Cao Zhengwang, a childless
elderly, was moved to tears when head nurse Yang Jinron brought
hot dumplings from her home to his bedside and fed him.
</P>
<P>
Hospital authorities had prepared meals for the wounded,
following local traditions to celebrate the festival.
</P>
<P>
Many local officials did not get a wink of sleep all night, as
they were busy visiting every family to make sure that all farmers
had sufficient goods and clothing during the cold season.
</P>
<P>
In Shizijie Village of Hailiutu Township, another moving story
spread rapidly. The quake left two brothers, Qiao Ying and Qiao
Ming, without parents. They became orphans overnight, and were
worried about where they would spend the festival.
</P>
<P>
But to their surprise, village officials had prepared rice,
flour and pork, as well as other daily necessities. "We will join
you to celebrate the festival," the village Party secretary Li
Qing told the two orphans.
</P>
<P>
However, officers of a military force stationed at the
quake-hit area sent for the brothers when they got the news. So,
Li and other village officials had to bow to the military's good
deed.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, the Party secretary of the township's court
phoned the military force, saying that the province's Higher
People's Court asked him to make sure that the two brothers had
dumplings on the first day of the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
"We lost father and mother, but now we have more people so dear
to us," Qiao Ying said.

<HEADLINE> Consultations Continue on ECOMOG's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi has started his second leg of consultations with west
African leaders on the future of the sub-regional peace-keeping
force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry release said Tuesday that Ikimi left the
capital Abuja the same day and was expected to parley with
leaders of Niger, Burkina Faso, the Gambia and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
He would also deliver special messages from Nigeria's head of
state General Sani Abacha, the current chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The minister has made a three-day visit to Togo, Guinea and
Liberia to consult with leaders there on the future role of
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, Ikimi will discuss with the leaders
on issues which are central to the security and stability of the
sub-region, and the possibility of reaching a compromise on the
peaceful resolution of the crisis in Sierra Leone within the
framework of the Conakry peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord signed last October in the Guinean capital
emphasizes the reinstatement of the legitimate government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, which was ousted in a military coup
on May 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian minister is also expected to formally brief the
leaders on the recent change of ECOMOG force commander and
solicit the support of them for the new commander.
</P>
<P>
The visit was made at a time when Liberian President Charles
Taylor had said February 2 this year would be the deadline for
ECOMOG to wind up its operations in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The first contingent of 1,205 Nigerian soldiers serving the
11,000-strong ECOMOG returned from Liberia last month under a
phased pullout plan.
</P>
<P>
Another batch of more than 1,200 Nigerian soldiers are due
back home this week.
</P>
<P>
Relations between President Taylor and former ECOMOG force
commander Maj.-gen. Victor Malu went sour over whether ECOMOG
should be involved in the restructuring and training of Liberia's
post-war army.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who reportedly also refused ECOMOG to use Liberia as a
base to launch attacks against the military junta in neighboring
Sierra Leone, made an unscheduled visit to Nigeria late last year
to consult with the ECOWAS chairman over the alleged dispute.
</P>
<P>
Malu was recently recalled from Liberia and replaced by
another Nigerian officer, Maj.-gen. Timothy Shelpidi, but no
explanation was given for the change of the ECOMOG chief.

</P>
<P>
Stephen Kabawu, the chairman of the District Health Committee
in Kasese District, said the kids in camps for the displaced are
the most affected.
</P>
<P>

Nurses in a local hospital said the medical staff of the
hospital were overwhelmed by the large number of patients. They
said they are forced to go off work at 02:00 a.m. instead of at
usual 06:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The children ward of the hospital admitted 65 patients instead
of usual 32, "The Monitor" paper said in its report.
</P>
<P>
The local nurses attributed the high death rate of malaria to
the delay of sending patients to the hospitals.

<P>
LANZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The comprehensive growth of
agriculture in northwestern Gansu Province has played a vital role
in the take-off of local economy.
</P>
<P>
With the infusion of 70 million yuan (8.4 million US dollars)
from the central government, the province has exerted great effort
to raise 290 million yuan (34.9 million US dollars) to improve
agricultural conditions since it was listed as one of China's five
major comprehensive agricultural development zones in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that Gansu, with a territory of 45
million hectares, has the potential to explore 2.02 million
hectares of farmland, which is mainly distributed in the Gansu
Corridor.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, 43,000 medium- and low-yield fields have
been improved and 12,000 hectares of wasteland opened. And 12,000
hectares of irrigated areas were added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the added grain and cotton production capacity
reached 127 million and 1.28 million kilograms, respectively. The
output of sugar and oil crops added 68.77 million and 3.24 million
kilograms. The per capita net income of farmers increased by more
than 160 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gansu province has focused its attention on
accelerating the modernization process for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
More than 283,000 farmers in the province have received
technical training in agro-techniques, and improved varieties of
crops have been used on more than 90 percent of the farmland.

<HEADLINE> Port City in Guangxi Becomes Rising Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Fangchenggang, a newly built
port city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has
emerged as a rising star in pushing the region's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
With a coastline that stretches 584 kilometers, the city now
has built 25 berths, bringing to 8.5 million tons of annual
handling capacity. Ten of them are 10,000 ton-dead weight tonnage
(dwt) berths.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city has invested 2.2 billion yuan
(275 million U.S. dollars) in the construction of wharfs and basic
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The city, also one of the country's four largest bases for the
export of cement, has forged trade ties with 159 ports in 64
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Fangchenggang, which borders Vietnam, is considered the most
convenient passage to the sea in southwest China. Especially,
since the railway linked with the trunk line between Nanning,
capital of Guangxi, and Kunming, the capital of southwestern
Yunnan province, and Qinzhou-Fangchenggang expressway were put
into operation in 1997, more cargo can be exported throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
To expand foreign trade, the city is exerting great efforts to
build markets exporting grain, fertilizer, building materials and
aquatic products near the wharves.
</P>
<P>
Apart from tourism, the city has paid close attention to
developing industries of raw materials, high-tech and
export-oriented processing sectors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city's annual growth rate of gross domestic
product reached 30.3 percent, much higher than the national
average. The annual handling capacity of the port city should
reach 20 million tons by the year 2000, according to the city's
plan for economic development.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Using Advanced Farming Techniques to Promote Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Grain output of southwest
China's Guizhou Province reached 10.25 million tons in 1997
mainly due to the application of advanced farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
This figure represents an increase of 2 percent over 1996 and
an all-time high, said Sun Yizhong, an official of the Provincial
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
Sun attributed the increase in grain output to the
popularization of advanced farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
He said that Guizhou in 1997 spread the use of 83 advanced
farming techniques. More than 10 million farmers received
technical training.
</P>
<P>
So far, half of the province's farmers -- eight million -- each
have grasped at least one farming technnique, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province has built 194,000 hectares of
terraced fields in the past five years, increasing grain
output by a total of 630 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province has added 55,000 hectares of
irrigated farmland.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the agricultural development has helped 5.45
million farmers shake off poverty.

The city's retail sales had totaled 72.62 billion yuan (9.08

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Building Modern Enterprise System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial and
commercial center has made remarkable headway in the nationwide
reform program for building a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The 1,673 chosen pilot state-owned firms, which account for
more than 80 percent of the municipality's industrial asset value
of 648.7 billion yuan in 1997, have maintained a 10 percent annual
rate of increase in asset value during the past three years. The
asset-to-liability ratio in these firms has dropped from 80
percent to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Billions of yuan in idle state assets in 1,000 companies have
been re-used through bankruptcy and merger.
</P>
<P>
Apart from withdrawing government interference in the operation
of state-owned enterprises to make them more responsible for their
own profits and losses, the modern enterprise mechanism introduced
in Shanghai in 1993 has established a system of free choice for
employees.
</P>
<P>
This led to 1.39 million redundant laid-off workers. So far,
1.19 million of them have been re-employed because of the
"Re-employment Program" and social security systems that have been
set up in 95 percent of state-owned enterprises in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In addition, state-owned enterprises began to select
decision-makers through competition rather than accepting
appointed managers. The two newly established talent-search
companies have recommanded 108 managers for state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To specify a scientific measurement of the implementation of
the system, Shanghai has worked out 22 indices, and they all had
been met by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The modern enterprise system has injected great vitality to the
local economy. In 1997, Shanghai's per-capita gross domestic
product topped 3,000 U.S. dollars. The sales-to-output ratio for
major products reached 97 percent. Its industrial sector has
averaged a 14 percent growth rate for seven successive years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is striving to build itself into a base for new and
high-tech industries, which now account for two-thirds of the
municipality's total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, 32,000 new industrial products
have been introduced to fuel an annual product-replacement rate of
20 percent in Shanghai's industrial sector.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Plans to Buy 6 Sea Patrol Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has planned to buy six
sea patrol aircraft worth 250 million U.S. dollars to boost
its naval forces, local Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan was launched following the heightened tension in the
Aegean Sea with neighboring Greece, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a general, who asked not be named, as
saying: "We must have a modern and high-capability fleet in the
Aegean and the Mediterranean in order to control the region."
</P>
<P>
He added that "new sea patrol aircraft will also help monitor
the passage and the type of load of any ship and monitor all
ships, including those involved in illegal immigration, between
Turkey and European countries."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the type of the aircraft would be CASA
CN-235, which is being produced by the Turkish Aerospace
Industries (TAI) from a Spanish design and the vital avionic,
radar and weapon systems will be produced from abroad through a
bidding process.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Turkish naval force sent its 15 aged S-2E
aircraft into retirement after several decades of service.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Greek warplanes and naval vessels are frequently
involved in minor frictions over and in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over several issues,
including the limits of airspace, rights of sea-bed mineral
resources as well as the protracted Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Reduce Troops on Hokkaido Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The first deputy chief of
Japan's National Defense Agency, Masahiro Akiyama, said Tuesday
that two of the five ground divisions deployed in Hokkaido will be
reduced by half in line with the Guidelines of Defense Cooperation
for the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Itar-Tass news agency, Akiyama said
that the number of tanks and other vehicles attached to those
units will also be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on holding a U.S. Marines exercise in
Hokkaido in 1997, Akiyama said that it did not mean the
re-deployment of the U.S. troops from Okinawa to the area closer
to Russia.
</P>
<P>
It only meant the growth of the number of Japanese training
grounds where such exercises could be held, he added.
</P>
<P>
Akiyama had a four-and-a-half-hour talk with Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev on bilateral military cooperation Monday.
</P>
<P>
He described the talk as major success, the Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Akiyama arrived here for a working visit on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Yield of Crops Down in Kenya due to El Nino Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will register a sharp
reduction of maize, wheat, sugar and coffee due to heavy rains
and floods caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, local press
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of El Nino rains during harvesting period last
year, farmers lost over a million bags of maize and nearly
600,000 bags of wheat, leaving a shortfall of at least seven bags
of maize this year which have to be met through imports.
</P>
<P>
The net realized production for long rains was 22.7 million
bags (90 kg per bag) of maize and 2.5 million of wheat, according
to the latest data from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The sugar production will also fall to 350,000 tons this year,
from 390,000 tons in 1997 and 400,000 tons in 1996. The gap is
attributed to lack of cane collection because of poor roads and
cane from farms with low sugar content.
</P>
<P>
Consumption locally has remained at 560,000 tons in the last
two years and the authorities do not foresee a change this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, coffee production is forecast to reduce to 65,000
tons in 1997/98 (October/September) from 68,000 tons in the
previous year because of the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have devastated a majority part of irrigation
schemes nationwide, leaving more than 300,000 farm families
suffering with their crops washed away.

<HEADLINE> Israel Offers Reward for Information on Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel has offered a reward
for any information about the Israeli submarine Dakar which
disappeared under mysterious circumstances 30 years ago, local
newspaper Haaretz Reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai as saying
that Israel is offering a reward "to any person, in Israel or
elsewhere, for information that will enable the submarine Dakar
to be located."
</P>
<P>
The Dakar left Portsmouth, England, for Israel on January 9,
1968. The last contact with the vessel was made between January 24
and 25, when it was in the Mediterranean Basin. Sixty-nine people
were on board the Dakar when it vanished.
</P>
<P>
A search operation was mounted immediately after it had become
clear that the submarine had disappeared, and it was officially
listed as missing on February 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai decided on the reward in principle two weeks ago,
and made the final decision early this week after consulting with
Israeli Army Chief of Staff Ammon Lipkin-Shahak and Navy
Commander Alex Tal. But he did not specify the amount of the
reward.
</P>
<P>
At the annual state memorial ceremony for the missing
submarine held in Jerusalem Tuesday, Shahak said that "Israel
Army has no weightier, more important or more authentic duty than
to bring back the fighters of the Dakar and the other fighters
who have not found a final resting place."
</P>
<P>
Tal also said at the ceremony that he had taken part in
searches for the Dakar as a young officer, but had never imagined
that 30 years later he would still not be able to offer an
authoritative account of what happened.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepali Supreme Court Faces Hard Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Supreme Court is
challenged with three different opinions concerning the issue of
whether to dissolve parliament and call mid-term polls, or to
convene a special parliamentary session to discuss a no-confidence
motion against the present government.
</P>
<P>
At the week-long discussions which ended on Tuesday, eight of
the 14 amicus curiae (friends of the court) and representatives
from political parties who had aired their views supported Prime
Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa's recommendation to dissolve
parliament and call fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
Five favored the petition by 96 MPs to call a special session
of parliament to discuss their censure motion against the present
coalition government while one stated unequivocally that the
question does not actually fall under the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The latest political crisis in the country started on January 8
when the prime minister, who came to power last October, made the
abrupt call for dissolution of parliament to preempt the move by
96 MPs from the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and his own party.
</P>
<P>
After days of discussions with advisors, legal experts and
party leaders over the two clashing petitions which are both
constitutional, King Birendra could not make a decision and
referred the matter to the apex court on January 13, the first
time for him to do so.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions in the court which began on January 19,
some amicus curiae and representatives from the three ruling
parties stood behind Thapa, arguing that the constitution has
provided for the dissolution of parliament as a privilege of the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
They added that Thapa recommended dissolution well before the
submission seeking a special session, so the prime minister's
should take precedence.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that the King must consult with the prime
minister before acting upon anything except matters specifically
reserved to his discretion.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML retorted that parliament is the mother giving birth
to prime minister, any attempt to save her must be credited, and
the dissolution is possible only when there is no other option.
</P>
<P>
Former President of Nepal Bar Association Krishna Prasad Pant
said the King is bound to convene a special session of the Lower
House as long as the House is alive. He also disagreed with the
logic that the King should consult the cabinet even in simply
subjective questions.
</P>
<P>
"A constitutional monarch can't be supposed to act like a
robot, who doesn't work without guidance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Attorney General Motikaji Sthapit questioned the court's
jurisdiction, saying it had been asked to "suggest priorities for
the execution of an entirely executive duty."
</P>
<P>
Several advocates of constitutional law had advised that the
court remain aloof from the act of determining anything as the
issue is "entirely political."
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the nine-member special bench of the apex
court has asked the amicus curiae to furnish written briefs of
their arguments along with relevant reference materials by Friday
before the bench can come up with an opinion for the King.
</P>
<P>
The country's constitution Stipulates that "If His Majesty
wishes to have an opinion of the Supreme Court on any complicated
legal question of interpretation of this Constitution or of any
other law, it shall upon consideration on the question, report to
His Majesty its opinion thereon."
</P>
<P>
But observers say the court faces a really hard choice.
</P>
<P>
The court had spun a cocoon around itself by handing down two
conflicting verdicts.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, it ruled that Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala of
the Nepali Congress was within his constitutional authority to
recommend dissolution of parliament and holding of fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
But the following year, it overturned the similar
recommendation made to the King by Prime Minister Man Mohan
Adhikari of the CPN-UML, ruling that dissolution was not allowed
if an alternative government could be formed from the existing
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Walks on Wire to Celebrate Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Adili, who set the Guinness
world record with a daring feat of walking the wire across China's
longest Yangtze River last year, walked on high wire again here
today to celebrate the Chinese traditional Spring festival.
</P>
<P>
The famed professional tightrope walker pulled off a series of
eye-popping acrobatics on a 120-meter long wire, which was
stretched between two 80-meter-high towering pillars in the
National Olympic Sports Center in the northern Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the 10-minute show came when Adili defied the
gravity by displaying the traditional dances of his hometown,
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Uygur said after the performance that he was
sending greetings in his own way to the Beijing residents, who are
celebrating the Chinese traditional new year -- Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Adili, the seventh generation of a high-walking family from
Xinjing, earned his fame last June when he crossed the Yangtze
River on a 640.75-meter steel wire stretching 375 meters high in a
time of 13 minutes and 48 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Killer Epidemic Out of Control in Kenya, Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) says the spread of Rift Valley fever, a
haemorrhagic disease that has killed more than 500 people in
north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia, is "out of control".
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has spread from Kenya's northern Wajir and
Garissa districts to eastern Marsabit and Isiolo, local press
reported Tuesday. The death toll is believed higher than the
Kenyan government and the U.N. sources have claimed.
</P>
<P>
The vastness of the affected area combined with the refusal by
striking governmental nurses to return to work have contributed
to the rising death toll.
</P>
<P>
The nurses are seeking a 300 percent pay hike citing excessive
work load, poor remuneration and hazards of their work place as
grievances.
</P>
<P>
The fever, which is transmitted from infected livestock to man
through handling or eating infected flesh and which can also be
transmitted by mosquito, broke out in the regions in the wake of
heavy floods caused by El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
Most affected areas have been rendered inaccessible by road
and the true extent of the disease remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ICRC predicted an immediate major "cholera
crisis" in the whole of eastern Africa where already more than
4,000 people have perished since floods overwhelmed the
sanitation system in the region last October.

<HEADLINE> Cities Celebrate Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A warm Spring Festival
atmosphere has settled in nationwide, but with different
characteristics in different cities.
</P>
<P>
Cake, cigarettes and wine once were popular gifts to relatives
and friends during the festival, followed by flowers and food
items, but these are no longer fashionable in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Instead, local residents prefer to send green vegetables packed
in plastic bags. Boxes or bags of clean vegetables such as cherry
radishes, balsam apples, Japanese yams and Israeli green peppers,
at varying prices between 10 to 120 yuan, are selling well in the
markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Beijing residents have other choices to spend the
holidays, such as lantern shows, fairs, dinners and travel.
</P>
<P>
People in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province,
tend to celebrate the festival in the traditional way. Some 60
percent of local residents consider the Lunar New Year as the most
important festival of the year, according to a recent
survey. Eighty-four percent of them chose to have holiday meals
with their families, and 55 percent planned to stay up late or all
night on the eve.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing, a newly promoted municipality directly under the
central govenment in southwest China, new and clean buses took
people by surprise on the eve of the Spring Festival. The city
began to replace its dirty old buses with new ones, and has
converted 60 of the 120 diesel-engine buses to petroleum. The city
will add another 200 new buses this year.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin in north China enjoys a strong cultural flavor during
the holidays. High on the purchase list of many families are books
for children, VCD discs and flower bouquets.
</P>
<P>
And in Lhasa, capital of Tibet Autonomous Region, residents are
happy to have stable market prices. A fair at the foot of the
Potala Palace sells green vegetables, fresh fish and prawns.
"Market prices this year are lower than last year and, more
importantly, you can buy whatever you want," a woman named Luo
said.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Assures Nagano of Olympic Rewards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
(IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch assured Nagano Wednesday
that its huge investment in the upcoming Winter Olympics would pay
off.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the Japanese sport movement, Nagano City
and its prefecture will be the main beneficiary of this long term
investment," he said in a statement on arrival in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to be in Nagano and look forward to a very
successful Olympic Winter Games," the 77-year-old Olympic chief
said. "The preparation of the Games was implemented according to
schedule."
</P>
<P>
Nagano had to build a dozen stadia and facilities financed
mostly through bond issues, which cost each family more than two
million yen (about 15,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total investment is estimated at 1,650 billion yen (13.8
billion dollars), including super-fast rail and road links, with
the central government picking up just half the tab for Olympic
facilities.
</P>
<P>
More than two billion yen (15 million dollars) is expected to
be spent each year in the upkeep of what a citizens watchdog in
Nagano called the "ruins of the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
"Most important, we have enough roads to venues," Samaranch
said as he arrived at Nagano central station by a high-speed
"bullet train" from Tokyo after flying in from Europe earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
The rail service was opened in October as part of preparations
for the biggest Winter Games involving competitors from an
estimated 74 countries and featuring 68 events, both record
figures.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch noted that curling, snowboard and women's ice hockey
were included in the Olympic program for the first time. Some
2,450 athletes are expected to compete in the last Winter Games of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Samarach was also scheduled to preside over the IOC executive
board and general meetings beginning on Friday in Nagano, 200
kilometers northwest of Tokyo.

XINING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
in northwest China's Qinghai Province is expected to increase by 9
percent in 1997 when all date has been compiled.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai, a sparely populated area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
should record a total grain output of 1.28 million tons, up 2.86
percent over the previous year. And the output of oil crops
bearing is expected to increase by 5.88 percent to 180,000 tons,
according to a provincial official.
</P>
<P>
He said the province's township-run enterprises should realize
3.8 billion yuan (475 million U.S. dollars) of production value,
up 25.5 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income for farmers is estimated to reach
1,320 yuan (165 U.S. dollars) in 1997, a 12.5 percent increase
over 1996. And an additional 168,000 farmers earned enough to rise
above the poverty level in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The official said the province's industrial output should
increase 10.84 percent to 11.1 billion yuan (1.8 billion
U.S. dollars). The building industry alone increased 20.6 percent
in output.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province invested 9.7 billion yuan (1.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in fixed assets in 1997, 24.9 percent more than
1996, he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Qinghai Oil Field has proven natural
gas deposits of 150 billion cubic meters and can produce 1.6
million tons of crude oil annually.
</P>
<P>
The province invested 1.3 billion yuan in completing 33 major
technological innovation projects in 1997, up 24.8 percent over
the previous year. At the same time, 355 million yuan was invested
in the construction of roads, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Govt Urged to Act on Long-term Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's biggest seniors
group Wednesday called for government action to reduce the number
of the older and long-term unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
Despite an overall fall in the number of unemployment,
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures produced for the
National Seniors Association (NSA) showed a sharp rise in the
number and proportion of people aged over 50 who had been jobless
for more than a year, NSA chief executive David Deans said.
</P>
<P>
While one in three jobless Australians were now considered
long-term unemployed, the rate rose to over one in two for those
aged over 50.
</P>
<P>
"While things are bad for the unemployed, they're twice as bad
for people aged 50 and over," Deans said in a statement available
here.
</P>
<P>
The December ABS figures showed 67,200 men and 28,200 women
aged over 50 had been looking for work for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that employers in the public and private sectors
have failed to recognize the benefits of employing and retaining
older workers," Deans said. "It is also clear that only government
action and leadership can address this issue and help stop this
shameful waste of talent and experience."
</P>
<P>
Deans said he had written to federal Employment Minister David
Kemp to alert him to the group's concern.

"While recognizing these measures would require a significant
investment on the part of government, NSA argues the cost of

said.

<HEADLINE> Growth Rate of China's Exports to Japan Slows in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's exports to Japan are
undergoing major changes because of the new international economic
situation, a trade newspaper has reported.
</P>
<P>
An article carried by the Beijing-based International Trade
News said the Sino-Japanese trade volume in 1997 grew by only 1.2
percent over 1996, compared with 8.6 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the annual growth rate of
Sino-Japanese trade volume remained more than 30 percent during
the 1993-95 period.
</P>
<P>
Last year's financial crisis in Southeast Asia resulted in the
depreciation of the exchange rates of these currencies with the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the exchange rate of Renminbi yuan, China's
currency, with the Japanese yen did not devalue at all, but went
higher. This created an unfavorable situation for Chinese exports
to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the Japanese Finance Ministry show that the
growth rate of China's exports to Japan in November was 1.3
percent. Compared with September the export volume in food,
textiles, electronics, machinery and other traditional products
declined.
</P>
<P>
Direct investment in China from Japanese firms continued to
fall in 1997. In comparison, Japanese investment in China grew
more than 20 percent during the 1991-95 period.
</P>
<P>
The report called for a readjustment of China's policy
concerning exports to Japan and efforts to create new market
potential to better cope with the ever-changing economic
situation.

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Crisis Has Organizers in Review Mode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 278 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis
and its possible effects on Australian and international sponsors
of the Sydney Olympics have forced Games organizers to review
their budget.
</P>
<P>
Olympic organizers also conceded Wednesday that transport will
form a daunting task during the Games.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Hollway, chief executive of the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), said Wednesday that the
body was not alarmed by the crisis but wanted to take a "prudent"
look at the potential effects it could have on Games sponsors.
</P>
<P>
"So I'm not coming at this from the point of view of alarm
about our financial position at all but certainly realism," he
said. "If there is going to be a problem I would like to
anticipate it.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a new budget coming out. We are very concerned to
stay within budget revenue and expenditure."
</P>
<P>
Hollway said none of the sponsors had told SOCOG they would
have to pull out of their commitments to the 2000 Games because of
the crisis. He said he hoped to have reviewed budget forecasts
ready by the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a transport report released Wednesday shows that
Sydney's rail network will be forced to handle 80 percent more
people during the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Transport Strategic Plan
also predicts more than 500,000 people will travel to Sydney
Olympic Park at Homebush in the city's west on the busiest day of
the Games.
</P>
<P>
Traffic flows are also expected to be heavy, with Victoria Road
now identified as the key route linking the city and Olympic
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Olympic transit lanes will be established on Victoria Road,
dedicated for use by athletes, official Olympic vehicles and
public transport, including bus services and taxis.
</P>
<P>
Olympics Minister Michael Knight said the transport problems
facing Sydney and Olympic organizers were enormous and the stakes
high.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney rail network, which moves almost one million people
a day, will bear the brunt of spectator transportation for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that with the combined pressure of the Olympics
and general daily commuting it will move 1.8 million people each
24 hours during the Games.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Ready for Balloon Adventure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Europeans were preparing
Wednesday to set off from Switzerland in the quest to circle the
world non-stop in a balloon, spokesman Gerard Sermier said.
</P>
<P>
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten
from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, were
planning to depart around 8:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) from Chateau d'Oex,
in western Switzerland, aboard the Breitling Orbiter II.
</P>
<P>
The balloonists' plan is to soar quickly to nearly 8,000 meters
and drift towards Italy and Greece, reaching the Middle East on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
From there, they hope to ride jetstreams that should move them
along in an east-bound direction at around 200 kilometers an hour
at 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
If luck holds, Brietling Orbiter II will complete its
globe-girdling adventure in 10 to 20 days.
</P>
<P>
British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who plans to set off from
Morocco in a few days in a rival attempt to circle the world,
wished the Brietling Orbiter II team good luck.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Withdraw Troops from Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
withdrawing soldiers from law enforcement duties in Harare and
nearby Chitungwiza where they had helped end violence and looting
following last week's food riots.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday, a government spokesman said normalcy
had returned to both Harare and Chitungwiza and that the army
would be pulled out.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, details from the Zimbabwe National Army, who had
been deployed to assist the Zimbabwe Republic Police will now be
withdrawn from the streets but will remain on standby and can be
redeployed should the need arise," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The police, on the other hand, will remain on the ground to
continue with investigations as the process of apprehending
culprits and recovering looted property continues, added the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The army came to the aid of the police, who were outnumbered
and were encountering logistical problems in quelling the wave of
violence and looting which swept through Harare's high-density
suburbs and Chitungwiza on Monday and Tuesday last week.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "both the army and police wish to
reiterate that no single shot was fired by the army in the entire
exercise and extend their deep appreciation for the cooperation
received from the public."
</P>
<P>
Last week's violent food riots which brought business to a
halt in Harare and Chitungwiza, have seen about 2,575 people
being arrested for looting and public violence during the
disturbances which later spilled, but to a much lesser extent, to
other centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
About 1,748 suspects have so far been brought before the
courts. To cope with the increasing number of suspects being
brought before the courts, special arrangements have been made to
allow courts to sit as late as 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
From Monday to Wednesday, thousands of residents in Harare,
Chitungwiza and other small towns staged demonstrations in
protest against recent prices increases.
</P>
<P>
Some of them looted shops, stoned cars and destroyed property,
causing millions of Dollars losses.

MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) announced Wednesday that it has settled its conflict
with the former rebel Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in the
Southern Philippines after seven people were killed in a fighting.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine News Agency reports, MILF vice-chairman
Ghadzali Jaafar personally initiated the settlement together with
his MNLF counterpart Randy Karon.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the Moro parties agreed to send a letter to the
government army, requesting the army's Sixth Infantry Division in
Maguindanao, the Southern Philippines, not to intervene anymore
when future conflicts take place between the MILF and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an army soldier, five MILF rebels and one civilian
were killed after MILF rebels ambushed government troops who tried
to intervene in fighting between the two Moro groups.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the government troops fired back with cannon
shells, killing five MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF and the government signed a peace accord in September
1996 and part of MNLF forces has been integrated into the army and
the national police. But the MILF rejected the peace accord and is
continuing its fighting for an independent Muslim state in the
Southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> ADB Extends Loans to Indonesia, Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Wednesday approved a 32 million U.S. dollar loan to Indonesia for
a conservation project, and two loans of 24.5 million dollars to
the Philippines to help its disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the Manila-based bank said
prospects for conservation of biodiversity and improvement of the
livelihood of over 120,000 people will be greatly enhanced with a
Central Sulawesi Integrated Area Development and Conservation
Project in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The bank's loan to Indonesia will come from its ordinary
capital resources and will be repayable within 25 years, including
a grace period of 7 years, it said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate press statement, the ADB said half of the
Philippines' most disadvantaged and vulnerable children under six
will benefit from an Early Childhood Development Project, for
which two loans totaling 24.5 million dollars will be granted by
the bank.
</P>
<P>
The project will substantially lower infant and child
mortality, malnutrition and primary school dropout rates among 2.7
million children in the regions of Western Visayas, Central
Visayas and Central Mindanao, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, the total project cost is estimated at 65
million dollars. Apart from the 24.5 million dollars, the World
Bank will provide 22.4 million dollars, local government units 6.4
million dollars and the national government 11.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loans will be repayable over 25 years, including a
grace period of five years.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Into Semi-finals in Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Martina Hingis
swept past fifth seed Mary Pierce 6-2, 6-3 Wednesday to set up a
semi-final showdown on Thursday at Australian Open tennis
tournament against 10th seeded German Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
Today's 59 minute match was almost flawless display for Hingis
and Pierce's too many unforced errors cost her chance into the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Huber became the first player to enter the semi-finals of the
tournament in Melbourne today with a victory over Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario.
</P>
<P>
The 10th-seeded German won 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 and probably ended
any chance the Spaniard had of winning an Australian championship.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, who was making her eighth consecutive
appearance in Australian Open, has played in three semi-finals and
two finals.
</P>
<P>
Today's loss, though, made it three years in a row that the
seventh seed has failed to advance beyond the quarters.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 23 years and without a grand slam title to her
credit, Huber must also have only limited opportunities.
</P>
<P>
But she has the best chance of her career to win one in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Huber meets top seed Martina Hingis in tomorrow's semi-final
after the Swiss teen beat Frenchwoman Mary Pierce 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The German always had the upper hand today and said she adopted
new tactics after winning only one match in her previous 11
meetings with Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
"Today I played the way I wanted to from the beginning. I was
patient and waited for my chances," Huber said.
</P>
<P>
The pair battled for almost two hours before Huber grabbed the
third of her match point opportunities, settling the issue with a
perfectly placed backhand into the corner.
</P>
<P>
For Sanchez Vicario, the defeat left the impression that she
may have lost the edge to her two greatest assets, speed and
determination.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish No.1 won her three grand slam titles by grinding
down her opponents and hunting down every ball.
</P>
<P>
In her past year, though, more of them are slipping by out of
reach.

<HEADLINE> Rios out duels Berasategui for semifinal berth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Ninth seed Marcelo Rios of
Chile outgunned Spanish baseliner Alberto Berasategui in four sets
at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Wednesday to reach his
first grand slam semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old left-hander from Santiago got off to a slow
start against the Spanish dangerman but quickly regained the
initiative to complete an impressive 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4, 6-0 win.
</P>
<P>
Rios struggled for accuracy in the first set but soon found
range with his forehands and backhands from the baseline, pushing
the 1994 French Open runner-up from one side of Melbourne Park's
centre court to another.
</P>
<P>
Berasategui had been in giant-killing form earlier in the
tournament, toppling second seed Patrick Rafter of Australia and
former world number one Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
The pony-tailed Rios made the quarter-finals in Melbourne and
at the U.S. Open last year. He and Czech veteran Petr Korda are
the only two seeded players left in the Open men's draw.
</P>
<P>
World number eight Rios will meet either Nicolas Kiefer of
Germany or Frenchman Nicolas Escude in the semifinals, the two
unseeded Europeans due to meet in the last quarter-final later on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not to Declare Debt Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will not follow
Indonesia by declaring a debt moratorium, cabinet members have
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has announced a temporary freeze on servicing a
corporate debt estimated at 66 billion dollars, raising fears that
Thailand would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet met on Tuesday to work out steps following
Indonesia's decision, which prompted Standard and Poor's, the U.S.
ratings agency, to downgrade 19 Indonesian Corporations, according
to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Thai cabinet members made it clear that events in Indonesia
would not affect Thailand's public debt standing and the ability
to repay. Thailand' foreign debt stands at about 90 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
If there were to be any impact at all, "It would only be
minimal," a cabinet member was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Mimmanhaeminda said Indonesia's
debt crisis would not dampen investment confidence in Thailand
which was in better shape than Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The weight of the crisis hitting the two countries was clearly
distinguishable, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
The baht had depreciated 100 percent against the dollar while
the Indonesian rupiah downgraded 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand remained committed to the fulfillment of IMF
loan obligations despite the difficulty Thailand was facing.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
ease a key condition for a 17.2-billion-dollar rescue package
which requires a budget surplus equivalent to one percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the IMF said the organization has agreed to
ease key conditions to reflect Thailand's actual economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials will hold talks with an IMF team from February
2-14 for a quarterly review of progress in implementing the
package.

<HEADLINE> LTTE Launches Simultaneous Attacks on Military Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Large numbers of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels launched three attacks on
military camps simultaneously in Eastern Sri Lanka Tuesday night,
military sources said Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Government troops repulsed the attack on one of the camps, an
Army brigade command, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of casualties yet. But the sources
said the rebels involved in the attacks were in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came only one day after the government announced it
outlawed the LTTE with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to outlaw the LTTE followed Sunday
morning's fatal bomb explosion in Kandy, a central mountain city
where the 50th independence day celebrations had been scheduled to
take place on February 4.
</P>
<P>
However, the government decided this morning that the main
function in Kandy will be shifted to Colombo, while the planned
religious activities to mark the day will go ahead in Kandy.
</P>
<P>
A government official told Xinhua that the cabinet is holding a
meeting on the issue of celebration arrangements in Colombo.

<HEADLINE> Croatia President Pleased With Achievements in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 27 (Xinhua) -- President Franjo Tudjman of the
Republic of Croatia Tuesday has spoken highly of the government's
achievements last year.
</P>
<P>
"Last year has been marked by the full achievement of the
fundamental goal of Croatian national and State policy," Tudjman
said at the beginning of his report.
</P>
<P>
He said 1997 saw the country maintaining stability in all
aspects, with the living standards of people improved and its
economy rejuvenated and developing.
</P>
<P>
The most important achievement of 1997 is the unification of
the country with its eastern part through peaceful measures, he
stressed. The unification fulfilled the dream of the people for
one century.
</P>
<P>
These achievements improved Croatia's international prestige
remarkably, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tudjman said
his country's principle is that the Washington and Dayton
Agreements must be realized to "assure a truly constituent and
equal position to the Croatian people" in the republic, and to
protect the national interests of his country.
</P>
<P>
"In relation to current integration trends in Europe, and to
decisions regarding the expansion of Euro-Atlantic institutions,
Croatia should put every possible effort into becoming an integral
part of such developments as soon and as extensively as possible,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
Croatia was also seeking a membership of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the World Trade Organization, he said.

The main target of the country for this year is promote
stability and confidence in the country and renovate the economy
and improve the country's international status, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Add More Teachers to Shrink Classes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton said on Tuesday that his nation will add 100,000 new
teachers to reduce class sizes in schools in an effort to achieve
his 21st education plan.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed a school construction tax cut to help
communities modernize, or build, 5,000 schools to meet the smaller
class requirement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the proposal in his annual State of the Union
address delivered to Congress Tuesday night. In the speech, the
president emphasized that his administration would regard
education as the nation's highest priority in an effort to meet
the requirements of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In last year's State of the Union address, Clinton stressed
that education was the nation's highest priority and he laid out a
ten-point plan to upgrade the nation's education.
</P>
<P>
His administration and Congress have worked out plans to
increase public school choice by adding 3,000 charter schools,
connecting classrooms to the information superhighways, increasing
scholarships, and launching programs to help schools make sure
every school child can read.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Saving Social Security Before Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton delivered a State of the Union address Tuesday evening,
calling on Congress to "save Social Security first" before
spending any budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight I propose we reserve 100 percent of the surplus --
that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the
measures necessary to strengthen the Social Security system for
the 21st century," he said in his annual nationwide address.
</P>
<P>
To promote a solution to Social Security's problems, Clinton
proposed a White House conference in December, which would allow
him to spend the year talking about saving Social Security while
delaying decisions until after the mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the country's economic situation, Clinton noted,
"the state of our union is strong" with the lowest unemployment in
24 years and the lowest inflation in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Congress to raise the minimum wage from
5.15 U.S. dollars an hour at present, but did not specify by how
much.
</P>
<P>
"Because these times are good, we can afford to take one
simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to
provide for their families," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged raising the price of cigarettes by 1.50
dollars a pack to deter teen smoking, and said tobacco companies
should be slapped with penalties "if they continue marketing to
kids".
</P>
<P>
He urged 21.7 billion dollars for a child-care initiative,
doubling to two million the number of children eligible for
child-care subsidies.
</P>
<P>
He proposed 7.3 billion dollars to hire 100,000 teachers, with
a goal of reducing class sizes in grades one to three. He also
urged tax credits to pay interest on nearly 22 billion dollars in
bonds to build and renovate public schools.
</P>
<P>
With the economy booming and the government collecting more tax
revenue, Clinton claimed that he would submit a balanced budget
for 1999, three years earlier than required in his deal with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the
budget this year, four years ahead of schedule," he said.
</P>
<P>
With Asia undergoing a financial crisis, Clinton requested 18
billion dollars to boost the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He
also asked for more than one billion dollars to pay the U.S. debt
to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Medicare Extension to Aged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton said on Tuesday Congress should let Americans between
the ages of 55 and 65 buy into the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union address, Clinton said: "It won't add
a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will
be priceless."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also wanted Congress to extend tax deductions for
working families.
</P>
<P>
He said if lawmakers pass his plan, a family of four with an
income of 35,000 dollars and high child care costs would not pay
anything in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The president proposed that Congress extend the Family and
Medical Leave Act to cover an additional 10 million workers. He
said lawmakers should extend the law to give parents time off for
parent-teacher conferences and doctor's visits.
</P>
<P>
"We must help parents protect their children from the gravest
health threat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking spread
by multi-million dollar marketing campaigns," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Congress to pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation
that will improve public health, protect tobacco farmers, and
change the way tobacco companies do business forever.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on Congress to raise the price of cigarettes by
up to 1.50 dollars a pack over the next 10 years, with penalties
if tobacco companies continue marketing to children.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Congress to Support his Foreign Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
asked Congress on Tuesday to support his foreign policies ranging
from the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to paying debts to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent
to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members
of NATO," said Clinton in his annual State of the Union address.
"I ask the Senate to say yes to them -- our new allies."
</P>
<P>
"By taking in new members and working closely with new
partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure
that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st Century," said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Last July at its special summit in Madrid, NATO decided to
accept Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic as new members by
1999. The decision needs to be approved by a two-thirds majority
vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged Congress to agree to paying off some 1.4
billion U.S. dollars dues it owes to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"It's long past time to make good on our debt to the United
Nations. More and more, we are working with other nations to
achieve common goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we want America to lead, we must set a good example. As we
see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can share our
burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are
actually enriched, not impoverished, by our increasing
interdependence with other nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a legislation last year, Congress voted for paying the
arrears to the U.N. with conditions setting benchmarks for the
reforms of the world body.
</P>
<P>
The conditions were opposed by the Clinton administration and
strongly criticized by U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Bosnia, Clinton appealed Congress to support
further deployment of U.S. troops in the region. He decided last
month that the GIs will continue to stay in Bosnia beyond the
deadline of June when mandate of the current Stabilization Forces
expires.
</P>
<P>
"I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and
their mission in Bosnia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The progress is unmistakable -- but not yet irreversible. To
take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of
American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in
June," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the need to combat terrorists, international
criminals and drug traffickers, Clinton also urged Congress,
saying "join me in pursuing an ambitions agenda to reduce the
serious threat of weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he asked the Senate to ratify the comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
"By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the
development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more
difficult for non-nuclear states to build them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed in September 1996 and 149 nations have
signed it as of January 1998, but only eight states have ratified
it. It will enter into force after 44 major countries including
the U.S. have ratified the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Finance Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka on Wednesday tendered his resignation to Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto as a token of responsibility for the arrests of
two top ministry banking inspectors on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka submitted a resignation letter at the prime
minister's official residence, the media reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto will handle the duties of finance minister until
Mitsuzuka's successor is named, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka's decision to resign came amidst tense political
confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties following
the arrest of two ministry inspectors suspected of having taken
bribes from banks in exchanges for tip-offs about ministry
inspections of those banks.
</P>
<P>
Diet (parliament) debates came to a halt Tuesday as opposition
parties demanded that Mitsuzuka step down.
</P>
<P>
After Mitsuzuka announced his resignation, opposition parties
agreed with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) not to
boycott Diet deliberations on a supplementary budget for fiscal
1997 and other financial bills the government hopes will bolster
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka had been in charge of the "Big Bang" liberalization
of Japan's financial sector, one of the six areas of reform
initiated by Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
His resignation is widely viewed as a blow to Hashimoto, as the
prime minister has been struggling to stabilize the country's
financial system and stimulate the sluggish economy.

</P>
<P>
"We hear endless discussions on exchange rates and interest
rates. We hear the views of bankers and economists. It is time we

sectors of society are affected, especially the poor and the
marginalized," an organizer said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Identifies Potential Striking Targets on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon on Tuesday
identified potential targets on Iraq once the Clinton
administration decides to strike against Iraq for its refusal of
abiding by U.N. resolutions on destroying weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military planners have been looking for some time at
sites "of importance to (Iraqi President) Saddam (Hussein),"
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Those sites, apart from suspected chemical and biological
weapons sites, would include his premier military units, the
Republican Guard, the special Republican Guard units that provide
security forces for his regime, and the units that gather
intelligence and send out commands to forces in the field, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Should Saddam decide to hit back with his suspected arsenal
of chemical and biological weapons, U.S. response would be
"decisive and devastating," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether that might include the use of nuclear weapons,
Bacon said the United States has not "ruled anything in or out in
this matter."
</P>
<P>
All the potential military punishment on Iraq would be done
through air strikes, Bacon said. And attacks by ground troops
would not be encouraged, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accused of Seeking Continued Dominance in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The People's Party of
Panama accused the United States Tuesday of seeking to continue
its dominance of this Central American country into the 21st
century by establishing a multilateral anti-drug center.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the left wing People's Party said the
Multilateral Antidrug Center (CMA) is a violation of national
sovereignty and "a new model of the dominant U.S. geopolitical
stance towards Latin America cloaked as a multinational fight
against drug trafficking."
</P>
<P>
It said the CMA will be a replacement of the old Southern
Command -- the U.S. army for Latin America -- which has been
transferred from Panama to Miami.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Command was withdrawn in compliance with the
Torrijos-Carter treaties signed in 1977. These also mandated the
return of the Panama Canal and other U.S. facilities to Panama by
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing party statement said that the objective of the
CMA is to be a multinational, political-military presence in
Panama, but it is actually one in which the U.S. is the
predominating force.
</P>
<P>
"In reality, mankind's interest in fighting the drug scourge,
which we also support, is being deceptively used by the U.S.,
utilizing this center to continue to occupy Panamanian territory
for purposes of dominance."
</P>
<P>
The party stated that the negotiations for the CMA have
designed a political-military complex in the context of the latest
U.S. geopolitical and national security doctrines to maintain
American supremacy into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Panama and the United States reached an agreement late last
year on the principle of establishing the CMA from the year 2000
on the Americans' Howard Air Force Base located in the Pacific
section of the Panama Canal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Keen on Touring Abroad During Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- More and more better-off
Chinese tend to spend the traditional Spring Festival, or Chinese
Lunar New Year, by touring overseas.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Guangzhou, capital of south China's booming
Guangdong Province, is a typical example.
</P>
<P>
Today, the first day of the festival's holidays, a 60-member
group, organized by the Guangdong International Tourism Agency, is
leaving for Australia and New Zealand on a visit. And tomorrow,
another 10-odd groups of holiday makers will fly to Singapore,
Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 100,000 people of the city will go
elsewhere for the festival, 40 percent of whom plan to go abroad,
with the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia being their
major destinations.
</P>
<P>
The city's urbanites prefer to tour Thailand this year, as the
charge of a five-day visit there has been cut from more than 4,000
Hong Kong dollars last year to some 2,800 now.
</P>
<P>
As a result, all flights to Thailand are full. So, China
Southern Airlines has arranged an extra flight on Thursday. And
its only air route to the United States and Australia that was
opened last year has also reported a marked rise of passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Airlines has put 30 planes into operation, including eight
Boeing-777s and 10 Airbus-320s, sources said. enditem

Festival greetings to Chinese people of various ethnic groups, and
compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as all
overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese origin residing

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony on the eve of the Spring Festival, the

opening, as well as in various other endeavors, during 1997. He
noted that the national economy witnessed steady and rapid growth
accompanied by a low inflation rate, with major economic indices

</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks IMF Program Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson has formally asked the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to extend until the end of March the coverage of the
Extended Fund Facility program (EFF) to allow lawmakers to pass
the oil deregulation program.
</P>
<P>
According to the Manila Bulletin, Singson Tuesday sent a letter
to the IMF, formalizing the country's intention to ask for more
time to complete its commitments made under the EFF program.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the extension period was enough for the congress
to enact an oil industry deregulation law -- one of the
prerequisites for exiting from IMF's tutelage. The IMF requires
immediate full deregulation.
</P>
<P>
The new oil deregulation law was already approved by both
chambers of the congress. It is now with the bicameral conference
committee which is reconciling conflicting provisions in the
versions approved by the senate and the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The EFF program was started in July 1994 and was supposed to
expire last June. It was extended to December 31, 1997 because
another policy requirement, the comprehensive tax reform program,
was not yet approved by the congress at that time.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that even if the bicameral conference committee
approves the new oil deregulation law soon, the IMF would need
time to prepare the papers for the EFF executive board.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is likely to get 345 million U.S. dollars in
financial assistance from the IMF if the executive board decides
that the country has substantially complied with the terms of the
EFF program.

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested for Forgery of Official Documents in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A Costa Rican and a Cuban were
arrested in Costa Rica for allegedly forging the signature of the
Minister of Public Security to issue visas to Cubans who want to
leave their country, authorities said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Carlos Arias said that 12 false signatures of
Minister Laura Chichilla had been detected and that 25 others were
being investigated.
</P>
<P>
The arrested Costa Rican citizen was only identified by the
last name of Alfaro, while the police did not release any name for
the Cuban.
</P>
<P>
Other people may possibly be involved, including an immigration
official, Arias said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two weeks ago, the Minister of Public Security, Laura
Chicilla, had reported the increased number of Cubans entering the
country, through suspicious marriages with Costa Rican citizens or
on the pretext of family reunions.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed the existence of an institution called
the National Committee of Churches that obtained visas for Cubans
for a fee of $7,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The arrested men forged the signature of the Minister on the
documents sent to the immigration authorities that authorized
issuing visas to citizens of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has no diplomatic or consular relations with Cuba
but has opened a special office in Havana. Moreover, an important
Cuban community lives in this Central American nation.

TEGUCIGALPA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing President Carlos

president of the constitutional history of Honduras in a ceremony
held at the national stadium in Tegucigalpa.
</P>

Flores placed his hand on the Constitution of the Republic,

govern on behalf of all Hondurans, whatever their politics and to
work to overcome under development and poverty.
</P>

After the swearing in ceremony, presided over by the new head

minute long speech, the high point of which was when he said, "The
word backward will no longer exist in Honduras because the only
backward thing about us is backward minds."

"Our poverty is no excuse because material poverty is the least
important and with determination and hard work we can overcome it
because we are in no way impoverished as far as our history,
resources and even less talent are concerned," said Flores.

<P>
The new president, who is also a 47 year old industrialist,

<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Office minister
Derek Fatchett said here Tuesday that the Second Asia-Europe
Summit (ASEM II) will be a "landmark" in the development of
Europe's relationship with Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Foreign Office briefing here Tuesday morning,
Fatchett said that the ASEM II, due to take place in London on
April 3-4, will not be just another international meeting. "It
will be the focus for a diverse range of activities between Asia
and Europe, all with the common objective of building relations
and setting up cooperation between our two regions."
</P>
<P>
The British minister made it clear that the turmoil in Asian
financial markets will be high on the agenda of the summit
meeting. "We have a common interest in finding solutions and
restoring market confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade cooperation will be another important target
of the Asian and Europe meeting. The British government is
expected to host a "Business Forum" to explore further business
opportunities between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
"The Business Forum will bring together top businessmen from
both regions so they can talk directly to their political
leaders," Fatchett said, adding, "the practical concerns of
business will be at the hearts of the ASEM discussions."
</P>
<P>
On the first ever China-European Union (EU) Summit to be held
during the ASEM II in London, Fatchett told Xinhua that Britain
was pleased that the summit will take place during Britain's EU
Presidency.
</P>
<P>
"We see that as a significant achievement for our (EU)
presidency. The (China-EU) summit is a substantial innovation and
contribution to the relations between EU and China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a full agenda in terms of political engagements
between EU and China ranging from political global issues through
the agenda of human rights to our economic relationship," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Extend Mandate of MONUA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today unanimously adopted a resolution,
deciding to extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola (MONUA) for a further period of three months
until April 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council reviewed the latest
report by the Secretary-General on Angola. In the resolution, the
Security Council once again expressed its firm commitment to
preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged the Government of Angola and the National
Union for Total independence of Angola (UNITA) to complete the
remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol by the end of february
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Council requested the Government of Angola and UNITA, in
cooperation with MONUA, to take appropriate steps, including
through its integrated National Police and Armed Forces, to ensure
an environment of confidence and safety in which the United
Nations and humanitarian personnel may carry out their activities.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Government of Angola and in particular UNITA
to refrain from any action which might undermine the process of
normalization of State administration or lead to renewed tensions.
</P>
<P>
The Council also urged the international community to provide
assistance to facilitate the demobilization and social
reintegration of ex-combatants, demining, the resettlement of
displaced persons and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the
Angolan economy in order to consolidate the gains in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
MONUA, which was established in June 1997, is aimed to
succeed the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and
continue to monitor the peace process in the country. It has
2,100 military personnel and its current mandate will expire on
January 31, 1998.

<HEADLINE> New York Stock Exchange Bounces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
rebounded on Tuesday with blue-chips rallying amid encouraging
reports of some major companies' performance in the fourth quarter
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.14 points or 1.3
percent to 7,815.08 at the close, according to preliminary data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's biggest gainer was Disney whose fourth quarter
earnings rose to 755 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another blue-chip gainer was Ford Motor which saw a 1.8 billion
dollars profit in the last quarter of 1997. Both Ford and Disney
surpassed expectations for their profits.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators also posted gains with the Nastaq
composite index rising 17.45 points to 1,578.91.
</P>
<P>
Advances led declines 17-11 on active volume of 683 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Today's rally was attributed to large stocks as investors were
still reluctant to buy small-name issues when they were not
certain about the market direction, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wages and Benefits Up 3.3 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The wages and benefits of
the U.S. workers increased 3.3 percent in 1997, the fastest growth
in four years, the Labor Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the increase for the whole year was a
significant acceleration from a 2.9 percent rise for 1996 and a
2.7 percent increase in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The annual gain of 3.3 percent marked the fastest increase
since a 3.5 percent rise in 1993.
</P>
<P>
While rising wages and benefits are good news for workers,
economists worry that if those gains are not accompanied by
productivity increases, then inflation pressures can mount
quickly, often spelling an end to an economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The 1 percent October to December gain in compensation costs
was slightly higher than the 0.9 percent analysts had been
expecting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned the
looming danger of wage inflation as one of the primary factors
that would prompt the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate currently stands at the lowest levels in a
quarter of a century, standing at 4.7 percent in December. Despite
this fact, wage pressures have been restrained.
</P>
<P>
One of the major factors that has helped to restrain overall
compensation costs has recorded a marked slowdown in health
insurance. For 1997, health insurance and other benefits were up
2.1 percent, only slightly higher than a 2 percent growth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries last year rose 3.8 percent, compared to a
gain of 3.3 percent in 1996. It was the fastest wage increase
since a 4.3 percent gain in 1990, at the end of the last long
recovery period.
</P>
<P>
For the final quarter, wages were up 1 percent, the fastest
quarterly pace since June 1990. Benefit costs climbed 0.9 percent,
also the fastest quarterly increase since a similar 0.9 percent
rise in the third quarter of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Blair Hold Talks with N. Irish Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held talks with the Northern Ireland parties on Tuesday in a
bid to defuse the crisis threatening peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He met leaders of all seven parties taking part in a peace
talks being held in Lancaster House in London after Protestant
leaders angrily rejected a new discussion paper.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear that what is important is that the future of
Northern Ireland and a lasting political settlement can only be
put through if those people from the traditions of Northern
Ireland can come together and negotiate," Blair told reporters
emerging from his informal talks with the parties' leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that it can be done provided people realise
that the details of any settlement have got to be negotiated,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the publication of proposals for north-south
institutions by the UK and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
The proposals aimed at driving the talks forward drew vastly
different reactions from Catholic and Protestant leaders when they
were published earlier on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new proposals suggested a new Northern Ireland assembly,
closer London-Dublin links and powerful cross-border bodies to
foster Ireland-wide cooperation in trade and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Catholic nationalist groups applauded the initiative, but the
Protestants were against it with scorn. The parties will continue
to discuss the initiative as well as the future of Northern
Ireland in London on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Germany Commemorates Holocaust Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Commemorative events were held
across Germany Tuesday to pay respect to six million victims of
the Holocaust committed by German Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of the German parliament Tuesday,
parliament speaker Rita Suessmuth called on Germans not to forget
the terrors committed by German Nazis.
</P>
<P>
"The courage to face the history enables a people to guard
against national madness and complacency," Suessmuth told the
parliament session with all German leaders present.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the German parliament, Israeli historian Yehuda
Bauer warned against the danger of a repeated Holocaust and called
on the German people to make sure that a more humane and better
civilization has been developing from the debris of the history.
</P>
<P>
In the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the state
parliament convened a special session in commemoration of Nazi
victims at a former Nazi concentration camp near the city of
Worms.
</P>
<P>
In the northern states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg, local
authorities had ordered all public buildings to fly a flag at
half-mast. And in the former Dachau concentration camp near
Munich, more than 800 school children participated in a memorial
event alongside survivors of the camp.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, where about 56,000 Jews were deported and murdered
by Nazis between 1941 and 1945, a memorial was unveiled Tuesday
before a railway station to mark the Jewish deportees.
</P>
<P>
January 27 was the day when Nazi victims in Auschwitz
concentration camp in Poland were liberalized by the Soviet troops
in 1945. The day was decided by German President Roman Herzog as a
rememberance day in 1996.
