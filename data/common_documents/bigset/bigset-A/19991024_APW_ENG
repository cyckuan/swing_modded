<HEADLINE> Columbia Energy Turns Down NiSource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Energy Group's board of directors  
rejected a sweetened $74-a-share bid by NiSource Inc., calling it 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the board instructed the Herndon-based company's  
management to look for other possible deals, leaving the door open 
for a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejection announced Sunday marked the second time Columbia  
has spurned NiSource. In June, NiSource offered $68 a share, then 
raised the offer to $74 a share Oct. 17 after a campaign by the 
Herndon, Va., company to urge its shareholders to turn down the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest offer is worth about $6.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Oliver G. Richard III, Columbia's chairman, president and chief  
executive officer, said in a statement that Columbia was ``firmly 
committed to exploring thoroughly the opportunities available to us 
and considering all possible alternatives for enhancing shareholder 
value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., has said the combination  
would make a good fit in a natural gas distribution corridor from 
the Chicago market to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Hibbs, a NiSource spokeswoman, said her company was  
disappointed by Columbia's response. ``However, we're confident 
that when Columbia sits down with us, they'll recognize that this 
is the right combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to NiSource chairman, president and CEO Gary L.  
Neale, Richard agreed to meet with NiSource about a possible deal 
``if it is interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $74-a-share offer expires Nov. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	NiSource is the parent company of Northern Indiana Public  
Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts. It would become 
one of the nation's biggest natural gas companies if the takeover 
succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is involved in natural gas exploration, production,  
transmission, storage and distribution as well as propane sales and 
electric power generation, sales and trading.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Finance Upgrade in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- The United States will upgrade two air bases and  
an army camp it has been using in this oil-rich state at a cost of 
around $173 million, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking here before he departed for Jordan, Cohen said the  
price was still ``a general figure'' and it has not been decided 
how it will be allocated. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want is an upgrade in the capacity of the bases to  
accommodate those troops and make sure that we have the kind of 
ramp space and other types of facilities that would accommodate a 
large influx of aircraft should it be necessary,'' Cohen told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 10-year agreement Kuwait signed with the United States  
after the 1991 Gulf War, several thousand American troops are 
stationed in Kuwait with pre-positioned weapons and aircraft, ready 
to defend the small state from Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	The troops use a camp in Doha, outside Kuwait City, while the  
warplanes operate out of Ali Al Salem and Ahmed Al Jaber air bases. 
They help patrol the no-fly zones imposed on Iraq after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he and Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber Al Ahmed Al Sabah,  
``totally agree there should be no change in our Iraqi policy until 
Iraq complies with its obligations, including the full accounting 
of Kuwait's POWs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwait claims Baghdad is still holding some 600 Kuwaitis and  
other nationals from Iraq's seven-month occupation that was ended 
by the Gulf War. Iraq denies the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, arriving in Jordan, Cohen was met by Prime Minister  
Abdur-Ra'uf S. Rawabdeh. Talks with King Abdullah II were scheduled 
to open immediately afterward at the king's palace in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats described the visit as a courtesy call, but Jordanian  
officials said the two are expected to discuss Iraq, Middle East 
peacemaking and Jordan's defense needs. Abdullah met President 
Clinton and other administration officials during a 12-day visit to 
the United States earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who has been on a nine-day tour of eight countries in the  
region, is scheduled to depart later Sunday for Oman.

<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama tailback and Heisman hopeful  
Shaun Alexander and quarterback Andrew Zow have sprained ankles and 
might not play against Southern Mississippi Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their ankles are tender,'' coach Mike DuBose said. ``We don't  
know about Saturday ... if we had to list them one way or the 
other, it would be doubtful this early in the week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander left the field limping after Saturday's game against  
Tennessee. He sprained his right ankle on his final catch of the 
game. Zow also sprained his ankle, in the second quarter, and 
didn't start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything can change in the morning,'' DuBose said. ``I don't  
anticipate that, though.''

<HEADLINE> Lapentti Wins Lyon Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYON, France (AP) -- Sixth-seeded Nicolas Lapentti beat  
Australia's Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 6-2 Sunday in the final of the 
$725,000 Lyon Grand Prix, taking a big step towards the 
season-ending World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently ninth in the point standings, Lapentti's victory over  
the 27th-ranked Hewitt helped his chances of moving into the top 
eight and qualifying for the prestigious event at Hanover, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ecuadorian, who never had won a match on carpet and had only  
two career indoor victories before this tournament, had to struggle 
to reach the final. He came back from a set down in each of his 
four previous matches, saving two match points. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one expected me to do anything indoors,'' said Lapentti,  
ranked a career-high 14th, up from 69 at this time last year. ``I 
was so close to losing twice this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the match, the two players appeared evenly matched,  
both having won two career titles -- including one each this year -- 
and both seeking their first career indoor title. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti got off to a strong start, breaking Hewitt's opening  
serve and taking a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	His confidence building as Hewitt's sputtered, Lapentti  
surrendered only two more points on his serve, easily holding to 
take the set. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti began the second set the same way, breaking Hewitt's  
serve twice for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got off to a bad start ... which didn't help,'' Hewitt said.  
``I came out and tried to be too aggressive from the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's Piet Norval and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe won the  
doubles title, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4) over the fourth-seeded 
team of 1995 singles champion Wayne Ferreira of South Africa and 
Australia's Sandon Stolle.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Charmer Wins Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Olympic Charmer withstood a closing rally  
from Camargo on Sunday to win Oak Tree's $100,000 Harold C. Ramser 
Sr. Handicap by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic Charmer ran one mile in 1:34 1/5 at Santa Anita Park's  
Camino Real Turf Course. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Chris McCarron put Olympic Charmer, the 4-5 favorite, in  
second behind pace-setter Bright Magic but took the lead entering 
the stretch. The Kentucky-bred filly had enough in reserve to hold 
off Camargo, ridden by Alex Solis, in the race for 3-year-olds. 
Matt Garcia rode 18-1 longshot Bright Magic to third place, 
three-quarters of a length behind the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the second in as many starts for Olympic  
Charmer, a daughter of Olympio. Hall of Famer Ron McAnally trained 
the bay filly, which carried a high weight of 118 pounds and paid 
$3.80, $3 and $2.80. Camargo paid $5.40 and $4. Bright Magic 
returned $7.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Rod Strickland Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being fined for being a no-show,  
Washington Wizards point guard Rod Strickland apparently has 
patched matters up with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland attributed his unexcused absence from a practice  
Wednesday to ``personal things that I had to resolve.'' He did not 
explain but said he was ``definitely sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was back on the court Saturday, coming off the bench  
with 6 minutes, 47 seconds left in the third quarter, and scoring 
five points in 14 minutes in Washington's 112-99 exhibition win 
over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hit with an undisclosed fine for his earlier absence and  
benched for Thursday's exhibition game. After he missed Friday's 
practice, coach Gar Heard said: ``I thought until he got his head 
squared, I didn't want him to be out there.''

<HEADLINE> Colts 31, Bengals 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Peyton Manning spent his rookie season  
setting passing records. He's a lot happier getting victories, even 
at the expense of the hapless Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last year, to say we're going to overlook anybody  
doesn't make a lot of sense. Sometimes it's not going the way you 
want it to, but we finally caught on and made some plays,'' said 
Manning, who passed for 284 yards and two touchdowns as the 
Indianapolis Colts beat the Bengals 31-10 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupled with last week's 16-13 victory over the New York Jets,  
it marked the first time in Manning's 22-game career the Colts 
(4-2) have won two straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far this year, it's been win-lose, win-lose,'' said  
Manning, who was only 3-13 last year despite setting NFL rookie 
records for yards and touchdowns passing. ``It's nice to have one 
that didn't go down to the wire in the fourth quarter. Even though 
it was a struggle at times, we felt we were in control the entire 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Harrison, the NFL leader in receptions, caught eight of  
Manning's passes for 156 yards, including 56 yards for a 
first-quarter touchdown. It was the eighth TD reception of the 
season for Harrison, matching his career high in just the sixth 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were double-covering him early and they realized it was  
just hurting them, and we were beating them with other guys,'' 
Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts also got two short touchdown runs by rookie Edgerrin  
James and a late touchdown pass by Manning to Ken Dilger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals (1-6) lost Corey Dillon, the NFL rushing leader,  
with a cut on his right arm in the first half and rookie 
quarterback Akili Smith with a bruised right shin in the third 
quarter. Jeff Blake relieved Smith, going 5-of-7 on a 68-yard drive 
and hitting Darnay Scott for a 10-yard score with 5:13 to go. 
Dillon managed only 7 yards on six carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything like that affects us. But that wasn't the reason  
for us losing the game,'' Bengals coach Bruce Coslet said of the 
loss of Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play very well. They got after us on a lot of long  
plays. The one long play, we had Harrison double-covered and he 
still got out. You can't do that to a heck of a player. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many things went wrong, I don't know where to begin.''  
</P>
<P>
	Manning (17-for-33 for 284 yards) hit Harrison for the 56-yard  
TD on the Colts' third play. Both of James' scores came in the 
second period following crucial mistakes by Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bad snap, Will Brice's punt was blocked by Ratcliff  
Thomas, giving the Colts the ball at the Bengals 28. Two passes to 
Harrison helped Indianapolis to the 12, then an apparent 
interception in the end zone by Artrell Hawkins was called back by 
an offside penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning passed to Terrence Wilkins at the 1, and James ran in  
for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Colts' next possession, a long pass to Harrison fell, but  
an interference penalty on Hawkins put the Colts at the 5. James 
ran 2 yards for the second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be aggressive, but their passing game is so quick  
and rhythmic that you can't come up very far or they'll try those 
double moves and go behind you like they did on the first score,'' 
Hawkins said. ``Marvin Harrison has so much speed, you can't afford 
to give him any steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, making his third start, was 12-for-24 for 122 yards, but  
he was sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
	An apparent TD pass to Harrison was nullified on a review that  
showed he had one foot out of bounds when he made the catch, 
setting up Mike Vanderjagt's 22-yard field goal for a 24-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which had just one first down up to that point,  
moved 48 yards in nine plays, including a 24-yard scramble by Smith 
and a 16-yard pass to Carl Pickens. Doug Pelfrey's 32-yard field 
goal with 15 seconds left cut the lead to 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more completions to Harrison set up Dilger's 10-yard TD  
reception in the fourth quarter before the final touchdown pass 
from Blake to Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the team all week Cincinnati is a better team than  
their record. I was impressed with their defense, and they showed 
that again today,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said. ``I didn't relax 
until the game was over. I was concerned the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Bengals also lost guard Brian DeMarco (elbow) and  
tackle Willie Anderson (knee). ... Scott's five catches gave him 
301 for his career; Pickens, who had three receptions, moved within 
one of becoming the first Bengal with 500. ... Mora became the 27th 
coach to win 100 games and was presented with a game ball ... 
Manning has been sacked only three times this season, a league low 
by a starter. ... Harrison has had receptions in all 50 of his NFL 
games. He's had 100 yards receiving four times this year. ... 
Wilkins, an undrafted rookie, had three receptions for 54 yards in 
his first NFL start at wide receiver.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: US Plans Kuwait Base Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen on Sunday  
defended allied actions against Iraq and said the United States 
plans a $173 million upgrade of two air bases and an army camp it 
has been using in this oil-rich state. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Kuwait before departing for Jordan, Cohen said that  
the estimated upgrade cost of $173 million was still ``a general 
figure'' and that it has not been decided how the money would be 
allocated. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want is an upgrade in the capacity of the bases to  
accommodate those troops and make sure that we have the kind of 
ramp space and other types of facilities that would accommodate a 
large influx of aircraft should it be necessary,'' Cohen told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 10-year defense agreement reached after the 1991 Gulf  
War, about 4,000 American troops are stationed in Kuwait with 
pre-positioned weapons and aircraft, ready to defend the small 
state from Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	The troops use a camp in Doha, outside Kuwait City, and the  
warplanes operate out of Ali Al Salem and Ahmed Al Jaber air bases. 
They participate in patrolling the no-fly zone imposed over 
southern Iraq after the war to protect Shiite Muslim minorities 
from the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense secretary said he and Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber Al  
Ahmed Al Sabah, ``totally agree there should be no change in our 
Iraqi policy until Iraq complies with its obligations, including 
the full accounting of Kuwait's POWs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwait claims Iraq is still holding some 600 Kuwaitis and other  
nationals from its seven-month occupation that was ended by the 
Gulf War. Iraq denies that claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense secretary took advantage of stops in Kuwait and  
Jordan to stress that the United States would continue its policy 
of containing the Iraqi leader as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the Iraqi people will have an opportunity to have a  
new leadership and we hope that the leadership will come from 
within Iraq,'' he told reporters after meeting with Jordan's King 
Abdullah II. ``We are committed to maintaining Iraq's territorial 
integrity and ... we are supporting alternative voices to Saddam's 
regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he and Abdullah also discussed the Middle East peace  
process and U.S. military aid to Jordan, which he said could 
increase by $50 million to $125 million next year, pending 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who held separate talks with Jordanian Prime Minister  
Abdur-Ra'uf S. Rawabdeh and senior army officials, later traveled 
to Oman. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. defense chief planned to visit Israel on Tuesday as  
part of his Mideast tour, which has included stops in Egypt, 
Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Demby Named NCAA Woman of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jamila Demby, a track and field standout  
from the University of California-Davis, was named NCAA Woman of 
the Year on Sunday night for her academic, athletic community 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	Demby was among 10 finalists selected by a special committee of  
athletic administrators from NCAA member colleges and universities. 
There were more than 300 nominations initially. 
</P>
<P>
	``This award means a lot to me because it's about everything I  
love to do,'' Demby said at a dinner ceremony at the Indiana Roof 
Ballroom. ``I love to run track, I love school and I love working 
with kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank my mother for inspiring me to go to college  
and to get where I have today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demby, who won numerous track and field awards during her  
collegiate career, is scheduled to graduate in December. 
</P>
<P>
	She was an indoor track and field All-America in the 1,600-meter  
relay in 1998 and 1999. She was a first-team All North Coast 
Athletic Conference selection in the 400 in 1996 and 1997, and was 
an All-America in the 800 from 1996-99. 
</P>
<P>
	She also earned All NCAC honors in the 800 in 1996 and 1999, and  
was a 1999 All-California College Athletic Association Conference 
selection in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was more worried about waiting in line tonight and getting  
to my seat than I was about winning because I really didn't expect 
to win,'' Demby said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to be in the presence of so many young women  
who have achieved so much in their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demby, 22, is majoring in rhetoric and communication with a 3.06  
grade-point average. She was on the school's honor roll from 1995 
to this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where to go from here. This awards seals  
everything up. I can't ask for anything more than this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her athletic and academic success, Demby  
volunteered as a Special Olympics coach, instructed physically 
challenged youth in track events at the ACT Games and junior high 
students at the Jacobs Track Clinic in California. 
</P>
<P>
	She also participated in food and clothing drives, organized an  
event at Shriner's Hospital and was awarded the university's 
Outstanding Senior Leadership Award in 1999. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Researchers Fight E. Coli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In the effort to keep the deadly microbe E.  
coli out of meat, one short-term tactic that shows promise involves 
a simple change of diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, researchers at Cornell University found that E. coli  
in a grain-fed cow's digestive tract are resistant to strong acid 
like that in the human stomach. But when the cow's diet was 
switched to hay, the bacteria became acid-sensitive, so they would 
die if eaten by a person. 
</P>
<P>
	If cattle are switched to a hay diet about five days before  
slaughter, E. coli in fresh feces that might contaminate the 
carcasses would be less likely to cause human illness, said James 
Russell, a USDA microbiologist and professor at Cornell University. 
However, once manure is outside the cow and exposed to oxygen for a 
while, the E. coli become acid-resistant and thus able to cause 
illness, no matter what the cow was fed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies this summer, researchers in Nebraska found that  
changing the diet caused a dramatic decrease in the amount of E. 
coli 0157:H7 in cattle going to slaughter, according to Dr. Robert 
Elder, a U.S. Department of Agriculture microbiologist in Clay 
Center, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that it's not hay, but the change from one diet to  
another that's able to exclude 0157,'' Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the effect is temporary. ``It just rebounds after they're on  
the diet for a while,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Transporting cattle also causes a decrease in fecal shedding of  
toxic E. coli, Elder said. ``That's actually the opposite of what 
we expect to see in animals that are stressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two interventions, dietary manipulations and transport,  
look like the most promising short-term solutions until a vaccine 
or other approach comes along,'' Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
	While those short-term strategies might reduce the likelihood of  
E. coli getting into hamburger, they don't address the problem of 
contamination of lakes and water supplies with runoff from manure 
piles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at treatment technologies for manure as part of  
an effort to combine on-farm prevention with food processing 
techniques to close the loop on all the avenues by which this 
contamination can reach food,'' said Patricia Millner, research 
leader of the USDA's Soil Microbial Systems Laboratory in 
Beltsville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a process called advanced alkaline stabilization, the  
Beltsville researchers are mixing manure with recycled materials 
like gypsum, lime kiln dust, and coal ash from power plants. A 
natural chemical reaction produces heat, ammonia, and a high pH 
that kills microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
	The research may produce a method of pasteurizing manure that's  
going to be used to fertilize crops or spread on other land, 
Millner said. It wouldn't prevent pollution from a temporary manure 
pile at a fairground. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and dairy cattle produce 1.2 billion tons of manure  
annually in the United States. New federal regulations direct 
states to develop permit systems requiring waste management plans 
from farmers. New York was one of the first to set up a permit 
system this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the guidelines wouldn't have prevented the outbreak in  
upstate New York at the Washington County Fair. The permit system 
applies to dairy operations that keep more than 300 cattle for 45 
days a year -- about 20 percent of the state's dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington County Fair outbreak apparently was caused by the  
manure of one infected cow, in a temporary barn 83 feet from a 
20-foot-deep, unchlorinated well, state Health Commissioner Dr. 
Antonia Novello said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the outbreak, Novello ordered all state fairgrounds to  
serve only disinfected drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Fashion Caters To Tech Junkies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ideally, Jonathan Davis would love to have his  
cellular telephone, handheld computing device and other electronic 
trinkets on his person at all times. 
</P>
<P>
	But fashion reality won't allow that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have far too many gadgets and not enough pocket real  
estate,'' said Davis, technical director at The Adrenaline Group, a 
software development and Web strategy firm in Washington. ``It's 
just a little too cluttered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some retailers, especially those catering to younger customers,  
are responding to the high-tech quandary by adding accessories and 
altering the design of their clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Silver Tab, our whole new mantra has become equipment for  
modern living,'' said Mary Bruno, design director for the 
youth-oriented jeans line, a sub-brand of Levi's. That means 
clothing should be able to hold things that would normally fit into 
the briefcase or backpack, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Tab has tinkered with its pockets, both in size and  
placement. Putting the front pockets at the top of the leg rather 
than along the side seam makes is easier for people to reach their 
phones, Bruno said. Pockets were becoming more long and narrow to 
store cell phones, but as the phones become shorter and fatter the 
shape of the pockets are evolving as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Silver Tab line -- geared toward 15- to 24-year olds -- keeps  
on top of the latest technology trends by comparing notes with the 
company's information services department, responsible for their 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time clothing makers have taken their cue  
from technology trends, said Joe Culley, brand manager at Dockers, 
known for its khaki pants. The rise in people carrying snuff boxes 
and pocket watches had a similar effect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it, we're really at another one of those  
junctures in time,'' Culley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Newcomer, a professor of fashion design at the Fashion  
Institute of Technology in New York, said it's not surprising that 
retailers are making changes to suit the needs of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your manufacturer sees that customers are making do with a  
makeshift pocket or strap, they are going to invent new designs,'' 
Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects the trend to reach the mass market -- where the  
prevalence of cargo pants and other multi-pocketed items help cater 
to those who can't live without their techno-gadgets. Accessories 
such as sleek-looking belly packs and shoulder satchels have sprung 
up in part so people don't have to stick bulky computing and 
telephone devices in their clothes, Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the belt bag category -- items that loop through the belt  
or are worn around the waist -- have been ``red hot,'' said John 
Florin, vice president marketing for Westport Corp., which makes 
bags and agenda notebooks under such names as Mundi, Perry Ellis 
and Kenneth Cole. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap stores offer a version of the modern-day backpack, featuring  
a single strap that goes across the front of the body with a cell 
phone pocket in the center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology has been a huge influence we see in our fall and  
holiday line,'' said Amy Manitis, Gap's director of public 
relations. The chain has updated already-spacious cargo pants with 
special cell phone pockets and added clothes with lots of Velcro 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	It cuts both ways. Personal style also is influencing the design  
of cellular phones, pagers and other devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``People believe that these products, which are going to be with  
them for long periods of time, have to be an extension of their 
personal selves,'' said Dan Williams, director of design and 
innovation for Motorola's personal communications sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's StarTac wireless phone comes with accessories like  
an imitation pearl necklace so the device can be worked around the 
neck. Motorola also has been working on packaging a cellular phone 
in the form of a wristwatch -- making the technology more like a 
personal accessory. 
</P>
<P>
	Vibrant colors and sleeker shapes are becoming more pervasive.  
Qualcomm's thin phones, which have a built-in battery and are less 
than seven-tenths of an inch thick, can slip into a pocket but 
still be comfortable to use. 
</P>
<P>
	The portability of personal technology is influencing fashion in  
other ways. New devices enable people to conduct business just 
about anywhere and free them from the confines of the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clothing needs to keep up with that,'' said analyst Phil  
Kowalczyk, a partner in charge of strategic services with Kurt 
Salmon Associates in Atlanta. More comfortable fabrics, like wool 
garments with some stretch in them, are the result, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bucs 6, Bears 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Warren Sapp refers to quarterbacks as ``the  
hunted'' and the rookies as ``fresh meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday it was Cade McNown's turn to run from the Pro Bowl  
tackle, who led a solid defensive effort that gave the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers a 6-3 victory over the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Gramatica kicked two first-half field goals for Tampa Bay  
(3-3), and the Bucs kept the Bears off the scoreboard until an 
ineffective McNown was benched. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Miller completed a 50-yard pass to Bobby Engram to set up a  
field goal for Chicago with 2:24 to go. The Bears made one first 
down on their final possession before Derrick Brooks' second 
interception allowed Tampa Bay to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for the Bucs, who  
started the day ranked second in the NFL in total defense. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of Tampa Bay's wins have come against inexperienced  
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp and his teammates sacked Doug Pederson and Donovan McNabb  
in a victory over Philadelphia and held Brian Griese to 132 yards 
passing in a win against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, making his second pro start in place of the injured  
Shane Matthews, completed 9 of 23 passes for 82 yards and was 
sacked twice -- once by Sapp, who was in the rookie's face all 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bears coach Dick Jauron changed quarterbacks late in the third  
quarter after McNown, rolling to his left, threw into coverage and 
was intercepted by Brooks at the Bucs 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller completed 10 of 22 passes for 117 yards. Chris Boniol  
missed a 44-yard field goal attempt early in the fourth quarter, 
but converted a 28-yarder when the Bears got back into scoring 
position again. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Alstott rushed for 72 yards on 14 carries for Tampa Bay,  
but Trent Dilfer had another rough day at quarterback, going 
16-of-27 for 121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs rushed for 220 yards in one of their two victories over  
Chicago last season, and the Bears knew they'd have to contain 
Alstott and Warrick Dunn to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticized at times for being too conservative, Tampa Bay opened  
the game with five straight passes and threw on seven of eight 
plays before Gramatica kicked a 49-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	That drive, though, would prove to be Dilfer's most effective.  
Although the Bucs established the running game, with Alstott 
gaining 42 yards on five carries on the team's next possession, the 
lack of a consistent passing attack kept them from scoring more 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer overthrew a wide-open Dunn on what would have been a  
first-quarter TD, threw behind receivers on several plays and at 
times delivered the ball short and low. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramatica kicked a 34-yard field goal that made it 6-0 after  
earlier hitting the left upright with a 43-yarder that would have 
tied the NFL rookie record of 11 consecutive field goals to start a 
career.

	Changes Detailed by Indonesian Leader  
</P>
<P>
	JIMBARAN, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's new president outlined  
sweeping changes in domestic, foreign and defense policy during his 
first major speech Sunday. But Abdurrahman Wahid also said he would 
appoint some members of longtime authoritarian President Suharto's 
disgraced regime to his Cabinet. That move defies a chorus of calls 
to wipe the slate clean after the recent ouster of former President 
B.J. Habibie's government, which included many Suharto holdovers. 
In a shift in diplomatic priorities, Wahid said he planned to visit 
China and other Asian nations within weeks. He also said he would 
build an economic relationship between Israel and Indonesia, the 
world's most populous Islamic nation, as a start to ending years of 
animosity.

	U.S. To Finance Upgrade in Kuwait  
</P>
<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- The United States will upgrade two air bases and  
an army camp it has been using in this oil-rich state at a cost of 
around $173 million, Defense Secretary William Cohen said today. 
Speaking here before he departed for Jordan, Cohen said the price 
was still ``a general figure'' and it has not been decided how it 
will be allocated. ``What we want is an upgrade in the capacity of 
the bases to accommodate those troops and make sure that we have 
the kind of ramp space and other types of facilities that would 
accommodate a large influx of aircraft should it be necessary,'' 
Cohen told reporters.

	Rebels Preparing for Russian Attack  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Islamic militants in Chechnya were  
strengthening their positions around the capital, Grozny, on Sunday 
while Russian forces continued artillery bombardments of suspected 
militant bases, a military spokesman said. Col. Gennady Alyokhin, a 
Russian spokesman in neighboring Dagestan, said the overall 
situation in Chechnya was stable, but that Russian artillery units 
were continuing to shell the rebels in response to rebel moves to 
shore up their positions. Yusup Yaraliev, a spokesman for the 
Chechen military command, said four people were killed and 20 
wounded Sunday in a pre-dawn Russian artillery attack on the town 
of Vedeno, 18 miles southeast of Grozny.

<P>
	Albright Denounces Chechnya Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The Russian military's attacks in Chechnya  
are ``deplorable and ominous,'' and the events of the past 36 to 48 
hours in the breakaway republic are of ``grave concern,'' Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said Saturday. Russian forces were 
consolidating their positions around Grozny, the Chechen capital, 
after an air, artillery and ground onslaught that left the Chechen 
forces with heavy losses. A missile attack Thursday night on a 
Grozny marketplace killed at least 143 people. Russia sent troops 
into Chechnya at the end of September, following weeks of 
airstrikes, ostensibly to eliminate the militants who invaded the 
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan this summer.

	Clinton Nixes Investment Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to engender a bipartisan spirit,  
the latest proposal from President Clinton on Social Security does 
not include a controversial plan to have the government invest a 
portion of Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. In 
his weekly radio address yesterday, Clinton challenged Republicans 
to improve upon their pledges that they would avoid using Social 
Security surpluses to pay for other budget needs. ``I think we can 
do better,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address, adding that 
he will submit legislation this week that would enact part of a 
Social Security rescue plan he outlined early this year. The 
proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits any 
government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay off 
the national debt.

	'El Duque' Steps Up Again for Yanks  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez got away with his one mistake.  
He struck out 10 and allowed only one hit in seven innings, Chipper 
Jones' solo homer in the fourth, as the New York Yankees beat the 
Atlanta Braves 4-1 in Game 1 of the World Series on Saturday night. 
Until the eighth inning, it looked like Hernandez's bad fastball to 
Jones would overshadow his most dominating postseason start, 
because the Yankees couldn't score off Greg Maddux. But after 
Hernandez was lifted for pinch-hitter Darryl Strawberry in the 
eighth, the Yankees scored four runs to give him yet another big 
win.

<HEADLINE> Trump Plans To Join Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Real estate tycoon Donald Trump plans to join  
the Reform Party in advance of a possible campaign for the 
presidency, beating Pat Buchanan to the punch by hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, a lifelong Republican, said in a telephone interview he  
signed the necessary papers to change his voter registration to the 
Independence Party -- the Reform Party affiliate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he will file the documents Monday morning, just  
before Buchanan is expected to announce his Reform Party bid in 
suburban Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always great to beat somebody to the punch,'' Trump said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he has not decided whether to seek the presidency,  
though he has made arrangement to qualify for an early deadline to 
get ballot access in California. He also has formed an exploratory 
committee to help him decide by January whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another step in the process. It's another step toward  
making a positive decision, but I haven't made that decision yet,'' 
Trump said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump casts himself as a middle-of-the-road politician would  
offer tax cuts to the middle class, ban unregulated ``soft money'' 
in political campaigns and negotiate tougher trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party has just moved too far to the extreme  
right. The Democrats are too far to the left. I believe the Reform 
Party can be the true centrist party. And that's very much in line 
with my thinking,'' Trump said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has called Buchanan's views ``prehistoric,'' and expects a  
cake walk to the nomination if he gets in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I beat Buchanan easily,'' said Trump, who also  
appeared Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''

	DENVER (AP) -- Danny Pena and Joe Franchino scored to give the  
Los Angeles Galaxy a 2-0 victory over the Colorado Rapids and 
clinch their MLS Western Conference semifinal series on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The result left the Rapids with a league record for futility,  
679 minutes of play without a goal to close out their season. The 
Rapids have not scored in seven games and failed to score a single 
goal in 12 of their last 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never encountered anything like this in my life, playing  
soccer for the better part of 25 years,'' Rapids forward Paul Bravo 
said. ``It's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy, which swept the best-of-3 series in two games,  
didn't put the game away until the 74th minute when Pena scored. 
Franchino scored 10 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made five saves for the shutout.  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles advanced to the Western Conference finals against  
the winner of the Chicago-Dallas series, which goes to a decisive 
third game on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Strike at Overnite Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The Teamsters union on Sunday set up  
picket lines across the country at Overnite Transportation Co., one 
of the nation's largest trucking companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman said operations would not be hindered as  
picket lines went up in Memphis, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, 
Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri and La Vergne, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters and Overnite have been trying to negotiate a  
contract for four years for the 21 centers where the union 
represents employees. The company has 160 terminals in the United 
States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of bargaining in good faith, there has been a pattern  
of retaliation and violence against union supporters,'' said John 
Murphy, a Teamsters organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite spokesman Ira Rosenfeld denied those allegations and  
said the strike was not affecting operations, and he didn't expect 
it to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire network is open, and will continue to be so,''  
Rosenfeld said. ``We have a strike contingency plan. We use dock 
workers and drivers not on strike, and we also have temporary 
replacement workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have said wages are not a major factor. A major issue  
is the pension system. Overnite wants to retain control while the 
Teamsters want to put pension money into a union fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite is based in Richmond,. Va., and employs more than  
13,000.

<HEADLINE> Irvine Leads After Winning Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After winning an appeal, Eddie Irvine now is on  
the verge of claiming the Formula One series title at Sunday's 
Japanese Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in a great position now,'' Irvine said. ``I have always  
done well at Suzuka.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins the title, he would be Britain's first champion since  
Damon Hill in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine -- after Ferrari won its appeal Saturday -- enters the  
Japanese Grand Prix four points ahead of McLaren's Mika Hakkinen, 
the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I need to do is finish ahead of Mika and I will be  
champion,'' Irvine said from Japan. ``I could still crash or break 
down in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a few incidents this season where we have had big  
problems and sometimes McLaren has had problems, so we will have to 
wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari hasn't won a drivers' title since 1979. Michael  
Schumacher, who was brought in four years ago to help Ferrari end 
the dry spell, has pledged his help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am elated that the FIA has agreed with Ferrari's point of  
view,'' said Schumacher, who missed half the season with a broken 
leg. ``Now the world championship will be decided on the circuit 
and not on the wheel of fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will do everything to help the stable and Eddie Irvine get  
as good a result at Suzuka as in Malaysia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Automobile Federation's decision to reinstate  
Ferrari's 1-2 finish by Irvine and Schumacher in the Oct. 17 
Malaysian Grand Prix has given Irvine the inside track to the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the FIA's five-member International Court of  
Appeal brought cries of foul from McLaren, which had been 
celebrating a second straight season title for Hakkinen after the 
Finn was elevated to first place in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal made it so the title is still up for grabs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have come to make the announcement myself because it was  
felt that whatever decision was taken, there might be criticism of 
FIA,'' FIA president Max Mosley said before announcing the Italian 
team's successful appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of lawyers ruled that the disputed aerodynamic  
deflectors -- initially ruled three-eighths of an inch out of 
compliance -- conformed to FIA standards. They said initial 
measurements were ``not sufficiently accurate'' and the rules were 
fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``To punish someone, you need two things,'' Ferrari's chief  
legal officer Jean-Pierre Martel said. ``A clear set of rules and 
acknowledgment that the rules have been broken. We proved that 
neither of those were shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren managing director Ron Dennis was sharply critical,  
suggesting that ``commercial'' pressure had influenced the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more than anything else a bad day for the sport,'' Dennis  
said. ``What has actually occurred is that through a very heavy 
scrutiny of our rules, which are extensive and very detailed, a way 
has been found ... to provide a reason for the appeal to be 
upheld.''

<HEADLINE> Seahawks 26, Bills 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Even without Joey Galloway to throw to, Jon Kitna  
is getting the job done for the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna, in his first full season as the Seahawks starter, passed  
for two touchdowns and Todd Peterson kicked four field goals as 
Seattle moved into a three-way tie for first place in the AFC West 
with a 26-16 victory over Buffalo on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Galloway still holding out in a bitter contract dispute  
that threatens his entire season, Kitna made Derrick Mayes his top 
target and teamed with him on scoring passes of 7 and 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson kicked field goals of 40, 21, 42 and 34 yards for the  
Seahawks (4-2), who rebounded after a last-second defeat in San 
Diego last weekend to grab a share of first place in the division 
with the Chargers and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills (4-3) lost for the second week in a row following a  
four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle built a 23-3 halftime lead, but Doug Flutie rallied  
Buffalo in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 45-yard completion to rookie Peerless Price, Flutie  
threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jay Riemersma with 7:32 
left to cut Seattle's lead to 26-16. 
</P>
<P>
	But Flutie, who celebrated his 37th birthday on Saturday,  
committed his third turnover of the game when he was sacked by 
Michael Sinclair and fumbled. Sam Adams recovered for the Seahawks 
on the Seattle 45 with 5:10 to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing without guard Ruben Brown, No. 2 tackler and linebacker  
John Holecek and top receiver Eric Moulds, who were injured last 
week against Oakland, the Bills couldn't get any pressure on Kitna 
in the first half and they couldn't get anything going on offense, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's Steve Christie kicked a 50-yard field goal as time  
expired in the opening half after Flutie completed a 36-yard pass 
to Kevin Williams -- the Bills' longest offensive play of the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ahman Green returned the opening kickoff 54 yards to  
the Buffalo 38. Five plays later, the Seahawks scored a touchdown 
on Kitna's 7-yard pass to Mayes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry Joseph's interception of a pass by Flute set up Kitna's  
second touchdown pass to Mayes, a 43-yarder, with 7:36 left in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo controlled the ball for 11:31 of the third quarter, but  
scored only six points. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie passed 18 yards to Price for a touchdown with 1:59 left  
in the third period to cap a 15-play, 84-yard drive that consumed 
7:04. But Christie didn't get off an extra-point attempt because of 
a high snap, leaving Seattle with a 23-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	On the ensuing kickoff, Christie recovered his own onside kick  
on the Buffalo 42, but the Bills went three-and-out and had to 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson's 34-yard field goal gave Seattle a 26-9 lead with  
10:02 left.

<HEADLINE> NY Mayor Warms Up to Wage Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's attempt to put maximum  
heat on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the minimum wage appears to be 
having some effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, her likely opponent in the New York Senate race, said  
Sunday he'll probably favor a minimum-wage increase after all, 
despite earlier comments against it. He was waiting for the results 
of citywide research on the impact of raising the wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate that I'll eventually support it, but first I'll  
have to see what their study shows,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the difference between substantive policy and  
essentially pandering policy, the difference between having 
responsibility in government versus not having responsibility in 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Queens, Mrs. Clinton and two economists  
from the Fiscal Policy Institute, a Manhattan research group, 
described numerous studies that they said prove a raise in the 
minimum wage does not decrease job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you study this issue, you can clearly see it will not hurt  
the economy, it will not increase unemployment,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said. ``It will provide necessary income to people working full 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bill is pending in Congress that would raise the $5.15 federal  
minimum wage by $1 in two stages. About 650,000 people in New York 
State -- 78 percent of them adults -- work minimum-wage jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's press conference was the second in three weeks that  
Mrs. Clinton has devoted to the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	She reiterated her message later Sunday at a Democratic Party  
fund-raiser on Long Island. ``We should be working to keep a basic 
bargain with all Americans: If you work hard and are responsible, 
you will not live in poverty,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment on the mayor's expected change of mind, Mrs.  
Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said: ``He has all the 
information he needs right now. If he's going to flip-flop, he 
ought to do it today.''

<HEADLINE> Money for Accused Boy's Family Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A Swiss newspaper has decided to withhold  
contributions for a couple whose son is charged with incest after 
the two disclosed they once had plans to create an erotic Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The mass-circulation daily Blick said in its Saturday edition  
that it would withhold money donated from its readers to the family 
of Andreas and Beverly Wuthrich, who fled with their three 
daughters to Switzerland after their 11-year-old son was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Juerg Lehmann, chief editor of Blick, said the newspaper would  
continue to back the boy while Colorado investigators look into the 
incest allegation. It was unclear whether Blick meant financial or 
editorial support for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Blick and other European media took up the family's cause,  
saying the boy was unfairly subjected to heavy-handed treatment at 
the hands of authorities who misinterpreted his actions with his 
5-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple fled for Switzerland after their son's Aug. 30  
arrest. Authorities began the investigation after a neighbor 
reported that she saw the boy fondle his sister. Mrs. Wuthrich has 
said her son was trying to help the girl go to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wuthriches, who have dual citizenship, said they left the  
United States after authorities told them their other three 
children might be taken from them. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was jailed seven weeks before being placed in a foster  
home last week to await trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehmann said Blick decided to withhold readers' donations from  
the Wuthriches after learning the couple had considered creating a 
sex-oriented Web site and charging for access. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wuthriches have said they dropped the idea for the Web site  
about a month before their son was arrested. They said they had 
considered it because they were having difficulty paying their 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's foreign minister said in Blick's Sunday edition  
that his country would continue to provide support for the boy to 
ensure he has a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The welfare of this child is what interests us,'' said Joseph  
Deiss.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 16, Eagles 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Even without Dan Marino, the Miami Dolphins had the  
better quarterback. They also had the better kicker. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard led Miami to a quick 10-point lead in his first NFL  
start, and the Dolphins beat the Philadelphia Eagles 16-13 Sunday 
when Norm Johnson was wide right on a 42-yard field-goal attempt 
with 52 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Olindo Mare made field goals of 37, 37 and 53 yards, extending  
his streak of kicks without a miss to 17, a Miami record. 
</P>
<P>
	For both teams, the close finish was familiar. The AFC  
East-leading Dolphins (5-1) have won four games by a total of 10 
points. The Eagles (2-5) have lost three games by a total of five 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard outplayed counterpart Doug Pederson, who was 13-for-25 for  
108 yards with four sacks. The Eagles' offense totaled just 175 
yards, but coach Andy Reid chose not to use rookie quarterback 
Donovan McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	Stingy defense allowed Miami to overcome one glaring mistake by  
Huard, an interception returned 67 yards for a touchdown by Brian 
Dawkins. Huard finished 15-for-21 for 142 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins notched only their second victory in the past 11  
games when Marino doesn't play. Bothered by a bone spur in his 
lower neck, Marino suited up but didn't throw before the game and 
missed a start for the first time since 1996, a span of 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia failed to make the most of two scoring chances in  
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 16-10, the Eagles drove to the Miami 7, but a holding  
penalty and sack pushed them back to the 26, and Johnson kicked a 
44-yard field goal with 6:08 to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawkins recovered a fumble by Cecil Collins at the Philadelphia  
42 with 2:33 left. The Eagles reached the Miami 24, but after 
Pederson's third-and-2 pass was incomplete, Johnson missed the 
potential tying kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was nursing a 13-3 lead late in the third period when  
Huard tried to hit Oronde Gadsden on a short pass near the 
sideline. Dawkins intercepted and ran untouched for the score. It 
was the second Huard interception returned for a touchdown in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the second game in a row, Huard's mobility gave Miami a  
new weapon. He scrambled before completing a 26-yard pass to Troy 
Drayton, ran for 11 yards on a third-down quarterback draw and 
sneaked 2 yards for another first down. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard started quickly, moving the Dolphins to scores on their  
first two possessions for a 10-0 lead. Miami scored a touchdown in 
the first quarter for the first time in 11 games on J.J. Johnson's 
12-yard run, capping a 63-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia then scored on David Akers' first NFL field goal, a  
53-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson fumbled when sacked by Trace Armstrong, setting up a  
Mare field goal for a 13-3 Miami lead. The Eagles reached the Miami 
21 late in the first half, but Rich Owens deflected a Pederson pass 
and Derrick Rodgers intercepted.

<HEADLINE> Contract Talks at Boeing To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Contract talks covering Boeing Co. scientists,  
engineers, manual writers and technical workers begin Monday amid 
signs of growing restlessness within their union. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent membership survey by the Society of Professional  
Engineering Employees in Aerospace, 60 percent said the union is 
too cozy with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the past, some also complained that SPEEA contracts are  
inferior to those of the larger Machinists union, which represents 
hourly production workers. 
</P>
<P>
	SPEEA, formerly the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees  
Association, is the second-largest union at Boeing, representing 
nearly 23,000 workers in three bargaining units covering seven 
states. Contracts for the three units are negotiated together. 
</P>
<P>
	``A union's job is to be adversarial with the company,'' said  
Andrea Fisher, a metallurgical inspector who joined SPEEA six 
months ago. ``Otherwise, what good is a union?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Bofferding, the union's executive director, counters  
that conciliation, rather than confrontation, has been the key to 
the union's clout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in police brutality. We have a lot more tools  
in our tool box than just a strike,'' Bofferding said. ``We'd still 
like to do things in cooperation with the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  
Workers represents about 44,000 riveters, painters, electricians, 
quality control inspectors, tool makers and other workers, 
principally in the Seattle area, Gresham, Ore., and Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	All are covered by a master contract, ratified Sept. 1, that  
makes them the best-paid workers of their kind in the aerospace 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing engineers earn an average $62,000 a year while technical  
employees get about $45,000. SPEEA leaders say that's thousands of 
dollars less than at other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said they hope to reach a tentative agreement  
by Nov. 17. The current contract expires Dec. 1.

 *Jessie Lee Foveaux    	
</P>
<P>
	MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Jessie Lee Foveaux, whose autobiography  
brought her fame at the age of 98, died Saturday. She was 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Foveaux wrote ``Any Given Day: The Life and Times of Jessie Lee  
Brown Foveaux,'' which began as a memoir that was intended only for 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal about the  
plainspoken tale sparked a bidding war for a book by Foveaux. New 
York-based Warner Books paid Foveaux a seven-figure sum for the 
book in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It depicts her life raising eight children in Manhattan during  
the Depression -- and her struggle to endure marriage to an abusive, 
alcoholic husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in 1899 in Quick City, Mo., Foveaux moved into her house in  
Manhattan in 1923. She remained there until her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Charley Kempthorne, whose writing program prompted Foveaux to  
write the book said she was ``really a very gracious lady ... just 
unfailingly polite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kempthorne said Foveaux continued to get letters and phone calls  
from fans of her book up to the day before she died.

 *H. Stuart Hughes    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- H. Stuart Hughes, who ran unsuccessfully against  
Edward M. Kennedy for the Senate in 1962, died in San Diego 
Thursday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	The author, historian, peace advocate, and political thinker was  
a professor emeritus of the University of California at San Diego, 
where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes spoke out against American military involvement in  
Vietnam and was vocal about nuclear disarmament while a history 
professor at Harvard in the 1960s. Along with Dr. Benjamin Spock, 
he co-chaired the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy and 
later became chairman of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes wrote eight history books, three collections of essays  
and an autobiography, ``Gentleman Rebel: The Memoirs of H. Stuart 
Hughes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962's Senate campaign, he focused on nuclear disarmament and  
the abolition of war.

<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Luciano Soprani, an Italian designer, died  
Saturday of cancer. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he had been ill for several months, Soprani managed to  
complete the collection that previewed in September as well as a 
collection for the January fashion shows in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	Soprani rose through the ranks of the Milan fashion world,  
working for houses such as Max Mara and Basile. He first presented 
fashions for men and women under his own name in 1984. Soprani also 
produced an extensive line of accessories.

 *Albert Tucker    	
</P>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Painter Albert Tucker, hailed as one  
of Australia's most influential 20th century artists, died of heart 
disease Saturday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was among a group of artists in the 1940s and '50s who  
abandoned academic realism in favor of a more raw, internal 
imagery. In 1957, his paintings became the first works by an 
Australian artist to be purchased by New York's Museum of Modern 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Churcher, former director of the National Gallery of  
Australia, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that Tucker's 
surreal wartime works of Melbourne's nightlife revealed a deep 
anger at the effect World War II had on the city.

 *Bobby Willis    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bobby Willis, husband and manager of pop star  
Cilla Black, died Saturday at age 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis, who had been diagnosed with cancer of the lungs and  
liver in July, died at a hospital where he was being treated for 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis met Miss Black when she was a 15-year-old waitress in  
Liverpool who occasionally sang with rock groups. She was signed by 
Beatles manager Brian Epstein in 1963, and her hits included 
``Anyone Who Had a Heart'' and ``You're My World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis became her manager after Epstein's suicide in 1967, and  
they married two years later. As her singing career faded, she and 
Willis turned their efforts to television, where she became a 
high-paid fixture as hostess of ``Blind Date.''

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dockworkers Talk on Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Negotiators trying to prevent a statewide  
dockworkers strike talked until dawn on Sunday, took a short break, 
and were back at the bargaining table midmorning. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would say how the talks were progressing.  
</P>
<P>
	The dockworkers' contract with four island shippers expired June  
30 and an extension was terminated by the International Longshore 
and Warehouse Union last week. By Friday, all 507 local union 
members had voted to authorize a strike. 
</P>

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Derek Jeter batted .349 during the regular season  
and is showing no signs of letting up during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter went 2-for-5 in Sunday night's 7-2 victory over the  
Atlanta Braves to help the New York Yankees to a 2-0 lead in 
best-of-7 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The two hits extended Jeter's postseason streak to 15  
consecutive games, dating to 1998. He has hit in 10 straight this 
postseason and is hitting .400 (16-for-40). 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even think about that too much,'' Jeter said. ``Myself  
and Chuck (Knoblauch), that's our job to get on base for the 3-4-5 
hitters. When we get on, we score runs and that's what we wanted to 
do -- especially early in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did just that, scoring three runs in the first inning.  
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch led off the game with a single and Jeter followed with  
another single. Paul O'Neill's single scored Knoblauch and Jeter 
came home two outs later on a single by Tino Martinez. Scott 
Brosius added a run-scoring hit to give the Yankees a 3-0 
first-inning lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was swinging the bat real well during the end of the regular  
season and just tried to maintain that in the postseason,'' Jeter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *MANAGER AGAIN?* Atlanta Braves hitting coach Don Baylor put off  
an interview for the Cleveland Indians managerial position on 
Sunday, but hinted he may already have a job elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who managed the Colorado Rockies until he was fired  
following the 1998 season, was tentatively scheduled to meet with 
Cleveland general manager John Hart on Sunday, but said he had put 
off any interviews until after the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get up in the morning smiling after a loss like last  
night,'' Baylor said referring to the Braves' 4-1 loss in Saturday 
night's World Series opener to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor has already interviewed with the Anaheim Angels, Chicago  
Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers about their managerial openings. 
</P>
<P>
	He basically ruled out the Angels, but it is believed that  
either the Cubs or Brewers, who recently hired former Atlanta 
Braves assistant general manager Dean Taylor as GM, are interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost there,'' Baylor said before Game 2 of an agreement  
with one of those clubs. ``It's just not been done yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would ``like to have all that stuff done and know  
where I'm going before the second week in November,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GLAVINE BACK:* Tom Glavine, who had to be scratched as Saturday  
night's Game 1 starter when he came down with the flu, showed up 
Sunday, but didn't look well. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked bad,'' catcher Eddie Perez said. ``He's lost about  
seven pounds and looks skinny. I told him to go back home and get 
your rest so you can be ready for next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine is scheduled to pitch Game 3 in New York when the Series  
shifts to New York on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be all right by then,'' Braves general manager John  
Schuerholz said. ``We're not going to worry about it. If he's 
better, he'll pitch, if not, we'll pitch someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox said Glavine showed up and threw a little.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to go right back home. He felt pretty good. He  
thinks he can start Tuesday,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BRAVES DH:* When the series shifts to Yankee Stadium for Games  
3, 4 and possibly 5, the designated hitter will be used. Atlanta 
Braves manager Bobby Cox said he will use either Keith Lockhart or 
Ozzie Guillen when left-hander Andy Pettitte throws on Tuesday and 
Jose Hernandez against Roger Clemens in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't change anything for me. I'm starting,'' said  
Lockhart, who was inserted into the lineup for Game 2 against David 
Cone, replacing the right-handed hitting Bret Boone. ``I've done it 
a couple times this year so it's nothing new for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozzie Guillen remembers he did it a couple of times in winter  
ball, but never in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be something different for me, but I don't mind. I might  
be the weakest one, though,'' said Guillen, who hit .241 with one 
home run during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who came to the Braves in a midseason trade with the  
Chicago Cubs, said he was the DH once during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a little different, but I'll be ready,'' he said.  
``It's like pinch hitting. The only difference is you get 3 or 4 
at-bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROCKIN' ROCKER:* New York Yankees manager Joe Torre has a  
pretty good reliever in Mariano Rivera and so do the Braves in John 
Rocker. He was asked to discuss the contrasts in each pitcher's 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a bit different. Mo is ... I don't want to say calm,  
because you know he's not calm inside,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rocker is what short relievers are all about. They've always  
been colorful people for the most part. I get a kick out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker waged a war of words with New York Mets fans during the  
National League Championship Series won by the Braves in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, you have to sort of dismiss some of the things that he  
might be saying critical of fans and the like, you know, he's got a 
lot of confidence,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ETC:* The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by home run king  
Hank Aaron. Singer Patti LaBelle sang the national anthem. ... The 
winner of the 1999 Roberto Clemente Man of the Year Award will be 
announced Tuesday during a news conference prior to Game 3. The 
award is given annually to the player who best exemplifies the game 
of baseball on and off the field. ... The 1999 Hank Aaron Awards 
will be presented prior to Game 4 on Wednesday. The awards, given 
to the best offensive player in each league, will be given to 
Cleveland's Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. ... 
Atlanta's Andruw Jones batted in the No. 8 spot for the first time 
this season. He batted eighth 84 times during the 1998 regular 
season. ... Of the previous 45 teams that have taken a 2-0 lead in 
the World Series, 34 have won the championship (75.6 percent), 
including seven of the last eight starting in 1987. The only 
exception was Atlanta in 1996. ... Road teams that have taken a 2-0 
lead have won the series on nine of 12 occasions, but have failed 
to do so the last three times -- St. Louis vs. Kansas City in 1985; 
Boston against the New York Mets in 1986; and the Braves against 
the Yankees in 1996. ... The Yankees have won 10 straight games in 
the World Series, while the Braves have lost six in a row.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Monday  
ahead of the release of key economic data later this week. Japanese 
stocks rose after gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.86 yen, up 0.42 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo but below its New York level of 105.97 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 137.46  
points, or 0.79 percent, to 17,576.26 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 9.47 points, or 0.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar held steady against the yen  
ahead of closely-watched economic numbers out of both Japan and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were awaiting Wednesday's release of monthly industrial  
production figures in Japan and Thursday's third quarter U.S. gross 
domestic product data for clues about the direction of the world's 
two largest economies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 113.48 yen, down  
from 114.00 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started higher Monday, led by  
high-technology blue chips which rose in line with sharp gains in 
U.S. stocks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among early gainers were electronics companies Sony, NEC,  
Fujitsu and Kyocera. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
172.56 points, or 1.7 percent, to 10,470.25 as the U.S. lawmakers 
agreed on legislation that would remove barriers separating banks, 
insurers and securities brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 14.20 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,528.13. 
The TOPIX closed up 0.99 points, or 0.66 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was  
unquoted in early trading. On Friday, it settled at 1.9100 percent 
and its price stood at 99.07.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine To Elect a New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The poorly dressed, unkempt woman selling  
secondhand clothing at Kiev's Sennoi flea market was furious. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've destroyed the Soviet Union and now they are destroying  
Ukraine. They don't care for the people. What we need is Soviet 
power,'' she snapped, denouncing pro-reform politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The angry tirade scared away a handful of customers rummaging  
amid piles of broken appliances and old shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	A tall pensioner looked around and glared at the woman. ``Look  
at you -- some communist from the bazaar. We've had enough of your 
kind,'' he growled. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments are reverberating across Ukraine, a former Soviet  
republic of 50 million people heading into an Oct. 31 presidential 
election, its third such ballot since gaining independence in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy in ruins, the election is not just about  
choosing a president. It will also be a ballot on whether Ukraine 
keeps chasing Western market reforms or turns back to the Soviet 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 15 candidates want to revive some form of socialism  
and close ties with Russia. President Leonid Kuchma, seeking a 
second term, and a few minor nationalist and centrist candidates 
want to press ahead with market reform and pro-Western policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot enter the same river twice,'' Kuchma told his  
leftist foes on a recent television talk show. ``This is the past. 
Our future is in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Kuchma's lack of popularity in many areas, polls  
indicate he leads the race. But few analysts expect him to get the 
50 percent vote necessary to win outright. That would force him 
into a runoff in mid-November, almost certainly against a leftist 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma's most formidable foes are all leftists: Oleksandr Moroz  
of the Socialist Party, Communist Party chief Petro Symonenko and 
Oleksandr Tkachenko, a hard-line agrarian. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is Natalia Vitrenko, whose brand of populist  
socialism appeals to many disgruntled Ukrainians. The fiery 
Progressive Socialist Party leader has been running second after 
Kuchma in the polls. A grenade attack that injured Vitrenko earlier 
this month also boosted her popularity, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disposition of forces is such that Kuchma would have to  
face me in the second round,'' Vitrenko said in a recent interview 
with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``And don't say that my program calls for a return to the past.  
My program is based on studying and implementing the civilization's 
best achievements,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma's challengers charge he has used state funds and  
officials to help his campaign and has stifled news media. At one 
point, an annoyed Kuchma called his opponents ``non-people'' who 
resort to groundless accusations because they have nothing else to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever wins, things are not likely to get better soon. The  
government has been halfhearted at best about market reforms, while 
leftist opponents have not offered new ideas on how to revive the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1991 Soviet collapse, many ordinary Ukrainians say the  
independence they wanted so badly has brought little improvement in 
their lives and caused many hardships. 
</P>
<P>
	The republic was the Soviet Union's breadbasket and produced up  
to a third of Soviet weapons, but it has seen its agriculture and 
industry crumble as workers go hungry. Ukraine's hopes for 
extensive Western investment have never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment is rising. Corruption and bureaucracy have hindered  
businesses and scared away foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma mostly has avoided strong policies, maneuvering between  
Russia and the West, nourishing ties with NATO while proclaiming 
Ukraine's neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
	His start-and-stop reforms have caused the International  
Monetary Fund and other donors to repeatedly freeze aid to Ukraine. 
But the government's limited reforms have still managed to anger 
the left-leaning parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma did bring inflation down from more than 10,000 percent in  
1993 to 20 percent last year, and has introduced a new and 
relatively stable national currency, the hryvna. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ukraine has resorted to heavy borrowing abroad, and the  
cash-strapped government fails to pay workers and pensioners on 
time. Kiev's foreign debt now stands at more than $12 billion, and 
billions more are owed at home in government bonds and overdue 
wages and pensions.

<HEADLINE> Koufax Appears and Talks About Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sandy Koufax sat in a corner of the room, softly  
talking -- about himself! 
</P>
<P>
	For more than two decades, he has seldom been seen in public and  
almost never is heard reminiscing. But on Sunday, on the occasion 
of his election to baseball's All-Century team, the 63-year-old 
left-hander discussed his 12-year career, which included a six-year 
run that may be the greatest ever by a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd almost rather have a root canal,'' he said. ``Something  
like this in those days would draw eight people. Where did you all 
come from?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has become baseball's Garbo.  
</P>
<P>
	Kids sometimes think the ``K'' for strikeouts in scorebooks came  
about because of him. Many think he's the greatest pitcher ever, 
the original Dr. K. 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax doesn't share that opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	``Spahn, not only for what he did on the field -- he'll kill me  
for doing this -- he pitched in the whole damn century,'' Koufax 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Spahn spent 21 seasons in the major leagues and won 363  
games, the most ever by a left-hander. While Koufax was 165-87 with 
the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, he will be forever remembered 
for going 129-47 from 1961-66, three times finishing with an ERA 
under 2 and once coming in just above at 2.04. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished second in the All-Century voting, trailing Nolan  
Ryan 992,040 to 970,434. He beat out Cy Young, Walter Johnson, 
Christy Mathewson and Spahn in fan voting. Some pretty great 
players, he admitted, didn't make the 30-man All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it detracts from the legitimacy of it, but it  
does make it partially a popularity contest,'' he said, adding that 
some greats who missed ``played at the wrong time, they played in 
small cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He looked like anyone's uncle, nondescript, his hair getting  
whiter by the year. You wouldn't know that he led the Dodgers to a 
World Series sweep of the New York Yankees in 1963 and a seven-game 
win over the Minnesota Twins two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	His career started slowly when he first joined the Brooklyn  
Dodgers in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know where you went for batting practice,'' he said.  
``Joe Black had to show me around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax was wild as a youngster -- on the field, not off. He had  
two winning records in his first six seasons, never finishing more 
than two games above .500. After going 8-13 in 1960, everything 
changed. He learned control and wound up 18-13 with 269 strikeouts 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest thing was I got to pitch on a regular  
basis,'' he said, adding that his roommate, Norm Sherry, gave some 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA and 306 in 1963, followed that  
with records of 19-5, 26-8 and 27-9, ERAs of 1.74, 2.04 and 1.73, 
and strikeouts totals of 223, 382 and 317. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, it all stopped. He retired. He took his flaming fastball  
and nasty curve and went home, becoming a broadcaster for a few 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't regret making the decision. I regretted having to  
make the decision,'' he said. ``At the time, I was risking the use 
of my arm -- the normal use of my arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had felt numbness in his fingers, and quit rather than risk  
permanent damage. He kept throwing a little until four years ago, 
when he hurt his rotator cuff. Other than that, the left arm still 
works. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normal for a 63-year-old,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He won Cy Young Awards in 1963, 1965 and 1966, the standard  
until Steve Carlton, Tom Seaver and Greg Maddux came along, and was 
elected to the Hall of Fame in 1971 on the first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaques pile up, but that's not all that important to  
Koufax. He talks about teammates, not trophies, about what joy the 
Yankees and Braves were experiencing by playing in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest honor is what happens on the field,'' he said.  
``Everything else that happens late in life is anticlimactic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He still matches baseball, admires Mike Mussina, Randy Johnson  
and Pedro Martinez and ``a bunch of guys here in Atlanta, because I 
believe in the outside corner.'' But he doesn't like the current 
philosophy of most pitching coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing speeds is more important than ball movement,'' he  
said. ``I don't believe that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also feels more distant from the Dodgers since Peter O'Malley  
and sister Terry Seidler sold the team last year to the Fox 
division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up with Peter and Terry. They're about the same age,''  
Koufax said. ``Part of the affinity is the people. I'm still a 
Dodger fan, but it's not the same people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He shows up at spring training and talks about Dodgers pitchers,  
makes an occasional appearance to talk with pitchers on the Mets. 
He was teammates at Lafayette High with team co-owner Fred Wilpon, 
whom he says was a much better batter and pitcher in high school. 
He even makes it back to Brooklyn once in a while -- ``I went to a 
pretty good Italian restaurant a year ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the attention players get these days, some wonder  
whether Koufax would have put up with it. He says he could. 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax talked about how he hasn't changed his telephone number  
in 11 years and how some players change theirs every two or three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	But make no mistake, he's not about to become another talking  
head former athlete on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	He has no desire to write about himself, no notion of setting  
the record straight when untruths are said. He just wants to be 
himself, not Sandy Koufax, Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what anybody says about me,'' he said. ``What can  
I do?''

<HEADLINE>  Rose Back in Baseball for a Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Pete Rose was back in baseball for the first time  
in 10 years, his lifetime ban lifted for a single night. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the All-Century team, ``Charlie Hustle'' was  
center stage at Turner Field before Game 2 of the World Series on 
Sunday, getting the loudest and longest ovation of them all. His 
was a 55-second cheer, 15 seconds longer than the welcome given 
Hank Aaron, the city's own career home runs leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, Rose defiantly repeated denials that he bet  
on baseball, and even told a national television audience that he 
never would admit to ``something that didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grinning widely, Rose doffed his Cincinnati Reds cap twice, then  
turned and waved to all areas of the ballpark. After the national 
anthem, he spoke with Ted Williams as the game's greats walked off 
the podium, then posed for a photo by the pitcher's mound as Aaron 
threw out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans'  
voting me on the All-Century team,'' he said, going on to shake 
hands with Paul O'Neill and others near the Yankees' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In a live TV interview following the ceremony, NBC reporter Jim  
Gray repeatedly asked Rose why he wouldn't admit to betting on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised you're bombarding me with this, I'm here to do  
an interview with you,'' Rose said during the riveting segment. 
``You're bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, refusing to change the subject, said the commissioner's  
office had strong evidence that Rose bet on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Show it to me, where is it?'' Rose asked.  
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Rose tried to get Gray off the subject, saying:  
``I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing about that. It's too festive 
a night to worry about it. I'm just a small part of a big deal 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours earlier, as Rose faced reporters during a 25-minute  
news conference, his 15-year-old son Tyler sitting beside him 
wearing a Yankees cap, baseball's career hits leader blurted out 
his feelings: 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, Charles Manson gets a hearing every year, doesn't  
he?'' Rose said. ``This kid thinks his dad's a monster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he went to see his other son, Pete Jr., play in Cincinnati  
in 1997, he said he sat next to owner Marge Schott and felt like a 
pariah. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're paranoid about me being at the game,'' Rose said.  
``Can you park here? Can you go into the entrance? Can you sit 
here? Can you buy a hot dog? A Diet Coke? They're all scared 
they're going to lose their jobs. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time in my life I ever bought four tickets to  
a baseball game. I had -- they made me -- I had to buy the tickets. I 
had to buy the tickets the next night to sit up in her box. I was 
always on the pass list. My son couldn't leave me passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is balding now, the closely cropped hair noticeably  
thinner, the creases on his face deeper. He looked dapper in a 
crisp white shirt, blue jacket, hip tie and pocket square. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at 58, Rose still longs to put on a uniform and return  
to the game he loves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the best ambassador baseball has,'' he said. ``I'll be  
talking about baseball tomorrow in Florida, Wednesday in Chicago, 
Saturday back in Florida, Sunday in Los Angeles, because my name in 
synonymous with the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He named some other in the game who've been given second  
chances: Dwight Gooden, Steve Howe, George Steinbrenner and Leon 
Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think somewhere down the line, somebody's going to give  
me a second chance,'' he said. ``I won't need a third. We all know 
that baseball has a tendency to give people more than one chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and doesn't  
understand why commissioner Bud Selig hasn't formally decided on 
his request. As he spoke, Selig's personal lawyer stood off to the 
side behind a thick black curtain, listening. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner didn't come near him during the ceremony, but  
Rose certainly was given the royal treatment. Baseball's head of 
security, Kevin Hallinan, one of the men who gathered the evidence 
on gambling that got Rose thrown out of the game, accompanied him 
in and out of the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose had missed the formal news conference with the other living  
members of the All-Century team. He was at Bally's Park Place 
Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., with other members of the 
3,000-hit club, signing baseballs for $40, caps for $60 and bats 
for $75. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you can't have a 3,000-hit show if I'm not there,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others didn't share his opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing that he's there,'' said Nolan Ryan, one of  
nine pitchers on the All-Century team. ``It's something you've got 
to deal with. I think the fans look at it differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Rose remained as self-obsessed as ever,  
reciting many of his career statistics off the top of his head. And 
not just the 4,256 hits in a 24-year career ending in 1986, more 
than any other player in baseball history. Little detailed ones, 
like how he got 77 hits (actually 64) off former Brave Phil Niekro. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to be on the team,'' said former Reds teammate Johnny  
Bench, one of two catchers elected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-time All-Star and three-time batting champion, then the  
manager of the Reds, accepted a lifetime ban from baseball on Aug. 
23, 1989, following an investigation of his gambling by 
then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. Despite what baseball 
concluded was overwhelming evidence, Rose has denied he ever bet on 
his sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do anything in my power to change what has happened to  
me in the last 10 years,'' Rose said. ``But I can't change what has 
happened. You know how I feel. You know I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he's banned, Rose remains ineligible for the Hall of Fame.  
He said a compromise in which he'd become eligible for the Hall but 
ineligible to work for a team wouldn't make him happy. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most others, the All-Century team members had mixed  
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with Pete being on the team,'' Brooks  
Robinson said. ``I have a problem with the gambling part and 
putting him in the Hall of Fame. That's the worst thing you can do. 
It undermines the whole integrity of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Navajo Rangers Combat Illegal Dumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) -- Navajo Ranger Kevin Gleason has a  
dirty job, a really dirty job. 
</P>
<P>
	Day after day, he probes and stakes out mounds of rusted  
appliances, broken halogen lamps, egg crates and rotting sofas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones I have a hard time going through are the ones with  
the diapers,'' said Gleason, flashing a quick smile. 
</P>
<P>
	He and four other rangers are digging through these pungent  
messes hoping to stop a generations-old Navajo practice -- open 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no door-to-door trash pickup on the 4.8 million-acre  
Navajo Reservation. It's often-isolated homes and size -- slightly 
smaller than New Jersey -- make suburban-style trash pickup 
impossible, tribal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, rangers began heavy enforcement on illegal dumps  
around the largest Navajo communities, issuing tickets for every 
infraction and picking over trash for identifying information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navajo Environmental Protection Agency has uncovered 465  
makeshift illegal dumps on the reservation and has begun cleaning 
them up. But at an estimated cost of $30 million, it's slow going. 
</P>
<P>
	So for now, Gleason and his fellow rangers are left to fight the  
tide of garbage by donning rubber gloves and face masks and poking 
their way through refuse -- bag by bag, appliance by appliance. They 
look for letters or other information that will identify the person 
who left the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleason visits certain trash piles so often he can immediately  
tell when new black trash bags were thrown in overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for some of these people to understand there's laws  
against it. They say it's their land. We're trespassing,'' Gleason 
said as he sifted through a pair of fresh bags at one site. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting caught can result in a minimum $100 ticket. But Calvert  
L. Curley of the Navajo EPA said the fines can climb as high as 
$600 once all related infractions are added up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a problem for so many years. It's mainly because  
there was no enforcement,'' Curley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Lee Yazzie, 63, said part of the dumping problem stems from  
a lack of respect for traditional Navajo beliefs. Yazzie, a 
community leader in nearby St. Michaels, said traditional Navajos 
believe that they are to keep Mother Earth clean. 
</P>
<P>
	The earth is ``what we live on, that's what we eat from,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He hired a tractor to rip out part of the dirt road leading to  
an illegal dump near his boyhood home, but dumpers cut down trees 
along the road and simply drove around the trenches he cut to block 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Damon, a 67-year-old retiree in Window Rock, said many  
Navajos are reluctant to use dumping stations because they charge 
to dispose of trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have funds to haul their own trash. So what they  
do, the first arroyo or ravine they see, they just dump it in 
there,'' said Damon, who estimates 60 percent of his neighbors 
illegally dump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Us poor people don't save for certain things. We save our  
money for food and lodging. We don't have money for dumping 
trash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon, who pays someone $19 a month to take his trash away, said  
transportation can also be a problem. Dumping stations are 
sometimes dozens of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon and Gleason said some Navajos don't understand dumping  
endangers people's health. Many of the illegal dumps are located 
along washes, dry creek beds that only run during heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say 'When the next big rain comes, we won't have to worry  
about it,''' Gleason said. ``But the next person will.''

<HEADLINE> Fiedler Wins Keirin Cycling Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Jens Fiedler won the Keirin in a photo  
finish Sunday as the World Track Cycling Championship ended with 
the French still dominant in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler defended his title by charging late to edge American  
Marty Nothstein and New Zealand's Anthony Peden. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothstein, a two-time champion, was dropped to sixth for racing  
out of his line. France's Frederic Magne was awarded the bronze 
medal and Peden the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Clignet won the women's points race, giving France its  
seventh gold in 12 events. Clignet, born in Illinois, won her 
fourth gold, and helped France better its performance of six titles 
last year at Bourdeaux, France. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany finished with three golds, four silvers and three  
bronzes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clignet had 20 points to beat Germany's Judith Arndt, with 18.  
New Zealand's Sarah Ulmer got the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish team of Isaac Galvez Lopez and Joan Llaneras was a  
surprise winner in the American Madison. Denmark's Jimmi Madsen and 
Jakob Piil got the silver after leading most of the way. The German 
team of Andreas Kappes and Olaf Pollack was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler's Kierin gold broke up a sweep by the French men, who  
won the other three individual events. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothstein charged past Peden over the final meters and bumped  
Fiedler up the sloped track. But Fiedler recovered with a furious 
sprint to catch Nothstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The French women also starred in the individual events, with  
Clignet winning the 3,000 individual pursuit and Felicia Ballanger 
taking both the sprint and 500-meter time trials.

<HEADLINE> Amateur Lawyer Hooked on Suing Habit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICOPEE, Mass. (AP) -- With Mel Brown, it's always ``res  
judicata'' this or ``de novo'' that. He spouts legal Latin the way 
his blue-collar neighbors talk Monday night football. 
</P>
<P>
	He wears a dark suit and lugs a legal portfolio with the  
``Massachusetts Rules of Court'' highlighted and bookmarked. He 
quotes the state constitution from memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a clerk at the state Supreme Judicial Court thought Brown  
was kidding when he said he wasn't a member of the bar. But the 
tortured souls on the other end of Brown's lawsuits take him very, 
very seriously -- or risk a legal thumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 10th-grade dropout with a GED, never went to law  
school, but he has filed and argued dozens of motions and lawsuits 
with courts and administrative bodies over almost two decades. He 
has acted as his own lawyer before jurors at trial, twice argued in 
person before this state's top court, and lodged legal papers with 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	He works at law about 20 hours a week. ``If I can do the job,  
why should I pay somebody else to do it? And maybe I have better 
ideas!'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v. Wade. Mel's  
law reflects his life and the cares of ordinary folk: union issues, 
utility bills, medical insurance. ``I've had many people say, `Mel, 
don't ever give up! We're afraid to do it, but you're not,''' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	This former president of a firefighters' local has been fighting  
his way through the legal system for the past 21 years. Many of his 
cases stem from his objection to a $40 special assessment charged 
by his union. The fee -- aptly enough -- was meant to pay for 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Motion has piled on eye-glazing motion, year after year, back  
and forth, between Brown and his city and union adversaries: a 
request for summary judgment, a demand for voiding a judge's 
ruling, appeals to a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
	A frustrated judge once blurted: ``We've done all this stuff  
over $40?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely without a retort, Brown recalls snapping back, ``Judge,  
that's my right!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a union-organizing foundry worker, Melvin Arnold  
Brown was born in the rural town of Barre. As a boy, he liked 
baseball, hockey and boxing. He found other contact sports: Once he 
got in trouble for giving a black eye to a schoolmate who tried to 
choke him. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond feistiness, he inherited his unionist father's readiness  
to question authority. ``When you're right, you fight,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, for much of his life, little foreshadowed this knight  
errant of small claims. Brown first worked in factories, then as a 
firefighter and paramedic in Chicopee in western Massachusetts. He 
married and raised three children. Now, at 68, he's retired and 
lives with his wife and two dogs in one of the city's working 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	His life in the law dates to 1978, when Brown balked at the  
union fee and landed a week's job suspension. His fight spread to 
other union assessments and, since payment was a condition of 
employment, he finally got himself fired. Thanks to his Civil 
Service challenge, he also got himself reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	He later sued the union for his legal costs and eventually  
erected other mountains of principle from what some might view as 
molehills. He challenged the city and others over how water and 
sewer rates are set, why the cost of his medical coverage increased 
when he reached age 65. He has won some rounds and lost others. He 
is still chasing $1,389 in legal costs from his old union. 
</P>
<P>
	For his first two years of legal warfare, he relied on a lawyer  
from a foundation that challenges forced unionism. But Brown 
discovered he knew the details of his case best. So he finally 
swore off lawyers, only occasionally seeking advice from a friend 
who knew some labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Brown has pored over books at the local law library  
and confronted the legal system wholly on his own -- ``pro se,'' as 
the courts call it. 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent hearing in Supreme Judicial Court, Brown let fly in  
a strong, clear voice with abundant references to other legal 
cases, arguing beneath the dour stare of Justice Ruth I. Abrams. 
When he finished, she added, ``You did a very good job as a pro 
se.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What do people expect? David Rome, a lawyer for the  
firefighters' union, says Brown has more experience with the 
state's highest court than most lawyers with 20 years' practice. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has more tenacity than many. ``We can't even give in if  
we want to. We've tried,'' Rome says with a laugh. As Brown puts 
it, fixing his piercing blue eyes: ``I'm past the age of 
intimidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His son, David, grows animated when he recalls playing ball with  
his dad long ago. ``I'll tell you one thing about him: He never let 
me win!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his father's endearing quirks win over some who have every  
right to groan at the sight of him. Former mayor Joseph Chessey Jr. 
is a neighbor fond of a chat when Brown walks his dog. ``I think we 
got a good relationship, considering he's sued me numerous times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chessey, who has been questioned by Brown at trial, in turn  
questions Brown's legal skills -- but never, ever his doggedness. 
``He's kind of like a pit bull,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	At other times, though, Brown comes off as mankind's eccentric  
best friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know how you bring peace to the world?'' he asks a man in  
the courthouse elevator. Brown extends his right hand with a 
flourish, and the bemused stranger grins and shakes hands 
awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown recently served up the world-peace shtick to a visitor  
leaving his home. But after the handshake, he added, ``This is the 
other side of the story... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	And out popped his middle finger.

<HEADLINE> WWII Vets Protest Internment Marker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- It doesn't sound like a big deal: a bronze  
plaque on a boulder at the edge of a dusty park where dogs run. 
</P>
<P>
	But to a handful of World War II veterans, the proposal to mark  
the site of a long-ago internment camp for Japanese Americans is a 
bitter affront. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't they wait till I'm dead?'' asks 88-year-old Manuel  
Armijo, who survived the brutal Bataan death march and 3 1/2 years as 
a Japanese prisoner. ``It just opens up old wounds. And it hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armijo was among 1,800 young New Mexicans sent during World War  
II to the Philippines -- half of whom died. 
</P>
<P>
	In his hometown, a city that proudly promotes its rich, varied  
history, the internment camp for ``enemy aliens'' -- United States 
residents who were Japanese -- is barely a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing marks the 28-acre site, now an established residential  
neighborhood. No exhibit or archive tells the story of the camp, 
run by the federal government from 1942-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Chavez, director of the Palace of the Governors, the  
state's history museum, decided a couple of years ago to rectify 
that omission. ``It's history. It's what I should do,'' Chavez 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	He set up a committee that did some research and eventually  
recommended a plaque at a city park on a hilltop overlooking the 
site. Private donations would pay for it. The City Council votes on 
the plaque Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This marker is placed here as a reminder that history is a  
valuable teacher only if we do not forget our past,'' is part of 
the proposed wording. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry, most of them  
U.S. citizens, were removed from their homes on the West Coast and 
from parts of Hawaii and taken to internment camps during World War 
II. Most of the camps were located in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government in 1988 formally apologized for the  
treatment and has paid at least $1.6 billion in reparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Fe camp, operated by the Justice Department and  
surrounded by barbed wire, was largely for Japanese-born men who 
were professionals and community leaders, and therefore considered 
more of a threat. Some had lived in the United States for decades, 
but under federal law could not become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,500 people passed through the camp. They were not  
soldiers, nor prisoners of war. But some Bataan veterans, still 
bitter after a half-century, contrast the internees' treatment to 
their own. They note that the Santa Fe camp had a farm, a garden, 
recreational facilities, classes and a theater group. 
</P>
<P>
	When Japan overran the Philippines and U.S. forces surrendered  
on the Bataan peninsula in April 1942, sick and starving soldiers 
were forced to march 65 miles in the hot sun. Denied food and 
water, they were beaten -- and some were killed -- if they fell out 
of line. The cruelty continued in prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I surrendered I weighed about 160 pounds. Within three  
months, I went to 72 pounds,'' says Arthur Smith, 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith says he opposes the plaque because he wants to forget his  
war experiences. But he is surrounded by memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The walls of his home in the Casa Solana neighborhood -- the site  
of the camp -- are lined with photos, maps and medals. He keeps a 
list of his surviving war buddies, crossing their names out with a 
pink marker when they die. Even his 1945 wedding picture is a 
reminder: His bride's dress was made from a parachute used in a 
food drop after he and other POWs were freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith still sees a psychologist, and he still has bad dreams.  
``I hate for the night to come,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gus Tanaka's father was picked up in Portland, Ore., the  
night Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and ended up in the Santa Fe camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can fully understand their bitterness, and my heart bleeds  
for what these guys went through,'' says Tanaka. ``I really feel 
ashamed of the way Japan treated the Bataan veterans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tanaka said the treatment of the Bataan veterans is a  
separate matter from the historical significance of the Santa Fe 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they're confusing two issues,'' says Tanaka, a  
retired general surgeon in Ontario, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tanaka was drafted into the U.S. Army, he was held with  
his family in other detention camps. They were discriminatory, he 
said, but he understands what led to their creation. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he supports a historical marker, he wouldn't want it  
to hint at any criticism of the U.S. government's actions during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``In war, our nation has not only a legal right but a  
responsibility to protect its citizenry, whether it's ill-conceived 
or not,'' Tanaka said.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Chains Square Off Over Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Two of the biggest names in pizza are preparing to  
fight in federal court this week over claims about who makes the 
better pizza. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Pizza Hut is suing over upstart Papa John's' slogan  
-- ``Better Ingredients, Better Pizza'' -- saying the motto is 
deceptive and implies that Pizza Hut uses second-rate ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville, Ky.-based Papa John's International Inc.  
subsequently countersued, then came back for seconds, filing 
another lawsuit over a Pizza Hut ad that featured Papa John's 
chairman in an unsavory light. 
</P>
<P>
	After jury selection Monday, testimony is scheduled to begin  
Tuesday in Dallas in the first lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut spokesman Jay Allison said he couldn't comment about  
the litigation -- Magistrate Judge William F. Sanderson Jr. slapped 
a gag order on all parties last week -- other than to direct 
inquiries to past statements. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Pizza Hut has accused Papa John's of duping  
customers into thinking they were getting fresh tomato sauce on 
their pizza, ``when in fact they use cooked and concentrated tomato 
sauce, stored in cans for up to 18 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can tell you is our advertising is truthful and  
accurate, and we're confident we'll prevail at trial,'' answered 
Karen Sherman, a spokeswoman for Papa John's. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome is unlikely to give either side a bigger slice of  
the $25 billion pizza business, say analysts. Pizza Hut is the 
industry leader, followed by Domino's, Little Caesar's and Papa 
John's. Pizza Hut, a division of Louisville-based Tricon Global 
Restaurants Inc., sells about four times as many pizzas, though 
Papa John's is growing much faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut is seeking $12.5 million in damages, but that may be  
of secondary concern if Papa John is forced to drop a pithy slogan 
that customers seem to remember. It claims to have spent more than 
$200 million plastering the slogan on everything from store signs 
to stationery. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe Pizza Hut made a strategic blunder by taking the  
dispute to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company with bigger market share doesn't want to highlight  
a competitor or make it seem like a big company going after a small 
one,'' said John Ivankoe of Schroder &AMP; Co. ``This is more an issue 
of egos than financial or economic importance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruised egos and bad blood go back a long way between these two  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Two brothers, Frank and Dan Carney, borrowed $600 from their  
mother in 1958 to open a pizza joint in Wichita, Kan., and Pizza 
Hut was born. They eventually sold out to PepsiCo Inc., which spun 
off its restaurant businesses into Tricon Global. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, John Schnatter knocked out a broom closet and installed  
a pizza oven in his father's tavern in Jeffersonville, Ind. Soon 
they were selling more pizza than booze. Schnatter and his wife 
opened other outlets and called them Papa John's. 
</P>
<P>
	The rivalry became personal in 1997 when Frank Carney, now a  
Papa John's franchisee, made commercials poking fun at the chain he 
helped found but left in 1980. ``Sorry guys,'' he said, ``I found a 
better pizza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut fought back on several fronts, including spying on the  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In an operation called Stoppa the Papa, Pizza Hut executives  
directed employees to shed their uniforms on Thursday evenings and 
stake out Papa John's outlets, counting deliveries and reporting on 
the appearance of Papa John's employees. A senior executive wrote 
that Pizza Hut would ``declare war on these guys!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut also took its complaint about the ``Better  
Ingredients, Better Pizza'' motto to the National Advertising 
Division of the Better Business Bureau, but the organization's 
lawyers ruled the slogan was acceptable as long as it was limited 
to thin- and regular-crust pizza. The setback led Pizza Hut to file 
the lawsuit in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut also responded with its own ad which borrowed from a  
Papa John's commercial featuring Schnatter. Papa John's said the ad 
took Schnatter's comments out of context to make it seem that Papa 
John's uses old dough, and it filed a lawsuit in Louisville. No 
trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Trademark lawyers say the legal case boils down to whether Papa  
John's slogan is a specific claim of product superiority that must 
be supported or is just common boasting, known as puffery in the 
advertising trade. Papa John's says it's no different from Pizza 
Hut slogans, including ``The Best Pizza Under One Roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few expect the pizza fight to spark other lawsuits over  
marketing claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a Big Boy franchisee in Michigan, Elias Brothers, who  
advertise that dinner is better at Elias because 'We use better 
stuff,' and nobody is suing them,'' said Walter Kirchberger, an 
analyst with Paine Webber.

	Poll: Bush, Gore Leading Races  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just over a year before the election, Democrat  
Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush hold strong leads nationally 
in the races for their parties' nomination, a poll released 
Saturday finds. The latest Newsweek poll suggested former Sen. Bill 
Bradley would receive 26 percent of the votes of registered 
Democrats and those who lean toward voting for a Democrat, while 
the vice president would get 49 percent. Those numbers are 
statistically unchanged from a similar Newsweek poll in June. The 
survey said Bush, would win 57 percent of the votes of registered 
Republicans and those who lean toward voting for a Republican.

	Rebels Claim Two Russian Jets Downed

<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechen fighters said they shot down two  
Russian warplanes in separate incidents Saturday, while government 
forces bombed and fired rockets on rebel positions in the breakaway 
republic. The clashes came amid growing foreign criticism of the 
Russian offensive. Russian officials defended the Chechnya 
operation as a war against terrorism. The Chechen Health Ministry 
said that 163 people had been killed and 380 injured by Russian air 
and artillery bombardment on Friday and Saturday, the Interfax news 
agency reported. The toll could not be independently confirmed.

fought a gunbattle with rebels hiding in a cluster of houses in 
Ganderbal, 35 kilometers northeast of the state capital of 
Srinagar, and killed seven militants Saturday, the military said in 
a statement. Residents said several houses were damaged in the

	NEW YORK (AP) -- After days of legal maneuvering about their  
rights to rally, Ku Klux Klan members stood silently inside a pen 
fashioned from police barricades on Saturday and literally faced 
the jeers of thousands of protesters. New York City succeeded in 
unmasking the Klan when a federal appeals court ruled Friday that 
the city could refuse to permit the event if participants insisted 
on wearing their traditional masks. The Klan contingent wore their 
traditional pointed hats, minus the usual face cover.

we can do better,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address, 
adding that he will submit legislation this week that would enact 
part of a Social Security rescue plan he outlined early this year. 
The proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits 
any government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay 
off the national debt.

	Angola Rebels Pledge To Strike Back  
</P>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Angola's UNITA rebels conceded Saturday  
to having lost four key areas to government forces and pledged to 
fight back with sharpened guerrilla tactics, targeting the capital, 
Luanda. A Lisbon-based spokesman for UNITA said the rebels had 
staged a ``strategic withdrawal'' from central highland bases, 
located within 310 miles of the coastal capital to the 
northwest.''The government invested everything in this offensive. 
UNITA picked up its arms and withdrew'' from the bases, Rui 
Oliveira said by phone. He said he had contacted the movement's 
leadership by satellite phone on Friday.

	Yankees Beat Braves in Game One  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Yankees suddenly broke loose for  
four runs in the eighth inning against Greg Maddux and John Rocker 
and, behind Orlando Hernandez, beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 Saturday 
night in Game 1 of the World Series. The Braves managed just one 
hit in seven innings against Hernandez, and only one more against 
three Yankees relievers. Shut down on three measly singles for 
seven innings, the Yankees took advantage of defensive replacement 
Brian Hunter's two errors at first base to rally for their ninth 
straight World Series victory.

	No Contest Ruled in Tyson Fight  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It was another Mike Tyson fiasco -- a punch to  
the jaw after the bell that knocked down Orlin Norris, who claimed 
he couldn't continue because of a sprained right knee. After 
several minutes of chaos following the punch, which ended the first 
round of the scheduled 10-rounder, the fight was called a no 
contest to a chorus of boos and epithets Saturday night. ``I really 
don't want to fight anymore,'' the angry Tyson said. ``I'm tired of 
this.''

<HEADLINE> Barkley Calling it Quits -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- This time he means it. No joke.  
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley even had a halftime ceremony before the hometown  
fans at Sunday night's Houston Rockets-Detroit Pistons exhibition 
game to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, his 16th in the NBA, will be his last.  
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, who has teased fans a number of times in recent years  
with the threat of calling it quits, formally announced his pending 
retirement in the Birmingham Civic Center, just a half-hour drive 
from his hometown of Leeds. 
</P>
<P>
	With his trademark flourish, he announced he would give $1  
million each to alma maters Leeds High School and Auburn University 
and to a program for inner-city Birmingham youth called Cornerstone 
Schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think God gave me this gift so I could play basketball  
and have $50 million in the bank and live happily ever after,'' 
Barkley, 36, said. ``I don't think that's what my life is for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made up my mind that I was going to retire last season,'' he  
told the crowd at halftime of the Rockets' 98-96 victory in which 
he had 13 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. ``A reporter 
asked me, `You have athletes making absurd amounts of money but why 
aren't they doing great things with it?' It really annoyed me, 
because it was true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined at center court by his mother, Charcey Glenn, and  
grandmother, Johnnie Mae Mickens, who raised him together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for me to do something else,'' he said. ``It's time  
for me to have some fun now. I don't think my life could get any 
better. But it's time to do something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-time All-Star has gained fame for his game -- he was named  
one of the NBA's 50 best all-time players in 1997 -- and infamy for 
his mouth. Barkley has been one of the league's most colorful 
players -- on and off the court, known for everything from 
denouncing athletes as role models to once throwing a man through a 
barroom window. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some negative things that have happened that  
people are going to accentuate,'' Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich 
said. ``He's a really good player with a great heart. I love the 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be missed,'' added Pistons guard Grant Hill.  
``There's not going to be another Charles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 252-pound Barkley once remarked, ``If I weren't  
earning $3 million a year to dunk a basketball, most people on the 
street would run in the other direction if they saw me coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is a season-long farewell tour from his final NBA dunk,  
though. Barkley signed a one-year contract estimated at $9 million 
on Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over with,'' he said. ``This is the last night  
I'm going to talk about retiring. I'm not going to let everyone ask 
about it every city I go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley is one of only three players in NBA history with more  
than 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists. The others 
are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks 13th in career scoring (23,468) and is fourth among  
active players. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley led the Olympic Dream Team in scoring in 1992 and 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't lost his skills either, averaging 16.7 points and 12.4  
rebounds last year. Only Sacramento's Chris Webber averaged more 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley's coach at Auburn, Sonny Smith, was on hand Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was not one of those flirtations where he comes off the  
cuff and says something,'' said Smith, adding that Barkley talked 
about possibly retiring over the summer. ``This is something he's 
planned out, how he wants to go out and when he's going out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Barkley first talked to him over the summer about  
making this season his last. He said the NBA would be a more boring 
place without the loquacious Sir Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any doubt about that,'' Smith said.  
``Charles has developed marketing -- both himself and basketball.''

<HEADLINE> Information Biz Generates $623B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The business of America is ... information.  
</P>
<P>
	The information industry, including entertainment, employed more  
than 3 million people and generated $623 billion in income in 1997, 
the Census Bureau reports in a study being released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, there were 114,000 information service businesses  
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest group of these businesses was in broadcasting and  
telecommunications with $346.3 billion in receipts. That included 
$29.8 billion in television broadcasting and $10.6 billion for 
radio broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Income for wired telecommunications carriers totaled $208.8  
billion, more than five times as much as the $37.9 billion 
generated by of wireless telecommunications carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes the Census Bureau's first-ever results for  
cable networks, with $10.4 billion in receipts, and for cable and 
other program distributors, such as cable systems or direct-to-home 
satellite systems, with $34.9 billion in receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite telecommunications operators, another new industrial  
classification, recorded $5.1 billion in receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to publishing, receipts totaled $179 billion, led by  
software publishers with $61.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	California led all states with $18.6 billion in software  
publishing receipts. Santa Clara County alone accounted for $5.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers were the second-largest publishing industry, with  
$41.6 billion in receipts, followed by periodical publishers at 
$29.8 billion, book publishers with $22.6 billion and database and 
directory publishers with $12.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeting card publishers had receipts of $5.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The motion picture and sound recording businesses generated  
$55.9 billion in receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion picture and video production industry brought in  
$20.1 billion while movie. Video distributors had $12.5 billion 
income and exhibitors such as theaters had receipts of $7.6 
billion. Regular theaters accounted for $7.5 billion and drive-ins 
just $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined record production and distribution industry  
followed with $8.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the motion picture and video industries California led all  
states with $26.1 billion in receipts. Los Angeles County accounted 
for $24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's sound recording industries produced $11 billion in  
receipts. New York led all states with $5 billion in receipts, with 
New York City generating $4.9 billion. California was second at 
$4.7 billion followed by Tennessee with $567 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the information and data processing services area, total  
receipts were $42 billion. Data processing services led with $30.8 
billion, followed by online information services at $8.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is one of a series of detailed studies being released  
based on the Bureau's 1997 economic census. This information is 
collected every five years but because of changes in the way 
businesses are classified the 1997 results are not directly 
comparable with the findings from 1992.

<HEADLINE> Boomeritis Afflicts Aging Boomers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Boomeritis'' isn't a formal medical  
condition, but Dr. Nicholas A DiNubile has seen enough boomers with 
exercise injuries to want to call it something. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a mini-explosion of these injuries,'' said DiNubile,  
an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we are a sedentary country, there is one segment  
that the message (about exercise) has hit, and it's the baby 
boomers,'' DiNubile said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that many boomers have the message garbled,  
hearing about the benefits of exercise but not listening to their 
own bodies tell them their limits, DiNubile said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise will reduce your risk of ailments from heart disease to  
diabetes. But ``trying to do at 50 what you did at 20 is going to 
get you into trouble,'' DiNubile said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNubile spoke about boomers' sports injuries at a recent  
meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Although no 
one keeps a national tally on boomers' injuries, other doctors also 
say they are seeing more cases as the generation ages. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the standard over-use trauma -- torn muscles, tendons and  
ligaments, and damage to joints. But aging bodies are quicker to 
develop the injuries, DiNubile said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably a larger problem for weekend people who want to  
look and feel like they did in their twenties,'' said Dr. Clarence 
L. Shields of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic in Los Angeles. 
``They are unable to do so because they have lost some of their 
flexibility, strength and endurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even older pros have these problems, Shields said. ``The level  
of intensity that they have taken to their sport always has been 
very high,'' he said. ``It's difficult for them to peform or enjoy 
a sport at a lower level. They had the mentality that, if you have 
no pain, you made no gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pro or amateur, boomers have to realize that their reaction time  
has lengthened, their joints lack the easy lubrication they had in 
youth, and the elasticity of their muscles, tendons and ligaments 
has diminished, the doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Achilles tendon is a good example, DiNubile said. These  
tough bands of tissue across the bottom of the foot become fatty 
and spongy with age. ``It's no longer the pretty white collagen 
lined up in parallel, but it's this gritty, amorphous stuff,'' he 
said. ``That is a setup. The tendon just tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, middle age is when the body's pre-existing weak spots  
begin to show. Cumulative trauma may develop in a joint, in part 
because the body's ability to recover from the stress of exercise 
is reduced. And getting over an injury takes longer because the 
body also loses some of its recuperative power. 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing the risk is easy -- to avoid an over-use injury, don't  
over use. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to slow them down and say they must listen to their  
body,'' Shields said. Remaining sore longer after a workout could 
be a sign of trouble, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomers must pay more attention than they did in their youth to  
warming up muscles, stretching tendons and ligaments, and doing 
movements to get fluid flowing in joints, the doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also may need to add to their major activities by  
crosstraining, DiNubile said. For instance, runners may start upper 
body exercises to strengthen the arms they swing as they run, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And those who are planning to take up vigorous exercise or  
sports after a long break should first tell a doctor about it, so 
the doctor can make sure the exercise won't trigger some 
otherwise-hidden problem, said Dr. Peter Indelicato of the 
University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	New exercisers should start slowly, perhaps with the 30 minutes  
of moderate activity on most days that the federal government 
recommends as a minimum for better health, Indelicato said. 
Increases should not exceed 10 percent of time, distance or 
intensity in a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would be wise to get new, good equipment and to hire a  
teaching pro to reduce the risks of a training problem that could 
sideline the boomer athlete, Indelicato said.

<HEADLINE> Brosius Steps It Up Again in Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Scott Brosius has regained his hitting stroke -  
and just in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Distracted most of the year because his father was dying of  
colon cancer, Brosius struggled at the plate for the New York 
Yankees. But in the first two games of the World Series, he has 
been their best hitter, getting five hits, including two in a 7-2 
win Sunday night to give the Yankees a 2-0 Series lead over the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind's obviously been in two places at one time and it's  
difficult to really keep focus 100 percent,'' Brosius said. ``But 
we're at a time now where I know that this is what we play for. 
This is the apex of the year, and in another week, win or lose, I'm 
going to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a second straight year, this has been Brosius' time to  
shine. Last year's World Series MVP, he had two hits and an RBI 
Sunday after going 3-for-4 in the opener and is hitting .500 
(13-for-26) in six career Series games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy what the postseason is all about,'' he said. ``But it  
is just a few games. A bloop hit here, a grounder that gets through 
there and you're numbers start to look pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Befitting his unassuming personality, Brosius isn't even sure  
where the trophy is right now, saying it's sitting on a shelf 
somewhere in his basement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1998 World Series against San Diego was special for more  
than his individual accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Maury, was undergoing chemotherapy and could not  
attend the first two games at New York, but saw the final two games 
at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius hit two homers, including a game-winner off Trevor  
Hoffman, in the third game and won the MVP as the Yankees swept the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	That game was the highlight of Brosius' nine-year career and he  
often talks about how important it was to have his father there for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The two relived those memories two months ago, when Scott missed  
six games to go home to Oregon to see his father for the final time 
before Maury died on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question it's been a more difficult year focus-wise  
than last year,'' said Brosius, who missed five more games for the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	After having a career year in 1998, hitting .300 with a  
career-high 98 RBIs, Brosius hit just .247 with 71 RBIs this season 
and was one of the reasons why the Yankees scored 65 fewer runs in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has been in the middle of New York's scoring these two  
games, singling off Greg Maddux to start a four-run rally in the 
eighth inning Saturday night and hitting an RBI single in the 
Yankees' three-run first inning in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's swinging the bat really well again,'' teammate Derek  
Jeter said. ``He makes the offense go from the bottom of the 
lineup. Obviously, everybody remembers what he did in the World 
Series last year. He's stepping it up again.''

<HEADLINE> Lions 24, Panthers 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions keep losing running  
backs and winning games. 
</P>
<P>
	Overcoming the early departure of Ron Rivers to an ankle injury,  
the Lions rode a strong performance by Charlie Batch and their 
defense to stay atop the NFC Central with a 24-9 victory over 
Carolina on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Batch threw for 210 yards and two touchdowns and the Lions  
defense repeatedly made big plays against a team coming off its 
first back-to-back 30-point games in franchise history. Five times 
the Panthers drove to the Detroit 3-yard line or closer, but they 
came away with just three field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who has emerged as the Lions' top runner following the  
offseason retirement of Barry Sanders, rushed just once, losing 2 
yards before leaving with a sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	His replacement, Greg Hill, rushed for 70 yards, helping the  
Lions to their second 4-2 start in four years. Batch, showing no 
ill effects of a throwing-arm bruise that forced him out of last 
week's game, completed 16 of 27 passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina (2-4) was penalized nine times and Steve Beuerlein was  
sacked four times, helping spoil the Panthers' bid to reach .500 
for the first time since December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Panthers' biggest problem was their inability to finish  
drives, thanks in large part to a Detroit defense that also 
intercepted one of Beuerlein's passes in the Lions' end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Batch took care of the offense, going 5-for-7 for 49 yards on  
the drive that put Detroit ahead to stay, a 12-play, 80-yard march 
aided by four Carolina penalties. The drive ended on a 1-yard run 
by Sedrick Irvin that made it 7-3 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Batch drove the Lions for touchdowns on their first two  
possessions of the second half, completing a combined seven of 10 
passes for 99 yards. He capped the first with a 22-yard scoring 
pass to David Sloan and the second with a 3-yarder to Brian 
Stablein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers were at the Detroit 2 three times in the first  
half, but had to settle for John Kasay's two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's opening possession produced a first-and-goal at the  
1, but the Panthers lost 2 yards on two rushes and a third-down 
pass fell incomplete, bringing on Kasay for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sign of things to come.  
</P>
<P>
	Twice more in the first half Carolina got to the Detroit 2, but  
couldn't finish the drives. The first ended when Beuerlein's 
underthrown pass was intercepted by Mark Carrier in the end zone. 
The second ended when linebacker Chris Claiborne sacked Beuerlein 
for an 11-yard loss, leading to Kasay's 30-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth failure came on Carolina's opening possession of the  
second half. The Panthers got to the 3, only to lose 2 yards and 
settle for a 23-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure No. 5 came early in the fourth, with another sack, this  
one by safety Ron Rice, creating a fumble that was recovered by 
defensive end Tracy Scroggins.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Season in Peril </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Only three weeks ago, Michigan was  
ranked fifth in the polls and dreaming of another national title. 
Two straight losses have put an end to that quest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can put a loss like this into words,'' nose  
tackle Rob Renes said after the Wolverines were upset 35-29 by 
Illinois on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 34-31 loss to in-state rival Michigan State spoiled the  
Wolverines' bid for a perfect season after a 5-0 start. But things 
still looked promising, especially since the Spartans lost while 
Michigan had a bye week. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Illinois -- a 24 1/2-point underdog -- and sophomore  
quarterback Kurt Kittner, who passed for 280 yards and four 
touchdowns against a team that prides itself on playing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the passing of Kittner and the running of Rocky Harvey,  
the Fighting Illini (4-3, 1-3 Big Ten) came back from a 27-7 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as it hurt me to feel the way we played, you really  
have to give a lot of credit to them,'' Renes said. ``From their 
standpoint, they played a tough game, a gutsy game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did the things they needed to do.''  
</P>
<P>
	Those are generally the traits of a Michigan team. But this  
time, the Wolverines (5-2, 2-2) were giving up big plays, rather 
than making them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of our guys to bounce back,'' said Illinois coach  
Ron Turner. ``No one believed they could, except the players in the 
locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss dropped Michigan from ninth to No. 15 in this week's AP  
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittner completed 24-of-33 passes with no interceptions. Jameel  
Cook had six receptions for 32 yards, including a 6-yard TD catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittner hooked up with Walter Young for a 31-yard scoring play,  
tossed a 3-yard TD strike to Brian Hodges and tossed a short pass 
over the middle which Harvey turned into a 59-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him at halftime, `Rocky, get ready. If the ball comes  
to you, we need some big plays,''' Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey rushed 17 times for 106 yards, 54 of them on a touchdown  
run that put Illinois in front 35-27 with 59 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we put everything on the line,'' Harvey said. ``It  
didn't matter if we won or lost, we wanted to show people we could 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mission accomplished.  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Brady, who completed 23-of-38 for 307 yards, threw a 6-yard  
TD pass to Marquise Walker and a 31-yard storing strike to Marcus 
Knight for Michigan. Anthony Thomas ran the ball 21 times for 130 
yards, including TD runs of 25 yards and 1 yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone was very disappointed,'' Brady said. ``If we  
go out and play our type of football, we don't lose that football 
game. We just continue to beat ourselves. Championship teams don't 
do that.''

<HEADLINE> Marino's Injury Could Keep Him Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- While quarterback Damon Huard led the Miami  
Dolphins to another win, Dan Marino maintained his position on the 
sideline as a backup and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a scenario the Dolphins might have for the next several  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino will fly to California on Tuesday to see a specialist and  
get a second opinion on his neck injury, ESPN reported Sunday. 
Marino has a bone spur in his neck that caused spasms and weakness 
in the muscle between his neck and right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury has limited his throwing distance and velocity, so  
much so that he has not practiced since starting last Sunday's game 
against New England. He went 1-for-3 against the Patriots before 
being pulled in favor of Huard. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go (see a specialist), it's my business and no one  
else's,'' Marino said after Miami's 16-13 win over the Philadelphia 
Eagles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins declined to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's still having problems throwing the ball,'' coach Jimmy  
Johnson said. ``We kept him as the third quarterback because, more 
than anything else, I wanted him to be a coach today. He said he 
could go in and hand off, but he'd have a tough time throwing the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino might not have had to throw.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins ran the ball a season-high 39 times for 149 yards,  
helping them control the clock for more than 36 minutes. They 
attempted a season-low 21 passes, all by Huard. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard completed 15 for 142 yards and a touchdown. He made only  
one mistake, but it nearly cost Miami the game. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Dolphins leading 13-3 and four minutes to play in the  
third quarter, Huard audibled to a passing play and was intercepted 
by Brian Dawkins, who returned it 67 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they knew it was coming,'' Huard said. ``I didn't  
really see the inside guy and he jumped on it and went the other 
way. He may a good play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interception return for a touchdown was Huard's second in as  
many weeks and the Dolphins' fourth this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Johnson thought Huard played well.  
</P>
<P>
	``Other than checking off to the pass there and giving them a  
touchdown, other than that, I liked it,'' Johnson said. ``We were 
pounding them pretty good, and he felt like he could throw it out 
there for an easy seven or eight yards, but he didn't see No. 20 
there and he picked it off and ran for the touchdown. Other than 
that, I thought he did a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was very confident like he was in New England,'' said tight  
end Troy Drayton, who caught four passes for 38 yards. ``He's got 
the respect of the guys and he deserves it. He's won two games for 
us and right now he's our starting quarterback.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Shake Up Lineup for Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves, who managed just two hits in  
the World Series opener, radically altered their lineup Sunday for 
Game 2 against the New York Yankees, benching Bret Boone, Eddie 
Perez and Walt Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozzie Guillen, Keith Lockhart and Greg Myers all made their  
first starts of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone seemed upset by his benching, while Perez said he  
understood the rationale even though he was MVP of the NL 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stunk as hitters,'' Perez said during batting practice.  
``Why not try something different? It's a short series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were shut down Saturday night by Orlando Hernandez,  
who allowed just one hit -- Chipper Jones' solo homer -- in seven 
innings while striking out 10. Atlanta's only other hit in a 4-1 
loss was a ninth-inning single by Boone. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox shook things up, inserting Guillen at  
shortstop in place of Weiss and batting him second, Boone's normal 
spot in the order. Lockhart took over at second base for Boone and 
batted sixth against Yankees starter David Cone, while Myers 
replaced Perez at catcher and batted seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Andruw Jones, who had 26 homers and 84 RBIs during the regular  
season, was dropped from sixth to eighth in the order. 
</P>
<P>
	``They run two real tough righties at us, Hernandez and David  
tonight,'' Cox said before the game. ``We're just throwing it out 
there and see if they won't change things. We didn't hit much last 
night. What little we did hit got caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After playing 152 games during the regular season and batting  
.474 (8-for-19) during the NLCS, Boone found himself on the bench 
for Game 2. He had 13 strikeouts in 11 postseason games but an 
overall average of .311 (14-of-45). 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys won't get me to say anything,'' he told reporters who  
gathered around the batting cage. ``But, yes, I was very surprised. 
Hopefully, we can go out and get a win tonight. I'll support the 
guys who are in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three newcomers to the Atlanta lineup had a total of just 14  
at-bats in the postseason. But all three are ex-American Leaguers 
and more familiar with Cone than the players they replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen was 14-of-37 (.378) in his career against Cone, with one  
homer and six RBIs. Myers was 2-of-13 (.154) with a homer and two 
RBIs, while Lockhart was 1-for-6 (.167). 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got here, I wasn't expecting it,'' said Perez, who hit  
.500 (10-of-20) with two homers and five RBIs in the NLCS. ``But 
when I saw the lineup, it made sense. ... We've got a lot of good 
guys in the lineup today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most of the Braves were clearly stunned when they saw the  
lineup posted in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unusual for the World Series to change the lineup so  
dramatically,'' said outfielder Brian Jordan, still hitting 
cleanup. ``I know the guys who aren't playing were pretty 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I guess Bob's trying to mix it up, make things happen. We  
only got one or two hits yesterday, so we need to get something 
going. Not to say it was an easy pitcher yesterday to get a lot of 
hits off, but we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings 40, 49ers 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The backup trying to rescue Minnesota's  
season and revive his own checkered career took several huge steps 
in that direction Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so much Jeff George, but Leroy Hoard.  
</P>
<P>
	Subbing for injured starter Robert Smith, Hoard rushed 17 times  
for 105 yards and a touchdown in the Vikings' 40-16 romp over the 
San Francisco 49ers, who lost their third straight game for the 
first time since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are 3-4, but while the 49ers look lost without their  
starting quarterback, best running back and go-to receiver, the 
Vikings appear rejuvenated under Hoard and George, who replaced 
Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't all rosy for Hoard, whose first-half fumble was  
returned 71 yards for a score. George wasn't infallible, either. 
But he enlivened Minnesota's moribund offense, which had sputtered 
for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	George threw an interception in the end zone and didn't even try  
chasing down Darnell Walker on his TD return with Hoard's fumble. 
But he was 15-of-28 for 250 yards and three touchdowns, including 
an 80-yarder to Matthew Hatchette as the Vikings returned to their 
record-breaking 1998 form. 
</P>
<P>
	George also hit Cris Carter for a 2-yard scoring strike and  
Andrew Jordan from 7 yards out to go with Hoard's 1-yard TD romp 
and Moe Williams' 9-yard scoring run. Minnesota surpassed 24 points 
for the first time this season after not scoring fewer than 24 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	John Randle's first career interception -- at the 49ers 15 with  
just three seconds left in half -- set up Gary Anderson's 33-yard 
field goal that gave the Vikings a 24-13 halftime lead. Randle 
sniffed out a screen by Jeff Garcia, who fell to 1-3 in place of 
Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker scored a touchdown as a nickel back for the second  
straight week, scooping up Hoard's fumble and rumbling 71 yards for 
a 10-7 San Francisco lead in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walker was burned one play later. George sent a pass over  
his head and into Hatchette's hands for the 80-yard touchdown, the 
second-longest of George's 10-year career. That put the Vikings 
back on top for good, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
	George faked a handoff to Hoard and hit a wide-open Jordan for a  
7-yard touchdown toss and a 21-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Richey had two field goals in the first half after Vikings  
defenders dropped interceptions near the goal line. His 22-yarder 
followed Jimmy Hitchcock's drop and his 31-yarder came after Robert 
Griffith's drop. He also had a 26-yarder in the third quarter that 
pulled the 49ers to 24-16. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco strong safety Tim McDonald sustained a bruised  
right shoulder and a concussion in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	George, whose reptuation as a talented but troublesome player  
has gotten him run out of Indianapolis, Atlanta and Oakland, 
replaced Cunningham at halftime last week at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoard, a member of the same draft class as George, had his  
troubles fitting in at Cleveland and Carolina before becoming a 
short-down specialist in Minnesota. He's carrying the load with 
Smith out up to six weeks following a hernia operation on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Hondurans Still in Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The baseball field is green and  
impeccably groomed, and the ``Always Coca-Cola'' and ``Drink 
Pepsi'' signs are in place to tempt sports fans to the refreshment 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	But there haven't been any baseball games here since last  
November, when Hurricane Mitch transformed the stadium into an 
``emergency'' shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, there is no sign of emergency -- or any baseball  
games. Just clothes hanging from the windows of the announcing 
booth, children playing on empty cement bleacher seats -- and 
hundreds of parents wondering when they will ever leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel completely abandoned,'' said Ana Maria Lopez, 34. ``No  
one even comes by to ask us how we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year after Mitch, 20,000 Hondurans -- more than 6,000 in the  
capital of Tegucigalpa alone -- are still stuck in shelters, waiting 
to find out when new houses promised by the government, the Red 
Cross and a variety of international aid groups will be built. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mitch swirled off Honduras' coast for a week before making a  
devastating march across the country, as many as 200,000 people 
were herded into stadiums, community centers, churches and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Diego Beltrand, head of the International Migration Organization  
in Honduras, said shelter populations have dropped substantially as 
people returned to homes not destroyed by the hurricane, moved in 
with relatives or got new houses. Most of those who remain are 
among the country's poorest. 
</P>
<P>
	In February and March, officials began moving most of the  
shelter residents into 13 ``macroshelters,'' clusters of small 
rooms made of wooden frames and wallboard with corrugated tin roofs 
and common bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The macroshelters were built so the 70 schools being used as  
refuges could reopen and to give victims more dignified housing 
until their new homes are ready, Beltrand said. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency shelters housed as many as four families to a  
room, whereas the macroshelters give each family its own room -- as 
well as access to schools, health services and day care, said 
Honduras' minister for international cooperation, Moises Starkman 
Pinel. 
</P>
<P>
	The macroshelters aren't much to look at. Trebol II, one of four  
in Tegucigalpa, is built on a barren dirt hill and looks desolate 
save for the bright shades of violet and yellow that residents have 
begun to paint on its facade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a very pleasant place, but it's much, much better  
than how they were in the schools,'' Starkman said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 55,000 new houses are planned for Mitch victims across the  
country. Some 12,000 have been built, and the rest should be 
finished by the end of next year, Starkman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the homes will be built by the new owners themselves,  
who will receive technical help from aid agencies and pay monthly 
installments over a period of years. Some will receive free food 
during the construction, Beltrand said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several different programs helping people build  
houses, and the victims choose which to join. Some appear to have 
fallen into the wrong program. Lopez, with a family income of $145 
a month, has joined the most expensive program available, and will 
have to pay $30 a month for 15 years for her Habitat for Humanity 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine how we're going to do that,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Further frustrating Lopez is the delay.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've said that they'll be finished on Dec. 31, but the land  
hasn't even been prepared for the construction yet,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While people in other parts of the country have moved into their  
homes, projects in Tegucigalpa have been delayed by a lack of land 
and problems getting water and laying streets, and in some cases by 
opposition from residents of neighborhoods where the houses are 
planned, Beltrand said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, everyone wishes the program could go faster ... but  
this is something that needs a bit of time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Starkman said officials are trying to get the  
600 people like Lopez who are still in emergency shelters to move 
into macroshelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Three emergency shelters, including the Hector Sosa baseball  
stadium where Lopez lives, are in Tegucigalpa's ``Olympic Village'' 
-- a sports complex that includes two basketball and volleyball 
gymnasiums, tennis courts and a running track where international 
competitions are held. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the two gyms, the now-scuffed floors are crowded with  
temporary ``houses'' made of tree branches, plastic tarps, old 
blankets and army canvas. The gyms are dimly lighted during the day 
and reek of kerosene, a fuel many Hondurans use to cook their 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
	The homeless refugees at the sports complex use cold-water  
outdoor taps behind the stadium to scrub clothes and bathe. They 
string their wash over hedges bordering the now-unused tennis 
courts and squat to cook tortillas on portable grills. 
</P>
<P>
	Marta Emilia Berrillos, 37, lives in one of the baseball  
stadium's 100-square-foot cement rooms with a sister and brother, 
two in-laws, her mother and 23 children, eight of which are hers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sleep on top of each other,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Berrillos and Lopez hear it is even worse in the  
macroshelters. Besides, they don't want to be bothered with moving 
the beds, televisions, radios, cookware and other belongings they 
have accumulated since moving into the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want them to let us stay here until we can move into  
our own houses,'' Lopez said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Doctors Will Lie for Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A survey of doctors finds that many consider it  
ethical to lie to an insurance company or HMO if patients cannot 
get treatment any other way. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 169 internists in eight cities found that 58  
percent considered it ethical to lie for a patient who needed a 
heart bypass operation but wouldn't ordinarily be covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight percent of respondents also considered it ethical to  
deceive insurance companies or health maintenance organizations in 
order to get intravenous pain medication and nutrition for a dying 
cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentages were lower for less serious conditions,  
researchers said in today's issue of the American Medical 
Association's Archives of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the doctors was asked if he or she had ever actually  
lied or would lie -- only whether it would be justified for a 
physician to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The mailed survey posed hypothetical treatment situations. In  
one, a 55-year-old woman who has never had a mammogram seeks the 
test after her sister dies of breast cancer. Almost 35 percent of 
the doctors said it was OK to say a suspicious breast lump existed 
when it didn't in order to get coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the heart bypass example, a woman suffering angina who needs  
the procedure is forced to change insurance companies. The new 
company says it won't cover the pre-existing condition unless it 
becomes more serious. A majority of doctors said they would lie and 
report that her chest pains increased in frequency to have the 
surgery covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Just under 3 percent said they would tell an insurance company  
that a 55-year-old woman who wanted a cosmetic nose job needed the 
procedure for a medical reason, such as difficulty breathing, the 
poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most physicians (76 percent) believed their primary  
professional responsibility was to practice as their 'patient's 
advocate,''' said researchers led by Dr. Victor Freeman of 
Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	One co-author, Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, said the margins of error  
were different in each hypothetical example and typically were 
between 5 and 10 percentage points.

<HEADLINE>  Summers Calls China Talks 'Useful' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANZHOU, China (AP) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji discussed economic issues and 
China's campaign to enter the World Trade Organization in almost 
three hours of talks Sunday that Summers said were ``very useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu told Summers that China remains committed to reforming  
ailing state-owned enterprises. They also discussed how Chinese 
entry to the WTO, which makes rules for global trade, would benefit 
both countries, Summers told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Premier Zhu and I had a very useful, warm and candid  
discussion on a full range of issues affecting both our economies. 
Our talks were based on a foundation of mutual respect for 
developments in China and the U.S.,'' Summers said after the 
meeting in Lanzhou, an industrial city in northwest China that Zhu 
was visiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Premier Zhu told me of China's continued commitment to  
financial sector and state-owned enterprise reforms, so critical to 
improving its economic efficiency,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's bid to join the WTO has been held up by U.S., European  
and Canadian demands that it first do more to lower trade barriers 
to foreign goods and investment. China says opening its markets too 
far, too fast would hurt it economically. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, who arrived in Beijing on Saturday, is the first U.S.  
Cabinet-level official to visit China since U.S.-led NATO forces 
mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in May, killing 
three Chinese citizens and plunging China-U.S. ties to their lowest 
point in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers will attend a meeting of the China-U.S. Joint Economic  
Committee on Monday for discussions on financial and economic 
policy issues. He also is scheduled to meet Finance Minister Xiang 
Huaicheng and Dai Xianglong, governor of the Chinese central bank.

<HEADLINE> United 1, Fusion 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Roy Lassiter's goal in the sixth  
round of the shootout gave D.C. United a 1-0 victory over the Miami 
Fusion Sunday, completing a two-game, first-round MLS playoff 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington secured the victory when goalkeeper Tom Presthus  
stopped Miami's Tyron Marshall on his shootout attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory advances the United to the Eastern Conference finals  
next weekend against the Columbus Crew, which beat Tampa Bay in its 
first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Etcheverry and Diego Sonora also scored shootout goals for  
United. The Fusion's shootout scorers were Jim Rooney and Saul 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United has eliminated Miami from the playoffs two years  
straight, and like last year, won the second match in a shootout 
after playing to a scoreless tie during regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite both teams being down to 10 players -- after each had a  
starter ejected late in the first half -- United and the Fusion had 
few scoring chances during the final 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C.'s Carey Talley launched a clear shot from 25 yards out that  
was stopped by Cassar. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's best scoring opportunity in regulation came as Eric  
Wynalda had a clear path deep into the D.C. goal area after 
receiving a pass from Nelson Vargas in the 82nd minute. But D.C. 
goalkeeper Presthus kicked away Wynalda's point-blank shot. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, United had the best scoring chances, early  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Moreno's header sailed barely over the goalpost in the  
third minute and Maessner missed a shot wide just outside the 
six-yard area at the 22nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's first scoring threat came in the 27th minute as Welton's  
shot deep inside the penalty area was deflected Presthus.

	``It totally puts law in context,'' says Kirstin Carlson, a  
second-year student at Berkeley's Boalt Hall. ``A problem with law 
school is you can become really myopic. You can get really good at 
contract law, but you can forget to ask yourself: 'How should this 
be? What's justice?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boalt Hall International Human Rights Clinic was started in  
January 1998 by two lecturers, Patty Blum and Laurel Fletcher. The 
idea was to go beyond the traditional teaching tools of simulated 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a simulation class you can carefully control the facts for  
a pedagogic purpose. In a clinic setting, the pedagogic purpose is 
to learn how to be a lawyer by dealing with the real problems 
lawyers deal with,'' Fletcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has six to 10 students a semester, second- and  
third-year students who work under the close supervision of a 
practicing lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students aren't simply thrown in and told, 'Just learn how to  
do it.' Any document is reviewed countless times before it goes out 
of the office,'' says Fletcher, clinic associate director. 
</P>
<P>
	One early case was that of Tibetan monk Jigdol Ngawang, who  
requested asylum last year on the grounds he had been beaten, 
imprisoned and tortured under Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngawang, who began studying to be a monk at age 12, began  
protesting for Tibetan rights at age 15, joining other Buddhist 
monks and nuns who marched outside of a temple in Tibet. Police 
descended and although Ngawang escaped, he was arrested the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	In prison, he said, he was beaten, sharp bamboo sticks were  
shoved under his fingernails, and he was hanged from the prison 
ceiling by handcuffs as police demanded to know who was behind the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, he was released without explanation, but he  
soon learned he was under surveillance and likely to go back to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He fled, spending two months walking across the Himalayan  
mountains and living as an undocumented refugee in Nepal for five 
years before being able to manage passage to California. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparing Ngawang's case, law student Anastasia Telesetsky  
put together Ngawang's declaration of his experiences, 
corroborating news articles and his personal photos and letters. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic, says Ngawang, ``saved my future life.'' Now 28 and  
working at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Ngawang says 
every day is a revelation. ``When I was in Tibet, I was fighting 
for freedom, but I don't really know how freedom is. Now I'm 
experiencing the real freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinic students also worked on the case of a 14-year-old  
Dominican girl who was denied schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was expelled from school after third grade because she  
didn't have a birth certificate. She was born in the Dominican 
Republican to a Dominican mother, but her father is Haitian. Her 
relatives were told it was policy not to give certificates to 
children of Haitian parents, Fletcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the  
human rights arm of the Washington, D.C.-based Organization of 
American States, granted the clinic's emergency request to direct 
the Dominican Republic to enroll the girl in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Working on the schoolgirl's cause ``doesn't compare,'' with  
typical law school classes, says Gina Amato, who with fellow 
student Katie Fleet, worked on the case. ``It's real. There are 
real deadlines. There are real people. There's real passion ... to 
win the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another international project, Carlson spent this summer in  
Bosnia, along with two other Boalt students and three Bosnian law 
students -- one Muslim, one Croat and one Serb. 
</P>
<P>
	The six interviewed judges about how effective the role of law  
has been in social reconstruction. They are now working on a report 
to the International Criminal Tribunal on how it can make its work 
more relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching theory spring to life was an experience to remember,  
says Carlson. ``It was hard and it was amazing and it touched me in 
ways I didn't expect,'' she says.

<HEADLINE>  China Tops Indonesia Head's Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JIMBARAN, Indonesia (AP) -- Demanding new international respect  
for his crisis-ridden nation, Indonesia's new pro-democracy 
president made clear Sunday that relations with the West would take 
a back seat to ties with Asia, particularly China. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdurrahman Wahid also outlined a long list of democratic and  
human rights reforms for Indonesia in his first policy speech since 
his election by the top legislative body on Wednesday, a vote that 
ended more than four decades of authoritarian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid signaled that the reforms would be matched by a renewed  
sense of nationalism in ``Indonesia Baru'' -- the ``New Indonesia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, our honor as a nation, our independence, was  
attacked in a brutal way,'' he said in Sunday's wide-ranging 
address to business people, politicians and diplomats at a tourist 
resort on the island of Bali. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Wahid said he would appoint to his Cabinet some members  
of former President Suharto's disgraced regime. That move defies a 
chorus of calls to wipe the slate clean after the recent ouster of 
former President B.J. Habibie's government, which included many 
Suharto holdovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To attain the presidency, I have to make compromises,'' he  
said. ``But please be assured that although they will be included 
in the Cabinet, I will make it that they should have to follow our 
code: to follow the current government's interests in honesty, 
frankness and, most importantly, our economic development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid is expected to announce his Cabinet lineup within days.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the head of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization,  
Wahid has championed the rights of the nation's influential Chinese 
minority. Indonesian Muslim mobs targeted Chinese during the bloody 
riots and unrest that brought down Suharto in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks on ethnic Chinese residents, who make up only a few  
percent of Indonesia's 210 million-strong population but play a 
major role in commerce, angered Beijing and prompted Chinese 
businessmen to pull out billions of dollars from the country's 
fragile economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know their feelings,'' Wahid said of Beijing in the speech.  
Wahid is almost blind and can no longer read, so he spoke 
off-the-cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	While Indonesia's past regime also had ties to its Asian  
neighbors, it emphasized links with the United States, Australia 
and other Western nations, despite the West's criticism of its poor 
human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid's comments seemed not to signal a major shift in foreign  
policy, but an attempt to build stronger relations with its Asian 
neighbors, particularly China. He said his first official trip 
would be to China -- after an informal tour of the member states of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations next month. He then 
wants to visit Japan and India. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid is not inherently anti-Western. Last week, he met the U.S.  
ambassador and continues to enjoy friendships with past American 
envoys. Earlier this year, he had eye surgery in Salt Lake City, 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say when he might travel to the United States or  
other Western nations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that his impoverished and debt-burdened nation, mired  
its worst economic crisis in three decades, could not rebuild 
without outside help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign investment are key words,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wahid also said he might set up economic relations with Israel.  
He said he would visit Jordan next month for a conference on 
religious tolerance. He lamented that he could not also visit 
Israel because Indonesia did not yet have diplomatic ties with the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
	His pro-Israel stance comes as no surprise. A few years ago, he  
was roundly criticized by other Islamic leaders in Indonesia when 
he visited Jerusalem, where he received an award for his work to 
improve human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't think that I will open a diplomatic relationship with  
Israel,'' Wahid said. ``It is a different thing ... going there and 
having a diplomatic relationship. Maybe we will have, for the first 
time, economic cooperation or economic contacts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said neglected and impoverished regions across  
Indonesia's 17,000 islands would be granted greater autonomy 
through a federal-like system to end years of bloody communal and 
religious violence as well as separatism. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would appoint Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri to  
head efforts to calm trouble spots such as Irian Jaya in western 
New Guinea and Ambon in Indonesia's east. 
</P>
<P>
	He would try to end a separatist rebellion in the staunchly  
Islamic province of Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Wahid and Megawati, the popular daughter of Indonesia's  
founding president, Sukarno, have repeatedly described the 
preservation of national unity as a basic priority.

<HEADLINE> Casino Tries Again in Big Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- More than seven years after the Legislature  
approved the idea, New Orleans begins its second foray into 
big-time gambling with a huge casino across from the French Quarter 
and the city's giant convention center. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the plethora of out-of-town guests that will be within  
walking distance of Harrah's, success is far from assured, based 
upon New Orleans' casino track record and heavy competition from 
casino-hotels on the Mississippi coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Making it in the Big Easy apparently hinges on the casino's  
ability to tie into the city's burgeoning tourist and convention 
business, which hosts about 11 million visitors per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Awaiting gamblers when doors open Thursday night on the $800  
million project are 100,000 square feet of wagering space with 
2,900 slot machines and 120 table games in five New Orleans-themed 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be the best casino in Louisiana,'' said  
Deborah Simpson, a slot-machine attendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino was first pushed by then-Gov. Edwin Edwards during  
his unsuccessful re-election bid in 1987. In the four years Edwards 
was out of office, the Legislature approved a state lottery, 
riverboat casinos and video poker machines. Then, Mississippi got a 
big jump on the city in attracting gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon returning to office in 1992, Edwards pushed the urban  
casino through the legislature. The project was touted by the Wall 
Street junk bond market: After all, casino gambling would be a 
perfect fit in the City of Sin. 
</P>
<P>
	Or would it?  
</P>
<P>
	Fights between two competing groups for the project -- one which  
won the city lease for the casino site and another that won state 
approval for a 30-year contract -- resulted in a compromise 
partnership called Harrah's Jazz Co. 
</P>
<P>
	It took until May 1995 to open a temporary casino in the city's  
municipal auditorium, far away from the tourist-convention hubbub 
and across from a public housing project. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino, which needed to take in over $30 million a month to  
break even, averaged about $12 million before closing in late 1995 
and filing for bankruptcy protection, putting 3,000 people out of 
work. The permanent casinos building sat unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
	What finally emerged in late 1998 was a new publicly-traded  
ownership company, Jazz Casino Co., whose majority owners were the 
holders of $435 million in Harrah's Jazz junk bonds. Harrah's 
Entertainment is the largest minority partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question for the new casino and its 2,800 employees is  
the same as it was several years ago: Whether enough gamblers will 
drop enough money for it to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Sevigny, president of Harrah's New Orleans Management Co.,  
which will manage the new casino, said that since 1995, the city's 
tourist-convention industry has grown from 8 million to 11 million 
visitors annually, and their annual spending has increased from $3 
billion to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the state gambling board was told that Harrah's is  
aiming for a first-year win from gamblers of $345 million, about 
$29 million a month. Sevigny won't provide an updated estimate, but 
says he expects 45 percent of the customers to be area residents 
who will provide about 35 percent of the casino's winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Harrah's has three major obstacles to overcome. To  
protect the existing tourist industry, the state ruled that the 
casino cannot have its own hotel and it is restricted to a 250-seat 
buffet restaurant and a few standup dining vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the state will impose a minimum tax of $100  
million, which is due no matter how much the casino takes in. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrah's has deals for rooms in 10 hotels near the casino and  
has lined up 15 restaurants to accept its vouchers. Harrah's plans 
to use a database of 11 million regular customers to tout a trip to 
New Orleans -- and the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the $100 million tax, Sevigny calls it ``an ominous  
number,'' but adds optimistically: ``When you see the potential of 
this casino, it's a much-more manageable number.''

	PEARL, Miss. (AP) -- A guard taken hostage by a state prison  
inmate was released several hours later after the suspect was 
allowed to speak to his family, authorities said.

	James Albert Polk surrendered to authorities about 11:35 p.m.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball All-Century Team Assembles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Willie Mays and Ken Griffey Jr. steadied a  
fragile Ted Williams. Mike Schmidt played a quick game of catch 
with Hank Aaron. And a teary-eyed Pete Rose got the longest ovation 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
	From Ruth to Ripken, Mays to McGwire and Cobb to Clemens,  
baseball's ultimate dream team was honored Sunday night in an 
emotional ceremony before Game 2 of the World Series that brought 
together several generations of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18 living members of the 30-player All-Century team -- the  
most glorious gathering of baseball talent ever assembled on one 
field -- stood on a podium at second base at Turner Field, where a 
sellout crowd roared its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In the outfield, the oversized uniforms of all the players,  
living and dead, were unfurled as the names were announced in the 
lilting tones of Hall of Fame announcer Vin Scully. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves stood at the  
top steps of their dugouts and applauded the greatest players of 
the century. Yankees reliever Jason Grimsley videotaped the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	For a moment, the intensity of the World Series was set aside  
for a salute to baseball's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most poignant moment came when Mays and Griffey  
helped the 81-year-old Williams to a seat on the podium, with Aaron 
steadying the chair. Williams, weakened by a series of strokes, 
acknowledged the cheers with a wave of his Red Sox cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch, limbered up  
beforehand by playing catch with Schmidt across the mound. After 
Aaron delivered, Mays also tossed one over the plate for good 
measure -- with no catcher behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rose stole the show.  
</P>
<P>
	The All-Century team, elected by the fans, is comprised entirely  
of Hall of Famers or those headed there. The exception is Rose, who 
is ineligible for Cooperstown after being banned from baseball in 
1989 for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest ovation went to Rose, suspended from baseball and  
making his first appearance at a major league field in 10 years. 
The crowd cheered baseball's all-time hits leader for 55 seconds as 
he repeatedly tipped his Cincinnati Reds cap. Other members of the 
All-Century team, some of them critical of Rose's behavior, also 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable. I thought I hit a grand slam to win the  
World Series in Game 7,'' a tearful Rose said after he came off the 
field. ``I thought I broke the record all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snubbed in July when the 100 players on the ballot were  
introduced at the All-Star Game in Boston, Rose was still chosen. 
In an Associated Press poll conducted earlier this month, nearly 
eight out of 10 people asked said he should be here. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic 25-man roster, elected in a nationwide balloting, was  
supplemented with five players added by a special panel of baseball 
executives, media and historians. Rose, the all-time hit king with 
4,256, was the last of nine outfielders chosen by the fans and 
appeared on a major league field for the first time since his 
suspension 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy I'm one of the nine,'' Rose said before the  
ceremony. ``It's fun to be back at the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a sharp interview on national TV after the ceremony, Rose  
turned combative when asked if he would simply admit to wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to admit to something that didn't happen,'' he  
said defiantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Rose in the All-Century outfield were fan choices Aaron,  
Mays, Williams, Griffey, Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and 
Ty Cobb. Stan Musial was added by the special panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan balloting chose six pitchers -- Nolan Ryan, Sandy Koufax, Cy  
Young, Roger Clemens, Bob Gibson and Walter Johnson. Lefty Grove, 
Warren Spahn and Christy Mathewson were added. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the team had catchers Johnny Bench and Yogi  
Berra, first basemen Lou Gehrig and Mark McGwire, second basemen 
Jackie Robinson and Rogers Hornsby, shortstops Cal Ripken Jr., 
Ernie Banks and Honus Wagner, who was added, and third basemen 
Schmidt and Brooks Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig and Ruth, cornerstones of the New York Yankees Murderers  
Row teams in the 1920s and '30s, were the leading vote-getters. 
Gehrig had 1,207,992 and Ruth 1,158,044. Among the active players, 
Ripken received the most votes (669,033). Rose got 629,742. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, McGwire, Griffey and Clemens were the lone active  
players picked. 
</P>
<P>
	Bench and Gibson recalled playing with many of the All-Century  
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called the pitch that Aaron hit for his 714th home run and  
shook his hand as he crossed the plate,'' Bench said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson is the man many say they would pick to pitch Game 7 of a  
World Series. ``That would be my answer, too,'' Gibson said, 
confidently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson recalled the All-Star game ceremony and wondered if he  
belonged in this All-Century group. ``Then I looked around,'' he 
said, ``and most of the other guys I got out.''

<HEADLINE>  Baseball All-Century Team Assembles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Willie Mays and Ken Griffey Jr. steadied a  
fragile Ted Williams. Mike Schmidt played a quick game of catch 
with Hank Aaron. And a teary-eyed Pete Rose got the longest ovation 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
	From Ruth to Ripken, Mays to McGwire and Cobb to Clemens,  
baseball's ultimate dream team was honored Sunday night in an 
emotional ceremony before Game 2 of the World Series that brought 
together several generations of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18 living members of the 30-player All-Century team -- the  
most glorious gathering of baseball talent ever assembled on one 
field -- stood on a podium at second base at Turner Field, where a 
sellout crowd roared its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In the outfield, the oversized uniforms of all the players,  
living and dead, were unfurled as the names were announced in the 
lilting tones of Hall of Fame announcer Vin Scully. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves stood at the  
top steps of their dugouts and applauded the greatest players of 
the century. Yankees reliever Jason Grimsley videotaped the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	For a moment, the intensity of the World Series was set aside  
for a salute to baseball's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most poignant moment came when Mays and Griffey  
helped the 81-year-old Williams to a seat on the podium, with Aaron 
steadying the chair. Williams, weakened by a series of strokes, 
acknowledged the cheers with a wave of his Red Sox cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch, limbered up  
beforehand by playing catch with Schmidt across the mound. After 
Aaron delivered, Mays also tossed one over the plate for good 
measure -- with no catcher behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rose stole the show.  
</P>
<P>
	The All-Century team, elected by the fans, is comprised entirely  
of Hall of Famers or those headed there. The exception is Rose, who 
is ineligible for Cooperstown after being banned from baseball in 
1989 for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest ovation went to Rose, suspended from baseball and  
making his first appearance at a major league field in 10 years. 
The crowd cheered baseball's all-time hits leader for 55 seconds as 
he repeatedly tipped his Cincinnati Reds cap. Other members of the 
All-Century team, some of them critical of Rose's behavior, also 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable. I thought I hit a grand slam to win the  
World Series in Game 7,'' a tearful Rose said after he came off the 
field. ``I thought I broke the record all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snubbed in July when the 100 players on the ballot were  
introduced at the All-Star Game in Boston, Rose was still chosen. 
In an Associated Press poll conducted earlier this month, nearly 
eight out of 10 people asked said he should be here. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic 25-man roster, elected in a nationwide balloting, was  
supplemented with five players added by a special panel of baseball 
executives, media and historians. Rose, the all-time hit king with 
4,256, was the last of nine outfielders chosen by the fans and 
appeared on a major league field for the first time since his 
suspension 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy I'm one of the nine,'' Rose said before the  
ceremony. ``It's fun to be back at the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a sharp interview on national TV after the ceremony, Rose  
turned combative when asked if he would simply admit to wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to admit to something that didn't happen,'' he  
said defiantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Rose in the All-Century outfield were fan choices Aaron,  
Mays, Williams, Griffey, Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and 
Ty Cobb. Stan Musial was added by the special panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan balloting chose six pitchers -- Nolan Ryan, Sandy Koufax, Cy  
Young, Roger Clemens, Bob Gibson and Walter Johnson. Lefty Grove, 
Warren Spahn and Christy Mathewson were added. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the team had catchers Johnny Bench and Yogi  
Berra, first basemen Lou Gehrig and Mark McGwire, second basemen 
Jackie Robinson and Rogers Hornsby, shortstops Cal Ripken Jr., 
Ernie Banks and Honus Wagner, who was added, and third basemen 
Schmidt and Brooks Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig and Ruth, cornerstones of the New York Yankees Murderers  
Row teams in the 1920s and '30s, were the leading vote-getters. 
Gehrig had 1,207,992 and Ruth 1,158,044. Among the active players, 
Ripken received the most votes (669,033). Rose got 629,742. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, McGwire, Griffey and Clemens were the lone active  
players picked. 
</P>
<P>
	Bench and Gibson recalled playing with many of the All-Century  
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called the pitch that Aaron hit for his 714th home run and  
shook his hand as he crossed the plate,'' Bench said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson is the man many say they would pick to pitch Game 7 of a  
World Series. ``That would be my answer, too,'' Gibson said, 
confidently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson recalled the All-Star game ceremony and wondered if he  
belonged in this All-Century group. ``Then I looked around,'' he 
said, ``and most of the other guys I got out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spahn, who pitched before Gibson and Bench played, hesitated to  
compare generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's better depends whose eyes you're looking through,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax was asked who he thought the best pitcher was and he  
picked Spahn, who won more games than any left-hander in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only for what he did on the field,'' he said. ``He'll kill  
me for doing this: He pitched in the whole damn century.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	``Making the All-Century team, that's great,'' he said. ``Spahn  
made it for last century and this century. Now that's amazing.''

<HEADLINE> Black Actress May Get Part of Wish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nearly 50 years after actress Hattie  
McDaniel's death, the Oscar-winning co-star of ``Gone With the 
Wind'' will come close to getting her final wish. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel, the first black to win an Academy Award, asked in her  
will to be buried at the Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, the 
final resting place of Mel Blanc, Rudolph Valentino and Benjamin 
``Bugsy'' Siegel, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in  
my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and 
a pillow of red roses,'' McDaniel wrote. ``I also wish to be buried 
in the Hollywood Cemetery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when she died in 1952 of breast cancer at age 57, the Los  
Angeles cemetery did not take blacks. McDaniel was buried instead 
at Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the new owners of the Hollywood cemetery, which was renamed  
Hollywood Forever, are installing a memorial to recognize McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the 47th anniversary of her death, they will place a  
gray and pink granite monument next to a lake at the cemetery in 
view of the landmark Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was so much that was done wrong here,'' said Tyler  
Cassity, who bought the cemetery in 1998. ``It was karma where we 
thought clearly they made a horrible decision and it is in our 
power to correct it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cemetery changed its policy after 1959, but only three black  
people are buried at the park out of 80,000 graves, Cassity said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel won the Oscar for her role as ``Mammy'' in ``Gone With  
the Wind,'' released in 1939.

<HEADLINE> 'The Best Man' No. 1 At Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Moviegoers packed theaters for ``The Best  
Man'' as if flocking to a favorite cousin's wedding, lifting the 
comedy to a first-place debut at a crowded weekend box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Best Man,'' starring Taye Diggs in a romantic wedding  
romp, took in $9.1 million in its opening weekend, according to 
industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead'' had a so-so opening  
weekend with $6.2 million for fourth place. ``Crazy in Alabama,'' 
directed by Antonio Banderas and starring wife Melanie Griffith, 
premiered dismally with $1 million to finish well out of the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bats,'' about swarms of killer-winged things on a rampage in a  
Texas town, opened in seventh place with $4.7 million. ``Three to 
Tango,'' a romantic comedy with Neve Campbell, Matthew Perry and 
Dylan McDermott, was eighth with $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier releases still crowded the field, cutting into business  
for new films. ``Double Jeopardy'' remained the No. 2 movie, 
grossing $7.7 million in its fifth weekend, pushing its total take 
up to $91 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's top film, ``Fight Club,'' fell to third place  
with $6.3 million. ``The Story of Us'' was No. 5 with $5.5 million 
and ``American Beauty'' placed sixth with $5.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Double Jeopardy' is still siphoning off that mature audience  
so many of the fall films go after,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie 
ticket sales. ``It's making it tough for some of these newcomers to 
break in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Best Man'' had the broadest appeal of all the weekend's  
new movies, with universal themes about the ``hesitancy of men to 
commit and that bachelor party thing,'' Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-produced by Spike Lee and written and directed by his cousin  
Malcolm D. Lee, the movie stars Diggs as a writer who is best man 
at a friend's wedding. Bedlam breaks loose when a bridesmaid, 
played by Nia Long, obtains an advance copy of Diggs' steamy novel 
that borrows heavily from the lives of the wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend audience for ``Best Man'' was 80 percent to 85  
percent black, but ``the movie did very well across the board,'' 
said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which 
released the film. ``It played well with the white community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film played in just 1,346 theaters and averaged $6,761 a  
screen. ``Double Jeopardy'' was on 3,002 screens and averaged 
$2,565, while ``Bringing Out the Dead'' opened in 1,936 cinemas and 
averaged $3,202. 
</P>
<P>
	Scorsese's movie drew more of a niche crowd for those who like  
their movies gritty and a bit depressing. ``Bringing Out the Dead'' 
stars Nicolas Cage and Patricia Arquette in a maniacally paced 
drama about a New York City paramedic on the verge of a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really plays strongly in urban markets, New York, Chicago,  
San Francisco, and not as strong in the smaller markets,'' said 
Wayne Lewellen, distribution president for Paramount, which 
released ``Bringing Out the Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations. Final figures 
were to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Best Man,'' $9.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $7.7 million  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Fight Club,'' $6.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' $6.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Story of Us,'' $5.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``American Beauty,'' $5.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Bats,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Three to Tango,'' $4.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $4.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Three Kings,'' $4.29 million.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Player Accused of War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A star Bosnian soccer player in Spain is  
accused of being a war criminal. His club says he is a victim of 
mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Darko Ljubojevic, who plays for the third-division club Cadiz,  
is trying to become a Spanish citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	He needed only a document from Interpol to show he was not on  
any wanted list, a requirement made of most Balkan players in 
Europe, the newspaper El Mundo reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the international police body's records showed a Bosnian of  
the same name was indeed wanted for war crimes. The team's lawyers 
are trying to sort out the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljubojevic has missed the season's opening games because he was  
sick. This dispute probably will sideline him several months. 
</P>
<P>
	He played in the Spanish second division two seasons ago.  
Ljubojevic returned to his home country before coming back to Spain 
this season.

<HEADLINE> FSU, Clemson Coaches Can Relax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- The words of praise from father to son at  
midfield in Death Valley will have to do for now for Bobby and 
Tommy Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	While the two could finally relax -- Bobby Bowden's victory No.  
300 was secure and their father vs. son showdown was done -- Tommy 
said Sunday the family might not reflect on the game's importance 
until their annual summer reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get to see him for such a brief time,'' Tommy Bowden said a  
day after No. 1 Florida State (8-0, 6-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) 
rallied to defeat Clemson 17-14. ``And it's not only (Bobby), 
there's my other brother (Jeff). We usually don't see that crowd 
until summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a long week of buildup for the few minutes Bobby and  
Tommy met in the center of the field Saturday night. Both coaches 
spoke to their teams, did their radio shows, spoke to the media and 
left with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That handshake was about it,'' Tommy Bowden said. ``Then  
you're gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's national title hopes and Bowden's milestone were  
in doubt for much of the game. Bowden's still not sure how his team 
managed to beat Clemson (3-4, 3-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those games you go out there and play and you  
feel like you're losing, you're losing, you're losing and you're 
going to get beat,'' Bowden said. ``Then all of a sudden you win it 
and I don't even know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State remained No. 1 in the latest Associated Press  
college football poll. It received 55 first-place votes from the 
panel and led No. 2 Penn State, 1,733 points to 1,684. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Bowden -- that chip off the ol' whistle -- did about all he  
could to steal this one from his old man. ``I told him after the 
game he outtricked me 3-0,'' said Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy's Tigers (3-4, 3-2) converted a fake punt for 23 yards on  
the way to Clemson's first touchdown. And he called a double 
reverse, throw-the-ball back to quarterback Woody Dantzler for 
another first down. 
</P>
<P>
	But trailing 17-14 and faced with a fourth-and-1 from Florida  
State's 30, the younger Bowden played it straight, going for a 
tying 41-yard field goal that failed. Tony Lazarra looked like he 
kicked the ground and Seminoles cornerback Tay Cody got a hand on 
the kick, Tommy Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy crouched on the sidelines alone, head down, as time ran  
out. ``I was more disappointed that we missed a chance to beat the 
number one team in the country and with any familial ties,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Warrick, back for Florida State after missing the past two  
games with legal troubles, caught 11 passes for 121 yards. But when 
he had chances to make a difference, he dropped plays he'd normally 
break for big yards. Warrick chose not to talk to reporters after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden thought the distraction of Warrick's situation -- he  
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petty theft on Friday for a 
department store scam and was finally cleared to play -- led to his 
inconsistency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen Peter do what he did tonight since he was a  
freshman,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Minor scored on a 1-yard run and Chris Weinke threw to  
Dan Kendra for a 2-point conversion with 10 seconds left in the 
third quarter as Florida State tied it 14-all. 
</P>
<P>
	Sebastian Janikowski's third field goal, a 39-yarder, with 5:26  
was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	The win kept alive the Seminoles' drive for Bowden's second  
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team hasn't been beat,'' Weinke said, ``and we don't  
think we will be beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden joined Bear Bryant, Pop Warner, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Joe  
Paterno as the only major college coaches to reach 300 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's victory wrapped a week unlike the Bowdens  
probably had ever seen. The family -- from Bobby to wife Ann to sons 
Bobby, Terry, Jeff and Steve, to brother-in-law Jack Hines and 
Tommy's wife, Linda -- shared some personal, funny and embarrassing 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Bowden sat with a sweatshirt half Clemson, half Florida  
State. Everyone in college football's first family pretty much left 
satisfied, its patriarch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mama's happy, I know,'' Bobby Bowden said of his wife. ``She  
wanted a close game and that I would win because I'm older. She 
wanted her boy to look good and he looked good. He looked too good 
to suit me.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing: Lost Sale No Major Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- China's decision to buy 28 planes valued at $2.5  
billion from Airbus Industrie is a disappointment to the Boeing Co. 
but not a major setback, a spokesman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a long and close relationship with the Chinese and  
we expect that to continue,'' said Mark Hooper, a spokesman for 
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. ``This is a win for Airbus and 
the next time we expect to get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase consists of eight A340s, the largest model made by  
the European consortium, plus 10 A318s and 10 A319s, all assembled 
at Toulouse, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced Saturday evening by French President  
Jacques Chirac and Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin, who was visiting 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good for Europe, good for France and good for  
employment,'' Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom McLean, Boeing's spokesman in China, told The Seattle Times  
on Saturday that the sale was not related to troubled U.S. 
relations with China over the recent U.S. indictment of Boeing's 
McDonnell Douglas unit and a Chinese aerospace firm on charges of 
violating export-control laws, or to China's failure to gain 
membership in the World Trade Organization, which meets here later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, China bases these decisions on what they believe  
is a good business plan,'' McLean said.

<HEADLINE> Zagat: NY Restaurant Costs, Tips Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Diners spend about $10 more per meal to eat in  
New York restaurants than their counterparts pay across the 
country, but they don't seem to mind -- they're leaving bigger tips. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a meal in a New York restaurant, including  
drink, tax and tip, was $33.17 in 1999, up from $31.68 last year, 
according to the 2000 edition of the Zagat New York City Restaurant 
Survey, released to the press on Sunday. That's the highest price 
since the 1990 recession, the guide said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average for 24 cities surveyed by Zagat was $23.84  
per meal, according to Zagat. 
</P>
<P>
	The average tip left by those who participated in Zagat's survey  
of New York restaurants was 18 percent, up one percentage point 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone appears to enjoy restaurant service equally. Eighty  
percent of the 19,227 diners who participated in the Zagat survey 
said they think men are treated better in restaurants than women. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual Zagat guide is based on reviews from consumers who  
fill out questionnaires rating food, decor, service and cost, then 
pick out their five favorite eateries. The 2000 guide is due out 
Monday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Claiming that the Washington elite of the GOP  
had left him, Republican Pat Buchanan said today he will seek the 
reform party presidential nomination. Buchanan said in a letter 
seeking money for his new campaign that issues of extreme

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Awakening from a ``nightmare of apathy  
and fear,'' millions of Colombians marched Sunday in the largest 
anti-war protest in nearly four decades of civil strife as 
long-awaited peace negotiations began in a rebel-held town. 
Claiming inspiration from such nonviolent crusaders as Mohandas 
Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., marchers in 15 major cities and 
dozens of towns turned out to demand a cease-fire, swift progress 
in peace talks and an end to violence against civilians -- the 
principal victims of a war that has claimed at least 30,000 lives.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- At least 39 people had been killed and  
dozens more injured in Russian attacks, Chechen officials said 
Sunday. The casualty figures could not be confirmed, and the 
Russian command did not offer any estimates of its own. It stressed 
that the attacks were aimed at militants rather than civilians. The 
Chechens did not say if the casualties included rebel fighters. 
Although Russian warplanes pummeled towns around Grozny today, the 
Chechen capital was calm, though most people ventured out of 
basement bomb shelters only to cook food on campfires in the

a U.S. helicopter, with soldiers from the multinational

image of Carnahan was published in 1960 in the Rolla Daily News. 
Carnahan's campaign adviser said the picture represents the last

over accusations of racism leveled at Ashcroft, Republican 
activists contend the photo reveals Carnahan is not the progressive 
Democrat he claims to be.

Ditka $20,000 for making obscene gestures to fans at the Superdome 
after they booed the team. Unlike the last four games where the

New York (4-3) finally found a big-play offense to go along with 
its outstanding defense.

<HEADLINE> How To Open a Champagne Bottle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REIMS, France (AP) --The fancy French way to open champagne is  
with a saber. Or, if your regimental sword is not handy, with a 
heavy kitchen knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Slide the back of the blade smartly down the neck, striking the  
glass around the cork. With luck, the glass breaks in a clean 
circle, the cork sails across the room, and bubbles foam out of the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is an easier way.  
</P>
<P>
	Remove the wire and grasp the cork with one hand, using a towel  
to avoid cuts from the metal disk. With the other hand, rotate the 
bottle slowly to ease the cork out. Turn the bottle, not the cork. 
As the cork emerges, press it down to control the escaping gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Before opening, champagne should be iced in a bucket, turned  
frequently and not left long enough to overchill. Do not leave it 
for more than a day in a refrigerator, or it is likely to go flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The right glass is important. A famous picture shows Marilyn  
Monroe sipping champagne from a wide-mouthed stemmed affair. Wrong, 
wrong, wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The large surface allows too many bubbles to escape, carrying  
off fizz and fun. A flute is the standard glass, but most experts 
prefer a tulip shape, which concentrates flavor under the nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Champagne does not stay bubbly for long after it is opened. Some  
people swear by a silver spoon down the neck. Airtight tops gain 
more time, but they also trap air inside the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	The best method, champagne lovers assert, is to drink it up. All  
of it.

<HEADLINE> Fleisher Wins Kaanapali Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAANAPALI, Hawaii (AP) -- Bruce Fleisher tied the Senior PGA Tour  
rookie record with his seventh victory of the year, beating Allen 
Doyle by one stroke Sunday to win the Kaanapali Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher had a 4-under 67 in the final round for a 14-under 199  
total and the winner's purse of $150,000 extended his lead on the 
money list and put him at $2,288,005. 
</P>
<P>
	His seven victories matches the record set by Bruce Crampton in  
1986 and matched by Lee Trevino in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a year I'll remember for a long time,'' said Fleisher,  
who won once in over 400 starts on the PGA Tour. ``I'd love to 
break the record, if it's possible with two tournaments to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle shot a 66 Sunday at the 6,590-yard Kaanapali North Course  
on Maui Island and finished three strokes in front of Steve Veriato 
(64), Jim Ahern (65), Hale Irwin (66) and Tom Jenkins (70). 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't give Bruce two strokes,'' said Doyle, a four-time  
winner this year who finished second to Fleisher for the third 
time. ``We need to reverse it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, the tour's money champion the last two years, is second  
on the list with Doyle third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce is playing well and Allen is playing well,'' Irwin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Irwin trails Fleisher by $311,183 with two tournaments  
remaining, including the Senior Tour Championship, worth $300,000 
to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still in running for that top number one, but this  
(victory) one certainly helps,'' Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen played terrific today. We were neck and neck.''  
</P>
<P>
	Playing together in the final group, Doyle tied Fleisher three  
times with birdies at 5, 8 and 14, the last to go 13 under. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher made a 12-footer for a birdie at the par-4 16th to go  
ahead to stay. Doyle missed a birdie opportunity from 6 feet at the 
par-3 17th that would have tied Fleisher again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen probably wins the tournament if he makes that putt,''  
Fleisher said. ``It would have made 18 really interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Green bogeyed No. 18 to close with a 64 and finished at  
204 with John Jacobs and Brian Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kermit Zarley posted the day's best round, an 8-under 63, and  
finished at 205.

	The event was sponsored by EMC.

<HEADLINE> Low-Carb Diets Are Back in Fashion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As general manager of Gallagher's Steak House in  
midtown Manhattan, Bryan Reidy has noticed an odd habit among some 
of his patrons in the past year or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are coming in, and they're just eating steak. They're  
not eating potatoes or bread,'' he said. Yet some are feasting on 
spinach lolling in heavy cream, a dish Reidy compares to candy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They eat prime beef steaks and creamed spinach, and insist  
they're on a diet. It blows me away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it's a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, one that  
can include bacon and eggs for breakfast. Its advocates say the 
worst part of a cheeseburger is the bun. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound familiar? Longtime dieters may recognize it from the  
Stillman diet in the 1960s or the popular 1972 book, ``The Diet 
Revolution'' by Dr. Robert C. Atkins, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	But nowadays, it seems to be riding a renewed surge of  
popularity. ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution'' is a best seller. 
So is ``Protein Power'' by Drs. Michael and Mary Dan Eades, and 
other books are promoting low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more people who call the Atkins Center for  
Complementary Medicine in New York say their doctors recommended 
the center's diet, Atkins says. 
</P>
<P>
	To him, the key dietary villain in obesity is carbohydrates.  
They make susceptible people pump out too much insulin, which in 
turn encourages them to put on fat. By avoiding carbohydrates, a 
person stops that process and burns off body fat instead, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Fat in foods can be a dieter's friend, Atkins says, in part  
because it quenches appetite and stops carbohydrate craving. 
</P>
<P>
	So his program encourages eating meats, eggs, butter and almost  
all cheeses, among other things. In the first two weeks, dieters 
drive their carbohydrate levels down by avoiding foods like fruit, 
milk, bread, pasta, grains and starchy vegetables like potatoes. 
Later on, as they lose weight, they can slowly add carbohydrates 
until they reach a satisfactory level. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, food choices like that would knock the recommended  
food pyramid on its side. Wahida Karmally, a spokeswoman for the 
American Dietetic Association and a nutrition expert at Columbia 
University, says the basic premise of such diets is just wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	People don't get fat because of carbohydrates, she says. The  
problem is they're eating too many calories. Diets like Atkins' can 
work simply because they often make people eat fewer calories, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she says such diets might be risky. They make kidneys work  
harder, and ``we don't know the long-term effects of a diet that's 
very high in protein on kidney function,'' she said. Meanwhile, 
people with diabetes or kidney disease should avoid such programs, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, she said, fatty foods can raise cholesterol levels,  
and cutting back on things like whole-wheat bread, potatoes, 
vegetables and fruits can deprive a person of important nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins says there's no study showing that people with normal  
kidney function have developed problems because of a high-protein 
diet. People with diabetes can follow his diet, and while ``it 
takes a lot of kidney disease'' to rule out the regular diet, he 
has used a low-protein version in those cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkin said his diet makes ``bad'' cholesterol fall and ``good''  
cholesterol rise, and a dieter who also takes the recommended 
nutritional supplements will be in fine shape for nutrients. And 
while most Atkins dieters do end up eating fewer calories than 
before, that's not why they lose weight, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, back at the steak house, Reidy regarded the 400-odd  
slabs of meat on display by Gallagher's front door and wryly 
considered a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about if I started marketing this?'' he said.  
``Gallagher's recipe for losing weight.''

<HEADLINE> Giants 31, Saints 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Mike Ditka didn't have to worry  
about blowing another fourth-quarter lead. The usually inept New 
York Giants' offense had shredded the New Orleans Saints' defense 
long before then. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Graham ran for a touchdown and then broke the game open by  
throwing for two more scores in the final 63 seconds of the second 
quarter as the Giants routed the Saints 31-3 Sunday, handing 
Ditka's team its fifth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest loss was by far the Saints' worst of the season and  
it came just a week after the team fined the emotional Ditka 
$20,000 for making obscene gestures to fans at the Superdome after 
they booed the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the last four games where the Saints (1-5) blew the lead  
in the final quarter, they never led as New York (4-3) finally 
found the big-play offense it displayed in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, who was 19-of-29 for 239 yards, scored on a 6-yard run  
to give the Giants the lead for good late in the first quarter. He 
later connected on TD passes of a 27 yards to Amani Toomer and 53 
to Joe Jurevicius, the last one on a tipped ``Hail Mary'' on the 
final play of the half following some questionable timeouts by 
Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Joe Montgomery, seeing his first action of the season,  
added a spinning 12-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. It 
came one play after Jessie Armstead ran 31 yards with an 
interception of Billy Joe Tolliver, who was 14-of-33 for 176. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Brien kicked a 25-yard field goal in the first quarter for  
the Saints, who were limited to 84 total yards in the first half 
and 270 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, who were averaging 268.7 yards and 14 points, used a  
couple trick plays to gain 321 yards -- 266 in the first half -- and 
win their second straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-yard pass to Toomer and a 24-yard run by Ike Hilliard on a  
double-reverse set up Graham's first touchdown run of the year. It 
came on a third-and-goal scramble that also broke a scoring drought 
by the offense of 185 minutes, 23 seconds, dating to the first 
quarter of the Eagles' game on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans got its score on the next possession, driving 60  
yards in seven plays to set up Brien's field goal. A 29-yard pass 
from Tolliver to Aaron Craver and a 22-yard run by Ricky Williams 
(24 carries for 111 yards) set up the chip-shot field goal, which 
came on fourth-and-1 from the New York 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Bashir Levingston's 32-yard kickoff return set up a 41-yard  
field goal on the next series by recently signed Cary Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints had a chance to tie the score on the next series when  
they ran a halfback option on third-and-2 at their 36. Eddie 
Kennison got 20 yards behind the defense, but Lamar Smith's pass 
into the wind missed him by at least 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham showed some great touch, hitting Toomer on a 27-yard fade  
pattern in the left corner of the end zone with cornerback Tyronne 
Drakeford running with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurevicius's touchdown was the result of poor decision-making by  
the Saints, who called two timeout with the Giants seemingly 
willing to run out the clock with a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The first timeout came with 52 seconds left after the Saints  
lost five yards on a first-down run at their 28. The second came 
with 17 seconds to go after a 9-yard pass by Graham left the Giants 
with a third-and-1 at its 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham sneaked for the first down. After a New York timeout and  
an offsides penalty against the Saints, Graham threw a long pass 
that deflected off the hands of safety Sammy Knight and went right 
to Jrevicius for a 24-3 lead.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Rights Doctor Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- About 500 people attended a Sunday night  
memorial service for the Buffalo-area physician who performed 
abortions, one year after he was killed by a sniper's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse who was critically injured in the 1998 abortion clinic  
bombing in Birmingham, Ala., was among those who attended the 
interfaith ceremony at a Presbyterian church for Dr. Barnett 
Slepian. 
</P>
<P>
	Police kept watch outside and about 25 undercover police were  
scattered throughout the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security is tight,'' said Marilynn Buckham, of Buffalo Gyn  
Womanservices, a sponsor of the ceremony. ``But it's not tonight 
we're worried about. It's all of the other dark nights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service planned at the University of Rochester for  
Saturday was canceled after security plans were leaked. 
</P>
<P>
	Slepian was killed on Oct. 23, 1999 by a sniper hiding in his  
backyard. Earlier that day, the Slepian family sent a fax to local 
police explaining that abortion providers were warned that one of 
them might be targeted for assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 6, James Kopp, 44, was charged with the slaying. Kopp  
remains at-large and police admit that despite a worldwide search 
and a $1 million reward, they don't know where he is. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating knowing that he's out there,'' said Ms.  
Buckham. ``It's very scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's yahrtzeit service ---- a Jewish ceremony that  
commemorates the dead with the lighting of a 24-hour candle ---- 
included the lighting of candles for the seven people killed and 12 
people injured in abortion-related violence since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A tearful audience also listened to registered nurse Emily  
Lyons, who has undergone a number of operations since the Alabama 
clinic bombing and has permanently damaged eyesight. She spoke of 
Slepian and other abortion providers who have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They paid an awful price for reproductive freedom and the  
women they served,'' she said. ``They risked their lives for that 
freedom.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Welcomes Clinton in Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria welcomed news that President  
Clinton was ready to take an active role in the Middle East peace 
process before the end of his term in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a pledge implied ``a great deal of seriousness and  
responsibility'' that could help overcome the hurdles now facing 
the peace process, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper was responding to comments by a White House official  
published Saturday in the pan-Arab Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper. The 
unidentified official said Clinton would do all he could during his 
remaining 14 months as president to achieve a comprehensive peace 
in the Middle East. The official did not rule out Clinton's making 
a Mideast tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria was ready to cooperate with any action that might  
``correct the flaw that afflicts the peace process due to Israel's 
policy, which contradicts the simplest condition of peace,'' 
Al-Thawra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Al-Baath newspaper, of the ruling Baath Party, also  
expressed hope Sunday that Clinton would be able to implement his 
peace promises and ``crown his second presidential era with a big 
achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another state newspaper, Tishrin, stressed that Clinton would be  
welcomed in Damascus, and urged him to intensify contacts with 
Israeli leaders and to convince Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak 
that ``peace is much better than regional explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks between Syria and Israel have been stalled since  
February 1996, with the two countries disagreeing on the terms for 
resuming the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was scheduled to meet with Barak and Palestinian leader  
Yasser Arafat next month in Norway to commemorate the 1993 Oslo 
accords, which put Israel and the Palestinians on the negotiating 
track.

<HEADLINE> Airports Use Falcons To Scare Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Military airfield managers aren't the only ones turning to  
falcons to help keep birds from runways. A few civilian airports 
are employing the same strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City's John F. Kennedy Airport started using falcons in  
1996 to complement the airport's use of shooting to disperse birds 
from a nearby gull colony, said Richard Dolbeer, a bird-aircraft 
strike expert who heads a U.S. Department of Agriculture wildlife 
research center in Sandusky, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's Dorval International Airport also is using falcons,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other airports have found birds of prey aren't the only critters  
capable of scaring away birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Vancouver International Airport and Southwest Florida  
International Airport at Fort Myers have recently begun using 
border collies to scare geese and cranes from runways and prevent 
them from nesting nearby, Dolbeer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the nation's biggest airports now employ full-time  
biologists to deal with birds. The need is typically greatest at 
airports near wetlands or wildlife preserves. 
</P>
<P>
	With commercial air traffic increasing and some bird populations  
-- like Canada geese -- increasing, programs to prevent bird-aircraft 
strikes will likely expand, Dolbeer said.

	LONDON (AP) -- Glenda Jackson, the former actress who's now a

</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson, 63, was admitted to Lewisham Hospital on Saturday

</P>
<P>
	``She's feeling fine,'' Hodges said. ``The operation was a  
relatively routine procedure and went well.'' 
</P>

	Ms. Jackson, a former deputy transport minister, is campaigning  
for the Labor Party's nomination for mayor of London.

	Buchanan Bolts To Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a pledge to shake up American politics,  
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan announced that he's bolting the 
Republican Party to seek the Reform Party nomination. ``We are in 
this race to win!'' he told supporters. ``I must leave the party 
that has long been my home -- with regret but no rancor -- because 
the Washington elite of the GOP has left me and the principles for 
which I have toiled and fought for 40 years,'' Buchanan said in a 
fund-raising letter obtained by The Associated Press. Buchanan, the 
pugnacious conservative commentator whose insurgent campaigns 
hobbled Republican front-runners in 1992 and 1996, planned to 
formally announce his intentions Monday in suburban Virginia.

	Argentina Elects New Leader

<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Calling his overwhelming election  
victory a strong mandate to implement his policies, President-elect 
Fernando de la Rua vowed to blot out corruption and bring 
Argentines more jobs and better health care. With 85 percent of the 
ballot counted late Sunday, preliminary returns showed De la Rua, 
the opposition leader, with 48.7 percent of the votes. The ruling 
Peronist party's candidate, Buenos Aires Province Gov. Eduardo 
Duhalde, had 37.7 percent. The rest of the votes were split among 
eight other candidates. De la Rua's victory was a vote for change 
after the decade-long rule of flamboyant President Carlos Menem.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian jets and artillery pummeled towns  
around Grozny and other parts of Chechnya on Sunday, and Chechen 
officials claimed at least 39 people had been killed and dozens 
more injured in the attacks. The Russian military acknowledged it 
fired missiles at targets around the towns of Bamut and 
Achkoi-Martan, but said they were aimed at rebel military 
positions. Chechen leaders again called for peace talks with 
Russia, demanding they be held on neutral territory with 
international mediation.

	HAVANA (AP) -- Illinois Gov. George Ryan toured the cobblestone  
streets of Old Havana before getting down to ``serious business'' 
today on his mission to Cuba -- the first by a U.S. governor since 
the 1959 revolution. The itinerary today included a meeting with 
independent journalists and opponents of Fidel Castro's communist 
government, and a visit to a children's hospital, where Ryan was to 
present a donation of medical supplies. In all, Ryan's delegation 
was delivering more than $1 million in humanitarian aid during its 
five-day visit to the island, which ends Wednesday.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- A survey of doctors finds that many consider it  
ethical to lie to an insurance company or HMO if patients cannot 
get treatment any other way. The survey of 169 internists in eight 
cities found that 58 percent considered it ethical to lie for a 
patient who needed a heart bypass operation but wouldn't ordinarily 
be covered by insurance. Forty-eight percent of respondents also 
considered it ethical to deceive insurance companies or health 
maintenance organizations in order to get intravenous pain 
medication and nutrition for a dying cancer patient.

Jones industrial average rose 172.56 points to 10,470.25 as the 
U.S. lawmakers agreed on legislation that would remove barriers 
separating banks, insurers and securities brokerages.

franchise of the century got the win. The New York Yankees stormed 
halfway to their record 25th World Series title, humbling the 
clumsy Atlanta Braves 7-2 Sunday night behind David Cone for a 2-0 
lead. A night after they waited for an eighth-inning rally to win 
4-1, the defending champions wasted no time pounding Kevin Millwood 
in their 10th straight World Series victory.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Wins Ironman Triathlon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- The toughest part of the Ironman  
Triathlon World Championship proved the easiest for Luc Van Lierde 
of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the lead just after the start of the marathon and  
steadily extended it in winning the championship by more than five 
minutes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing in 8 hours, 17 minutes, 17 seconds, Van Lierde, who  
also won the continuous 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike race and 
26.2-mile marathon in 1996 and finished second last year, was 19th 
after the swim. 
</P>
<P>
	But with temperatures in the mid-70s, one of the coolest days in  
race history, Van Lierde steadily advanced and was sixth after the 
bike segment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel about the same as last time,'' said Van Lierde, who set  
the course record of 8:04:08 in his first Ironman in 1996. ``But 
the difference is that a few years ago, no one expected and I 
didn't expect. This year I worked very hard for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six miles into the marathon, Van Lierde had built more than a  
one-minute lead, and his margin never was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some bad luck in past years,'' said Van Lierde, who  
draped a Belgium flag over his shoulders as he crossed the finish 
line. ``But I'm glad I came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Lierde is training for next summer when the shorter,  
Olympic-distance event makes its debut in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Reid of Canada, the 1998 champion, finished second in  
8:22:54. Tim DeBoom of Boulder, Colo., was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori Bowden of Canada, who gained the lead 10 miles into the  
run, won the women's title in 9:13:02. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Smyers, of Lincoln, Mass., the 1995 women's winner, was  
second in 9:20:40. Fernanda Keller of Brazil, completing the event 
for the 12th time, placed third for the fifth time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, the wife of the second-place men's finisher, also was  
never challenged after assuming the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just so much difference between first and second,''  
said Bowden, who finished sixth in 1996. ``But with all the support 
we're getting from the crowds, it's just great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lothar Leder of Germany, who finished third last year and was  
about one minute behind as the cycling segment ended, was 
disqualified for drafting other cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of 1,470, 17 entrants shy of last year's record, began  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning man and woman each earned $35,000 from a $250,000  
purse for their overall titles and various bonuses for top 
individual segment places.

<HEADLINE> Internet Co. AltaVista Revamps Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- AltaVista Co., one of the oldest  
Internet search companies, is undergoing a radical makeover as it 
seeks to overtake competitors such as Yahoo! and America Online as 
a peak Web destination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palo Alto company is kicking off a $120 million marketing  
campaign on Monday -- its first ever -- to alert Web surfers to its 
newly designed Internet site, complete with slick and colorful 
graphics, an advanced comparison shopping service and self-updating 
news and sports information with easier-to-use features. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already climbed the mountain; now we're running down the  
other side,'' said Rod Schrock, AltaVista's chief executive. 
``We've not only changed the way we look and operate, we've built 
the next generation of the Internet experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move is the latest salvo in what could become a bruising war  
among companies that are trying to build loyalty to their portal. 
Portal sites, which serve as entry points to the Internet and make 
it easier for consumers to reach thousands of Web sites, make money 
by touting the amount of reach they can provide to advertisers and 
marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista is playing catch-up to leaders in the field such as  
Yahoo! and AOL after having relied for many years on the strength 
of word-of-mouth endorsements, said media e-commerce analyst 
Malcolm Maclachlan at International Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really says something positive for them that they had a  
brand name just off the search capability, but what they needed to 
do for the last two years is join the pack and play off their 
strengths,'' said Maclachlan, who has seen the new site. ``I don't 
think you could even say a year ago that they were a portal site. 
That's what they've done with their new launch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Developed in 1995 by Digital Equipment Co., AltaVista became  
part of Compaq Computer Corp. with its 1998 takeover of Digital. 
Earlier this year, Compaq -- not quite sure how AltaVista fit into 
its game plan -- sold a 83 percent stake in the company to Internet 
investment firm CMGI Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Andover, Mass.-based CMGI is moving to make AltaVista a  
centerpiece of its numerous Internet properties, with hopes of 
eventually spinning it off into a publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	While AltaVista has consistently been the most favored search  
engine in Europe, it ranks seventh globally behind Yahoo!, MSN, 
Netscape, Go, Lycos and Excite, according to Web rankings service 
Media Metrix. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, it has boosted its staff to more than 600 employees  
from 80 last year and created a tagline, ``AltaVista: smart is 
beautiful.'' It also has commissioned dozens of humorous television 
commercials, including one with Pamela Anderson Lee as a star who 
is saved by a technogeek who has used AltaVista to discover her 
plight following a disaster in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	To showcase its AltaVista Live! feature, which simulcasts  
traffic pictures, news, financial information and entertainment, 
the Palo Alto-based company donated $100,000 to charity for a 
45-minute Lauryn Hill concert after the new site's official 
unveiling on Monday afternoon in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Its shopping feature, Shopping.com, also has been revamped to  
allow consumers to compare prices for a particular item among 
hundreds of other shopping sites. The so-called metasearch engine 
is rapidly become a must-have for portal companies as shoppers 
become more savvy in navigating the Web in search of bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Sullivan, editor of searchenginewatch.com, said that  
despite the improvements, AltaVista is unlikely to overtake AOL and 
Yahoo! as the most frequently used portal sites since both have 
spent years making their brand names virtually synonymous with the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the makeover of AltaVista search engine using the  
AskJeeves technology -- which allows people to make queries in 
sentence form rather than using keywords -- could lure less 
computer-savvy people and help it overtake other competitors, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Stuart Case Fresh in Boston Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It was an emergency call that turned the city  
upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, police dispatchers heard the frantic voice of  
Chuck Stuart. With a gunshot wound in his abdomen, Stuart said he 
and his pregnant wife, Carol, had been robbed and shot. 
</P>
<P>
	No one doubted his story that a black gunman had commandeered  
their car as they left a hospital birthing class, drove them to the 
inner city and then shot them. Pictures of his mortally wounded 
wife were published nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	The story inflamed white fears in a city where in the two months  
prior to the Oct. 23, 1989 attack, there had been nearly 200 
shootings in neighborhoods with large numbers of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But a black man wasn't guilty of murder -- Stuart was believed to  
be the killer. The 30-year-old was found dead in an apparent 
suicide after his brother confessed to helping hide a gun used in 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The deception, and the controversial police response, almost  
overshadowed the death of Carol, 30, and her infant son. The baby, 
delivered by Caesarean section, survived just 17 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Stuart) took advantage of the times we were in and the  
environment he was in,'' said Boston police spokeswoman Margot 
Hill. ``He knew exactly what he was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings launched an enormous manhunt, with police fanning  
out through neighborhood housing projects frisking black men. State 
politicians called for reinstatement of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the murder, William Bennett, a 39-year-old  
paroled convict, was arrested on an unrelated charge. He became the 
prime suspect after witnesses said he had boasted of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart's body was recovered from Boston Harbor about seven weeks  
later after he apparently jumped off a bridge. His death cleared 
Bennett, but many blacks were outraged. They accused the police of 
violating their constitutional rights and of railroading Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 10-year anniversary of the shootings approached, former  
police commissioner Francis ``Mickey'' Roache denied he ever 
ordered police to pursue Bennett's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew Willie Bennett wasn't going anywhere, and we didn't  
want to serve a warrant that had nothing to do with the murder of 
Carol and the unborn child,'' Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roache said that then-District Attorney Newman Flanagan took  
over the investigation and ordered Bennett's arrest without ever 
consulting the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanagan told The Boston Globe last week that he doesn't  
remember where the order to arrest Bennett came from. He also 
suggested Roache's new claims could be aimed at deflecting 
attention from Roache's role in the entire episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's lawyer, Robert George, denounced the former  
commissioner for trying to rewrite history at a time when Roache is 
seeking re-election to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mickey Roache was at every bank of microphones he could find  
and at every television camera he could put himself in front of 
defending his police officers and their tactics in the Stuart 
case,'' said George. 
</P>
<P>
	Roache's statements also renewed racial tensions created by the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anniversary probably could have come and passed in a very  
reflective way. I have to tell you the former police commissioner's 
comments have been explosive and the reflection has turned into 
anger,'' said state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson, a leader among the 
city's black residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusations that the Boston police -- and media -- were too  
willing to believe that a black man had fired the shots had a 
profound effect on the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Although charges were never brought against Bennett in the  
killing, his attorney maintains the case led to two false armed 
robbery claims. Bennett was only recently released from prison 
after serving seven years for one of the charges, George said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett unsuccessfully sued the police department, claiming that  
officers violated his civil rights by coercing potential witnesses 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, Boston is a radically different place. The  
city's homicide rate has dropped by 80 percent and once-blighted 
neighborhoods like the South End, Jamaica Plain, parts of Roxbury 
and Mission Hill are revitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between police and black residents have improved in  
the last decade Wilkerson said, but tensions remain over crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something about that particular combination that  
people lose objectivity and it just brings out the worst in people, 
brings out their stereotypes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol's brother, Carl DiMaiti, 47, said that even though a  
decade has passed, his family mourns ``every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my own mind, I still can't understand how anyone could do  
that,'' he said. ``In the whole sensationalism of the case, a 
vibrant, caring, brilliant woman has been lost. Only her friends 
and family know that.''

	Rebels Readying for Russian Attack  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Islamic militants in Chechnya were  
strengthening their positions around the capital, Grozny, today 
while Russian forces continued artillery bombardments of suspected 
militant bases, a military spokesman said. Col. Gennady Alyokhin, a 
Russian spokesman in neighboring Dagestan, said the overall 
situation in Chechnya was stable, but that Russian artillery units 
were continuing to shell the rebels in response to rebel moves to 
shore up their positions. Yusup Yaraliev, a spokesman for the 
Chechen military command, said four people were killed and 20 
wounded Sunday in a pre-dawn Russian artillery attack on the town 
of Vedeno, 18 miles southeast of Grozny.

	Clinton Presses on Social Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Republicans  
yesterday to improve upon their pledges that they would avoid using 
Social Security surpluses to pay for other budget needs. ``I think 
we can do better,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address, 
adding that he will submit legislation this week that would enact 
part of a Social Security rescue plan he outlined early this year. 
The proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits 
any government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay 
off the national debt. White House aides said in advance of 
Clinton's remarks that, in an effort to engender a bipartisan 
spirit, the latest presidential proposal does not include a 
controversial plan to have the government invest a portion of 
Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market.

country's impoverished masses by boosting the crisis-ridden 
economy, Indonesia's new president outlined sweeping changes in 
domestic, foreign and defense policy during his first major speech 
today. But Abdurrahman Wahid also said he would appoint some 
members of longtime authoritarian President Suharto's disgraced 
regime to his Cabinet. That move defies a chorus of calls to wipe 
the slate clean after the recent ouster of former President B.J. 
Habibie's government, which included many Suharto holdovers.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just over a year before the election, Democrat  
Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush hold strong leads nationally 
in the races for their parties' nomination, a poll released 
yesterday finds. The latest Newsweek poll suggested former Sen. 
Bill Bradley would receive 26 percent of the votes of registered 
Democrats and those who lean toward voting for a Democrat, while 
the vice president would get 49 percent. Those numbers are 
statistically unchanged from a similar Newsweek poll in June. The 
survey said Bush, would win 57 percent of the votes of registered 
Republicans and those who lean toward voting for a Republican.

several minutes of chaos following the punch, which ended the first 
round of the scheduled 10-rounder, the fight was called a no

<HEADLINE> Rams 34, Browns 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The surprise juggernaut claimed another victim.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams, who entered this season as the NFL's  
losingest team in the 1990s, remained the only unbeaten team this 
year with a 34-3 victory over the winless Cleveland Browns on 
Sunday. Kurt Warner threw three touchdown passes, two to Roland 
Willliams, and Marshall Faulk, after spending the previous night in 
a hospital due to the flu, had 133 yards rushing on 16 carries, 
with a 33-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns, 19-point underdogs, were more fodder for a  
team that has made a remarkable transformation after entering the 
year 45-99 for the decade. The Rams (6-0) led 14-0 before the 
Browns (0-7) had run an offensive play and it was 21-3 -- and game 
over -- at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns rookie wide receiver Kevin Johnson had brashly predicted  
a victory. In particular, he was treated roughly. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, so lightly regarded before Trent Green's season-ending  
knee injury in August that the Rams had a shot at him in the 
expansion draft, hiked his league-leading touchdown pass total to 
18. He was 23-for-29 for 203 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the stand-in starter at tight end while Ernie Conwell  
recovers from reconstructive knee surgery, had a pair of 1-yard 
scores and has three touchdowns. He had his best game receiving 
with five catches for 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk set up both of Williams' scores with receiving gains of 13  
yards and 15 yards, each time to the Browns 1. Then Faulk went to 
the locker room for IV fluids before halftime. In the third 
quarter, he eluded several would-be tacklers on his 33-yard run. He 
also had 67 yards on nine catches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams began the game with an 11-play, 75-yard drive capped by  
Williams' first touchdown. Ronnie Powell fumbled the ensuing 
kickoff at the Browns 29, and the Rams needed only four plays to 
score again on a 4-yard pass from Warner to Isaac Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' second 1-yard catch made it 21-3 with 10:59 to go in  
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That was more than enough for a defense that has allowed one  
touchdown the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything went right for the Rams, who caught a break on an  
interception by Todd Lyght in the end zone. Dexter McCleon had been 
whistled for pass interference, but the call was waved off because 
the ball was tipped by tackle D'Marco Farr. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns highlights were a 40-yard run by Tim Couch to the Rams 3  
as time expired at the half -- the longest run by a quarterback in 
franchise history -- and the punting of Chris Gardocki, who averaged 
49 yards on five boots. 
</P>
<P>
	A plus for Couch, who was 22-for-40 for 185 yards and two  
interceptions, was getting some protection for a change with only 
one sack and rare pressure from the Rams. He's been sacked 24 times 
overall, including four last week against the Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Rams were 6-0 was 1985, when they opened 7-0  
and won the NFC West at 11-5. They've won five in a row at home, 
their best since 1988-89, and are 3-0 against the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Rams running back Robert Holcombe strained his right  
hamstring in the first quarter. ... The Browns lost linebackers 
Jamir Miller (strained left shoulder) and Rahim Abdullah (strained 
left hip) in the second quarter. ... The Browns offense has scored 
only five touchdowns. ... Bruce had four catches to move one ahead 
of Elroy ``Crazy Legs'' Hirsch for third on the team's career 
reception list. He has 344 in six seasons. ... Rams kicker Jeff 
Wilkins is 7-for-7 on field goals, including two Sunday. ... The 
Rams played without both return men. Tony Horne is serving a 
four-game drug suspension and Az-Zahir Hakim injured his groin on 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Tries To Reach Homosexuals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- Saundra Farmer-Wiley and Kerrie Young  
might never have crossed paths but for antagonism between 
conservative Christians and gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, a 22-year-old student, has little in common with  
Farmer-Wiley, a 57-year-old office manager from Maui, Hawaii. Young 
is white, has no children and is heterosexual. Farmer-Wiley is 
black, has three children and is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for one weekend, the two found common ground at the church  
of the Rev. Jerry Falwell, where the Moral Majority founder on 
Sunday brought what he said was message of God's love to 200 gay 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell's sermon was the culmination of a weekend forum designed  
to reduce violence against gays and Christians. It was led by 
Falwell and gay minister Mel White, an author from California who 
ghostwrote Falwell's autobiography before coming out. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who attends Falwell's Liberty University here, admitted  
she was initially against the meeting but later volunteered to 
attend so she could move past her prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was being proud and selfish,'' she said. ``I wasn't showing  
the love we as Christians are supposed to have for all people. I 
was focused on these extreme examples of the homosexual lifestyle 
I'd seen in the past and that was holding me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Farmer-Wiley, the forum was a chance to be seen as something  
more than a stereotype in the eyes of the 4,000 worshippers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my time to put my perspective in front of their eyes,  
... time for them to see me as a person, not just some lesbian,'' 
she said. ``You can't change a person from one meeting, but this a 
first step at building a bridge to understanding, rather than a 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I met Kerrie and I'm glad we got to talk. I believe  
it is the men and women of her generation who will stop the hate 
and believe we are not a threat to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unprecedented meeting surprised many because Falwell for  
years has condemned homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, gay activists hissed, booed and screamed as  
Falwell lectured via satellite to about 60 people in a San 
Francisco park, urging them to give up homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	The 66-year-old Falwell was also ridiculed earlier this year  
when his newspaper cited evidence that the creators of the 
``Teletubbies'' show intended Tinky Winky to be a gay role model. 
</P>
<P>
	As he had all weekend, Falwell stressed he will not change his  
belief that homosexuality is a sin, but added: ``That has nothing 
to do with the love factor involved. We are to be lovers of all men 
and women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell was careful not to offend his visitors during his  
sermon, preaching from Proverbs 13, which offers advice on 
successful living in the eyes of God. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke on the importance of working hard, living with  
integrity and not focusing on material things. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell also talked at length about the importance of parents  
loving their children unconditionally. He noted that he is often 
asked by reporters and gay rights activists what he would do if one 
of his sons was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd tell him 'I love you just as much ... I'm going to pray  
for you and do everything I can to bring you out of this 
lifestyle,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of angry anti-homosexual protesters demonstrated outside  
Falwell's Baptist church, holding explicit signs and screaming at 
gay supporters as they entered the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those protesting the gathering was the Rev. Fred Phelps of  
Topeka, Kan., whose congregation taunted gays at the funeral of 
Matthew Shepard, a gay college student who was killed in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to invite these fags here and into his church is an  
abomination,'' Phelps said outside the church Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, Jerry Falwell is just as much a sinner as Mel White and  
both will burn in hell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who brought 200 gays and lesbians from 30 states to  
participate in the weekend's activities, said it was ``a shame'' 
that protesters like Phelps brought hostility to a place a worship. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is a great moment for our country, gays and  
Falwell worshipping together,'' White said. ``It's a small start, 
but it's a start.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Wins Disney Classic  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Tiger Woods' victories are  
starting to come in all shapes and sizes -- majors and World Golf 
Championship events, in Europe and in America, even one like Sunday 
that came with Mickey Mouse on the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubling trend for everyone else is that Woods keeps

	``I'm not going to put any limits on where I think I can go,''  
Woods said after winning for the sixth time in his last nine 
tournaments, a one-stroke victory over Ernie Els in the National 
Car Rental Classic at Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods' final round on a Magnolia course that lies just beyond  
the Magic Kingdom was hardly a masterpiece, but the finished 
product was a carbon copy of his recent play -- another victory for 
the No. 1 player in the world in what already has become a 
masterpiece of a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can touch this guy at the moment,'' Els said. ``He has  
gone to another level where I don't think the rest of us can really 
find. The guy is great right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite missing five putts from 10 feet or less and  
three-putting on three occasions, Woods avoided the kind of 
mistakes that doomed Els and Bob Tway, closing with a 1-over 73 to 
finish at 271. 
</P>
<P>
	Els hit into the water trying to lay up on No. 14, and had a  
35-foot birdie putt roll off the green on No. 17 that led to a 
bogey. He wound up with a 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Tway was tied with Woods to start the final round and led by two  
strokes at the turn, but fell out of contention by hitting into the 
water on the par-3 12th and taking a triple bogey. Tway had a 76 
and tied for third with Franklin Langham (72) at 14-under 274. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of years ago when he won the Nelson and said he won  
it with his `C' game ... I guess he wasn't kidding,'' Els said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods didn't have his ``A'' game on Sunday, but lightning-fast  
greens and holes cut on the slopes made it difficult on everyone. 
Only 24 players managed to break par. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has not broken 70 in the final round of his last four  
victories, but he's been good enough. It was the 10th straight time 
Woods has had at least a share of the lead through 54 holes and 
gone on to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take pride in playing well,'' Woods said. ``It's hard to get  
complacent when you love what you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods earned $450,000, pushing his earnings to just over $4.7  
million. The real measure of greatness is the number of victories. 
Even Woods admits this will go down as a great year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disney victory was his sixth on the PGA Tour this year, the  
most since Tom Watson won six times in 1980 when Woods was a 
2-year-old showing off his talent on the Mike Douglas Show. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 23, he is the youngest player to win this often -- seven,  
including his victory against a strong field in Germany -- since 
Horton Smith won eight times in 1929 at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	And Woods isn't done yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Having won six of his last nine tournaments, Woods will be the  
favorite in the Tour Championship next week in Houston, and again 
in the final World Golf Championship event in Spain to close out 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning both those tournaments -- anything is possible right now  
-- would push him over $6 million in earnings for the year, an 
astounding number even with inflated purses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tway had to win Disney to get into the Tour Championship next  
week for the top 30 on the money list. As it was, there were no 
changes to the top 30. Duffy Waldorf, holding down the final spot, 
tied for 69th but no one else was able to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after making his first bogey in 43 holes on No. 2, and  
making another bogey on No. 4 by duffing a wedge from the fairway 
to fall two strokes back, Tway appeared to have control of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	It only only took two holes for that lead to evaporate. Tway  
missed a 4-foot birdie putt on No. 10, and Woods caught him with a 
10-foot birdie on 10 and a 3-footer on 11. Then, Tway took himself 
out of contention by hitting his tee shot on the 12th into the 
water, his third shot into the bunker and walking off with a triple 
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Birdies on three of the first four holes on the back side put  
Els into a tie with Woods at 18 under, but then he went to sleep on 
the par-5 14th, hitting a 5-iron lay up into the water and taking a 
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably hit my worst shot of the year,'' Els said. ``That  
took a lot out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament was effectively decided on No. 17, which can be  
chalked up to Els' inexperience at Disney. He left his approach on 
the ridge, and with the greens considerably faster than the first 
three days, the cup was all that could stop his ball from going off 
the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was done,'' Els said. ``I was done when I was lining up my  
putt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, meanwhile, left his approach on 17 below the hole and  
two-putted from 10 feet for par, giving him a one-stroke cushion. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods also won Disney two years ago, during his rapid rise that  
turned out to be a glimpse of what the future held. That year, kids 
stuck their heads through the netting under the grandstand to take 
a peek at the new star. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Woods holding up another trophy was old hat.  
</P>
<P>
 *DIVOTS:* Woods had seven three-putts for the week and was only 2  
under on the par-5s in three rounds at Magnolia. ... Tournament 
officials wanted to have the Tigger character at the trophy 
presentation if Tiger Woods had won, but was turned down. One 
reason? Woods got his nickname from a Vietnam War veteran, not a 
furry friend of Winnie the Pooh. Also, because Tigger is not a 
Disney creation, there were some legal concerns about the bouncy 
one being used in a promotion outside the Magic Kingdom. ... Lanny 
Wadkins, in his final PGA Tour event before he comes eligible for 
the senior tour, had a 75 and tied for 81st at 288.

<HEADLINE> Undefeated Penn State Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Penn State survived another close  
game Saturday. Drew Brees came within 12 yards of ending the 
Nittany Lions undefeated season -- and maybe their national title 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees threw for 379 yards and two touchdowns. Three completions  
in the final minute brought the 18th-ranked Boilermakers from their 
30-yard line to the Lions 12. Out of timeouts, Brees attempted four 
passes and each fell incomplete, giving No. 2 Penn State a 31-25 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just way too close,'' said Penn State linebacker  
LaVar Arrington, who had one of two touchdowns scored by the Lions 
defense and also blocked a field goal attempt. ``Right now, my 
nerves are all messed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) produced the 315th coaching  
victory of Joe Paterno's career, making him the third winningest 
coach in major college football history. He needs nine more to pass 
Bear Bryant for the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shaking,'' Paterno said after Purdue (5-3, 2-3) sent most  
of the sellout crowd of 68,355 home disappointed with the help of 
four turnovers and two missed field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington and defensive end Courtney Brown scored touchdowns for  
Penn State on turnovers by Brees. The Lions had only 11 first 
downs, but got two touchdown passes from Kevin Thompson. Eddie 
Drummond caught a 39-yarder and Chafie Fields had a 78-yard catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They moved the ball pretty easily on the last drive,''  
Arrington said. ``Coming into the game I knew Purdue was good, but 
I had no idea they were as good as they played today. ... To date 
this is the biggest win for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees had another quality game, but he couldn't convert with  
time running out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't even catchable,'' said Purdue receiver Chris  
Daniels, the target of Brees' final pass on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was out of bounds. We had four shots from the 12-yard line  
but couldn't punch it in,'' Daniels added. ``If you want to beat 
the No. 2 team in the country, you have to make some big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Purdue became the first team to score a touchdown in the  
first quarter against the Lions this year, Arrington tied the score 
when he sacked Brees, forced a fumble, recovered it on Purdue's 2 
and took it into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams were tied at 14 at halftime.  
</P>
<P>
	On the first play of the second half, Thompson lofted a pass to  
Fields, who caught the ball just inside Purdue territory and moved 
into the end zone untouched. About four minutes later, Brown tipped 
a Brees pass on what Purdue calls a bubble-screen to the flat. 
Brown caught the ball and sprinted 25 yards for a touchdown and 
28-14 Penn State lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just put my hands up, hit the ball and it came down and I  
went running,'' Brown said. ``I think I was the most surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only points in the fourth quarter came on a Travis Forney  
field goal after Kenny Watson's 45-yard run gave the Lions a first 
down at the Purdue 5-yard line. Forney later missed a 47-yard 
attempt that set the stage for the dramatic finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of mistakes made by both sides. It was a  
sloppy game. A lot of that was the intensity. Our kids were very 
emotional early in the game,'' Paterno said.

<HEADLINE> Croasdale Wins Marine Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mark Croasdale, a Marine based in Devon,  
England, fulfilled his 1999 goal by winning the Marine Corps 
Marathon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Croasdale pulled away from runner-up Mark Coogan after they made  
the turn at Hains Point during the 19th mile to win in 2 hours, 23 
minutes, 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He died coming off Hains Point,'' said Croasdale, a 1992  
Olympian in cross-country skiing. ``It was very windy coming back, 
but I knew they had to catch me, so I just tried to maintain 
pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Croasdale finished third here in 1996 and was runner-up last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coogan, a 1996 Olympian, finished second in 2:24:18. He was  
followed by Mexicans Maximino Ayala (2:24:38) and Juan Lopez 
(2:26:47) in the field of 21,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Moore of Silver Spring, Md., passed race leader Bea Marie  
Altieri near the 22-mile mark and held on win the women's race in 
2:51:53. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was three minutes ahead of me at 13 miles,'' Moore said,  
``but she slowed down a lot. I knew once I passed her that all I 
had to do was finish. Even with the wind in my face for the last 
four miles, I felt OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At mile 21, there was this huge, huge wall, and I ran smack  
into it,'' said Altieri, of Columbia, Md., who finished second in 
2:56:48. ``I think it was 80 miles between mile 21 and the 
finish.''

<HEADLINE> World Series Ratings Jump 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television ratings for Game 1 of the World  
Series didn't measure up to the last time the New York Yankees and 
Atlanta Braves met in the postseason, but they were up 4 percent 
from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight ratings for Saturday night's game, which measures the  
top 44 markets in the country, were 15.0 and a 26 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game of last year's World Series between the Yankees  
and San Diego Padres posted a 14.3 overnight mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's 12-1 victory over the Yankees in the opener of the  
1996 World Series earned a 17.0/26. However, that game was played 
on a Sunday, when ratings generally are higher than Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good start, especially because Game 1s on Saturday  
night are typically the lowest-rated in the World Series,'' NBC 
spokesman Ed Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 peaked with a 16.9 rating from 10:30-11 p.m. EDT after  
beginning the game with a 12.9 mark from 8-8:30 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings in New York were 27.5/43, considerably lower than the  
30.8/42 for Game 1 in 1996. Atlanta also was down, from a 50.2/66 
three years ago to 42.3/60. 
</P>
<P>
	National ratings for Game 1 will be released Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year's World Series was the lowest-rated (14.1) ever.  
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households in the  
nation tuned to a program. Each ratings point represents 994,000 
households. Share represents the percentage of television sets 
tuned to the show.

<HEADLINE> Beauty Queen: Help Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Former Miss America Nicole Johnson has called  
on Nevada legislators to do more to help people with diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old diabetic said Nevada is one of only 11 states  
that don't require insurance companies to pay for adequate 
supplies, medicine and education for diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to change that,'' she said Friday night before  
presenting awards at a Nevada Diabetes Association for Children and 
Adults banquet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson has helped pass diabetes-related legislation in  
three states and lobbied Congress six times for increased diabetes 
research funding. 
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed with diabetes in 1993 when she was a freshman  
at the University of South Florida. She has been dependent on 
insulin ever since. 
</P>

Heather Renee French was named Miss America 2000.

<HEADLINE> Casey Martin Earns PGA Tour Card  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOTHAN, Ala. (AP) -- Considering everything Casey Martin has  
already had to deal with -- a disabling disease in his leg and a 
lengthy court battle with the PGA Tour -- a two-hour wait was 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, needing to play well enough in the final Nike event of  
the season to place in the top 15 of the money list and earn his 
PGA card, just made it. A 37th-place finish Sunday dropped him from 
12th in the money standings to 14th -- still good enough for his 
card. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I play like I did here, I won't be a very good PGA  
player,'' Martin joked. ``I'm relieved and grateful. I admit that 
I'm a little bit shocked to have done it, but it feels really 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's status was in jeopardy after a poor performance Sunday  
on the back nine at Highland Oaks sent him into the clubhouse tied 
for 37th. 
</P>
<P>
	All he could do at that point was wait to see how the tournament  
would play out. Watching on television with his mother, Melinda, 
Martin stayed clam through the two-hour wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, he was at peace,'' Melinda Martin said, fighting off  
tears. ``With all the adversity he's been through in his life, he 
could handle the wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until the television announcer said Martin was  
guaranteed to make the top 15 that the 27-year-old golfer gave his 
mother a wink -- the only emotion he showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might not have been as dramatic as you would have liked,  
but I'm so exhausted it's hard to show any emotion right now,'' 
Martin said. ``I tried to stay straight-faced. I didn't want to 
break down, I've had a tendency to do so and I'm trying not to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's achievement overshadowed the victory of Bob Heintz, who  
beat Marco Dawson in a one-hole playoff to win the Nike Tour 
Championship, as well as the 14 other golfers who also earned their 
tour cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who shot a 6-over 78 in the final round, then had to  
wait through the playoff to accept his award. As he quietly waited, 
his parents did all the celebrating for him. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, King, so nervous during the two-hour wait he went  
and sat by himself in the car, said it was a fitting way for Martin 
to earn his tour card. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sort of limped in, didn't he?'' King Martin said. ``The  
fact that he got there the hard way was kind of indicative of his 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born with a rare circulatory disorder in his right leg, walking  
18 holes is too painful for Martin. He needs to ride in a cart, 
which is prohibited on the PGA Tour, so Martin sued for the right 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his case, but the tour appealed. The 9th U.S. Circuit  
Court could rule any day on the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the opposition for Martin to use the cart is PGA  
Commissioner Tim Finchem, who presented Martin with his tour card 
on Sunday. As he gave Martin his card, he shook the golfer's hand, 
then patted him on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	The stone-faced Martin then took his place in line and flipped  
his card over in his hand, examining both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're just pleased and excited for Casey,'' Finchem  
said afterwards. ``We have a great deal of admiration for what he's 
done, first with his physical disability and then with all the 
distractions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem refused to discuss what the kind of PGA future Martin  
might have. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the matter is with the courts and whatever it does  
it does,'' Finchem said. ``There is no point in speculating because 
it all might be academic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nervous from the start of the final round until the end, Martin  
did his best to keep control of his emotions and failed only once, 
tossing his club onto his bag and walking off in disgust after 
making a bogey on No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	But he recovered to birdie the next hole -- one of only three  
birdies on the day -- and closed the front nine with another birdie 
to make the turn at even par for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	But he started to feel the pressure on the back nine and  
ultimately crumbled under it. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened the back nine with three straight bogeys, missing  
short putts on all of them. After a par on No. 13, he had another 
bogey and then took a double bogey when his chip shot went into the 
sand on No. 15, dropping him to 10 over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt pretty good on the front nine, but on the back nine I  
just ran out of gas,'' he said. ``It was a humbling round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a birdie on the par-5 16th, Martin finished with yet  
another bogey for the 78 that left him at 11-over 299, tied for 
37th. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very stressful week, very nerve-wracking,'' he said.  
``I would have liked to have taken care of it on my own, but I'll 
just have to wait it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin then headed to the clubhouse to eat with his parents, who  
made the trip from Oregon, and watch how the final money list 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, even with the card, Martin's future on the tour isn't  
guaranteed. If the court rules against him, he'll have another 
uphill battle to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be disappointed if it's taken away from me,'' he said.  
``But right now, I don't even want to think about it. It's out of 
my hands.''

<HEADLINE> Raiders 24, Jets 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Raiders signed Rich Gannon to provide  
steady, mistake-free leadership at quarterback. On Sunday, he added 
a dose of heroism as Oakland rallied from a 17-point deficit and 
beat the New York Jets with 26 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon, who led the Raiders to three touchdowns in the final 16  
minutes, threw a 5-yard pass to James Jett to give Oakland a 24-23 
win over New York, which got 123 yards rushing from Curtis Martin 
and a solid performance by quarterback Rick Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 20-3 late in the third period, Gannon threw a 45-yard  
scoring pass to Tim Brown and then led the Raiders on an 83-yard 
drive capped by Zack Crockett's 3-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
	After John Hall's third field goal for the Jets (1-6), Gannon  
led a 90-yard drive in the final two minutes. It included a 17-yard 
pass to Brown on fourth-and-1 at the Oakland 19 and a 36-yard pass 
to Brown that got the ball to the New York 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon was 26-of-51 for 352 yards and led the Raiders (4-3) in  
rushing with 60 yards on scrambles. Oakland tailback Tyrone 
Wheatley fumbled twice and was knocked out of the game in the third 
period with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had 123 yards on 26 carries for the Jets, who forced four  
turnovers. Mirer threw a 2-yard scoring pass to Eric Green and ran 
9 yards for another score. Hall had field goals of 32, 37 and 43 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams traded field goals in the opening 20 minutes. Mirer  
ran for his score midway through the second period, on the first 
play after Jason Ferguson stripped the ball from Wheatley and Bryan 
Cox recovered on the Oakland 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders responded with a 76-yard drive, but Gannon fumbled  
on the New York 4 while scrambling and the half ended with the Jets 
leading 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
	New York went 88 yards on its first possession of the second  
half, scoring on the pass to Green. Dwight Stone went 36 yards with 
a reverse and Martin ran 21 yards to the Oakland 4 to set up the 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley's second fumble, on which he hurt his back, led to  
Hall's 37-yard field goal and a 20-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gannon lofted his scoring pass to Brown in the closing  
seconds of the third period and Crockett scored with 8:23 left to 
pull the Raiders within 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders got the ball back with 6:02 remaining, but Aaron  
Glenn intercepted a pass near midfield and the Jets took a 
six-point lead on Hall's 43-yard field goal with 1:55 left.

	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- With a big assist from crew chief  
Frankie Stoddard, Jeff Burton finally got it right Sunday at North 
Carolina Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton took the lead when he barely beat older brother Ward out  
of the pits on their final stop, and led the final 68 laps in 
winning the Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best win we've ever had,'' said Burton, who has  
dominated several times on the 1.017-mile oval only to fall out of 
contention in the late going. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the hardest we've ever had to work on the chassis to  
win a race,'' said Jeff Burton, who led only three laps before 
taking the top spot for the final time in the 393-lap event. 
``Today, we weren't close, but Frankie kept working and working and 
we had a great last stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rock'' has an abrasive asphalt surface that is notorious  
for tire wear on long runs. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the leaders pitting on lap 325, during the final  
caution period, Stoddard decided to set Burton's No. 99 Roush 
Racing Ford up for a shorter run and try to get his driver a big 
lead before the tires went away. 
</P>
<P>
	The green flag waved with 64 laps remaining, and after Jeff  
Burton was able to beat back a determined bid by Jeff Gordon to 
regain a lost lap, the strategy worked to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	``That last caution was definitely a blessing for us,'' Burton  
said. ``Ward was going to check out on us. He had a better car on a 
long run. Frank made the decision to go try to get everything he 
could on a short run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a lot of changes to the car and got it freed up. But  
it was too loose on the end of a long run. Ward was coming on us. 
He just ran out of laps,'' added Jeff, who saw his lead cut to 
.339-seconds -- about three car-lengths -- by Ward's Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff beat us out of the pits, then I got behind some lapped  
traffic and he was able to get away to a big lead,'' the runner-up 
said. ``If I had been on his bumper, I don't think the 99 would 
have won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he would give for another five laps, Ward said, ``I'd  
run another 400 (miles) for another five (laps). I think we'd have 
got him if we'd have had a little more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time this season that he has finished second to  
his younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's four times I've finished second -- one to Mark  
(Martin) last year and then three to Jeff,'' Ward said. ``It makes 
me mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff, who earned his sixth victory of the season and the 11th of  
his Winston Cup career, said he would not have minded losing to his 
brother, whose only victory came in this race in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad that Ward didn't win this race,'' he said. ``I know  
nobody believes that, but it's hard to go out there and one of your 
goals has to be to beat your brother. That's the hardest thing in 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With only three caution flags for a total of 18 laps, Burton's  
winning speed of 131.103 mph set a track record, breaking the mark 
of 128.423 set last fall by Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte finished third, followed by series leader Dale  
Jarrett, Rusty Wallace, Martin, John Andretti and Sterling Marlin, 
the only other drivers on the lead lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who faded after dominating the early part of the race --  
leading 160 of the first 261 laps -- added four points to his series 
lead, thanks to the five-point bonus for leading the most laps in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	He will go into the race on Nov. 7 in Phoenix 246 points ahead  
of Labonte and 334 in front of third-place Martin. If Jarrett 
finishes 19th or better in each of the final three races, he will 
win his first series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a three-time series champion, never did get his lap  
back, finishing 11th. Dale Earnhardt, who won the previous week in 
Talladega, was 40th Sunday after getting involved in a three-car 
mishap with Kenny Irwin and Wally Dallenbach that brought out the 
final caution flag.

	Israel Court Gives Md. Teen 24 Years  
</P>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- An Israeli court sentenced a Maryland  
teen today to 24 years in prison for his role in the slaying and 
dismemberment of a teen-aged acquaintance. Samuel Sheinbein's 
sentence, tough by Israeli standards, brings to an end a case that 
caused tensions between Israel and its closest ally, the United 
States, and led some U.S. congressmen to threaten to cut aid to the 
Jewish state. Sheinbein fled to Israel within days of the discovery 
of Alfred Tello's burned and dismembered remains in September 1997. 
Sheinbein sought refuge here under a law that prevented the 
extradition of Israeli citizens to foreign courts.

	U.S. To Finance Upgrade in Kuwait

<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- The United States will upgrade two air bases and  
an army camp it has been using in this oil-rich state at a cost of 
around $173 million, Defense Secretary William Cohen said today. 
Speaking here before he departed for Jordan, Cohen said the price 
was still ``a general figure'' and it has not been decided how it 
will be allocated. ``What we want is an upgrade in the capacity of 
thbases to accommodate those troops and make sure that we have the 
kind of ramp space and other types of facilities that would 
accommodate a large influx of aircraft should it be necessary,'' 
Cohen said.

militant bases, a military spokesman said. Col. Gennady Alyokhin, a 
Russian spokesman in neighboring Dagestan, said the overall 
situation in Chechnya was stable, but that Russian artillery units 
were continuing to shell the rebels in response to rebel moves to 
shore up their positions. A spokesman for the Chechen military 
command, said four people were killed and 20 wounded today in a

protest an attack on a Roman Catholic Church. ``We offered special 
prayers in all the churches at Sunday Mass for an end to religious 
violence and terrorism in the country,'' said Shahbaz Bhatti, of 
the Christian Liberation Front, an organization created to protect 
the rights of Pakistan's minority Christians. Christians, who 
comprise 5 percent of Pakistan, want the government to repeal a 
blasphemy law that imposes the death sentence for insulting Islam 
or its prophet Mohammed.

one hit in seven innings, Chipper Jones' solo homer in the fourth, 
as the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 in Game 1 of 
the World Series last night. Until the eighth inning, it looked 
like Hernandez's bad fastball to Jones would overshadow his most 
dominating postseason start, because the Yankees couldn't score off 
Greg Maddux. But after Hernandez was lifted for pinch-hitter Darryl 
Strawberry in the eighth, the Yankees scored four runs to give him

<HEADLINE> Boeing: Lost Sale No Major Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- China's decision to buy 28 planes valued at $2.5  
billion from Airbus Industrie is a disappointment to the Boeing Co. 
but not a major setback, a spokesman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a long and close relationship with the Chinese and  
we expect that to continue,'' said Mark Hooper, a spokesman for 
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. ``This is a win for Airbus and 
the next time we expect to get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase consists of eight A340s, the largest model made by  
the European consortium, plus 10 A318s and 10 A319s, all assembled 
at Toulouse, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced Saturday evening by French President  
Jacques Chirac and Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin, who was visiting 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good for Europe, good for France and good for  
employment,'' Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom McLean, Boeing's spokesman in China, told The Seattle Times  
on Saturday that the sale was not related to troubled U.S. 
relations with China over the recent U.S. indictment of Boeing's 
McDonnell Douglas unit and a Chinese aerospace firm on charges of 
violating export-control laws, or to China's failure to gain 
membership in the World Trade Organization, which meets here later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, China bases these decisions on what they believe  
is a good business plan,'' McLean said.

<HEADLINE> Harry Truman Had White House Gutted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the color guard stamped stiffly across  
the second floor of the White House to escort the president to a 
state dinner, the crystal chandelier in his study swayed ominously 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks later, when his butler walked in with breakfast,  
President Truman felt the whole floor wobble. It felt, he told his 
daughter, Margaret, as if it were simply ``floating in space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truman heeded the warning signs. ``I've had the second floor  
where we live examined -- and it is about to fall down!'' he 
reported in a letter to his sister in early 1948. ``The engineer 
said the ceiling in the state dining room only stayed up from force 
of habit!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the White House had been in hard and constant use  
for nearly 150 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Converting the mansion into a museum and moving the president  
elsewhere was not a serious option, although Truman privately mused 
about doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew the exterior image of the White House was ingrained in  
the American mind as a vivid symbol of democracy and a permanent 
home for its presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Truman was an avid historian, he was no  
sentimentalist. His final prescription was clear and crisp. 
</P>
<P>
	The original walls would remain. Everything inside them would be  
gutted and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``While his approach may seem strangely destructive today, it  
complied, for the most part, with historic preservation 
philosophies of the period,'' William O'Brien, a presidential 
projects specialist for the National Park Service, writes in White 
House History, the journal of the White House Historical 
Association. The publication devotes its most recent issue to the 
Truman renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the work began a half-century ago, the physical history of  
the White House vanished, dumped into landfills and dispensed in 
thousands of souvenir packets. Two dollars would buy enough White 
House pine to make a gavel; $100 paid for enough White House stone 
to face a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House was rebuilt inside its white-painted sandstone  
walls, its all-new interior supported by a hidden cage of steel 
beams. It was made as strong and as fireproof as a skyscraper, 
while largely duplicating the old floor plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But for those who saw the work in progress, it was a shock.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once the immense rectangular box was cleared of its historic  
insides, it was an awesome sight, a great hollow space some 85 feet 
north to south, 165 feet east to west and 70 or 80 feet high,'' 
William Seale wrote in his authoritative 1986 history, ``The 
President's House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, taken on a tour by the president himself, journalist  
and author John Hershey looked across the cavernous space to the 
``thick, ancient masonry walls which were patinated with old 
plasters and paints of many faded shades.'' Then he took in the raw 
concrete floors and columns, the new hot-air ducts large enough to 
hold a sitting workman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as if someone had decided to set up a modern office  
inside a deserted castle,'' Hershey reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, 660 tons of structural steel had been installed.  
Sub-basements were built to house new electrical, heating, plumbing 
and air conditioning systems. There were modern bathrooms, proper 
clothes closets and new kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in February 1952, just before he left on his annual  
Florida vacation, Truman set a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to Key West tomorrow and I am going to sleep in this  
house when I return,'' he announced. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 27, the president stepped out of his limousine,  
accepted a gold key to the reborn house, and briskly walked inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Truman's earlier attempt to build a new executive wing  
had been thwarted, and his building of a second-floor porch in the 
South Portico had drawn fierce criticism, his replacement of the 
historic interior of the mansion drew little public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	But some early reaction was cool.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Truman showed me around the White House, which he'd just  
redone, and he was so proud of the upstairs, which looked to me 
exactly like a Sheraton Hotel,'' Eleanor Roosevelt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was content.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no longer a chance that the leg of Margaret Truman's  
piano would sink through the floor, as it once had, or that showers 
of plaster would dust his guests. There were no more sagging 
timbers, leaking pipes or cracked plaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, like other houses would always need updates and  
repairs, but imminent collapse was no longer a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	And the ghosts -- a bantering Truman once said they disturbed his  
sleep with midnight knockings -- were definitely gone. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Steelers, Falcons Prepare for Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers can't win at home. The  
Atlanta Falcons can't win on Monday night -- and, for much of this 
season, any other day of the week, either. 
</P>
<P>
	So why, in the middle of an attention-grabbing World Series like  
that between the Yankees and the Braves, did the NFL schedule a 
Monday night game between the Falcons (1-5) and the Steelers (3-3)? 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, the league envisioned a matchup between two star  
running backs, Jamal Anderson and Jerome Bettis, amid the 
playoff-like fervor that Pittsburgh always whips up for Monday 
night games. And for good reason: The Steelers have won their last 
seven Monday home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two problems have since developed. One, Anderson is out for the  
season with a knee injury and has taken the Falcons' 28th-ranked 
rushing down with him. Two, the Steelers suddenly can't win in 
Three Rivers Stadium, where coach Bill Cowher was 45-9 until last 
November but is 0-4 since. 
</P>
<P>
	The home losing streak is the Steelers' longest since they  
played in Pitt Stadium in 1969. How long ago is that? Consider 
this: By the end of the next year, both Three Rivers and Pitt 
Stadium will be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who have uncharacteristically begun booing early and often  
probably hope they've blown up the offense by then, too. The 
Steelers' starting offense has no touchdowns in two home games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to get back to reestablishing the way we can play  
football in this stadium,'' Cowher said. ``We have to reestablish 
ourselves in this stadium with our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, the Steelers must begin throwing downfield more  
effectively. Bettis had his first 100-yard game this season in a 
languid 17-3 victory last week in Cincinnati, but Kordell Stewart 
constantly missed open receivers while throwing for only 134 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's troubles -- the Steelers are 27th in passing -- are  
persistent and consistent. He has thrown five touchdown passes in 
his last 12 starts, or about as many as Kurt Warner of St. Louis 
generates in 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	What could help Stewart is the Steelers' next four games are  
against the four NFL defenses that have allowed the most points. 
But it can't help that his top pass protector, center Dermontti 
Dawson, will miss his first start since 1988 with a pulled 
hamstring. Dawson's streak of 170 consecutive starts was the NFL's 
second longest. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep Stewart confused and unconfident, Atlanta's  
Ray Buchanan is playing mind games with him, accusing him of never 
looking off his intended receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks where he is throwing the ball,'' Buchanan said. ``I  
don't know what's going on with their offense, but he's pretty easy 
to read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, so is the Falcons' defense: It can't stop the run.  
</P>
<P>
	That's why the Falcons know what's coming Monday, and will keep  
coming until they stop it: Bettis left, Bettis right, Bettis and 
backup Richard Huntley up the middle behind fill-in center Roger 
Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter, Falcons coach Dan Reeves refuses to write off what  
has become a disaster of a season by a team that was 14-2 and 
reached the Super Bowl last season. The Falcons started 1-7 and 
finished 6-2 in 1997, and Reeves believes such a turnaround can be 
accomplished again. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it would help if quarterback Chris Chandler could  
finish his starts, something he's done once all season. He left 
last week's 41-13 loss at home to St. Louis with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can turn it around,'' Reeves said. ``It has to do with the  
confidence factor. If you start winning and you get the confidence 
and you stay healthy, you can get started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons might have picked the wrong place to do it, even if  
the Steelers haven't won at home since beating Jacksonville last 
Nov. 22. The Steelers are 12-4 on Monday nights since 1992; the 
Falcons are 5-16 on Mondays and have lost their last nine Monday 
games. Atlanta also is 1-10 all-time against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a factor,'' Reeves said. ``I think the biggest  
factor, though, is we are 1-5.''

<HEADLINE> Deion Sanders Suffers Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders left with a mild concussion  
during the first quarter of the Dallas Cowboys' game against the 
Washington Redskins Sunday, but returned to the game early in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who missed the first two games of the season with a toe  
injury, was hurt while returning a punt with less than six minutes 
left in the quarter. While being tackled by the Redskins' Dan Turk 
and Matt Sellers, Sanders was injured when the top of his helmet 
struck another player's shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys originally announced that the All-Pro cornerback had  
a strained neck, and in the second quarter they said he was not 
expected to return after a trip to the locker room revealed the 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	But with about 12 minutes remaining in the third quarter,  
Sanders sprinted out of the tunnel in the corner of Texas Stadium 
and immediately took the field for the fifth play of the Redskins' 
first second-half possession.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Wins Disney Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Tiger Woods hardly put together a  
masterpiece Sunday, but the result was the same -- another victory 
for the world's No. 1 player, who is still building on what already 
has become a masterful season. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite missing five putts from 10 feet or less and  
three-putting on three occasions, Woods avoided the kind of 
mistakes that knocked out Ernie Els and Bob Tway and closed with a 
1-over 73 to win the National Car Rental Classic at Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods finished at 271 and won $450,000, pushing his earnings to  
more than $4.7 million for the year. Even more impressive are the 
victories. Woods won for the sixth time this year on the PGA Tour, 
the most since Tom Watson won six in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hung in there today,'' Woods said. ``My putting was  
just not on. I figured if I kept hitting it close, one of them 
might go in. I got lucky and won this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Els hit into the water trying to lay up on No. 14, and had a  
35-foot birdie putt roll off the green on No. 17 that led to a 
bogey. He had a 71 and finished one stroke behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Tway was tied with Woods to start the final round and led by two  
strokes at the turn, but fell out of contention by hitting into the 
water on the par-3 12th and taking a triple bogey. Tway had a 76 
and tied for third with Franklin Langham (72) at 14-under 274. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has not broken 70 in the final round of his last four  
victories, but he's been good enough. It was the 10th straight time 
Woods has had at least a share of the lead through 54 holes and 
gone on to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way you can touch this guy right now,'' Els said.  
``He's gone to another level that the rest of us can't find.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the 13th of a career that began just three years  
ago. At age 23, he is the youngest player to win this often -- 
seven, including his victory against a strong field in Germany -- 
since Horton Smith won eight times in 1929 at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	And Woods isn't done yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Having won six of his last nine tournaments, Woods will be the  
favorite in the Tour Championship next week in Houston, and again 
in the final World Golf Championship event in Spain to close out 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning both those tournaments -- anything is possible right now  
-- would push him over $6 million in earnings for the year, an 
astounding number even with inflated purses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tway had to win Disney to get into the Tour Championship next  
week for the top 30 on the money list. As it was, there were no 
changes to the top 30. Duffy Waldorf, holding down the final spot, 
tied for 69th but no one else was able to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after making his first bogey in 43 holes on No. 2, and  
making another bogey on No. 4 by duffing a wedge from the fairway 
to fall two strokes back, Tway appeared to have control of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Consecutive birdies, and consecutive three-putts by Woods, gave  
the lanky Oklahoman a two-shot lead going into the back nine. But 
that's where Tway unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed a 4-foot birdie putt on No. 10, and Woods caught him  
with a 10-foot birdie on 10 and a 3-footer on 11. Tway took himself 
out of contention by hitting his tee shot on the 12th into the 
water, his third shot into the bunker and walking off with a triple 
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked as though Els didn't want to get his picture taken  
with Mickey Mouse during the trophy presentation. Birdies on three 
of the first four holes on the back side put him into a tie with 
Woods at 18 under, but then Els went to sleep on the par-5 14th, 
hitting a 5-iron lay up into the water and taking a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably hit my worst shot of the year,'' Els said. ``That  
took a lot out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry. Woods, playing in the group behind, kept Els in  
the game by three-putting from 20 feet to take a bogey and drop 
back into a tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament was effectively decided on No. 17, which can be  
chalked up to Els' inexperience at Disney. He left his approach on 
the ridge, and with the greens considerably faster than the first 
three days, the cup was all that could stop his ball from going off 
the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was done,'' Els said. ``I was done when I was lining up my  
putt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, meanwhile, left his approach on 17 below the hole and  
two-putted from 10 feet for par, giving him a one-stroke cushion. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods also won Disney two years ago, during his rapid rise that  
turned out to be a glimpse of what the future held. That year, kids 
stuck their heads through the netting under the grandstand to take 
a peek at the new star. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Woods holding up another trophy was old hat.  
</P>
<P>
 *DIVOTS:* Woods had seven three-putts for the week and was only 2  
under on the par-5s in three rounds at Magnolia. ... Tournament 
officials wanted to have the Tigger character at the trophy 
presentation if Tiger Woods had won, but was turned down. One 
reason? Woods got his nickname from a Vietnam War veteran, not a 
furry friend of Winnie the Pooh. Also, because Tigger is not a 
Disney creation, there were some legal concerns about the bouncy 
one being used in a promotion outside the Magic Kingdom. ... Lanny 
Wadkins, in his final PGA Tour event before he comes eligible for 
the senior tour, had a 75 and tied for 81st at 288.

<HEADLINE> Fears Aside, Americans Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Americans have many concerns as the next  
century approaches, but that doesn't keep an overwhelming majority 
from being hopeful about the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	They worry that the globe will get warmer in the next 50 years,  
think terrorists will probably attack with biological or chemical 
weapons and believe the world is likely to face a major energy 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, four of every five people questioned in a poll by the Pew  
Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press said they were hopeful 
about life in the new millennium. That outlook is fueled by their 
faith in science and technology, modern medicine and higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous polls have found that American optimism was based  
largely on the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think optimistically about the future because I don't want  
to think negatively,'' said Janice Royce, from Anchorage, Alaska, 
who is studying acupuncture in Columbia, an experimental ``city of 
the future'' about halfway between Washington and Baltimore. ``The 
economy is great. Politics will always be politics, but I like the 
direction the country is going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew poll, released Sunday, examined what people expect to  
happen in the coming decades after the start of the new millennium. 
While it found that people were generally upbeat, it also suggested 
they have serious worries about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	More than one-third expect the United States to be involved in a  
nuclear war during the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Benson, a 45-year-old delivery service employee, said he  
doesn't expect a full-scale nuclear war, ``but some close calls are 
possible, along the lines of the Cuban missile crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A majority in the poll, 56 percent, said overpopulation will be  
a major problem in the next 50 years, causing a strain on food and 
resources. About the same number thought there will be an epidemic 
worse than AIDS in that period, health care will be less affordable 
and the crime rate will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two-thirds, 64 percent, thought a major terrorist attack  
on this country involving biological or chemical weapons is 
probable. About the same number feared the world will face a major 
energy crisis and environmental problems may be a major threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God, yes,'' said Michelle Nader, a 25-year-old  
receptionist, when asked whether the environment would be a 
problem. ``All the trees are being taken down. The ozone's 
terrible. It's a mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While seven of 10 they were optimistic, 27 percent said they  
were at least somewhat pessimistic about the next 50 years in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nader had some misgivings as well. ``With all the  
technological stuff, people will just stay in their houses and do 
everything through a computer,'' she said. ``People are not going 
to do much real living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several people in Columbia expressed an optimism in the  
future reflected in the national poll. And that upbeat view seemed 
appropriate in a city carefully planned by developer James Rouse in 
the mid-1960s to be a vision of future communities. Special 
consideration was given to the location of schools, shopping 
districts, health centers and entertainment facilities to make 
living there a positive experience. 
</P>
<P>
	One Columbia resident who feels ``very optimistic'' is Linda  
Latta, a 46-year-old real estate saleswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are getting more concerned about other people,'' she  
said, ``getting into their own health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of five questioned in the national poll thought there will  
probably be cures for cancer and AIDS in the next 50 years, 
democracy will likely continue its spread around the world and a 
woman will be elected president of the United States. Nearly half 
said they thought Jesus Christ will return to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four out of five said medical advances, universities  
and science and technology will play a major role in improving 
American life. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,546 adults was taken from April 6 to May  
6 and had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Quotes About Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the fund-raising letter Pat Buchanan sent to  
would-be supporters announcing his decision to leave the Republican 
Party and seek the Reform Party presidential nomination. 

</P>
<P>
	``Over the past few weeks, many friends, many people of good  
will, have urged me to stay within the GOP. Yet I must leave the 
party that has long been my home -- with regret but not rancor -- 
because the Washington elite of the GOP has left me and the 
principles for which I have toiled and fought for 40 years, eight 
of them at the side of three Republican presidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeking and winning the Reform Party nomination, and  
contesting the Democrat and Republican nominees in the general 
election campaign next year, are Herculean challenges. But Shelley 
(Buchanan's wife) and I are eager to tackle them, with no backward 
glances. And, rest assured, we are in this race to win!'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``With your support, free from the constraints of working within  
one of the establishment parties, I plan in the weeks and months 
ahead to actively recruit Democrats, Republicans, reformers and 
independents to our movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If, with your support, I can win the Reform Party nomination,  
we will receive more than $12 million in federal funds. This means 
we will, at long last, be able to take our message -- through 
debates and advertising -- directly to all the American voters in a 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next autumn, my friend, I believe the power of our ideas can  
overcome the establishment, and we can win the presidency.''

<HEADLINE> Vols Back in National Title Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Defending champion Tennessee has a  
message for all of its doubters -- don't count the Volunteers out of 
the national title picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a saying we like to go by -- `Why not us?''' coach  
Phillip Fulmer said. ``You look at the country right now and there 
doesn't seem to be one dominant team. We'd like to think we can get 
back into the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-ranked Vols jumped right back into it with a 21-7 win  
over No. 14 Alabama. It was Tennessee's (5-1, 3-1 Southeastern 
Conference) fifth-straight win over the Crimson Tide (5-2, 4-1) and 
the Vols passed out victory cigars to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody really expects us to repeat, and when we lost to  
Florida, we were sort of written off,'' quarterback Tee Martin 
said. ``I think it's a little too early for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since losing to Florida five weeks ago, the Vols have won four  
straight. The victories weren't always pretty -- they squeaked out a 
17-16 win over Memphis -- but the Vols have played well enough the 
last two weeks to handily beat No. 10 Georgia and now Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said going in that Tennessee may be the best football team  
in the country and they didn't do anything to make me think 
otherwise,'' Alabama coach Mike DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the win over Alabama, Mississippi State is the only  
undefeated team left in the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we're coming together and peaking at just the  
right time,'' Fulmer said. ``We're not out of this thing just 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Alabama, the Vols did something no other team has  
done this year -- stop Shaun Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama tailback had run through every defense he had seen  
this season, racking up at least 100 yards in the Tide's first six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is the only team in the country to not allow a rushing  
touchdown, and has yet to let a back gain 100 yards on it. It kept 
both streaks alive against Alabama, holding Alexander to 98 yards 
rushing and one receiving touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our defense is geared to stop the run and we did a good job of  
doing that,'' Fulmer said. ``Shaun Alexander is a great back and 
when Alabama spread the field, we were scared of him. But we were 
able to stop him a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, the Vols were pleased with the 117 yards tailback  
Jamal Lewis gained. It was only the second 100-yard game this year 
for Lewis, who is coming back from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest run of the day all but sealed Tennessee's win.  
Leading 21-7 with 6:52 to play, the Vols took over on their own 
18-yard line and needed to put together a string of first downs to 
keep Alabama from getting the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis got the ball on the first play of the drive and broke up  
the right sideline for a 43-yard gain that took the life out of the 
Tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we have the best tailback in the country in Jamal,  
I wouldn't trade him for anyone in the country,'' linebacker 
Raynoch Thompson said. ``Shaun is a great back, but we were ready 
for him because we play against Jamal every day.''

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Although he still couldn't figure out a  
way to win at North Carolina Speedway, Dale Jarrett wasn't 
complaining after finishing fourth in Sunday's Pop Secret Microwave 
Popcorn 400. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last eight starts on the 1.017-mile oval, Jarrett has  
often dominated but finished second six times, seventh and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of two-time NASCAR champion Ned Jarrett led a race-high  
160 laps on Sunday, but never got back to the lead after the 261st 
of 393 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't seem to get the car right at the end of this  
race,'' Jarrett said. ``We came here to win and we thought we had 
the car to win. There again, we just have to find out what this 
racetrack wants at the end of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite coming up short in the race, Jarrett got just a little  
closer to his first Winston Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the five-point bonus for leading the most laps,  
Jarrett remained 246 points ahead of runner-up Bobby Labonte, who 
finished third in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett can could clinch the title on Nov. 7 in Phoenix if he  
can add 126 points to his lead. Even without a big swing in points, 
though, he can wrap up the championship simply by finishing 20th or 
better in each of the remaining three races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a little closer now,'' he said. ``As we knock  
these races off, and don't lose any points, or even gain a few, 
it's looking a lot more promising,'' Jarrett said. ``The team has 
worked awful hard to get to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte called the day ``a wash,'' as far as the points battle  
is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited we were able to bring home a third-place finish  
after a tough day,'' he said. ``I guess it's a shame it wasn't a 
500-mile race because we were getting better as it went. But I'm 
glad it ended when it did because we were the best we were all day, 
and you never know after the next stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSING IN:* Jeff Burton's victory in a Ford Taurus all but  
assured the Michigan auto maker of winning the 1999 NASCAR 
Manufacturers' Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford only needs a second-place finish in one of the last three  
races to wrap up its fourth title since NASCAR's modern era began 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, each of the three championships by Ford has come in  
the '90s. The company previously won in 1992, 1994 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory Sunday was Ford's 13th of the season. Chevrolet had  
12 wins and Pontiac six. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CRASHED OUT:* Dale Earnhardt, who came into Sunday's race  
hoping that a late-season surge could carry him into the top five 
in the points, had a crash-shortened afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	On lap 322, he tangled with Kenny Irwin and slammed into the  
wall on the backstretch. Earnhardt's Chevrolet then careened down 
the banking. Wally Dallenbach eased off the gas to avoid Earnhardt 
and got hit from behind by Jerry Nadeau. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt wound up 40th in the 43-car field. He remained seventh  
in the standings, but now trails sixth-place Jeff Burton, the race 
winner, by 161 points, and fifth-place Tony Stewart by 204. 
</P>
<P>
	``This might have knocked us out of it,'' said Earnhardt, who  
won the previous week in Talladega. ``It depends on how the guys do 
that are in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to finish today. We just needed to finish, at  
least.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPARK PLUGS:* Burton's sixth victory of the season moved him  
within one of Jeff Gordon. ... Ward Burton's second-place finish 
Sunday was his best in Rockingham since he won this race in 1995. 
... Bobby Labonte's third-place finish was his seventh consecutive 
top 10 this season. ... Mark Martin, sixth on Sunday, has finished 
sixth or better in each of his last five Rockingham starts. ... 
Rick Mast, who finished 38th, 24 laps behind, remains the only 
driver to be running at the end of all 31 races this season.

<HEADLINE> Israel Court Gives Md. Teen 24 Yrs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- An Israeli court sentenced a Maryland  
teen on Sunday to 24 years in prison for the slaying and 
dismemberment of a teen-aged acquaintance, bringing to an end a 
case that raised tensions between Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Uri Goren's sentence of Samuel Sheinbein was not a  
surprise; lawyers for Sheinbein and the Israeli prosecution had 
arrived at the plea bargain in August. In Israel, judges usually 
study plea bargains for several weeks before assenting. 
</P>
<P>
	Goren said the 24-year sentence was ``meaningful.'' He ordered  
Sheinbein to undergo psychiatric treatment while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein bludgeoned 19-year-old Alfred Tello Jr. to death on  
Sept. 16, 1997, cut up his body with an electric saw and hid the 
body parts in a nearby garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein fled to Israel within days of the discovery of Tello's  
burned and dismembered remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein successfully sought refuge here under a law that  
prevented the extradition of Israeli citizens to foreign courts. 
Sheinbein had only passing contact with Israel, but his father, 
Saul, was born here. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's refusal to extradite Sheinbein outraged U.S.  
authorities and prompted protests from senior officials, including 
Attorney General Janet Reno. Some congressmen who had otherwise 
been friendly to Israel threatened to cut aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland authorities said they would not pursue a capital case,  
but noted nonetheless that Sheinbein's sentence would be much 
tougher in his home state than in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein, whose sentence will include the time he has already  
served since being arraigned in 1997, could be free in as little as 
14 years with time off for good behavior. In addition, Israel has a 
much more liberal furlough policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Hadass Naor said Sheinbein would be eligible for 24  
furloughs in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the sentencing. Sheinbein's mother, Victoria, choking  
back tears, told reporters, ``It's unfair. It couldn't have 
happened to a better kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goren sentenced Sheinbein, who was 17 at the time of the  
killing, as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Needle, a friend that Maryland authorities also believe  
was involved in the murder, killed himself while in detention in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	A court recognized Sheinbein's right to be tried here. Israel's  
attorney general appealed the decision all the way to the Supreme 
Court; when that failed, earlier this year, the state started 
proceedings against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the American court system and we hope they respect  
ours,'' prosecutor Naor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer David Libai, a former Justice Minister, said the  
sentencing was just. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendant received one of the most harsh sentences ever  
imposed on a minor convicted of murder in Israel,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland authorities say they will continue to pursue a case  
against Sheinbein, should he ever leave Israel. They say double 
jeopardy does not apply to persons convicted of crimes overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has since changed its law preventing the extradition of  
citizens for crimes committed elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, GOP Spar Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With one last spending bill left to arrive at  
the White House, Republicans say President Clinton is holding at 
least one measure hostage in hopes the GOP-run Congress will steer 
money to such administration initiatives as teacher hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	But a veto of that bill -- a politically popular $268 billion  
defense measure that includes pay raises for the military -- could 
be hard to override. 
</P>
<P>
	The top House Democrat sought on Sunday to quell speculation  
that enough Democrats could join Republicans to override a veto of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to uphold these vetoes and I'm going to work very  
hard to do that,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri 
said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has signed seven of the 13 spending bills to fund the  
government in the 2000 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. He has 
vetoed two -- on foreign aid and the District of Columbia -- and has 
yet to act on three others, including the defense bill. The largest 
spending bill, dealing with education and health and social 
services, remains before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense bill, approved by wide margins in the House and  
Senate, would increase spending by $17.3 billion and raise military 
pay by 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has until Tuesday to sign the bill or veto it.  
Meanwhile, government agencies whose spending bills have not been 
signed into law are operating under stopgap legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some compromises. We don't need confrontation right  
now,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to me like Dick Gephardt is talking about  
confrontation,'' Domenici said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``He's 
telling the House members, don't help the Republicans with 
anything. He's trying to encourage the president not to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., questioned the reach of  
Gephardt's lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been used by the left wing of his party, and  
doesn't want to get our work done,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would like to put all the appropriations bills into a big  
bundle and then spend more money. And that's what's happened over 
the years, we're just not going to do that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling defended the threat.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we can come together on that budget, then the president  
won't have to veto anything,'' Sperling said on CNN. ``We certainly 
don't want to veto the defense bill, nobody does, but we need to 
make sure we have an honest budget. Right now, there are some 
problems in that defense budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans might pick up support from some pro-defense  
Democrats who have said they would help provide the two-thirds 
margin in both houses needed to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt denied ``strong-arming'' them or any other Democrats.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I said to my members was if the president vetoes any of  
these budget bills because they don't add up or they don't make 
sense for America, I will work hard to get enough members, both 
Republican and Democratic, to uphold those vetoes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sparring comes as the parties are trying to position  
themselves for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats fended off attacks from GOP ads last week accusing  
Clinton of raiding the Social Security surplus -- the excess of 
payroll taxes over benefits paid -- to spend on new federal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans also took heat, from Democrats and from within  
the party as well, for a proposed 1.4 percent across-the-board 
budget cut that does not include the lawmakers' own 3.4 percent pay 
increase. They contend the plan -- which would affect all government 
operations except the salaries, Social Security, Medicare and other 
benefits -- would cut a penny of waste, fraud and abuse for every 
dollar spent.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Doctors Will Lie for Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Many physicians approve of deceiving insurance  
companies or health maintenance organizations to secure payment for 
treatment if patients cannot get it any other way, a survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 169 internists in eight cities found that 58  
percent considered it ethical to lie for a patient who needed a 
heart bypass operation, and 48 percent considered it ethical to lie 
to get intravenous pain medication and nutrition for a dying cancer 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentages were lower for less serious conditions,  
researchers said in Monday's issue of the American Medical 
Association's Archives of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the doctors was asked if he or she had ever actually  
lied or would lie -- only whether it would be justified for a 
physician to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The mailed survey posed hypothetical treatment situations. In  
one, a 55-year-old woman who has never had a mammogram seeks the 
test after her sister dies of breast cancer. Almost 35 percent of 
the doctors said it was OK to say a suspicious breast lump existed 
when it didn't in order to get coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the heart bypass example, a woman suffering angina who needs  
the procedure is forced to change insurance companies. The new 
company says it won't cover the pre-existing condition unless it 
becomes more serious. A majority of doctors said they would lie and 
report that her chest pains increased in frequency to have the 
surgery covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Just under 3 percent said they would tell an insurance company  
that a 55-year-old woman who wanted a cosmetic nose job needed the 
procedure for a medical reason, such as difficulty breathing, the 
poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most physicians (76 percent) believed their primary  
professional responsibility was to practice as their 'patient's 
advocate,''' said researchers led by Dr. Victor Freeman of 
Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	One co-author, Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, said the margins of error  
were different in each hypothetical and typically were between 5 
and 10 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Raiders' Wheatley Injures Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland tailback Tyrone Wheatley was  
taken off the field on a cart after injuring his back in the third 
quarter of the Raiders' game Sunday against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, the Raiders' leading runner this season and one of the  
main reasons Oakland began the day leading the league in rushing, 
was hurt while fumbling for the second time in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley was on the ground for two minutes before trying to  
stand up, but was unable to support himself. He was taken off by 
cart a few minutes later. The severity of the injury was not 
immediately clear.

<HEADLINE> Road to NCAA Title Hits a Few Bumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Re-boot your computers, it's going to be a bumpy ride to the  
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Saturday filled with shockers and season-saving  
comebacks, a few more title chasers fell by the wayside, but No. 1 
Florida State and No. 2 Penn State barely held on to perfect 
seasons with far-from perfect performances. 
</P>
<P>
	When the day ended, five of top 13 teams had been beaten --  
Nebraska for the first time; and Michigan, Alabama, Michigan State 
and Texas A&AMP;M each for the second, thus dropping them from the 
national title scene. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, the Bowl Championship Series releases its first  
standings, which will be used to pick the top two teams to play in 
the Sugar Bowl, college football's designated national title game 
this season. The standings are based on a formula that combines 
polls, computer ratings, strength-of-schedule and won-loss records. 
</P>
<P>
	While Florida State (8-0) and Penn State (8-0) remained 1-2 in  
the AP media poll and the coaches' poll, No. 3 Virginia Tech (6-0) 
has been gaining ground in the eight computer ratings being used by 
the BCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Hokies were rated first by five of the eight  
services being used by the BCS. This week, they were first on two 
of three ratings services that were available as of Sunday 
afternoon. But they will likely lose ground when a weak schedule is 
weighed into the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	Same for No. 6 Kansas State (7-0), which spotted Oklahoma State  
a 21-point lead Saturday and then won 44-21. Anyway, that's for the 
computer to digest. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's not forget about No. 4 Tennessee (5-1), the defending  
national champions who beat No. 14 Alabama 21-7 in Tuscaloosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a saying we like to go by -- `Why not us?''' Vols coach  
Phillip Fulmer said after Tee Martin ran for two TDs and threw for 
another. ``You look at the country right now and there doesn't seem 
to be one dominant team. We'd like to think we can get back into 
the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State gave Bobby Bowden career win No. 300 with a 17-14  
decision over Clemson before a record crowd of 86,200 at Death 
Valley. But college football's first father-son coaching matchup 
almost produced the season's biggest upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mamma's happy, I know that,'' Bobby Bowden, referring to his  
wife, Ann, who said she wanted her husband to win in a close game. 
``It was close -- too close for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles trailed 14-3 at halftime, but rallied with some  
help from reinstated wide receiver Peter Warrick. The one-time 
Heisman Trophy frontrunner caught 11 passes for 121 yards but 
dropped at least four balls, and failed to come up with one of his 
patented game-breaking plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete had a couple of times he could win the darned game,''  
said Bowden, adding that the last time he saw that many bobbles was 
during Warrick's freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-ranked Nittany Lions survived Drew Brees once again  
in beating Purdue 31-25. Brees threw for 379 yards and two 
touchdowns, but Penn State forced him into four incomplete passes 
over the final 28 seconds after he had moved the Boilermakers (5-3, 
2-3) to the Lions 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just way too close,'' said Lions linebacker LaVar  
Arrington, who scored one of two defensive TDs and also blocked a 
field goal. ``Right now, my nerves are all messed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bowden became the fifth major college coach to reach 300  
wins, Penn State's Joe Paterno won No. 315 and moved into a third 
place on the list, a game ahead of Amos Alonzo Stagg and eight 
behind the leader, Bear Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games Saturday, it was: No. 12 Texas 24, co-No.  
8 Nebraska 20; co-No. 8 Mississippi State 17, LSU 16; No. 10 
Georgia 49, Kentucky 34; No. 11 Wisconsin 40, No. 19 Michigan State 
10; No. 13 Marshall 59, Buffalo 3; Illinois 35, No. 15 Michigan 29; 
No. 16 BYU 29, UNLV 0; No. 17 East Carolina 52, Tulane 7; No. 20 
Southern Mississippi 28, Cincinnati 20; No. 21 Ohio State 20, 
Minnesota 17; No. 24 Oklahoma 51, No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M 6; and No. 23 
Miami 31, Boston College 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a rundown of the top games:  
</P>
<P>
	-- At Madison, Wis., Ron Dayne picked himself up and got back in  
the Heisman race with 214 yards and two TDs as the Badgers (6-2, 
4-1) remained in the Big Ten race. The Spartans (6-2, 3-2) were 
beaten last week by Purdue, 52-28. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Ann Arbor, Mich., Kurt Kittner threw four TD passes and  
once-lowly Illinois (4-3, 1-3) rallied from 20 points down to stun 
the Wolverines (5-2, 2-2), who have dropped their last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Austin, Texas, Major Applewhite threw two second-half TD  
passes as Texas (6-2, 3-1 Big 12) came from behind for its third 
straight win over Nebraska (6-1, 3-1), which saw its title hopes 
dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Norman, Okla., Josh Heupel accounted for six TDs -- three  
running and three passing -- as Oklahoma (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) handed 
Texas A&AMP;M (5-2, 2-2) the third-worst loss in the school's 105-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Boston, Andy Crosland's 30-yard field goal with 3 seconds  
left capped an amazing comeback by Miami 15 years after losing to 
the Eagles on Doug Flutie's Hail Mary pass. The Hurricanes are 3-3 
and 1-0 in the Big East; BC is 5-2, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``People ask you, `Have you ever seen anything like this before?  
''' Miami coach Butch Davis said. ``Unfortunately, I've been on the 
other side of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was a Miami assistant in 1984 when Miami blew a 31-point  
lead to Maryland in what remains the biggest college football 
comeback. The next week, Miami lost to BC 47-45 on Flutie's 48-yard 
desperation TD heave. 
</P>
<P>
	The glamour game was at Death Valley.  
</P>
<P>
	A few trick plays from Tommy's Tigers nearly ended his father's  
quest for a second national title and first perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
	First, a fake punt led to a first-half TD as Clemson took a 14-3  
halftime lead. But Sebastian Janikowski's third field goal -- a 
39-yarder with 5:29 left -- provided the winning points. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson (3-4, 3-2 ACC) staged a final charge, and with one more  
razzle-dazzle play -- a series of handoffs and then a 14-yard pass 
reception by quarterback Woody Dantzler, was set to tie the game. 
However, Tony Lazzara's 41-yard field goal attempt fell short after 
it was partially tipped by FSU's Tay Cody with 1:57 left in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those games you go out there and play and you  
feel like you're losing, you're losing, you're losing, and you're 
going to get beat,'' Bobby Bowden said. ``Then all of a sudden you 
win it and I don't even know how. This was a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pac-10, Todd Husak threw for two TDs and ran for a third  
as Stanford (5-2, 5-0) remained perfect in the league with s 34-31 
win over now struggling USC (3-4, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Oregon State (4-3, 1-3) hammered UCLA 55-7, the most  
points the Bruins (3-5, 1-4) have allowed since 1970 when they lost 
to Washington 61-20.

<HEADLINE> Trump, Buchanan To Join Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a pledge to shake up American politics,  
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan announced that he's bolting the 
Republican Party to seek the Reform Party nomination. ``We are in 
this race to win!'' he told supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must leave the party that has long been my home -- with  
regret but no rancor -- because the Washington elite of the GOP has 
left me and the principles for which I have toiled and fought for 
40 years,'' Buchanan said in a fund-raising letter obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, the pugnacious conservative commentator whose  
insurgent campaigns hobbled Republican front-runners in 1992 and 
1996, planned to formally announce his intentions today in suburban 
Virginia. His GOP presidential campaign never broke out of the 
single digits in polls, and he had trouble raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan would not be assured of winning the Reform Party  
nomination and would be a longshot in the general election, 
although Democratic and Republican operatives say he could win 
enough votes to make a mark on the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	He began considering a third-party bid after Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush secured early dominance over GOP money, endorsements and 
poll ratings. A second-tier finish in a high-profile August straw 
poll in Iowa sealed his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan complained the nomination was rigged in favor of Bush,  
a candidate he thinks is too moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to take his potent mix of anti-trade populism and  
anti-abortion conservatism to the party founded by Ross Perot and 
``build a mighty, unprecedented coalition of Americans all across 
party lines,'' Buchanan said in the letter mailed to backers late 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will officially leave the Republican presidential campaign,  
and announce I am a candidate for the 2000 presidential nomination 
of the Reform Party,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential rival, New York tycoon Donald Trump, was changing  
his party allegiance from Republican to Reform Party today. He 
called Buchanan ``a Hitler lover'' on Sunday, and said he would 
decide early next year whether to seek the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a crowded field.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's highest-ranking  
elected official, appears to be reconsidering his promise not to 
seek the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I should be the candidate. But what do I do? I'm  
between a rock and a hard place,'' he was quoted as saying in The 
New York Times magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot has not ruled out a third presidential bid.  
</P>
<P>
	At stake is more than $12 million in federal money earmarked for  
the Reform Party nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans worry that a strong Buchanan candidacy would siphon  
conservative voters from the eventual GOP nominee. ``There's no 
place for conservatives to go other than to Pat,'' said former 
White House chief of staff John Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls substantiate GOP fears, although some surveys suggest  
that Buchanan would attract as many Democrats as Republicans. In 
current polls, no more than one in 10 voters tell pollsters they 
would support him. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is the sixth person to quit the GOP nomination race,  
leaving Bush and five others in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised backers he would to fight ``without compromise''  
against abortion, protect jobs against unfair trade, curb legal 
immigration, rebuild U.S. defenses, avoid foreign entanglements, 
outlaw unlimited ``soft money'' donations in politics and reform 
Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	It is largely the same platform that helped Buchanan win the New  
Hampshire primary in 1996 and put a scare into President Bush in 
1992. Entitlement reform and campaign finance overhaul -- two Reform 
Party tenets -- are new to Buchanan's stable of issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who said his campaign treasury is ``virtually empty,''  
sought help to raise the $4 million to $6 million he said he will 
need to win the nomination. ``I believe the power of our ideas can 
overcome the establishment, and we can win the presidency!'' he 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> NY Cardinal Returns to Pulpit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Still weak from radiation therapy, Cardinal John  
O'Connor returned to the pulpit Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral 
for his first public Mass in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The spiritual leader for New York's 2.2 million Catholics joked  
about his newly bald pate and made an emotional promise to continue 
preaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people tell me my hair may grow back. Red and curly,  
perhaps,'' O'Connor told the worshippers, who applauded his return. 
``Maybe I'll stick with the Yul Brynner look. ... Our Lord never 
said that hair had anything to do with getting to heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 79, was hospitalized last week for side effects from  
the radiation therapy he received after a brain tumor was removed 
in September. On Sunday, he slowly gave a 15-minute homily, then 
sat down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given his age ... and given the relatively high doses of  
radiation that he received, he's going to experience a little bit 
lower energy level,'' said Archdiocese spokesman Joe Zwilling. ``He 
was actually overjoyed to be able to preach at the Mass today.''

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson To Play One Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Magic Johnson's comeback will last one  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Johnson will play competitively for the first time  
since retiring from the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Johnson will play for a Swedish League team that  
bears his nickname, Magic M7, against a team from Uppsala named 
Sallen after its main sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Johnson's comeback is so great that the game will be  
broadcast live on one of the biggest networks. Basketball is 
popular in Sweden, but ranks far behind soccer and ice hockey, and 
league games are almost never televised. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's team is based in Boras, a city of 110,000 in western  
Sweden. The arena seats about 3,800 and it was sold out quickly for 
Johnson's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson works out daily and in early August, he played 12  
minutes in his annual all-star game at the Forum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	So how many minutes can Johnson play in a league that is  
certainly not among the best in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to say how many minutes Earvin can play,''  
said Charles Barton, head coach of Magic M7 and a former Swedish 
national team coach. ``I expect him to play a lot. He wouldn't come 
and not be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Magic M7 finished fifth in the Swedish League and  
missed the playoffs. This year, the team is off to a 6-0 start and 
hardly needs Johnson. But who could ever turn down one of the 
greatest basketball players ever? 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players tonight after practice that they have to  
play with Earvin, not watch him,'' Barton said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, whose parents flew over from Columbus, Ohio, to see  
their son coach what will be the most memorable game of his career, 
always thought Johnson was the ultimate player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him a lot. He could play point guard and center in  
the same game,'' Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
	So which position will Johnson play Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably point guard, but I have to see him in practice,''  
Barton said. ``The practice tomorrow will be more fun than the 
game, to tell one of the greatest players ever that `we want you to 
move here. ...' It's a tremendous challenge and honor at the same 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Haney, who is Magic M7's manager, said Johnson picked  
Sweden partly because of the impression the country made on him 
during a 1996 tour with his all-star team made up of former NBA 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a licensing agreement and he's an advisor and  
consultant to the team,'' Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who led Michigan State to the NCAA championship in 1979  
and the Lakers to five NBA titles in the 1980s, learned he had 
tested positive for the virus that can cause AIDS in 1991, and 
retired for the first time just before the start of the 1991-92 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to play on the U.S. Dream Team that won the gold  
medal in the 1992 Olympics, he made a brief NBA comeback before the 
1992-93 season, but quit again after several players expressed 
concerns about playing with him for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1996, he returned to the Lakers and played the  
remaining half of the season, retiring again, at age 37, after the 
Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Packers 31, Chargers 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- That disaster in Denver was just a hiccup for  
Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after his worst game as a pro, Favre threw three  
touchdown passes and the Packers exposed San Diego's weak pass 
defense and awful offense in humiliating the Chargers 31-3 on 
Sunday. Green Bay (4-2) had six interceptions in winning for the 
first time in three road games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 31-10 loss at Denver, Favre was 7-of-23 for 120 yards  
with three interceptions. Against the Chargers (4-2), who were 
shakier than usual on pass coverage because of injuries, Favre was 
an efficient 12-of-22 for 173 yards, with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chargers starter Erik Kramer threw his third interception,  
Favre put it away by leading the Packers on a 99-yard, 14-play 
drive. A 3-yard TD pass to Antonio Freeman made it 28-3 with three 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorsey Levens, who scored in the second quarter, had 71 yards on  
the long drive, including 25 on a swing pass that got the ball to 
the Chargers 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers were so in control that Favre was replaced with 9:42  
to go by Matt Hasselbeck, who got his first snaps from scrimmage. 
In their first three wins, the Packers needed touchdown passes from 
Favre in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers were brutal in flunking their first big test under  
rookie head coach Mike Riley. All three of Kramer's interceptions 
set up Packers touchdowns and Jim Harbaugh was picked off three 
times. The Chargers lost sole possession of first place in the AFC 
West and had their three-game winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
	It got so bad that after Kramer fumbled the snap and recovered  
midway through the third quarter, the fans started chanting 
``Harbaugh, Harbaugh!'' Five plays later, after moving the Chargers 
to the Packers 10, Kramer was intercepted by Tyrone Williams at the 
Green Bay 1 to set up the 99-yard scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh came in, all right, but his first pass was intercepted  
by Williams. Darren Sharper and Antuan Edwards finished off the 
six-pickoff day. Sharper's interception set up Ryan Longwell's 
46-yard field goal with 1:54 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers ran just 19 plays in the first half, yet took a 14-3  
lead. Overall, they ran 30 fewer plays than the Chargers and gained 
295 yards to San Diego's 303. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was intercepted twice in the span of three plays, by Mike  
McKenzie and Fred Vinson, and the Packers capitalized on both. 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers cornerback Jimmy Spencer, starting in place of injured  
Darryll Lewis, was burned for passes of 35 and 22 yards as Favre 
moved the Packers 80 yards, capped by his 7-yard pass to William 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay needed to move only 28 yards after the next  
interception, with Levens scoring on a 6-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's other TD pass was a 6-yarder to Bill Schroeder in the  
third quarter, set up by a 44-yard pass interference call on 
Terrance Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carney provided San Diego's only points, a 28-yard field  
goal late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was 18-of-36 for 161 yards and Harbaugh 7-of-18 for 78  
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 68,274 set a Chargers regular-season record.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Moves Up in Big 10 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Barry Alvarez's Wisconsin Badgers are  
playing so well, he can coach them sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has. Alvarez, reduced to traveling in golf carts and  
overseeing games from the press box because of a knee injury, 
hasn't had too many worries in the last month. The No. 11 Badgers 
have stormed into second place in the Big Ten Conference with four 
straight wins and a big head of steam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a joy to watch the guys play when they execute your game  
plan as well as we have in the last few weeks,'' Alvarez said. ``It 
makes this knee thing a whole lot easier to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers (6-2, 4-1 Big Ten) are playing with more confidence,  
players say, than during last season's 11-1 run to a Rose Bowl 
victory. A return trip to Pasadena is looking increasingly possible 
with each win by Wisconsin and national title contender Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that if we win out, we're going to be in a great  
position,'' said sophomore cornerback Jamar Fletcher. ``We've still 
got a lot of goals left to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's 40-10 thrashing of Michigan State on Saturday was a  
second straight overwhelming afternoon at Camp Randall Stadium for 
the Badgers, who have rung up 1,065 total yards of offense in their 
last two games while allowing 350. 
</P>
<P>
	The experienced offensive line is creating truck-sized holes for  
Ron Dayne, whose run at the major-college career rushing record was 
given new life on Saturday. The line sprung Dayne for 214 yards and 
two touchdowns, and he needs just 483 in the last three games to 
break Ricky Williams' mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to say what I've said all along: If we're  
winning games, all those other good things are going to come,'' 
Dayne said. ``That's my only concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez' biggest task now becomes avoiding a letdown. He plans  
to appeal to his team's sense of pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've just got to keep level-headed,'' Alvarez said. ``I  
reminded them we are the defending Big Ten champs, and we're going 
to fight like hell to try to keep it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers trail No. 2 Penn State (8-0, 4-0) by a half-game in  
the conference standings. Wisconsin is alone in second place 
because of losses by Michigan, Michigan State and Minnesota on 
Saturday. Wisconsin doesn't play the Nittany Lions this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've grown a lot as a team in the last few games,'' said  
freshman quarterback Brooks Bollinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollinger took over the team in the second half of the Badgers'  
loss to Michigan, and Wisconsin has outscored its opponents 177-65 
in its five Big Ten games since. Teams must respect Bollinger's 
mobility and his increasingly accurate arm, and when Dayne is 
thrown in, the combination has been too much to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans were overwhelmed by the Badgers' offensive  
versatility, and their own offense didn't get untracked until the 
game was out of reach. Afterward, even Alvarez was surprised by how 
powerful the Badgers have become. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like we could run the ball, but I actually thought we  
would have to throw the ball a little more than we did,'' said 
Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised by the score of the game, but I'm not  
surprised by how well our team played.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys 38, Redskins 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders got the Dallas Cowboys  
started and he was there to rev them up at the end. But while he 
was shaking off a head-spinning hit, it was Troy Aikman who led 
them to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman threw two touchdown passes and scored on a 1-yard run as  
the Cowboys built a 17-point lead, then held off a Redskins 
comeback for a 38-20 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas (4-2) broke out of an offensive drought and ended a  
two-game losing streak to tie Washington for the NFC East lead. The 
Cowboys, who won their first meeting 41-35 in overtime, have beaten 
the rival Redskins five straight times for the first time since 
1979-81. 
</P>
<P>
	In their season-opening meeting, Washington led 35-14 in the  
fourth quarter before Dallas rallied. The Redskins almost returned 
the favor this time as a 17-0 Cowboys lead was reduced to 24-20 
early in the fourth quarter following a 44-yard touchdown pass from 
Brad Johnson to Albert Connell. 
</P>
<P>
	Things looked bleak for Dallas as the next drive began with  
Emmitt Smith and Rocket Ismail in the locker room with injuries and 
the ball on the Cowboys 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But Aikman moved Dallas 93 yards in 13 plays, two of the biggest  
being third-down receptions of 12 yards by Ernie Mills and a 
52-yarder to Jason Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman, who finished 20-of-32 for 244 yards, ended the series  
with a scrambling touchdown run. The play made him a 1,000-yard 
rusher over his 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	With Dallas ahead 31-20, it was Sanders' turn.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who had missed most of the second and third quarters  
because of hard hit to his head, returned his first punt of the 
second half 70 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Holy Ghost'' dance he'd been promising to show off on his  
next visit to the end zone wasn't anything more than a few points 
to the sky. Nonetheless, it again enlivened the crowd -- which 
included former Nobel prize winner Nelson Mandela -- and it ended 
Washington's comeback hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders also got the Cowboys going to start the game. On the  
first play, he tackled Stephen Davis for a 4-yard loss. The crowd 
joined him in celebration and Dallas fed off that energy to force a 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was Aikman's turn. He drove Dallas to scores on their  
first three possessions, including two touchdowns. That first-half 
burst matched the number of scores the Cowboys had total in the 
previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman hit Raghib Ismail on a 13-yard fade for the first score  
and Emmitt Smith ran in from the 1 on the second touchdown. In 
between, struggling Richie Cunningham booted a 32-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins fought back, though, as Mike Sellers bounced off  
two tacklers for a 33-yard touchdown following Smith's score. Then 
a fumble by Ismail turned into a 36-yard Brett Conway field goal 
that made it 17-10 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
	On Washington's first drive of the second half, Conway hit a  
24-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson couldn't find the same touch as the opener, when he  
threw for 382 yards and the Redskins churned out 504 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the NFL's No. 1 offense managed 272 yards. Johnson  
was 23-of-35 for 218 and Davis, who came in as the NFC's leading 
rusher, had 62 yards on 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dallas, Smith ran 24 times for 80 yards -- a huge improvement  
over his 25 yards on 24 carries the previous game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys had 352 yards, well off the 541 they had in the  
opener but more than any game since.

<HEADLINE>  Khannouchi Sets Marathon Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Khalid Khannouchi was all by himself as he  
crossed the finish line of the Chicago Marathon, his world-record 
time flashing above him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was fitting, really, since Khannouchi truly is a man alone.  
He's atop the running world, and with his bid for American 
citizenship stalled, he has no country. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the moment I've dreamed of,'' said Khannouchi, who won  
the LaSalle Banks Chicago Marathon in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 42 
seconds Sunday, shattering the previous world best by 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working hard, believing in myself,'' he said. ``When  
I got to the finish line, I was so excited, so happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khannouchi trailed two-time Boston Marathon winner Moses Tanui  
of Kenya by 33 seconds at the 21-mile mark, but he caught Tanui by 
the 25th mile and easily outdistanced him, winning by 34 seconds. 
As he crossed the finish line, Khannouchi burst into tears and was 
wrapped in a bear hug by his wife, Sandra, who also is his coach 
and agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Khannouchi won a Volkswagen Beetle and $165,000, including a  
$100,000 bonus for breaking Ronaldo da Costa's previous world 
record of 2:06:05 set in 1998 at Berlin. Tanui finished in 2:06:16. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya fell just before  
the halfway point, but managed to edge countrywoman Margaret Okayo 
by a second in the closest women's finish at Chicago. Chepchumba 
finished in 2:25:59 while Okayo, running in her first marathon, 
clocke 2:26:00. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disappointments were da Costa, who dropped out at  
the 15th mile with lower back pain, and Catherina McKiernan, the 
world's No. 1 distance runner last year. McKiernan, who'd won the 
previous three marathons she entered, had stomach cramps throughout 
the race and finished 12th in 2:35:30. 
</P>
<P>
	The only disappointment for Khannouchi was that he didn't set  
the record as an American. Born in Morocco, Khannouchi moved to the 
United States in 1993 when he didn't get the support he felt he 
deserved from the Moroccan running federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Embraced by Americans, he applied for citizenship so he could  
run for the United States in the Sydney Olympics next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Khannouchi asked for expedited citizenship, but his request was  
denied in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always positive we have chances,'' he said. ``We're  
working hard and we're not going to give up. But if I don't have a 
chance to run in the Olympics as an American, I won't run. I'd 
prefer to wait another four years or maybe for the world 
championships. I want to give something back to the sport in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still Moroccan, I still have Moroccan blood. But the  
federation, I don't want to deal with them anymore. They put me 
down the time that I needed them, and it's not worth it to go back 
to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Khannouchi, American chances at the Olympics next year  
are dismal. Little-known David Morris, originally of Eagle River, 
Alaska, finished fourth and set an American record of 2:09:32, 
beating the 2:09:35 Jerry Lawson ran in Chicago in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, whose previous best was 2:15:25 at Pittsburgh last year,  
is the first American to meet the 2:14 qualifying time for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully Khalid can get pushed along and become an American  
citizen. There's our gold medal,'' said Todd Williams, who finished 
in 2;14:58. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American women met the 2:33 qualifying time for Sydney.  
Libbie Hickman of Fort Collins, Colo., finished sixth in 2:28:34. 
Kristy Johnson of Shephardstown, W.Va., was 10th in 2:32:34. 
</P>
<P>
	Khannouchi, who set a world debut best in 1997 when he won  
Chicago in 2:07:10, came close to repeating last year. But hampered 
by a stress fracture in his heel, he was passed in the final mile 
by Ondoro Osoro, who broke Khannouchi's debut mark with 2:06:54. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into Chicago, Khannouchi had won five of his last seven  
races and finished second in the other two. But with a field that 
included da Costa, Osoro and Tanui, Khannouchi said it would have 
to be ``his day'' to win. It was. 
</P>
<P>
	With race-time temperatures of 36 degrees and swirling winds,  
Tanui hung back before making a charge to catch the leaders between 
the 17th and 18th miles. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran 4:40, 4:40 and 4:33 for miles 17, 18 and 19, opening  
about a 10-second lead over the rest of the group. Khannouchi tried 
to close at the 22-mile mark, but Tanui put on another burst of 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I confused the miles,'' Tanui said. ``I did not know which  
kilometer I was running. Today, when I started to make my move, I 
thought I was over 35 kilometers. Unfortunately, I was at about 
maybe 30 kilometers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By mile 23, Khannouchi had cut five seconds off Tanui's lead and  
continued to close. At mile 24, Tanui's lead was down to nine 
seconds. Khannouchi moved ahead just before they entered a tunnel 
underneath McCormick Place on Chicago's lakefront, and by the time 
they emerged, Khannouchi had a commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2:04:32, with about a quarter-mile left, Khannouchi looked  
over his shoulder to make sure Tanui wasn't gaining on him and 
raced to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the best, but I'm one of the best,'' Khannouchi said.  
``That's one of the things I want people to understand. I'm not 
going to hold the world record forever. Somebody's going to come 
and break it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I dreamed of breaking the world record and I worked hard  
to get it. I'll be happy to hold it only for one hour. If somebody 
comes and breaks it, I'll be happy.''

<HEADLINE> Fans React To NBC's Rose Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC Sports reporter Jim Gray's relentless  
questioning of Pete Rose about gambling before Game 2 of the World 
Series in Atlanta prompted strong viewer reaction Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were quite a bit of phone calls. It was nonstop for at  
least an hour,'' said an NBC employee who declined to give her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	The local NBC affiliate in New York said operators fielded more  
than 600 complaints about the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cincinnati, NBC affiliate WLWT said there were calls nonstop  
for two hours after the interview. After the game, it rebroadcast 
the interview and got more calls. The station said some callers 
held for as long as half an hour to express their opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who was banned by baseball for gambling in 1989, was  
interviewed in front of the Yankees dugout at Turner Field 
following his introduction as part of the All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray asked him why he hasn't admitted that he bet on the sport.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to admit to something that didn't happen,'' said  
Rose, baseball's career hits leader. ``I know you're getting tired 
of hearing me say that. It's too festive a night to worry about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, refusing to change the subject, said the commissioner's  
office had strong evidence that Rose bet on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, show it to me, where is it?,'' Rose asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``But you agreed to a ban from baseball for life,'' Gray said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It also says I can apply for reinstatement in one year. I was  
looking forward to that day,'' Rose answered. 
</P>
<P>
	He applied to commissioner Bud Selig two years ago, but received  
no formal response. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gray suggested maybe Rose should take a different approach  
to getting reinstated by admitting guilt, Rose said, ``You say it 
hasn't worked, what do you mean?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Rose appeared taken aback by the line of questioning,  
and said: 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I'm surprised you're bombarding me with this. I'm  
here to do an interview with you on a great night, a great 
occasion. You're bringing up something that happened 10 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray declined to speak with a reporter about the interview after  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim's intent was to try to give Pete Rose an opportunity in a  
celebratory atmosphere on a major league baseball field for the 
first time in 10 years, to comment on the issues that have kept him 
out of baseball,'' NBC spokesman Ed Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the entire intention. These weren't new questions.  
They weren't a surprise. But Jim felt that in this atmosphere, and 
the ovation and emotion, that there was an opportunity there for 
Pete to shed some new light on all this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Leyritz and several other Yankees stopped to speak with Gray  
in the walkway after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an embarrassment to your profession,'' Leyritz  
said. ``Pete's done his time. To come off the field and have that 
question asked is barbaric. It's disgraceful. This whole ballclub 
was angry. If we weren't professionals, we could say, `Jim we don't 
want to talk to you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On a sports wrapup show in New York after the game, Mets pitcher  
John Franco said Gray overdid it in the interview and that 10 years 
was long enough for Rose to be punished. Later in the show, Yankees 
catcher Joe Girardi agreed that Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE> Stuart Case Fresh in Boston Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It was an emergency call that turned the city  
upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, police dispatchers heard the frantic voice of  
Chuck Stuart. With a gunshot wound in his abdomen, Stuart said he 
and his pregnant wife, Carol, had been robbed and shot. 
</P>
<P>
	No one doubted his story that a black gunman had commandeered  
their car as they left a hospital birthing class, drove them to the 
inner city and then shot them. Pictures of his mortally wounded 
wife were published nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	The story inflamed white fears in a city where in the two months  
prior to the Oct. 23, 1989 attack, there had been nearly 200 
shootings in neighborhoods with large numbers of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But a black man wasn't guilty of murder -- Stuart was believed to  
be the killer. The 30-year-old was found dead in an apparent 
suicide after his brother confessed to helping hide a gun used in 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The deception, and the controversial police response, almost  
overshadowed the death of Carol, 30, and her infant son. The baby, 
delivered by Caesarean section, survived just 17 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Stuart) took advantage of the times we were in and the  
environment he was in,'' said Boston police spokeswoman Margot 
Hill. ``He knew exactly what he was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings launched an enormous manhunt, with police fanning  
out through neighborhood housing projects frisking black men. State 
politicians called for reinstatement of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the murder, William Bennett, a 39-year-old  
paroled convict, was arrested on an unrelated charge. He became the 
prime suspect after witnesses said he had boasted of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart's body was recovered from Boston Harbor about seven weeks  
later after he apparently jumped off a bridge. His death cleared 
Bennett, but many blacks were outraged. They accused the police of 
violating their constitutional rights and of railroading Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 10-year anniversary of the shootings approached, former  
police commissioner Francis ``Mickey'' Roache denied he ever 
ordered police to pursue Bennett's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew Willie Bennett wasn't going anywhere, and we didn't  
want to serve a warrant that had nothing to do with the murder of 
Carol and the unborn child,'' Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roache said that then-District Attorney Newman Flanagan took  
over the investigation and ordered Bennett's arrest without ever 
consulting the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanagan told The Boston Globe last week that he doesn't  
remember where the order to arrest Bennett came from. He also 
suggested Roache's new claims could be aimed at deflecting 
attention from Roache's role in the entire episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's lawyer, Robert George, denounced the former  
commissioner for trying to rewrite history at a time when Roache is 
seeking re-election to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mickey Roache was at every bank of microphones he could find  
and at every television camera he could put himself in front of 
defending his police officers and their tactics in the Stuart 
case,'' said George. 
</P>
<P>
	Roache's statements also renewed racial tensions created by the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anniversary probably could have come and passed in a very  
reflective way. I have to tell you the former police commissioner's 
comments have been explosive and the reflection has turned into 
anger,'' said state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson, a leader among the 
city's black residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusations that the Boston police -- and media -- were too  
willing to believe that a black man had fired the shots had a 
profound effect on the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Although charges were never brought against Bennett in the  
killing, his attorney maintains the case led to two false armed 
robbery claims. Bennett was only recently released from prison 
after serving seven years for one of the charges, George said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett unsuccessfully sued the police department, claiming that  
officers violated his civil rights by coercing potential witnesses 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, Boston is a radically different place. The  
city's homicide rate has dropped by 80 percent and once-blighted 
neighborhoods like the South End, Jamaica Plain, parts of Roxbury 
and Mission Hill are revitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between police and black residents have improved in  
the last decade Wilkerson said, but tensions remain over crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something about that particular combination that  
people lose objectivity and it just brings out the worst in people, 
brings out their stereotypes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol's brother, Carl DiMaiti, 47, said that even though a  
decade has passed, his family mourns ``every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my own mind, I still can't understand how anyone could do  
that,'' he said. ``In the whole sensationalism of the case, a 
vibrant, caring, brilliant woman has been lost. Only her friends 
and family know that.''

<HEADLINE> Mississippi St. Still Undefeated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- Despite its inconsistent offense,  
Mississippi State is in the top 10 for the first time since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs (7-0, 4-0 SEC), thanks to their stifling defense,  
are one of just six Division I-A undefeated teams. They cracked the 
upper tier of The Associated Press poll by moving up four spots to 
No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State remained among the ranks of the undefeated  
only after Rod Gibson powered in from a yard out -- on a play he 
doesn't even remember -- with 1:39 left Saturday night as the 
Bulldogs won 17-16 over LSU (2-5, 0-5). 
</P>
<P>
	``Defense wins championships. All we have to do as an offense is  
make the plays when we have to,'' said sophomore quarterback Wayne 
Madkin, who played with his surgically repaired finger throbbing in 
pain. ``But we've got to learn to be more consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-play, 65-yard effort that ended with Gibson's touchdown  
was the longest drive of the game for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Against an LSU defense that had given up more than 30 points a  
game in its first four SEC games, Mississippi State managed just 
260 total yards and 15 offensive points. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jackie Sherrill was blunt in assessing his team's  
offensive performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not very good. We just really didn't, and haven't found a  
smooth niche,'' Sherrill said. ``But the bottom line is to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the Bulldogs are winning, 7-0 overall and 4-0 in the SEC  
for the first time in school history. They've also won 10 straight 
regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
	But how many more games can they depend on their defense to hold  
teams and just get by on offense? 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as it takes, as long as we are getting wins,'' said  
senior defensive back Tim Nelson. ``We prepared all summer to be 
ready to hold up for the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks before the LSU game, backup quarterback Matt Wyatt led  
the Bulldogs to two touchdowns in the final two minutes in an 18-16 
victory at Auburn. Wyatt played after Madkin tore a tendon in the 
middle finger of his throwing hand. 
</P>
<P>
	A pin placed in his finger during an open date, Madkin played  
the entire game against LSU. He struggled at times, completing just 
14-of-31 passes for 174 yards and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Madkin hit 3-of-4 passes on the winning drive, converting a  
third-and-9 with a 20-yard pass to freshman Terrell Grindle. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson, still woozy from a hit he took on the previous play, a  
5-yard screen pass on which he was stuffed inside the 1 by two LSU 
defenders, says he was sprawled across the goal line when came to 
his senses. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know was I was in the end zone when I got up,'' Gibson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU led 10-0 after its first two possessions, but the Tigers  
offense didn't score again on the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	With rumors rampant about coach Gerry DiNardo's future, LSU  
twice blew the lead and lost its fifth straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hope is that the team understands that regardless of the  
outcome that is how you play,'' DiNardo said. ``As hard as they 
worked to get ready for the game, as hard and they put the 
distractions of the week behind them, it is still worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Mississippi State went ahead with 11-10, aided by two  
blocked punts, LSU responded with a blocked punt of its own, 
recovered by safety Ryan Clark in the end zone to put the Tigers 
ahead 16-11 with 11:24 to play.

<HEADLINE> USOC President Hybl To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- One of the most harrowing years  
in U.S. Olympic history is ending with USOC president Bill Hybl's 
decision to follow executive director Dick Schultz in stepping 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl told U.S. Olympic Committee board members Sunday that he  
will not seek reelection and will leave office after completing his 
four-year term at the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when a bribery scandal in Salt Lake City stained the  
Olympic image, three of the most powerful men in the USOC have 
announced their resignations -- former marketing boss John Krimsky, 
Schultz, and now Hybl. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl's decision means the USOC will start with a clean slate of  
leaders at least a year before the Winter Games in Salt Lake City 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl, 57, said his business obligations as chief executive  
officer of the philanthropic El Pomar Foundation and vice chairman 
of the luxurious Broadmoor hotel in Colorado Springs were too 
pressing to continue his 40-60 hour-a-week volunteer position at 
the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick and I talked about this over the last three months,''  
Hybl said. ``It really is a question of being able to devote the 
amount of time necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the deciding factor was his feeling that he had to  
devote all his energy at the USOC over the next 14 months to moving 
ahead with an independent drug-testing program and putting 
restructuring proposals into place without spending time running 
for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some regrets,'' Hybl said, saying he might have  
pushed sooner for the independent drug-testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for all of us currently in office, Salt Lake City and,  
to a lesser degree, Atlanta have had an impact on the way that 
we've been perceived by the public. And it's our job then to work 
even harder to bring the true Olympic ideals back to the 
forefront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz praised Hybl's quiet, steadying influence in the face of  
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did a great job in providing the leadership we needed  
during the Salt Lake City challenge,'' Schultz said. ``The thing 
everybody has to realize is that the president's job, as it's 
constructed now, demands a huge amount of time. I'm amazed that he 
or any other volunteer could give that amount of time. This is a 
job you don't get paid for. You get all the crap and none of the 
glory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz announced two months ago that he would resign as soon as  
a replacement was found. He could be replaced as early as February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be 71 by the time of Sydney,'' Schultz said. ``What we  
need now in a chief executive officer is somebody willing to come 
in and make a 5-10 year commitment, start the changes, see them 
through and have that continuity. My family would kill me if I made 
another five-year commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said he believes ``the transition will be seamless'' as the  
USOC installs new leaders. He and Schultz will continue to help 
with fund raising and act as advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the chairman/president role goes,'' Hybl said,  
``there are 20 to 25 individuals in this movement in the United 
States that could do that job starting tomorrow, and that's why I'm 
comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said he also believes that International Olympic Committee  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch is serious about reforming the IOC 
in the wake of its bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is making, I believe, many of the right steps to present a  
new face of the IOC to the world,'' Hybl said. ``The greatest thing 
he is doing is involving the athletes, electing their own 
representatives, 15 of them, to serve on the IOC as voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC already has 20 athletes on its 113-member board, while  
20 percent of the executive committee is made up of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will be the legacy,'' Hybl said. ``They're not always  
right, in my view, but they certainly are a conscience to this 
organization.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Said Happy With Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Lummy could not be more pleased with his  
home or his neighborhood. After all, the three-bedroom Cape Cod 
where he has lived for 35 years in Old Saybrook, Conn., is only a 
few blocks from Long Island Sound. ``We're delighted with where we 
live,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is hardly alone in liking his community, a government report  
finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to rate their homes and neighborhoods on a scale from  
1-to-10, 69 percent of Americans rated their houses 8 or better and 
67 percent gave that endorsement to their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are in the massive ``American Housing Survey for the  
United States: 1997,'' being released Monday by the Census Bureau 
and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
	By a narrow margin Midwesterners are the happiest with their  
homes, with 70.3 percent rating them 8 or higher. Some 70 percent 
of folks in the Northeast gave their houses similar approval 
ratings, as did 69.9 percent in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Westerners seem somewhat less satisfied, with  
65.8 percent giving their homes ratings of 8 or better. 
</P>
<P>
	Lummy would give 10s to both his house and neighborhood. ``We've  
been extremely happy there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Hensley, schoolteacher from Carrollton, Ohio, is happy with  
his community, too. He and his wife built a two-bedroom home in a 
neighborhood where every lot is an acre in size. ``We know 
everybody. You have neighbors, but you have a little bit of land, 
too. It's the best of both worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Aycoth settled in Mount Pleasant, N.C., a small town near  
Charlotte, after a stint in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Love the house ... I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. It's  
where we always wanted to be.'' he said. ``It's a good hometown, 
family atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to neighborhoods, Midwesterners were once again  
happiest, with 69.3 percent giving a rating of 8 or more. That 
level of satisfaction was expressed by 68.4 percent of Southerners 
and 65.7 percent of Northeast residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Westerners were least satisfied with just 62.7 percent, giving  
their neighborhood a rating of 8 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings of the report included:  
</P>
<P>
	--There are 99.5 million occupied housing units in the United  
States, with owners living in 65.5 million and renters in the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	--The housing stock includes 62.1 million single detached homes,  
6.5 million mobile homes and the rest in attached homes and 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some 77 million homes are in metropolitan areas, and 22 million  
in rural locations. 
</P>
<P>
	--The median home size was 5.4 rooms. That means half had more  
than that and half fewer. Homes were biggest in the Midwest, 5.6 
rooms, and smallest in the West, 5.2. In the Northeast the median 
was 5.5 and it was 5.4 in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	--The largest share of homes, 44 million, had one complete  
bathroom while 39 million had two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	--Just over 2 million homes lacked a complete kitchen.  
</P>
<P>
	--There were 49 million homes with central air conditioning and  
25 million had window air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	--Warm-air furnaces are the most common form of heating, warming  
59 million homes. Second was steam or hot water at 13 million, 
followed by 11 million electric heat pumps, 6 million with built-in 
floor or wall units and 4 million with built-in electric heaters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Piped gas was the most common heating fuel, serving 51 million  
homes. Electricity was used by 24 million, followed by fuel oil, 10 
million and bottled gas, 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--There were 286,000 homes without a toilet, 328,000 did not have  
a tub or shower and 385,000 were without piped hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	--The vast majority, 88 million homes, were connected to a  
central water supply and 11 million had wells. There were 77 
million homes connected to public sewer systems and 22 million 
using septic tanks, cesspools or chemical toilets.

<HEADLINE> Parrots, Turkeys Called a Bad Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POINT ARENA, Calif. (AP) -- Parrots are beautiful, exotic -- and  
make lousy neighbors for turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners of a large turkey farm on the Mendocino County coast  
are threatening to move because a new neighbor is bringing in 
hundreds of parrots. 
</P>
<P>
	Avian experts say that having the two large groups of birds so  
close to each other poses a significant risk of spreading 
potentially fatal disease to both the parrots and the turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Gould said last week that she and her Parrot  
Preservation Society are not going anywhere, claiming that planning 
officials originally told her the parrot farm would not be a 
problem. But she conceded she may lose, based on a recent 
preliminary ruling that found her in violation of agricultural 
zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nicholas Turkey Breeding Farms operation has operated in the  
remote hills of Point Arena for years, choosing the location 
because it was isolated from chickens and pet birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Francine Bradley, a bird expert with the University of  
California Cooperative Extension office at Davis, said the turkey 
farm has an extensive ``bio-security'' system. The rare human 
visitors to the farm are required to shower and put on sterile 
coveralls before entering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does seem ironic that there's only one turkey ranch and  
only one parrot breeding farm in Mendocino County and they're next 
to each other in Point Arena,'' said Keith Faulder, an attorney on 
the turkey farmers' side. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parrot Preservation Society, a nonprofit group dedicated to  
saving parrots around the world, moved in during summer and brought 
the parrots from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Thirty-seven blueberry growers in  
western Michigan have been found in violation of federal child 
labor, minimum wage or overtime provisions, the U.S. Labor 
Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	In one field, investigators found workers as young as 7 years  
old. 
</P>
<P>
	``One young child working in the fields illegally is one child  
too many. One dollar in unpaid wages is one dollar too much,'' said 
James Smith, a district director with the department's Wage and 
Hour Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The department reported last week that the 37 growers, in Van  
Buren, Ottawa, Allegan and Berrien counties, had violated one or 
more provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Migrant and 
Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture is one of the key industries we have targeted to  
increase labor law compliance,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Michigan growers have been fined a total of $17,925 for  
violating child labor laws, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to note that fines were issued in some cases, but if  
you look at the amount, they're really insignificant,'' said Gary 
Gershon of the Michigan Migrant Legal Assistance Project, The 
enforcement of labor laws is ``grossly inadequate and has always 
been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three growers were found to have violated the migrant workers  
law for actions that included using an unregistered farm labor 
contractor, unsafe transport vehicles and failing to get proper 
insurance coverage, the Labor Department said. Penalties of $3,000 
were assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 48 workers for four growers were awarded $11,986 in  
back wages because they were paid less than the minimum wage, while 
39 workers received $3,295 for overtime work for three growers. 
</P>
<P>
	In other violations, the department said 11 growers failed to  
provide workers with information such as housing conditions or wage 
statements.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Confused Texas A&AMP;M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Texas A&AMP;M's Wrecking Crew defense got the  
worst of this wreck, a collision with an Oklahoma offense that 
generated 552 yards and handed the Aggies their worst loss in 98 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma confused the Aggies with a variety of formations that  
left quarterback Josh Heupel to take his choice of receivers. He 
often found the right one, finishing 31-of-50 for 372 yards and 
three touchdowns to go along with three sneaks for scores in a 51-6 
victory Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have just in the last couple weeks just evolved in  
everything we're doing,'' said coach Bob Stoops, whose team had 
last week off. ``We're improving and getting our players to 
understand more of what we're trying to get done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M (5-2, 2-2 Big 12) entered the game ranked 10th  
nationally in scoring defense (14.5 points a game) and total 
defense (258 yards a game). The Sooners had 14 points in the first 
8 1/2 minutes and 376 yards by halftime. By then they had run 60 plays 
and picked up 20 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a dizzying and disappointing night for coach A.C. Slocum,  
who had warned during the week that his team could not get into a 
shootout with the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really wasn't a shootout. We got shot,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma established itself right away, when Jarrail Jackson  
returned the opening kickoff 53 yards. When the drive stalled, 
Patrick Fletcher got a first down on a fake field goal and three 
plays later, Heupel scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners' second drive featured an alignment the Sooners call  
``Ninja'' -- just three interior linemen, and two groups of three 
receivers split wide to either side. Heupel wound up dumping shovel 
passes to tailback Michael Thornton for 11, 8 and 12 yards, and 
eventually Heupel hit Curtis Fagan on an 8-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma blocked a 39-yard field goal try on A&AMP;M's next  
possession, and special teams scored big again a few minutes later 
when Seth Littrell went 41 yards with a fake punt. That led to a 
field goal and a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma added 17 more by halftime -- one drive included a  
hook-and-lateral that gained 17 yards -- to lead 34-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the past two games, losses to Notre Dame and Texas, the  
Sooners didn't fade after taking a big lead. They continued to 
build, with Heupel throwing touchdown passes of 22 and 26 yards and 
the defense playing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy McCown, who came in averaging nearly 255 yards per game  
passing, was just 9-of-21 for 131 yards and left midway through the 
third quarter with a separated left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the third-worst in A&AMP;M history, the worst since a  
46-0 loss to Baylor in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously took a big, big step back as a team today,'' said  
Slocum, who was denied his 100th coaching victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma took a step forward. The Sooners (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) are  
only a half-game behind Texas and Texas Tech in the Big 12 South 
Division. They scored their most points in a Big 12 game, and gave 
up their fewest. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was their first against a ranked team since the  
fifth game of 1996, when they beat No. 25 Texas. It also lent 
credence to what Stoops has been saying all along -- the Sooners 
have enough talent to play with anyone on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told 'em we expect to play well like this each and every  
week if we continue to learn and understand what we're doing,'' 
Stoops said. ``That's what we're pushing for. We don't always do 
it, didn't always do it tonight, but we're going to keep pushing.''

<HEADLINE> Game 2 Turns in 1st Inning for Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It all came apart in a hurry for Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
	The first three New York batters -- Chuck Knoblauch, Derek Jeter  
and Paul O'Neill -- all singled sharply for a quick 1-0 lead during 
Sunday night's Game 2 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Right away, Kevin Millwood was in big trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make good pitches,'' he said. ``Everything was right  
down the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers succeed with location and Millwood's location wasn't  
great. ``I thought I had pretty good stuff,'' he said. ``I wasn't 
nervous. I just threw everything down the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a recipe for trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, poised for a big inning, the Yankees ran into a roadblock  
when cleanup batter Bernie Williams hit into a double play that 
might have short-circuited the early rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood thought he might escape.  
</P>
<P>
	``With just one run, it would be pretty good for myself and the  
team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But New York wasn't done.  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored two more runs in the inning on two-out hits  
by Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius sandwiched around a walk to 
Ricky Ledee. 
</P>
<P>
	Again the problem was his command of pitches. ``I didn't make  
pitches when I needed to,'' he said. ``I felt fine the whole time. 
I just didn't do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only when Millwood slipped a third strike past Joe Girardi was  
the inning finally over. But by then, the damage was done. The 
Yankees dented him for five hits in one inning, which was all 
Atlanta managed for all nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Braves took their first swings, they were trailing  
3-0, not a great situation for a team that has managed just three 
runs in the first two games of this suddenly one-sided Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all a matter of location,'' manger Bobby Cox said. ``He  
wasn't down and he wasn't up high enough. He was kind of in the 
middle, where he shouldn't have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, who had emerged as the ace of an outstanding Atlanta  
pitching staff, was making his World Series debut. He got through 
the second inning, but never retired a batter in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made bad pitches in the first inning, the second inning and  
the third inning,'' he said. ``I was lucky to get out of the 
second. When I tried to make good pitches, I threw it down the 
middle of the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early knockout was Millwood's shortest outing of a season in  
which he posted an 18-7 record and a 2.68 earned run average. He 
beat Houston in the divisional playoff and the New York Mets in the 
National League Championship Series and also had a save against the 
Astros. He was 2-0 with a 2.38 ERA in the postseason until the 
Yankees caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood threw 38 pitches in the first inning alone and the  
Yankees had eight hits in 13 at-bats against him. He finished the 
night with 67 pitches, 24 of them balls and 43 strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching is all about making adjustments,'' he said. ``I tried  
to make adjustments. It just didn't work for me tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood's quick departure was the second earliest ever for a  
Braves pitcher in World Series history, topped only by Bob Buhl, 
who was knocked out in the first inning by another Yankees team in 
Game 3 of the 1957 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	If it is any solace for Atlanta, that Braves team won that World  
Series in seven games.
