DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh extended her support

Sheikh Hasina told visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Friday evening.

The Palestinian leader told Hasina that he had mastered support
from 120 countries including the Organization of the Islamic
Conference and the Arab League in his efforts for the declaration

PARIS,August 18(Xinhua)-- Former President of Cote d'Ivoire
Henri Konan Bedie, living now in exile here, is going home on
September 3 to participate in his country's presidential election
in October,the local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bedie, who was overthrown in a military coup d'etat late last

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Libya Try to Improve Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- In a sign that Turkey and Libya
are trying to improve bilateral relations, Turkish Foreign Ministry
on Friday evaluated as "successful" a Turkish parliamentary
delegation's recent visit to the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation from Turkey-Libya Parliamentary Friendship Group
concluded its five-day visit to Libya on Friday. During the visit,
Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi sent a goodwill and friendship
message to Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
</P>
<P>
Libya's Secretary for External Relations and International
Cooperation Abdel Rahman Shalgham also invited Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem to visit
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said these are important steps taken to
overcome problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Libya soured four years ago when
former pro-Islamic Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan visited
the country in October 1996 and made fundamentalist remarks.
</P>
<P>
As a result of exchange of harsh statements from both sides,
Turkey called back its ambassador to Tripoli in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 when Erbakan's government was toppled under the pressure
from the powerful Turkish military who accused him of pursuing
anti-secular domestic and foreign policies, Turkey re-sent an
ambassador to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Turkish delegation, Shalgham said
Turkey can prevent the emergence of fundamentalist movements both
in Libya's region and in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Libya also asked Turkey, its "only ally friend" in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to assist in determining the
location of mine fields left over from the World War II and
eliminating them, saying records of the mine fields must exist in
NATO archives.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities accepted the Libyan request for
assistance and promised to do what they can with regard to NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation visited Turkish construction companies
working in Libya, especially on the Sub-Saharan water pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Turkey attaches importance to Libya, the road to trade with
Africa. The two countries are trying to tap into the African market
together on the basis of mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.N. embargo on Libya was lifted in April 1999, the
country has been struggling to regain its place in the world.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Claims Its Air Defenses Shot Down Another U.S. Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman said
on Saturday that an American plane has been shut down in southern
Iraq by its anti-air defenses, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Yassin Jasim, major general of the Iraqi
Air Defense Command, said that the plane was shut down on July 26
and crashed in the Saudi desert.
</P>
<P>
This had resulted in the suspension of the United States and
British air raids against Iraq "for many days," he was quoted by
the INA as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not explain why Iraq made the announcement
till almost one month later.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman claimed that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery has
shot down more than 10 U.S. and British planes. "We have evidence
to prove that," he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been challenging the U.S. and British jets patrolling
and enforcing the no-fly zones ever since the air war in December
1998 in southern and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the zones, which are not directly
covered by a U.N. resolution and have been the site of almost daily
skirmishes since December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Oppose Jerusalem Internationalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side totally opposes
the idea of internationalizing the holy sites in Jerusalem, said
Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
Abu Mazen, also known as Mahmoud Abbas, denied reports that Egypt
had put forward new initiatives regarding the future of Jerusalem
during his recent visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit came in the wake of a short visit by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to Egypt to discuss the latest
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
He bitingly blasted Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert for granting
Palestinians in Jerusalem Israeli citizenship, terming the move as
a scheme to annex the holy city, sacred to Muslims, Jews and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official also stressed that the Palestinian side was
willing to resume negotiations with Israel provided that good
preparations be made.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian Camp David summit on July 11-25 failed
to reach an agreement due to wide gaps between the two sides over
the fate of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership is keen to reach a peace deal with
the Israelis before the September 13 deadline, which might restore
the Palestinian national rights, Abu Mazen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "We are seeking to bring about a just and
permanent peace which guarantees the rights of Palestinians,
especially regarding Jerusalem, Israeli withdrawal to the June 4,
1967 borders, cessation of Israeli settlements and release of
(Palestinian) prisoners and detainees."
</P>
<P>
On holding a new three-way summit, Abu Mazen said such a summit
was proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton at the end of the Camp
David summit. The Palestinian party did not object to such a
summit, but good preparations should be made, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Rescuers Arrive, Sub Crew Survival Hope Dim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- British rescuers arrived Saturday
evening in the area where a Russian nuclear submarine with 118
crew went down a week ago, but Russian officials say chances are
very slim now for the survival of those aboard the ill- fated
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The British rescuers arrived aboard the Norwegian ship Normand
Pioneer, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. Norwegian divers will
reach the site later Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
All previous attempts by Russian rescuers failed.
</P>
<P>
Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian
rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the
cripple Kursk is lying.
</P>
<P>
The latest information from the site said the joint rescue
operation will start at 01:30 a.m. Sunday Moscow time (2130 GMT
Saturday) following the arrival of the Norwegian divers.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday he submarine's
ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency escape
hatch, may be flooded.
</P>
<P>
That statement implies that there is virtually no chance to
save any of the submariners aboard.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but
Admiral Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet, said there
were three possible versions.
</P>
<P>
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on
collision with another object.
</P>
<P>
Motsak said three foreign submarines were spotted in the
accident zone, which is an area under constant observation by
foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kursk's collision detonated three or four torpedoes,
resulting in a blast equivalent to 1-2 ton of TNT.
</P>
<P>
The second is an explosion inside the submarine with subsequent
flooding of the sub's first and second compartments.
</P>
<P>
And the third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War
II mine, the admiral said. The final suggestion should not be
completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in
that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a
government commission probing the causes of the accident, said the
crewmembers in the first, second and possibly several subsequent
compartments of the submarine died instantly when the Kursk struck
the seabed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Klebanov said that there is still a chance that some
sailors may still be alive in the eighth and ninth sections, but
that this chance is more of a theoretical nature, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
As the nation and the world pray for the sailors aboard the
Kursk, the relatives of the submariners are having an especially
hard time. The government has allocated funds to help those that
have arrived to the northern port city of Murmansk and other
places near the accident site.
</P>
<P>
In one moving episode, the director of a train bound for
Murmansk turned off the speakers of a carriage that housed the
relatives of the Kursk crew -- to stop them from hearing radio
broadcast of comments from military officials that the submariners
' chance of survival was almost zero.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, donations are being collected for the
relatives and religious ceremonies held to pray for the crew's
safe return.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Continue to Rescue Russian Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain plans to continue its bid
to reach and rescue the 118 Russian sailors in a sunken submarine
even though virtually all hope of finding survivors has faded,
British Defence Ministry said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said British and Russian naval officers are
liaising on how to mount a last-ditch rescue attempt after a
British team with a manned mini-submarine arrived at the scene at
1600 GMT and reported weather conditions to be "almost perfect"
for their mission.
</P>
<P>
But Vice-Admiral Mikhail Motsak, the head of Russia's Northern
Fleet, said earlier that there is now virtually no hope of any
survivors among the 118 crewmembers on board the submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, there was no hope that normal air pressure
had been maintained in the rear sections - SOS signals hammered
out by sailors trapped there soon after the accident indicated
water had broken through.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet whether the British team will be given the
chance to make a rescue attempt before a decision is taken by the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
Commander Alan Hoskins, who is organizing the British effort at
the scene, said they would continue offering assistance until the
Russians told them to stop.
</P>
<P>
Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts
to dock with the Kursk overnight. A spokesman said damage to the
escape hatch was proving "an insurmountable obstacle."
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said there is no reason to believe the
British mini-submarine and its crew, whose assistance was formally
requested on Wednesday, will perform any better.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gloomy outlook, the British submarine's chief pilot,
Tim Heron, believes they may still be able to save lives with
their state-of-the art technology.
</P>
<P>
"(The British mini-submarine) can move like an underwater
helicopter, up and down, round about and backwards and forwards,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A second vessel carrying British and Norwegian divers is due to
arrive at the scene of the disaster on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Lashes Out at Iraqi Propaganda Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Saturday lashed out
at what it called the recent Iraqi propaganda campaigns against
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the editors in chief of Kuwaiti
newspapers, Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said these "agressive acts
are not only directed against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia but also
against all Gulf countries."
</P>
<P>
"Such Iraqi threats come to confirm our doubts about the
credibility of the Iraqi regime and about any possibility it abides
by relevant United Nations resolutions," Sheikh Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the threats posed by Iraq to the security and
stability of Kuwait prove once again that the Iraqi regime is still
continuing its agressive policy against Kuwait in violation of U.N.
resolutions concerning Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official added that Iraq's continuous campaign
against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia "stirs the astonishment of the
world community."
</P>
<P>
In a speech made earlier this month, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein criticized Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states for hosting
Western military bases since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said the leaders of certain Gulf states "should be
ashamed that the aggressors' planes take off from their territories
to strike Iraqi targets, killing its women, men and children and
destroy what they possess."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Saddam's remarks, Kuwait once put some of its
armed forces on alert for "any emergency".
</P>
<P>
But the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) denied that Baghdad had
made any threats against Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"No Iraqi leader, whether directly or indirectly, has threatened
the Kuwaiti regime," said a political editor at INA in an article.

CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Six Israeli companies will undertake six irrigation
projects in Turkey at a cost of 7 million U.S. dollars within the
scope of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), reported Anatolia
News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey earlier requested Israel to propose firms after 30
companies had applied for the GAP irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Those companies are expected to start implementing the
irrigation projects at the end of 2000 after a formal agreement is
signed between Turkey's State Water Works and the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is expected to generate 1.613 billion Egyptian
pounds (460.86 million U.S. dollars) from textile products in the
first half of this year, up by 25.9 percent from 1.281 billion
pounds (366 million dollars) during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, textile exports
reached 52,000 tons to the value of 1.346 billion pounds (384.57
million dollars), while the figures stood at 43,000 tons worth 1.13
billion pounds (322.86 million dollars) in the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in exports was attributed to an increase in
international textile prices, cessation of anti-dumping legal
actions taken by the European Union (EU) producers and producers'
efforts to open new markets.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Used by some 10 million people worldwide, Palm pocket
computers have sold 5,000 units since they were launched on Turkish
market in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
Robotics, which is the Turkish distributor of Palm computers,
targets a sales volume of 40,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Palm, a computer of U.S. origin, displays all the functions of a
home or office computer.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- The number of Jordanian banks in the Palestinian self-
rule areas has reached 12 with 55 branches by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The accounts of those banks rose to 1.95 billion Jordanian
dinars(2.79 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of 1999, up 15.1
percent from 1998, according to a report by the Central Bank of
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian bank branches in the West Bank were closed down
following Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
1967. Jordan reopened its banks in the Palestinian self-rule areas
after it signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1994.

MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- British rescuers arrived Saturday
evening in the area where a Russian nuclear submarine with 118
crew went down a week ago, but Russian officials say chances are
very slim now for the survival of those aboard the ill-fated Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The British rescuers arrived aboard the Norwegian ship Normand
Pioneer, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All previous attempts by Russian rescuers have failed.
</P>
<P>
Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian
rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the
cripple Kursk is lying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday that the
submarine's ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency
escape hatch, may be flooded.
</P>
<P>
That statement implies that there is little chance to save any
of the submariners aboard.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Navrotsky, head of the Northern Fleet's press service,
said special rescue devices in the ninth compartment had been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but
Admiral Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet, said there
were two possible versions.
</P>
<P>
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on
collision with another object. The second is an explosion inside
the submarine with subsequent flooding of the sub's first and
second compartments.
</P>
<P>
The third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War II
mine, the admiral said. The final suggestion should not be
completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in
that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Motsak said earlier Saturday that "we have crossed the critical
guaranteed life support limit that we had set for the personnel in
the guidance manuals."
</P>
<P>
"A critical situation for the crew has apparently begun," he
said. "No matter how hard it is to say, we have to state the worst
expectations."

<HEADLINE> UK Rescuers Arrive, Sub Crew Survival Hope Dim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- British rescuers arrived Saturday
evening in the area where a Russian nuclear submarine with 118
crew went down a week ago, but Russian officials say chances are
very slim now for the survival of those aboard the ill-fated Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The British rescuers arrived aboard the Norwegian ship Normand
Pioneer, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. Norwegian divers will
reach the site later Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
All previous attempts by Russian rescuers failed.
</P>
<P>
Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian
rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the
cripple Kursk is lying.
</P>
<P>
The latest information from the site said the joint rescue
operation will start at 01:30 a.m. Sunday Moscow time (2130 GMT
Saturday) following the arrival of the Norwegian divers.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday that the
submarine's ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency
escape hatch, may be flooded.
</P>
<P>
That statement implies that there is virtually no chance to
save any of the submariners aboard.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but
Admiral Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet, said there
were two possible versions.
</P>
<P>
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on
collision with another object.
</P>
<P>
Motsak said three foreign submarines were spotted in the
accident zone, which is an area under constant observation by
foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kursk's collision detonated three or four torpedoes,
resulting in a blast equivalent to 1-2 ton of TNT.
</P>
<P>
The second is an explosion inside the submarine with subsequent
flooding of the sub's first and second compartments.
</P>
<P>
The third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War II
mine, the admiral said. The final suggestion should not be
completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in
that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a
government commission probing the causes of the accident, said the
crewmembers in the first, second and possibly several subsequent
compartments of the sub died instantly when the Kursk struck the
seabed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Klebanov said that there is still a chance that some
sailors may still be alive in the eighth and ninth sections, but
that this chance is more of a theoretical nature, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
As the nation and the world pray for the sailors aboard the
Kursk, the relatives of the submariners are having an especially
hard time. The government has allocated funds to help those that
have arrived to the northern port city of Murmansk and other
places near the accident site.
</P>
<P>
In one moving episode, the director of a train bound for
Murmansk turned off the speakers of a carriage that housed the
relatives of the Kursk crew -- to stop them from hearing radio
broadcast of comments from military officials that the submariners
' chance of survival was almost zero.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, donations are being collected for the
relatives and religious ceremonies held to pray for the crew's
safe return.

<HEADLINE> Digital Mobile Phone to Be Introduced in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Yemeni government has approved
the Sabaa Phone Company to execute a digital mobile phone project
before the end of the year, said a source at the Telecommunications
Ministry here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, capital Sanaa, Eden and other main cities
will be covered by the mobile phone network within one year, and
the network will extend to the rest of the country in a couple of
years, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract between the company and the government, Sabaa
Phone Company will pay the government 10 million U.S. dollars for
the operation permission, he added.
</P>
<P>
To head off monopoly and guarantee high quality services, the
government also allowed Space-tel Company, owned by investors from
Yemen and Oman, to take part in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Sabaa Phone Company is expected to spend roughly 50 million
dollars in the first year, and the total investments may amount to
130 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The firm is owned by Yemeni Al-Ahmar Trade and Industry Company
with a 41 percent stake, Egyptian Orascom Company with 32 percent
stake, Greece Hailascom Company with 22 percent stake and the
International Contractors Union Company with 5 percent stake.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices to Rise in Cyprus: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An official at the Cyprus
Commerce Ministry has predicted that petrol prices in Cyprus could
rise in September under a new automatic price adjustment mechanism,
local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism, approved by the parliament on July 6, created a
formula that factors in several variables and spits out a result,
said Ministry official Maria Passades.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism takes into account the fluctuations in any given
month of oil price and the exchange rate between Cyprus pound and
U.S. dollar to determine whether an automatic price rise or cut is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The parliament set the Brent Crude price of 16.97 pounds (26.81
U.S. dollars) per barrel as the baseline price against which
fluctuations would be measured. Pump prices will then rise one cent
per liter for every 1.75 pounds (2.77 dollars) that crude rises on
a monthly average over the baseline price.
</P>
<P>
With the Cyprus pound now valued at 1.58 dollars, and the
average price rise of crude oil currently 1.60 pounds (2.53
dollars) above the July baseline price, Passades said, she was "not
optimistic" that pump prices would not rise in September.
</P>
<P>
The new automatic price mechanism emerged as a solution to the
constant dispute over petrol prices between the government and the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
With the parliament's rejection to raise petrol prices, the
government paid out some 14 million pounds (22.4 million dollars)
in the first half of this year to subsidize the import of
increasingly expensive crude.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane in Iraq on Humanitarian Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A Russian plane arrived at the
newly opened Saddam International Airport in the capital Baghdad on
Saturday on a "humanitarian mission" to sanctions-stricken Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, carrying humanitarian supplies, mainly baby food,
medicine and medical equipment, landed at the airport at 18:10
local time (1410 GMT).
</P>
<P>
This was the first direct flight from Moscow since the end of
the Gulf War in 1991. Russian Deputy Minister of Civil Defense and
Emergency Situations Ruslan Tsalikov, at the head of a 25-member
delegation, told reporters that his country did not ask for
permission for the flight from the United Nations Sanctions
Committee for the trip.
</P>
<P>
"we just notified it," he added. The U.N. sanctions imposed
since 1990 bar any flight to and from Iraq, but Baghdad argues
there were no Security Council resolutions forbid Iraq from flying
civilian aircraft into and out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Russia is an independent country with independent foreign
policy, Tsalikov said, expressing the hope that the visit will help
enhance bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tsalikov will meet Iraqi officials to discuss
emergency treatments as well as safety measures in defusing
unexploded bombs.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
and the constant bombardments in the two no-fly zones in southern
and northern Iraq, are believed to have left a large amount of
unexploded bombs in Iraq, threatening the lives of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reopened the international airport on Thursday after it was
closed for 10 years, to welcome planes from "friendly countries."
</P>
<P>
Russia, one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, has been a traditional ally and the biggest trading
partner of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz visited Moscow in July to
rally Russian support for Baghdad's efforts to have the decade-old
U.N. sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been calling for an early removal of the sanctions
and has repeatedly urged the U.S. and Britain to stop patrolling
and bombing the two so-called no-fly zones in northern and southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the air-exclusion zones, citing they
were imposed by the U.S. and Britain without proper U.N.
authorization.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa conferred with visiting U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
on the Mideast peace process Saturday in the Mediterranean port
city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The two officials discussed prospects of giving a boost to the
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, and tried to
seek means of overcoming a number of impediments in the peace
process, a statement issued by Egypt's Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
They looked for ways of building on the Palestinian-Israeli
summit held last month at Camp David of the United States in a bid
to reach a final peace agreement between the two sides, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
They asserted the importance of seeking to push the two sides
towards an acceptable stance with a view to making real progress in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region on Thursday to assess the possibility
of holding a new Palestinian-Israeli summit similar to the one in
Camp David, which ended without an agreement on July 25, largely
due to disputes over the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The talks came at the end of a week that has seen extensive
diplomatic efforts by Egypt to help the Palestinians and Israelis
find solutions to thorny issues, particularly Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Lead: Abu Sayyaf's Safety Worry Defers Release of Hostages EDS: Updates With More Details and Background </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators Saturday failed to
secure the release of all the remaining hostages held by the Abu
Sayyaf in the southern island of Jolo as widely expected because
the group alleged the military are planning to attack it.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado told reporters at
the airport in the southern city of Zamboanga Saturday afternoon
that the Abu Sayyaf handed negotiators a letter in which it said
it can't free the hostages in one batch because there are military
movements in its areas, the local ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
"As I know, the military has been keeping a distance. They are
not doing anything," said Aventajado, who returned from Jolo, some
150 kilometers southwest of Zamboanga, where Abu Sayyaf rebels
were expected to hand over their captives to government
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
He said the Abu Sayyaf offered in the letter to release two
European hostages which is against a directive by President Joseph
Estrada to have the hostages "all or non."
</P>
<P>
The chief negotiator said they will hold a meeting Saturday
night to assess the situation and come up with a recommendation
for the president.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are still holding the remaining 13 hostages -- three
Malaysians, two Germans, two Finns, two French, two South Africans,
one Lebanese and one Filipino they abducted from Malaysia's resort
island of Sipadan on April 23.
</P>
<P>
They also have in their hands three French TV journalist and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists who went to Jolo last month to
cover the hostage crisis and pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the three Malaysians have been released,
Aventajado said he has no idea about it. He explained that Lee
Peng Wee, another government negotiator, is working for their
release while he is concentrating on the freedom of the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
They divided at the airport in Jolo and Lee's team went to
another place, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee reportedly said Friday that the Abu Sayyaf handed over the
last three Malaysian hostages to his special emissary in the day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rajab Azzarouq, a former Libyan ambassador to the
Philippines who is negotiating with the kidnappers, said "we will
have to renegotiate" as the Abu Sayyaf refused to release the
hostages in on batch.
</P>
<P>
Azzarouq went to Abu Sayyaf's staging areas in Jolo to receive
the hostages expected to be freed, but the rebels handed him the
above-mentioned letter.
</P>
<P>
Expectations ran high earlier in the day that the Abu Sayyaf
would free all the remaining hostages it held in Jolo, and
ambassadors of related countries gathered at the airport of
Zamboanga to meet them.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the foreign hostages will be flown by a
chartered Libyan plane to the Libyan capital of Tripoli, where
their family members are waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reportedly that Libya is willing to offer 25
million U.S. dollars in ransom for the release of the hostages,
but both Tripoli and Manila have denied such reports.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Abu Sayyaf has released in batches six Malaysians,
one ailing German woman and one Filipino of the Sipadan group, and
one German journalist and two local TV reports.
</P>
<P>
The group has amassed about 5.5 million U.S. dollars in ransoms
paid for the release of the six Malaysians and the German woman,
Gen. Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of the Philippine Armed Forces,
disclosed earlier.

<HEADLINE> Visiting Japanese PM Hopes to Cooperate with Dhaka in  International Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori Saturday expressed the hope to further cooperate with
Bangladesh in addressing various international issues, especially
since Bangladesh is currently a non-permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council and the next NAM (Nonalignment Movement) chair
country.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen here after a formal talk between Mori and
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a spokesman of the
Japanese Foreign Ministry said that during the talk, both prime
ministers were of the same opinion that, since the independence of
Bangladesh, "the bilateral relationship between the two countries
has been excellent." Both sides agreed upon further expansion of
the bilateral relationship, including in the economic and cultural
fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Mori mentioned in the talk that
Japan has extended positive economic cooperation to Bangladesh and
that Japan will continue its cooperation for poverty alleviation
through the development of the Bangladesh economy.
</P>
<P>
Hasina expressed Bangladesh's deep appreciation for Japan being
its largest development partner.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on the efforts made by the Japanese
government for becoming a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, the Japanese spokesman said that during talk with his
counterpart, Mori stressed the need of progressing forward the
discussions concerning U.N. reform, including the Security Council
reform.
</P>
<P>
Mori held the view that the reform of the Security Council
should include the expansion of both permanent and non-permanent
members of the Security Council, and the new permanent members
should include both industrialized and developing countries, the
spokesman said, adding that Hasina expressed her appreciation
concerning Japanese stance, and two prime ministers agreed to
further strengthen the two countries' cooperation within the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the plan for "people to people exchanges" mentioned
by Mori, the spokesman said that Japan will take 5000 youth from
all South Asian countries, including Bangladesh, per year as
scholars and artists for strengthening the "people to people
contacts".
</P>
<P>
Mori arrived here Saturday afternoon for a two-day official
visit on the first leg of his South Asian trip. The Japanese prime
minister will also visit Pakistan, India and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements signed on Friday between Japan and
Bangladesh, Japan will provide Bangladesh with 16.011 billion yen
(about 147 million U.S. dollars) as loan assistance for four
development projects and 4.52 billion yen (about 39 million
dollars) as grants.

<HEADLINE> Russian Officer Admits "Worst Expectations" for Sunken Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian officer said
Saturday that the crew in the front part of the sunken submarine
Kursk most likely died immediately a week ago and that chances of
survival for the rest are almost zero.
</P>
<P>
All the personnel in the nose section of the Kursk probably
perished in the flooding in the first minutes of the accident,
chief of the Russian Northern Fleet Staff Mikhail Motsak told the
RTR television.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk has a crew of 118. It went down last Saturday while
participating in a naval exercise of the Northern Fleet. A special
government commission has established an explosion inside the sub
as the most probable cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"We have crossed the critical guaranteed life support limit
that we had set for the personnel in the guidance manuals. A
critical situation for the crew has apparently begun. No matter
how hard it is to say, we have to state the worst expectations,"
Motsak said.
</P>
<P>
He described the accident as "the worst catastrophe in the
history of the underwater fleet."
</P>
<P>
Russian rescue efforts continued Saturday despite repeated
failures over the week. Outside assistance from Britain and Norway
will arrive at the site of the accident later Saturday, but they
may be too late for the crew.
</P>
<P>
Rescue vehicles succeeded in latching onto the escape hatch
twice, but were unable to create a watertight seal and pump out
the seawater.
</P>
<P>
Deformation of the hatch, likely caused when the vessel struck
the bottom, is considered the main factor behind these failures.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian ship "Normand Pioneer" carrying the British mini-
submarine "LR5" is expected to arrive on the scene at about 9 p.m.
Moscow time (1700 GMT) to attempt to dock the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
"We are pinning our greatest hopes on the Norwegians, who are
bringing deep-sea divers. We hope they will either help dock the
Northern Fleet's rescue sub or latch the mini-submarine they are
bringing themselves" onto the Kursk, said Mikhail Yevdokimov,
governor of the northern Murmansk region.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chronology of Beijing's Laoshan Tomb Excavation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The excavation of the 2,000-year-
old Laoshan Tomb, located 10 kilometers west of downtown Beijing,
has been going on for about eight months.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, local residents spotted some new
hillocks in Laoshan. On December 24, several people, suspected of
stealing from the tomb, were arrested by local police. Two days
later, archeologists from Beijing Bureau of Cultural Heritage
confirmed that an ancient tomb exists in the area.
</P>
<P>
Archeological workers began to excavate the tomb on January 17
year, with ratification from the State Bureau of Cultural Heritage.
A preliminary estimate was that the tomb belonged to a king from
the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
In early April, the shape of the outer coffin appeared after
the earth in the tomb was cleared out. "Ticou," the structure of
lots of piled-up wooden poles, used only by family members of the
king to protect coffins, were also discovered in the tomb chamber.
</P>
<P>
The outer coffin, all parts of the "Ticou" and the outer
cloister of the tomb had all been excavated by the end of April.
Burial objects of pottery and pieces of lacquerware were also
found.
</P>
<P>
From May 2, workers began to build a 36-meter-long canopy over
the site to protect it from the weather.
</P>
<P>
After the construction was completed at the end of July,
workers started to excavate the inside parts of the tomb chamber.
More lacquerware, a pottery tripod caldron and some well-preserved
tiles were unearthed.
</P>
<P>
The excavation has come to a crucial stage at present. All
preliminary preparations have been finished and archeologists now
are ready to open the coffin.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, the China Central Television, the largest TV
station in the country, will broadcast live for the first time
how archeologists excavate the front chamber of the Laoshan Tomb.

</P>
<P>
Ross is in the region trying to narrow the gaps between Israel

<P>
Erekat, who met Ross at an undisclosed place in Jerusalem on
Friday, told reporters that a new summit, following the failed Camp
David peace summit on July 11-25, needed intensive preparations,
estimations and clarifications on the Israeli position.
</P>
<P>
On the declaration of an independent Palestinian state, Erekat
said that the Central Council of the Palestine Liberation
Organization would make a decision on the issue in the interests of
Palestinian people after being briefed by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on the outcomes of his Arab and international tour.

Arafat is expected to return home on Saturday after his Asian
visit and will receive Ross on Sunday to consult with him and mull
over how to move the Palestinian-Israeli track forward.

<HEADLINE> Russia Tries Again to Rescue Sunken Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A rescue vehicle was once again
lowered Saturday afternoon to approach the sunken Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk lying on the Barents Sea floor after failed
efforts over a week.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, with a crew of 118, has been stranded more than
100 meters deep in the sea since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rescue vehicles succeeded in latching onto Kursk's escape
hatch twice, but were unable to create a watertight seal and pump
out the seawater, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Deformation of the hatch, likely caused when the vessel hit
the seabed, is blamed for the failures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin met senior aides in the
Kremlin to discuss the rescue operation. Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov, Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian ship "Normand Pioneer" carrying the British mini-
submarine "LR5" is expected to arrive on the scene at about 9 p.m.
Moscow time (1700 GMT) in an attempt to dock with the "Kursk."
</P>
<P>
The state ad hoc commission on the accident saw an internal
explosion as the most likely cause for the tragedy, Murmansk
region Governor Mikhail Yevdokimov told reporters Saturday
following a meeting of the commission, which is headed by Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
"This is indicated by cracks on the submarine's hull, which
cannot be explained by anything else," the Interfax news agency
quoted Yevdokimov as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the explosion occurred after the sub had already
crashed into the seabed. This "in fact eliminated the first cause
that had forced the submarine to sink to the sea bottom," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the chances to bring the submarine crew back
alive to the surface are becoming fewer and fewer.
</P>
<P>
The governor seems not to expect much of the foreign
assistance in improving the situation, saying the AS-34, AS-36 and
AS-15 vehicles employed by the Northern Fleet in the rescue
operations are not inferior to the British LR5 in their technical
performance.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "We are pinning our greatest hopes on the
Norwegians, who are bringing deep-sea divers. We hope they will
either help dock the Northern Fleet's rescue sub or latch the mini-
submarine they are bringing themselves" onto the Kursk.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Volleyball Association (
KVA) chairman Waithaka Kioni has resigned over the handling of the
scheduled national women's volleyball team's trip to Japan for two
weeks' training there.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation made public here Saturday, Kioni said he was
not impressed with the way the National Olympic Committee of Kenya
(NOCK) handled the trip of the national women's volleyball team to
Japan scheduled starting on August 20.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya women's team, that will make their Olympic debut next
month, failed to travel to Japan after NOCK could not raise 300,
000 shillings (about 4,000 U.S. dollars) intended for the team's
logistics in Japan where they would play several warm-up matches
before joining the Kenyan Games' camp in Adelaide, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The tour was organized by Kenya's Japanese coach Sadatoshi
Sugawara who also offered to pay 300,000 shillings for the team's
upkeep in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The failure by NOCK to pay the amount and subsequent
cancellation of the tour will really affect KVA's relations with
our Japanese friends," Kioni said.
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of the Japanese trip, the 12-member
Kenyan women's volleyball team left here for Adelaide on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kioni had worked with KVA for 15 years and served as KVA
chairman for two years.

<HEADLINE> Tomb Value to Be Known After Coffin Opening: Archeologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- It is quite possible that
precious burial objects may still be inside the Laoshan Tomb
though it was looted before, an archeologist said today.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, dating back some 2,000 years ago in the Western Han
Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.), was accidentally found early this
year in the Laoshan area, western Beijing. Archeological
excavation has gone on since then.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, archeologists discovered two small holes on
the doors of the tomb chamber and the outer cloister, which are
considered to be used by grave robbers long ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Pingfang, an archeologist with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, the tomb robbers might only took
jewelry away, while lacquerware, bronzeware, silk and other burial
objects of greater research value would be left in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese history, the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 220 A.D.) and
Tang Dynasty (618-907) were the two periods when grand funeral
ceremonies were popular. The burial objects in the tombs of
aristocrats were abundant both in quantity and in variety,
according to Xu, who has taken part in many important
archeological excavations.
</P>
<P>
Some of the unearthed objects from the Laoshan Tomb indicate
that the tomb occupant would be a king of the Yan Principality
from Western Han. As a result, the funeral objects must be
surprisingly valuable.
</P>
<P>
Historic records indicate that emperors of the Han Dynasty used
one-third of the annual revenue to build imperial mausoleums, and
the tombs of the royal family were also luxurious.
</P>
<P>
"It is still too early to make a conclusion on the
archeological value of the Laoshan Tomb," said Xu. "All judgments
should be made after the coffin is opened."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, China Central Television, the largest TV
station in the country, will broadcast live the excavation process.

BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Yin, a Beijing resident, said
she has been wanting to watch the live TV program on the
excavation of the Laoshan Tomb for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
The tomb Li Yin is talking about is the 2,000-year tomb
discovered early this year in western Beijing. Excavation of the
tomb has been going on for about eight months.
</P>
<P>
It is the second Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.) tomb
discovered in the Chinese capital. The first one is the Dabaotai
tomb excavated in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Reports from newspapers, Internet and TV programs over the past
months have made the tomb a hot topic among people in China.
</P>
<P>
Since no one is allowed to visit the excavation site, people
are following media reports to get the latest information. They
also talked to other archaeologists or bought books on archeology.
</P>
<P>
A salesman from the local Xinhua Book Store said that this is
the first time that archeological books have sold so well.

Tomb starting Sunday morning. This has aroused the interest of
more people, including Li Yin, who serves in the local government.
</P>
<P>
Li has formed a habit of discussing archeology and the
discovery of tombs with her colleagues.

"No archeological excavation process has been shown to the
public before," said Xu Pingfang, a renowned archeologist with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, "and descriptions in novels and some
TV series exaggerate too much about our work."
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time that we make a live broadcast on tomb
excavation and we want to let people understand what is the real
work of archeology," said Luo Hancheng, an executive producer at
CCTV.
</P>
<P>
Many unearthed funeral objects reveal that the tomb's occupant
was a king during the Western Han Dynasty, but since the coffin
has not been opened, the mystery of what is inside still has
people's attention.
</P>
<P>
"What ordinary people are concerned most about maybe is the
jewelry in the tomb, while silk, pottery, lacquerware and other
tender and fragile objects are of more value to archeological
research," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is really a rare chance for the audience to see the first
appearance of 2,000-year-old objects," said Luo.
</P>
<P>
This is good news to Li Yin. She use to visit the Ming tombs,
which date back 300-600 years ago, but some replications of
cultural relics disappointed her very much.
</P>
<P>
"The reports from the media will contribute to the spread of
archeological information to the masses as well as improve their
consciousness to protect our cultural heritage," said Xu.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lead: Abu Sayyaf's Safety Worry Defers Release of Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf rebels didn't free
its hostages in the southern island of Jolo Saturday as widely
expected, alleging there are military movements in their areas
which endanger their safety, government negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado told reporters at
the airport in the southern city of Zamboanga Saturday afternoon
that the Abu Sayyaf handed negotiators a letter in which it said
it can't free the hostages in one batch as there are military
movements in its areas, the local ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
They worry about their safety, but there are no military
movements in the areas, said Aventajado, who just returned from
Jolo, some 150 kilometers southwest of Zamboanga, where Abu Sayyaf
rebels were expected to hand over their captives to government
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are still holding the remaining 13 hostages -- three
Malaysians, two Germans, two Finns, two French, two South Africans,
one Lebanese and one Filipino they abducted from Malaysia's resort
island of Sipadan on April 23.
</P>
<P>
They also have in their hands three French TV journalist and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists who went to Jolo last month to
cover the hostage crisis and pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rajab Azzarouq, a former Libyan ambassador to the
Philippines who is negotiating with the kidnappers, said "we will
have to renegotiate" as the Abu Sayyaf wants to release the
hostages in batches, which is against a directive by President
Joseph Estrada to have them "all or non."
</P>
<P>
Azzarouq went to Abu Sayyaf's staging areas in Jolo to receive
the hostages expected to be freed, but the rebels handed him the
above-mentioned letter.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado told reporters that the rebels had offered to
release two European hostages, but Azzarouq proceeded in line with
President Estrada's directive.
</P>
<P>
Expectations ran high earlier in the day that the Abu Sayyaf
would free all the remaining hostages it held in Jolo, Sulu
province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Abu Sayyaf has released six Malaysians, one ailing
German woman and one Filipino of the Sipadan group, and one German
journalist and two local TV reports

<HEADLINE> SIA Encouraged to Maintain Pre-eminent Position in Global Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 19 (Xinhua)-- A senior Singapore official has
urged the Singapore Airline (SIA) to maintain its pre-eminent
position in the global market by consolidating into alliance and
capitalizing on new technologies.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister of State for Communications and Information
Technology and National Development John Chen made the
encouragement at the Singapore Airlines Staff Union Dinner and
Dance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that cross border collaboration between airlines
through strategic alliances and advances in technologies in the
offering of larger and longer range aircraft and in the area of
ticket booking or in-flight services are major challenges to the
airline industry.
</P>
<P>
"To succeed and thrive in the new competitive age, SIA must be
able to compete with other international airlines in the global
market and offer better and more innovative products at
competitive prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state encouraged SIA to make itself "the world'
s best airline" and praised SIA for its successes in responding to
the challenges by joining airlines alliance, investing in new
technologies and strengthening training of workforce.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, SIA has joined the Star Alliance whose
network covers over 800 cities in 130 countries and areas,
expanded the airline and airline-related business such as the
purchase of the Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand, invested 500
million Singapore dollars (about 300 million U.S. dollars) on
brand new products and services as well as on new technology to
provide the best possible services to its customers, ordered state-
of-art aircraft and introduced e-ticketing, self-ticketing, and
inflight entertainment.
</P>
<P>
SIA has enjoyed its reputation as one of the world's top
airlines and clinched the TTG Travel Award for "Best Airline (
Overall)" and "Best Asian airline" during recent media and trade
surveys.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Major Tombs of Han Dynasties Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua)-- The excavation of the Laoshan
Tomb of the Western Han Dynasty in western Beijing has aroused
great interest from the people.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
thousands of tombs from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 220 A.D.) have
been excavated.
</P>
<P>
Mawangdui Tomb: Western Han (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.) tombs excavated
in 1972 at Mawangdui, Changsha, Hunan Province. More than 3,000
burial objects of silk writings, bamboo slips, lacquerware,
pottery, Chinese herbal medicine, as well as a well-preserved
woman's corpse were found.
</P>
<P>
Tombs of the Changsha Prince and his family: Western Han tombs
at Changsha, Hunan. Over 2,000 burial relics were discovered.
Three lacquerware "Zhu," a traditional Chinese musical instrument,
were for the first time unearthed.
</P>
<P>
Mancheng Han tombs: Tombs of Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of
Zhongshan of Western Han and his wife Dou Wan, excavated in 1968
at Mancheng, Hebei Province. Two suits of "jade clothes sewn with
gold thread" along with some 10,000 burial objects were unearthed.
</P>
<P>
Dabaotai Tomb: Western Han tombs discovered in 1974 at Dabaotai,
Beijing. "Huangchang Ticou," a special wooden structure to protect
the coffin, used only by family members of the king, along with a
gorgeous full-scale carriage was unearthed for the first time in
China.
</P>
<P>
Tianchang Tombs: Western Han tombs excavated in 1992 at
Tianchang, Anhui Province. Rich well-preserved lacquerware and 28
woodworking tools which were considered to be of high importance
in archeological research.
</P>
<P>
Leitai Tombs: Large scale brick tombs from the late Eastern Han
Dynasty (25 A.D.- 220 A.D.) discovered in 1969 at Leitai, Gansu
Province. A bronze galloping horse was excavated from the tomb,
with the shape of a swallow on the right hind hoof has become the
symbol of China's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Archeological excavations in the past show that the Western Han
Dynasty mainly encased coffins into deep earth pits or caves on
high mountains, while the Eastern Han Dynasty used the brick and
stone-chambered tombs.

<HEADLINE> Well-Preserved Corpse Unlikely in Beijing Ancient Tomb: Archaeologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese archaeologist
estimated that it is unlike that a well-preserved corpse would be
found in a 2,000-year tomb currently excavated in western Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Xu Pingfang, an archaeologist with Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, explained that it was because the tomb was probably not
sealed off since part of it was found collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located in Laoshan area about 10 kilometers west of
downtown Beijing, was discovered early this year. It is believed
to be the tomb of a king or queen of the Yan principality from the
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The original corpse could be found rotten and only some bones
could be left in the coffin, Xu said. A team of archaeological
workers have been working on the tomb during the past eight months.
The occupant of the tomb is still unknown since the casket has not
been opened yet.
</P>
<P>
Ancient corpses unearthed in China are of two kinds: mummies
and soft bodies. Mummies were often found in drought-prone western
areas such as Xinjiang where the corpses can naturally turn into
mummies in the dry weather.
</P>
<P>
These mummies are different from the ones found in the pyramids
of Egypt, which were wrapped tight with cloth after the interior
organs were removed and special spices were applied from inside to
the surface of the body.
</P>
<P>
Soft bodies discovered in China were usually found in well
sealed tombs built with bricks or stones, sometimes with spices,
during the Song Dynasty (960-1279) and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, a rare but well-preserved female corpse with its
skin still elastic was uncovered in a tomb dating back some 2,100
years to the Western Han Dynasty in Hunan Province, central China.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that it was because the female corpse was preserved in
a coffin sealed up without oxygen and germs. Besides, the moist
weather in the south prevented the corpse from becoming dry.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Who Is Occupant of Beijing Ancient Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have been
excavating an ancient tomb dating back some 2,000 years in western
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The mystery of who is the occupant of the ancient tomb,
discovered in Laoshan area of Beijing, has aroused great public
interest and a live telecast has been planned at the site.
</P>
<P>
A wooden structure used to protect the tomb's chamber, which
has been unearthed in the ancient tomb, convinced archaeologists
that it was for a king or queen of a principality. The structure
of a tomb like the one discovered was only used for mausoleums of
emperors, queens, princes and kings of principalities during
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Beijing was part of the northeastern frontier known as Yan
Principality some 2,000 years ago. Emperors of the Western Han
Dynasty had appointed 12 kings of Yan Principality within some 200
years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists believe that the occupant of Laoshan
ancient tomb should be one of the 11 kings, since one of the 12
kings' tombs was discovered in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
They gave a list of four kings' names which are: who are King
Liu Ze, King Liu Shun, King Liu Huang and King Liu Qijia after the
possibility of other kings being buried at that tomb were excluded
in accordance with historical records and some relics unearthed
recently from the Laoshan ancient tomb.
</P>
<P>
It would be not an easy decision since no epigraphs were placed
in tombs during the Han dynasties. Archaeologists would have to
identify who the occupant was according to signets, clay seal
impressions, bamboo and wood strips with inscriptions, or marks on
bronze or lacquerware that might be found in the casket.

<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Unlike archaeologists who work
with spades and brushes, Chen Yunshi guided his colleagues to
where he keeps his medicinal liquid that is used on timber just
unearthed from a nearby ancient tomb.
</P>
<P>
His team also sprays the same liquid on the wooden fence around
the tomb from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Chen, an expert on timber protection with the Chinese Academy
of Forestry Sciences, is trying to prevent timber, which is over 2,
000 years old, from becoming rotten or fragile.
</P>
<P>
Chen's team works at the site of a tomb dating back some 2,000
years ago to Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.) in Laoshan
area, about 10 kilometers west of downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The mysterious underground palace was discovered early this
year. It was mainly built with wood. Archaeologists have unearthed
a wooden structure encasing the tomb. The structure, which was
designed to prevent outside moisture and earth from entering the
tomb, was reserved only for tombs of royal family members.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the about 100 cubic meters of timber was
used to build the wooden structure discovered in the ancient tomb.
</P>
<P>
All the timber has rotten to varying degrees. Some would break
at the slightest touch, Chen said.

<P>
To protect the timber, Chen's team has dug two pools to soak
the wood pieces in medicinal liquid.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that protection of unearthed relics
goes parallel with the archaeological excavation," said Chen. The
budget for timber protection alone was 350,000 yuan (42,200 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the past, rare relics sometimes turned into ashes shortly
after they were dug out due to inefficient technological support.
Today, with the help of scientists, archaeologists can avoid
similar situations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wuyu, site director with the Beijing Research Institute of
Cultural Heritage, said that DNA technology will be applied to
detect the age, gender and health condition of the occupant if
teeth or bones were discovered in the ancient tomb.
</P>
<P>
The excavation of the ancient tomb has been efficient and well
organized with scientists from different academic fields involved
in the project.
</P>
<P>
A plane carrying a high-resolution infrared detector has
conducted a remote examination over an area of three square
kilometers around Laoshan with the ancient tomb at the core.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that China applied self-developed
remote technology to archaeological discovery," said Guo Huadong,
director of the institute of remote sensing of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS), China's top research institute of natural
sciences.
</P>
<P>
Experts who have worked on the pictures taken by the device
found four more sites that archaeologists might investigate. They
suggested that more ancient tombs may be at those sites.

Organized by the BDRCS, the programs include primary health
services, especially health services to mothers and children,
creation of new sources of safe drinking water, creation of
awareness on sanitation and drainage system, usage of hygienic
latrines, generation of self-employment of women, education and
income generation activities.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the development efforts of the BDRCS, Minister for
Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs Kaiparanjan Chakma urged the
society to go ahead with development activities as people of CHT
could not witness the touch of development in the past 20 to 25
years due to political unrest.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and cooperation is the precondition of development," he
observed.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the BDRCS to establish agro-based industries in
the region to bring about a positive change in the socio-economic
condition of the people in this region.
</P>
<P>
The CHT affairs minister finally expressed the hope that
development activities in the region would be implemented in full
swing as the development partners from abroad are found
spontaneous in investment in CHT region.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Population Growth High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's population growth is too
high that it poses a major challenge to the country's development
objectives, the official newspaper Kenya Times quoted a senior
official as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country's population increased by 34 percent between 1989
and 1999, which is much higher considering the limited resources
of the east African country, Kenyan Minister for Planning and
National Development Gideon Ndambuki said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ndambuki attributed the high population growth to high
fertility resulting from unwanted pregnancies and desire to have
large families.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government had taken measures to reduce
population growth rate which included a wide range of effective
family planning services across the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's population amounted to 28.7 million, according to the
provisional results of last year's census.

<HEADLINE> China Sets up Largest, Highest Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YUSHU (Qinghai), August 19 (Xinhua) -- A nature reserve
covering the headwaters of China's three major rivers was set up
in Qinghai Province, northwest China, today.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, the largest in the country, covers 318,000 square
kilometers and is located more than 4,000 kilometers above sea
level. As the source of the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang rivers, it
is a reserve with most concentrated biodiversity in the world's
highest altitude.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists, one fourth of the water in the Yangtze
River, China's longest, half of that in the Yellow River, the
second longest, and 15 percent of that in the Lancang River, comes
from the area -- Sanjiangyuan (the source of the three rivers).
The region is also known as China's Water Tower.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers go eastward into the sea before
flowing through most parts of China, where Chinese civilization
began to grow thousands of years ago. The Lancang River goes down
to Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the south and further to some
southeast Asian countries where it is called the Mekong River.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the Sanjiangyuan region has witnessed
worsening natural environment, shrinking wetland, lowering water
level on lakes and water flows in the headwaters, and increasing
desertification. As a result, the number of plants and animals is
decreasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the nature reserve is aimed at protecting
the ecosystem, the highland swamp and natural habitat of the
unique wildlife in the region and promoting sustainable economic
development there, said Zhou Shengxian, an official with the State
Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
It is also a part of the central government's strategy to
develop the western regions of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
A monument bearing President Jiang Zemin's inscription was
erected by the Tongtian River, the major source of the Yangtze,
this morning to mark the establishment of the nature reserve.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Conditions in Major Rivers' Headwaters Deteriorating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YUSHU (Qinghai), August 19 (Xinhua) -- The ecological
conditions in the headwaters of three major rivers, the Yangtze,
Yellow and Lancang, are deteriorating, a senior official of the
Qinghai provincial government warned today.
</P>
<P>
The world's highest river sources boast the largest natural
swamp and most concentrated biodiversity, but are plagued by
worsening ecological conditions, increasing natural calamities and
weakening ecosystems, due to natural factors and man's activities,
said Mu Dongsheng.
</P>
<P>
This has adversely affected economic development and the people
's livelihood in the middle and lower reaches of the three rivers,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the situation of more than 10 million
hectares of grassland in the region has been deteriorating or has
been desertified, accounting for half of Qinghai's grassland that
can be utilized, while some 5.5 million hectares of grassland are
damaged by rats. Rapid desertification has resulted in serious
soil erosion, with increasing amount of silt washed down to the
lower streams of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, China's two
longest.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the headwaters of the three rivers from
deterioration, China set up its largest nature reserve today in an
area of 318,000 square kilometers so as to protect the environment
and promote sustainable economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The zone has more than 70 kinds of wildlife including Tibetan
antelope and wild donkey.

<P>
MACAO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Day of Judicial Police of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) was celebrated here
Saturday and some outstanding individuals and judicial police
groups were commended.
</P>
<P>
Cheong Kuok Va, secretary for security of the Macao SAR
government, noted that the judicial police have cracked many big
cases and contributed a lot to safeguarding public security since
the founding of the SAR in last December.
</P>
<P>
"This year, the leadership of the judicial police has conducted
a series of reforms which help raise the efficiency of criminal
investigation and make the work of judicial police more
transparent," he said.
</P>
<P>
With more contacts with the outside world, the judicial police
may face ever greater challenges in combating trans-border crimes,
Cheong said, adding that local police authorities have established
good ties with counterpart departments of the state and
neighboring Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"But one point is certain, all difficulties will be overcome
with the concerted efforts of all members of the judicial police,
with the common goal of protecting public security, together with
the cooperation of other police forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 19 individuals and five police groups were commended.
Chief Executive of the Macao SAR Edmund Ho Hau Wah attended the

<HEADLINE> SOE Reform, New Chapter in China's Market Economy: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The success in the state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) reform has opened a new chapter in China's
market economic transition, and the reform of the 160 giant state
enterprises and the four pillar state banks will be the next step,
analyst here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the reform depends on corporate system reforms
and market competition," said Yiping Huang, head for Asia Pacific
Economics and Market Analysis of Salomon Smith Barney (SSB).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the SSB analyst said the reforms
are likely to put the fiscal system under mounting pressure, but a
smooth transition should bring high economic growth and booming
property market.
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that the future reform efforts should
concentrate on the 160 giant state-owned enterprises and four
pillar state-owned commercial banks. Disciplined government
behavior and effective corporate systems are of equal importance,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Modern mechanism and market competition are keys to success,
and listing of these state-owned firms and banks on the stock
market or adopting debt-for-equity are only partial solution,"
Huang explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts from the Hong Kong-based Hongkong Shanghai
Banking Corporation (HSBC) believed that commercially driven
mergers raise hopes of enhancing the operational efficiency of the
state-owned enterprises and offer remedies to deep-rooted
structural problems.
</P>
<P>
"We reckon mergers between listed companies will form only part
of a comprehensive merger and acquisition process, which is
expected to sweep through most overseas listed Chinese companies
in the coming months," they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the aim is to boost profitability and
competitiveness, improving Chinese companies' ability to attract
foreign management and technology via strategic alliances before
heavy competition develops after China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"We believed undervalued China-registered companies with common
shareholding bases, as potential targets, could enjoy operational
efficiency gains from mergers," the HSBC analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Posts Second Win in Manila Leg of Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- World's No. 1 Russia showed poise
of a champion team Saturday, beating Italy 25-18, 20-25, 25-14, 25-
19 to clinch its second straight win in Manila leg of the 400,000-
U.S.-dollar 8th World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Still smarting from a near upset to the South Korean team
Friday, the Russians struggled hard in the first two sets before
unleashing their power in height advantage to dominate the third
and fourth sets en-route to their seventh overll win in eight
matches.
</P>
<P>
After the Italians took a 15-13 margin in the first set, the
Russians bounced back with a 12-3 windup spearheaded by multi-
awarded and veteran player Liouboy Chachkova Sokolova to claim the
opening set in 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, the defending champion Russians failed to keep the
momentum as the Italians leaned on Darina Mifkova and Manuela
Leggeri to tie match at one all to the displeasure of Russian
veteran coach Nikolai Karpol, the national team mentor since 1988.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like our first two sets, my players didnot concentrate
as a team and they are not in focus of playing. Only one player
wants to play," said Karpol referring to Sokolova, the 1999 Grand
Prix best server.
</P>
<P>
Sokolova was also the Russians best scorer with 21 points in
their hard-earned 25-21 19-25, 18-25, 25-19, 15-13 victory on
Friday over the small but hard-fighting South Korean team.
</P>
<P>
Italian coach Angiglino Frigoni admitted that his players could
not contain the solid spike of the taller Russians who had 51 win
points on attack and block 19 attempts compared to Italy's 11
blocks.
</P>
<P>
The Russians played the Brazilians, who are also tote a 7-1 win-
lost card in Sunday for the Manila leg top prize of 40,000 dollars,
the same cash award which a top team in the China leg will receive.
Playing in China preliminary round include Cuba, United States,
Japan, and host China.
</P>
<P>
The four teams in China will arrive in Wednesday for the eight-
team
finals slated on August 24 to 27. The overall winner will receive
150,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The crowd-favorite Brazilians won their second straight match
following another sweeping of South Korean, 25-17, 25-22, 29-27,
in Saturday's second game. Brazil also swept Italy, 25-14, 25-20,
25-21 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rookie and newest-crowd favorite Erika Coimbra led Brazil anew
with 21 points in Saturday's match that saw darling of the crowd
Leila Barros scoring with only 3 points for Brazil, last year's
overall runner up to champion Russia.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Aid Commitment to Nepal Rises in Fiscal 1999/2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign aid commitment to
Nepal for the fiscal year 1999/2000 ending in mid-July increased
nominally to 19.79 billion rupees (282 million U.S. dollars),
according to the statistics by the Nepali Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Although the figure is 1.44 billion rupees (20 million dollars)
more than the previous year, the commitment is less than the
budget estimates for the year, which put the foreign aid
assistance at over 26 billion rupees (370 million dollars), said
the statistics available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The aid commitment is mainly concentrated in areas such as
transportation, roads, primary education and hydropower, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics shows that Japan topped the bilateral donor list
with a total grant commitment of 4.9 billion rupees (70 million
dollars), followed by Norway, Germany, China and Finland, while
among the multilateral donors, the World Bank topped the
assistance list with a loan assistance of 4.06 billion rupees (58
million dollars), followed by the Asian Development Bank and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The committed aid, however, does not translate into
disbursement due to chronic problem in the absorptive capacity of
the national economy. Studies have shown that in some worst years
the disbursement is only about 33 percent of the commitment.
</P>
<P>
Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world, heavily
depends on foreign aid for its development.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Exploit New Natural Gas Resource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of Pakistan has
already approved a 20-billion-Rupee (about 46 million U.S. dollars)
project to capitalize on new discoveries of natural gas in
Southern Pakistan, officials of the Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Resources said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The project is aimed at making full use of the new discoveries
in the South that will add approximately 950 million cubic feet
per day of gas to the existing system," said Jahangir Basher, the
spokesman of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the supply of additional gas under the project
will allow a larger number of domestic and industrial users to use
the natural resource.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the supply of additional gas will enable the power
generation units using oil as fuel to switch over to the use of
natural gas, thus saving the country's hefty oil import bills.

TOKYO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nagasaki and Hiroshima, two
Japanese cities that experienced nuclear attacks, protested
Saturday against the United States' 12th subcritical nuclear test,
conducted Friday at an underground test site in Nevada, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am outraged at the testing and appeal to the international
community to start multilateral negotiations for an early
conclusion of a treaty banning all nuclear weapons," Nagasaki
Mayor Itcho Ito told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The city also sent a letter of protest to the U.S. Embassy in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hiroshima city government also sent a letter of
protest to U.S. President Bill Clinton saying the United States
should immediately stop the tests as they dampen global efforts to
eliminate nuclear weapons, Kyodo quoted city officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United States dropped atomic bombs on Nagasaki and
Hiroshima in 1945, killing more than 200,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Islam in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of Islam to
China saw frequent contacts between China and Arab countries. From
the Tang (618-907) to the Song (960-1279) dynasties, a continuous
stream of Muslim merchants from the Arab lands and Persia came to
China by sea and by Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
Many of the merchants married Chinese women and settled in
China and became the ancestors of today's Chinese Muslims. With
the conquest of Central and Western Asia by the Mongols in the
13th century, a large number of Arabs, Persians and Turks came and
settled down in China. Their common religious belief united them
into a new Muslim nationality -- the Chinese Hui.
</P>
<P>
These Hui Muslims have much in common with other Chinese
nationalities. Later, ethnic groups in northwestern China,
including the Uygur, Kazak, Ozbek, Tajik, Tatar, Kirgiz, Salar,
Dongxiang, and Bonan, converted to Islam.
</P>
<P>
The total population of the ten Muslim minorities in China now
stands at 20 million, mostly in Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, and
Qinghai regions. They also scattered throughout China's vast
interior.
</P>
<P>
Life of the Muslims in China has improved by a big margin since
1949, when the People's Republic of China was established. Their
religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution and other laws.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, the China Islamic Association, a national organization
for China's Muslims, was set up. It plays an active role in
helping the government implement an all-round policy of freedom of
religion and popularizing Islamic culture. The Association
publishes a journal named Muslims in China and runs nine Islamic
theological institutes.
</P>
<P>
Today, there are 34,928 mosques, 45,051 Muslims teachers and
administrators, and 23,480 disciples studying in the Islamic
theological institutes in various regions.
</P>
<P>
Especially worth mentioning is that in the past, owning to
economic restrictions, only a few Chinese Muslims could afford to
pilgrimage to Mecca. Now, an unprecedented number of more than 5,
000 Chinese pilgrims visit Mecca every year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Confirms Efforts for Release of Jailed Iranian Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
confirmed its involvement in international efforts to release 13
Jews detained in Iran on the charge of spying for Israel, the
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As three of the 13 Iranian Jews were acquitted in an Iranian
court ruling on July 1, the other 10 who were sentenced to two to
13 years in prison are due to appear in a court of appeal on
Saturday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomatic sources attributed the hearing of the appeal by
the Iranian court to the international pressure. Cyprus, for about
a year, has joined the international efforts for the release of the
Jews.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus and Iran enjoy very good relations and Cyprus respects
the principal of non-intervention in internal affairs of Iran and
the judiciary system. Any efforts we can make, to create a better
climate, we follow," Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
told the Cyprus Mail.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government noted that it did not exert any "pressure"
on Iran, and that any involvement was friendly and discreet.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian embassy in Nicosia was unavailable for comment so
far.   Iran has a Jewish community of about 25,000 people, the
largest
in the Middle East outside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest of the Jews early last year, Iran has been
under severe pressure from western countries to release them.
</P>
<P>
After the court verdict on July 1, western countries stepped up
their criticism and pressing Iran to overturn the sentences. Iran,
however, insists that the trial and verdict were rational and fair
and no foreign country should meddle in Iran's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, China Urged to Forge Strategic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and China should forge new
basis of strategic partnership in order to push their ties forward
in a wholly new circumstances, a prominent Nigerian scholar has
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a long pro-west tradition due to its colonial past,
which only sees a short break during the years of military ruler
Sani Abacha, said Professor J. O. Akinboye with the University of
Lagos on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following the economic sanctions against the Abacha regime led
by the United States and Britain, the Nigerian government had
adopted a more balanced approach between the east and west in
making its foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
But with the takeover of the elected civilian government in May
1999, and resumption of aid from the west, it is no surprising
that the country reappeared a strong tendency to return to that
pro-west tradition, the scholar in Political Science told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria wants the west to reduce or cancel its 30 billion U. S.
dollar external debts, it also hopes the west could help it
privatize its economy, said the professor, who had been in the U.
S. for many years as Fulbright scholar.
</P>
<P>
But the much strengthened pro-west stance does not necessarily
means a minus for the Nigeria-China relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade between the two countries is increasing rapidly,
making China one of the top 10 trade partners with Nigeria. And
Chinese businessmen also show growing interests in investing in
Nigeria, the most populous and the largest oil-producing country
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Politically, Nigeria is trying to play a leading role in Africa
and intensifies its bid for the permanent membership in the UN
Security Council. Nigeria needs China' s support in all these
areas, said Akinboye.
</P>
<P>
"I hope both China and Nigeria could carefully foster these
positive elements in their ties, and build a sounder ties in the
years to come," he added.

<HEADLINE> Four Tanzanian Presidential Candidates Join Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Four Tanzanian
presidential candidates entered the October 29 general elections
on Friday, the deadline set by the National Electoral Commission (
NEC) for returning presidential nomination forms.
</P>
<P>
The four contestants are current President Benjamin Mkapa of
the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Augustine Mrema of the
Tanzanian Labor Party (TLP), Ibrahim Lipumba of Civic United
Front (CUF) and John Cheyo of the United Democratic Party (UDP).
</P>
<P>
They are the same contestants for the first multi-party
elections in 1995 when Mkapa won the presidency by collecting 61
percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The NEC disqualified presidential candidates of the Tanzania
People's Party (TPP) and National Convention for Construction and
Reform (NCCR-Mageuzi) for failure to meet the legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
All the four presidential candidates and their running mates
for vice presidency returned the forms at the NEC head office amid
wild dance and songs by their supporters.
</P>
<P>
The NEC Chairman Justice Lewis Makame signed copies of the
forms, saying they would be displayed in a conspicuous place for
24 hours to allow for public scrutiny and objection if any.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that all the presidential candidates and
their running mates would be provided with security guard
throughout the campaign period.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been under one party (CCM) system between 1965 and
1992 when the multi-party system was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The October 29 elections will be the second multi-party
elections since 1995, but the first time in the country's post-
independence history for presidential, parliamentary and civic
elections to be held simultaneously.

<HEADLINE> British Team Hopes to Rescue Russian Sub Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The commander of a British rescue
team said Friday that he hoped he might be able to save some of
the 118 sailors in the sunken Russian submarine Kursk by Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible if conditions are favorable and the Russians
give us permission to proceed that we could have rescued someone
by this time tomorrow," Commander Alan Hoskins told BBC at about
2200 GMT Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hoskins and his rescue crew are currently working around the
clock to get to the Russian submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Commodore Tim Chittenden, who is head of the team's command
center in the Ministry of Defense base near Bath, a city in the
southwest of England, said that the team's spirits were very high
but the mood was very determined.
</P>
<P>
Hopes are increasingly pinned on the British rescue effort,
after an eighth Russian rescue mission failed to link with the
submarine Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rescue has become a race against time, as it is not known
how many of the 118 trapped sailors are still alive.
</P>
<P>
The Russian submarine has been stranded on the bed of the
Barents sea since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian boat carrying the British rescue team and mini-
submarine left Norway Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to arrive Saturday. "We just want to get them
there as fast as possible," said commodore Chittenden "I'm a
submariner, as are many involved in this operation, and we have no
other agenda than to get these guys out," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chittenden said his technical experts were working around the
clock to devise engineering solutions to the problems the team
faces.
</P>
<P>
He said they had received a huge amount of help from
specialists in private industry, including the oil and
construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a Russian rescue capsule reached an escape hatch on
the stricken nuclear submarine for the first time, but was unable
to latch on due to the heavy damage.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Taoism in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Taoism began in the 2nd century
AD. It is one of China's indigenous religions and derives its
ideology from ancient traditions including Huang-Lao, a learned
tradition named after Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor) and Lao-tzu
and followed by their devotees during the Western Han Dynasty (206
BC- 24 AD).
</P>
<P>
Because of the support from the emperors of the Tang (618-907)
and Song (960-1279) dynasties, Taoism entered a period of full
bloom and became an important religion in China, second only to
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Lao-tzu, who founded the early Qin Taoism school, is worshipped
as the forefather of Taoism, and the idea of the Way (Dao) that he
put forward in The Book of the Way of Power is the basis of the
religion.
</P>
<P>
Believing that Way is the origin of the universe and creates
all living beings, Taoists worship all life in the universe and
everything else created by nature. They also believe that man can
attain immortality and become a celestial being through practicing
austerities.
</P>
<P>
In the 12th century, Taoism gradually divided in two: Chuan-
chen Taoism and Cheng-i Taoism. The priests of Chuan-chen Taoism
renounced their families and lived together in temples. They were
vegetarian and practiced austerities in order to become immortal.
Many priests of Cheng-i Taoism, however, lived with their families
and did not avoid meat, and their ideas was to help others attain
good fortune and avoid the bad.
</P>
<P>
According to Taoism, the gods act as administrators and control
everything in the universe. Among the many gods worshipped by
Taoists, the God of the Primal Origin, the God of the Sacred Jewel,
and the God of the Way of Power (Lao-tzu) are regarded as the
supreme gods.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Taoist temples were built on mountains where,
according to tradition, celestial beings lived or ancient Taoists
had practiced austerities and become immortal. At present, there
are over 1,600 Taoist temples in China, home to more than 25,000
Taoist priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Taoist Association, established in 1957 in Beijing,
is a nationwide organization, with Min Zhiting as chairman. To
carry forward and spread the ancient Taoist culture, the
association has published dozens of Taoist classics and has
compiled more than 30 books about Taoism and a series of books on
Taoist culture. Apart from that, the association has a journal,
China Taoism, which is published every other month and distributed
both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Taoism, founded in 1990, offers
specialized classes for teaching students to become managerial
personnel of Taoist temples and advanced classes in the research
and teaching of Taoism. Hundreds of students have graduated from
the academy since its establishment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Taoists have always maintained close contact with
Taoists all over the world. The Chinese Taoist Association is also
a member of the World Union of Religious and Environmental
Protection.

<HEADLINE> China's Demand for Cotton Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua)-- Confronted with a new surge in
cotton and textile exports, China is expected to cope with a rise
in domestic demand for cotton this year.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, China's textile firms had
seen exports rise by more than 40 percent and the country's cotton
exports rocketed by 121.9 percent to 212,200 tons in the first
half of this year from last year's.
</P>
<P>
Officials said any shortfall would be dealt with by channeling
part of the State's cotton reserves onto the market to avert any
sudden surge in cotton prices next year.
</P>
<P>
Fan Ning, an official with the State Textile Industry Bureau,
said he foresaw no major fluctuation in cotton prices in the
coming months, but prices this year would exceed last year's
record 2,000 yuan (241 U.S. dollars) per ton mark.
</P>
<P>
This resulted from the country's earlier decision to encourage
its largest cotton producer -- the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region -- to export more cotton, according to statistics from Fan'
s agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Science
and Technology has designed a series of science-based programs to
help accelerate the development of China's backward western
regions.
</P>
<P>
The programs include such measures as experiments in water-
saving agriculture and afforestation to stop the expansion of
deserts in the west and administrative and specialized skills for
county officials; spread of advanced farming techniques and
introduction of high-tech zones and university-based scientific
parks.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the program are directing science and
technology institutions in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin to
support Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and Xinjiang and Inner
Mongolia and helping the west select science projects for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also enhance co-operation with Europe for the
development of agriculture, fisheries and forestry, build Sino-
Russian agricultural projects in China's dry and semi-dry west,
and popularise the use of poverty-relief, farm produce processing
and water-saving agriculture programs offered by the World Bank
and other international organizations.
</P>

Since the central government launched its western development
campaign early this year, the ministry has spent more than 270
million yuan (32.5 million U.S. dollars) on development in western
China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Be Target in Anti-Poverty Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's poverty-alleviation
experts and gender advisers have asked for more attention be given
to poor women as part of a program to help people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
A 20-year poverty-alleviation program is being drafted by the
State Council, Chen Fang, a research fellow with the Women's
Research Institute of the All-China Women's Federation, said.
</P>
<P>
"Gender awareness should be further incorporated into the
poverty-reduction program," Chen said. "Girls in poor areas still
do not have as many opportunities to go to school as boys, and
women still suffer most in poor areas."
</P>
<P>
Experts on women's issues believe women account for more than
60 percent of China's impoverished population. But most poverty-
alleviation projects in China do not give women special support.
</P>
<P>
Professor Du Xiaoshan, with the Poverty Research Center of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said income-generating
projects, education and medical services need assistance to lift
women from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Su Guoxia, division chief of the Policy Division of the State
Council's Poverty Alleviation Office, said advisers to the 20-year
project are considering literacy efforts, technical training and
health care to help women become better off.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Raps Bomb Attack on Kosovo Office Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government
strongly condemned Friday the bomb attack by unidentified
attackers on a building in central Pristina as perpetrating
ethnic cleansing and attempting to destroy all signs of the
Yugoslav presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, occurring at 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) when more than
20 people were working in the building, dilapidated offices and
caused injuries and great economic damage. The building houses
offices of the Yugoslav Committee for Cooperation with the U.N.
Mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the government said the terrorist act came only
four days after the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR)
forcefully occupied a Serb lead refinery.
</P>
<P>
It was another encroachment upon Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents indicated that the ethnic Albanian terrorists,
cooperating with forces under the disguise of the United Nations,
started another round of terrorist intimidation and ethnic
cleansing against peaceful civilians, public establishments and
state workers, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that pressed by the U.S. government, the U.N. special
mission has become an accomplice of Albanian separatists and
instrument to carry out ethnic cleansing and to destabilize the
region.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.N. mission and NATO-led peacekeepers entered Kosovo
last June following the end of NATO's 78-day bombing on Yugoslavia,
a total of 1,038 persons were killed, 960 kidnapped and 360,000
non-Albanian residents forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged an end to such a mission in order to defend
the dignity of the U.N., maintain peace and stability in the
region, and ensure a political settlement to the Kosovo issue.

China, to 3.2 yuan (0.39 U.S. dollars) from 3.07 yuan (0.37 U.S.
dollars) per litre. The price of diesel oil has also risen to 2.9
yuan from 2.76 yuan per litre.
</P>
<P>
Fuel dealers are permitted to raise or lower their prices by no
more than five percent from the benchmark levels, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
The is the sixth price increase on oil products in the domestic
market since last November.
</P>
<P>
Li Shengsheng, deputy director of the Economic Research and
Consulting Center under the State Economic and Trade Commission,
attributed the consecutive price increases to high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Domestic oil prices have surged in line with world oil price
hike this year. The central government has allowed domestic oil
prices to fluctuate according to world market changes since 1998.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices have stabilized at around 30 U.S. dollars per
barrel from less than ten U.S. dollars in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
"With the country's approaching entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), we must allow the domestic fuel prices to sway
in accordance with the world market variations," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will cut its tariffs on fuel imports by a large margin to
about six percent, within the first one to two years after it
joins the WTO.

BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The state will require China's
270 government-subsidized research institutions to support
themselves in October this year.
</P>
<P>
It is a significant step towards reforming science and
technology administration, said Huang Qitao, a senior official
with the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The 270 institutions, previously attached to cabinet-level
administrations, could become technology firms or affiliate with
universities.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Science and Technology Information of China, a
government-subsidized institution, has become a shareholding
company called Wanfang Data Co Ltd, pioneering this sort of change.
</P>
<P>
"Wanfang Data Co has set a good example for government-
subsidized institutions to free themselves from government
administrations," said Shang Yong, director of the ministry's

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lake Needs More Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province is fighting the deteriorating environment at Qinghai Lake,
the largest inland salt lake in China covering 4,282 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Various projects to improve biological conditions around the
lake have been built since late 1998. Fish in the lake have been
protected since the early 1990s, and bird habitats have been well
preserved too, said Mei Jieren, an official from the province's
environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
People in the province are also planting grass and trees in
farmland in poor condition, including that around Qinghai Lake.
</P>
<P>
A lower water level, the deterioration of grassland vegetation
and desertification are said to be threatening the lake. The
numbers of fish and birds there are also dwindling.
</P>
<P>
Mei said that the decline of water level is mainly because of
over-evaporation. But he admitted that over-farming and over-
herding have been causing the lake problems for years.

<HEADLINE> New Antimony Plant Goes Into Production in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An antimony concentrate plant in
Myanmar's southern Shan state, originally owned by the state and
was privatized in last November, went into production Friday after
it was upgraded, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Taken over by the Myanmar Mayflower Mining Company under the
country's privatization scheme, the antimony concentrate plant
will produce 4,500 tons of antimony ores annually.
</P>
<P>
The new plant was built beginning March this year and completed
in May.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's mining sector is growing by 19 percent every year.
However its contribution to the gross domestic product is rather
small.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar, over 11 percent of the mining sector is owned by
the state and over 86 percent by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Besides engagement in the mining sector by local private
entrepreneurs, there is also foreign investment in the development
of the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, about a dozen foreign firms,
including those from Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Malaysia,
Singapore Thailand and the United States, are engaged in
prospecting and exploration of mineral resources as well as
feasibility study in Myanmar since the country enacted the New
Mining Law in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that foreign investment in Myanmar's
mining sector so far amounted to 522.24 million U.S. dollars in 49
projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and one
injured in two mine explosions in the week in Bosnia, reports from
Sarajevo said.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian News Agency said that two mine clearance experts,
one Swedish and the other Bosnian, were killed Thursday in
Rogatica, 70 kilometers east of Sarajevo, when they stepped on
land mines while attempting to pull the bodies of two fishermen
who had been killed by mine explosions. A Serbian policeman was
also killed when he tried to rescue the two experts.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, a 17-year-old young man died and his brother
was wounded when they hit mines when collecting firewood in Bihac.
</P>
<P>
The mine clearance center in Bosnia appealed to local residents
again Friday to pay close attention to the danger of mines. It
said the Bosnian war ended, but the then battle fields were still
dangerous regions.
</P>
<P>
The center said that 347 people, 317 of them local residents
and 30 mine clearance experts, have been killed by mine explosions
in Bosnia since January 1996 after the peaceful agreement was
signed to end the war at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,829 registered minefields throughout Bosnia, but
the center estimated that more than one million mines remain
strewn in around 30,000 minefields. About 1,500 persons are
engaged in mine clearance and they should spend about 10 years to
remove all of the mines, the center said.

Lusia Elizabeth Sampow in the championships in South Korea from
August 9 to 16.

better than Nurfitriyana and Lusia," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Archery Association's Secretary General Udi
Harsono said there was no hope for the team events.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Assumes Venezuelan Presidential Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Hugo Chavez assumed Saturday as
the first constitutional president of the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela for the 2000-2006 period.
</P>
<P>
Chavez was sworn in as president of Venezuela in a solemn
ceremony held at the new National Assembly (AN) building with his
right hand raised and the left on the new Bolivarian constitution,
and he received the presidential sash from AN Chairman William
Lara.
</P>
<P>
The event was witnessed by all the deputies, representatives of
all the public powers, governors, mayors and the diplomatic corps
accredited to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela, the
president is committed to  have the constitution and the laws
fulfilled, to direct the government activities, to appoint and
remove the ministers, to direct the country's foreign affairs, and
is the commander in chief of the national armed forces.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in two years Chavez has been sworn in,
as a result of the president's overhaul of political institutions
in this South American nation of 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Calling Venezuela's current economic and social situation "
savage," Chavez promised Saturday to create a more equitable
society during his new term and to carry out an ambitious land
reform program. In international affairs, he urged "an end to the
bombardments, the embargoes, the sanctions and the threats of the
most powerful.''
</P>
<P>
"We will keep fighting for a multipolar world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chavez vowed to turn his attention to the ailing economy in his
new term. The economy has turned sour, shrinking by 7 percent last
year, during a boom in the international price of oil, Venezuela's
top export.
</P>
<P>
A Central Bank official said Friday that the economy was well
on its way to recovery, growing by about 2.5 percent in the year's
first half.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a big mandate in
July 30 elections. It gained three-fifths of a new, 165-member
unicameral legislature and 14 of 23 state governorships.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution gives Chavez a six-year term that can be
extended by another six years. The old 1961 constitution had five-
year terms and prohibited immediate re-election.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has become, according to the new Venezuelan magna
charta of December 15, 1999, the first and only Latin American
country where the president can be at the helm of the country for
six years with a possibility of being immediately reelected.

<HEADLINE> Four Bombs Damage Bank Offices in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Four bombs were detonated
Saturday in the same number of bank offices in Bogota, Colombia,
allegedly by guerrilla members, and no victims reported, police
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The devices detonated in the Ganadero and Santander bank
offices in the south and the center of the city, as well as in two
automatic tellers in the La Calera and Soacha localities, on the
city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
The detonations destroyed windows and facades of the banks,
which were simultaneously closed to the public, and this was the
cause for the absence of victims.
</P>
<P>
Police attributed the Saturday attacks to guerrilla urban
commandos, after the attack on Friday by members of the National
Liberation Army (ELN) to two bank offices in Cali.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occur 11 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
's visit to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have stated their rejection to Clinton's visit
and to the United States' meddling in the internal affairs of
Colombia.

<P>
QUITO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Saturday wound up her visit to Ecuador as part of a tour
of several South American countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright promised Ecuadoran officials for a social and economic
development program in the border of that country with Colombia,
as well as 15 million U.S. dollars for the attention of people
displaced by the Colombian internal armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of State told the press that the adoption of
the U.S. dollar as Ecuadoran currency was an independent decision
of Quito and regarded necessary to adopt complementary measures
for the strengthening of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of State visited Brazil, Argentina, Chile,
Bolivia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
She signed during her 20-hour visit to Ecuador an agreement for
the donation of U.S. food worth 26.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Albright described Ecuador as a "key country" for the
strengthening of democracy in the region and considered necessary
the improvement of the judicial system and a constructive
political opposition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said her country supports the plans for a
reduction of part of the Ecuadoran foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> Some Southern African Countries to Export Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some countries of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) will export maize in 2000/
2001 marketing year as the region projects a maize surplus of 1.34
million tons.
</P>
<P>
In its quarterly bulletin released here Sunday, the SADC
regional early warning unit said although cereal supplies have
remained insufficient with a deficit of 679,000 tons, some SADC
countries produced more than they needed.
</P>
<P>
The unit said the total maize availability projected at 21.05
million tons was sufficient to meet the region's maize requirement
of 19.71 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The unit said this would, however, boost export programs with
South Africa having so far made the commitment to export 565,000
tons of maize out of the country's availability of 2.27 million
tons for this crop.
</P>
<P>
Further exports are likely during the course of the 2000/2001
marketing year particularly to the drought-affected countries in
east Africa, said the unit.
</P>
<P>
Exportable maize surpluses were also projected for Malawi,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SADC early warning unit said wheat availability
estimated at 3.29 million tons was insufficient to cover regional
requirement of 4.5 million tons leaving a regional deficit of 1.21
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the region would also export rice, sorghum and
millet.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Calls for Speedy Implementation of Congo Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Signatories to the Lusaka
peace agreement should not let themselves be held to ransom by
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) President Laurent Kabila,
South African Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the South African Broadcasting Corporation
television program, she said regional leaders will decide whether
to institute punitive measures against the DRC as soon as they
hear Kabila's response to the latest peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether sanctions will work in getting Kabila to the
negotiating table, Dlaminis-Zuma replied: "They probably would
work to some degree."
</P>
<P>
The prospect of sanctions was raised during a gathering of
African leaders in Lusaka this week where participants failed to
persuade Kabila to accept the mediation of former Botswana
president Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has accused Masire, who was appointed by the
Organization of African Unity, of bias toward the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese leader was told in the latest Lusaka meeting "in
a very firm way" to reconsider his stance.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma said implementation of the year-old Lusaka accord
should start and be accelerated by the five governments who had
signed it along with the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"They should not be held at ransom by one person," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Friday that he was
sending Nigeria's former military ruler General Abdulsalami
Abubakar to tell the Congolese government to honor the accord.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Ruling Party Promises to Improve Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ruling Chama
Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) has put modernization of the economy and
empowerment of the people as its key targets in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The party's 2000 elections manifesto, which was officially
launched by its chairman, the incumbent president Benjamin Mkapa
on Saturday and made available here on Sunday, states that the
commendable social and economic progress was achieved in Tanzania
over the last couple of years, but the economy had remained
backward and dependent.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge ahead of us is to expand the economy and lead
Tanzanians out of traditional agriculture, livestock keeping and
fishing, as well as serfdom in the emerging market economy," the
124-page manifesto says.
</P>
<P>
"It is from such a background that CCM has now conceived a
strategy aimed at economically empowering the people."
</P>
<P>
The strategy, it notes, involves the creation of an environment
conductive to popular participation in economic activities and
poverty reduction programs.
</P>
<P>
It also includes strengthening of the cooperative movement in
the country to facilitate availability of inputs to farmers at
affordable prices and markets for their produce.
</P>
<P>
"In the next five years," the party declared in the manifesto,
"modern and scientific and technological processes are to be
applied in all sectors of the economy."
</P>
<P>
The party also pledges to continue with policies designed to
attract more investment in the mining, manufacturing, tourism and
other economic sectors to boost the country's economic growth to
over 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will hold its second multi-party presidential and
parliamentary elections on October 29. Mkapa is running for a
second five-year term as a CCM candidate, while the party is
trying to gain more seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the last elections in 1995, the CCM achieved a convincing
majority at the national legislative elections, winning 186 of the
232 elective seats in the National Assembly, the parliament of
Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Arrests Four Foreigners on Spying Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian authorities have
arrested four foreigners including two Britons, a South African
and a Sierra Leonean on spying charges, according to a radio
report on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Justice Minister Eddington Varmah was quoted by the
British Broadcast Corporation as saying at a news conference held
Saturday that the four, who are in Liberia to make a documentary
for Britain's Channel Four television, have carried out "acts
against the security of the state".
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the police discovered this group
damaging instruments against the interests of the Liberian country
in an attempt to provide false and malicious information to
foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested in their hotel rooms in Liberia's capital
Monrovia on Friday and will appear before a court in the near
future, Varmah said.
</P>
<P>
The British Television employing them has denied the spying
allegations, saying that it is "deeply concerned" and that the
crew was engaged in legitimate journalistic activities.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Liberia has repeatedly denounced what it says
are international plots against its President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Britain and Liberia have been on the strain since
Britain recommended the European Union to cancel an aid package to
Liberia for its alleged supporting the rebels in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Opposition Presidential Candidate Vows to Rid Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A major Tanzanian
opposition presidential candidate has promised to uproot
corruption and develop the country's economy through proper
utilization of the natural resources available if he wins the
election scheduled on October 29, newspapers here reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Launching the election campaigns here on Saturday, Ibrahim
Lipumba, a candidate who is running for the highest position in
the Tanzanian Union government on the ticket of the alliance of
the Civic United Front (CUF) and the CHADEMA, said that their
parties will wage an endless war against corruption and ensure
Tanzanians may live in a corruption-free country.
</P>
<P>
Lipumba, a professor of economics, said: "Much efforts will be
directed to the improvement of the economy by investing much in
agriculture and industries because they, important sectors, in
developing the nation."
</P>
<P>
This can be done through the provision of agricultural inputs
and soft loans to the peasants all over the country, he told the
rally.
</P>
<P>
"With the rehabilitation of our collapsing industries," he
added: "We would be able to create more jobs for our youth who are
roaming the streets on empty stomachs."

NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB),
one of the country's five major financial institutions, is to
spend some 1.2 billion shillings (about 16 million U.S. dollars)

have been stolen by some Kitwe residents after vandals broke into
the waste storehouse and stole two drums and sold the contents as
ordinary cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
The PCB oil which is harmful to both human beings and the
environment has been in the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
designated storehouse for the past 15 years after being drained
out of equipment at the site.
</P>
<P>
Cyril Lukeke, a ZCCM Investment Holding official, told a group
of participants of a national PCB conference in Kitwe this week,
that ZCCM needed about 700,000 U.S. dollars to dispose off all
toxic and hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
He explained during a tour of the PCB site that ZCCM Investment
Holdings also needed to buy United Nations-approved containers to
transfer the chemicals from the site to the final destination to
avoid any spillages.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a drop of PCB on a human skin causes
rashes, cancer and accelerates puberty and contaminates the soil.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Voluntarily Cuts Monthly Pay by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Saturday declared publicly that his official salary was 100,000
Kenya shillings (about 1,330 U.S. dollars) per month at his
Kabarak home at Nakuru town in Rift Valley Province, central Kenya,
media here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said that he only takes 50,000 shillings
(about 665 dollars) per month since he had voluntarily decided to
forgo a half of the salary, adding that the sacrifice was in
consideration of the hard economic time Kenyans were experiencing.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks when he was addressing Bomet District
goodwill delegation from Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he has dismissed as malicious claims by certain
quarters that he earned 4 million shillings (about 53,300 dollars)
daily in form of allowances.

<HEADLINE> Former Zambian Minister Launches New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian Environment
Minister Ben Mwila has officially launched his Republican Party (
RP) with an immediate call to fight corruption and politics of
intolerance, Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Luanshya's Rugby Club in Copperbelt Province on
Saturday, Mwila, also chairman of the RP, said his party would
ensure that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) was funded,
allowed to run independently and empowered to root out corrupt
leaders and citizens in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the performance of the economy, he said his party would
ensure that the economy was turned around with the help of all
stakeholders especially the farming community.
</P>
<P>
The party would resuscitate the agricultural sector, using a
combination of incentives such as affordable credit, speedy
collection and timely payment for agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Mwila as saying that his party once elected
into office would ensure that all citizens had access to basic
health facilities and care through the establishment of combined
private and public health schemes such as medical and insurance
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Mwila lost his minister portfolio after he was expelled for the
country's ruling party, Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD),
last month. He was suspended in June this year by MMD National
Secretary Michael Sata, who charged that in the past 18 months,
Mwila had been involved in anti-party activities which greatly
destabilized the party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidature for the MMD presidency on May
26 this year in a bid to run for the MMD presidency in the general
elections to be held next year.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Children's Foundation Launched in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The long awaited Kenneth Kaunda
Children of Africa Foundation (KKF) has been officially launched
by its Executive Director Robet Penny in Zambia on behalf of
Kaunda who is currently out of the country, Sunday Mail newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The practical launch will be done by Kenneth Kaunda, Zambian
former president and founder of the organization in the next few
weeks, said Penny at a press briefing here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have so far registered our organization in six countries
mainly in the Southern Africa," Penny said, adding that the
intention of the foundation is not to compete with other
organizations but to create alliances with the already existing
ones and internationalize it to hold public awareness campaigns on
the devastation the HIV/AIDS scourge has caused in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We will use Kaunda to get the conscience of the people who are
unaware of the devastating levels of HIV/AIDS in Africa. We are
going to break the silence which unfortunately has existed.
African countries have been pretty silent on the problems of HIV/
AIDS, so our mission is to break that silence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foundation is all about the children of Africa
who have fallen victims of the scourge after the deaths of their
parents and his organization was overwhelmed by the positive
response of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
heads of states at the recent Windhoek summit in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Some of the objectives of the foundation are to initiate
programs that will break the poverty/AIDS cycle through education,
skills training and job creation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Disseminate Storage Technics to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Ministry of
Agriculture has started a program to disseminate post harvest
storage technologies to farmers, with the aim to educate farmers
on simple local developed technologies to preserve food, the
government-owned New Vision daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Over 35 percent of the total produce is wasted because our
farmers do not have simple technologies to store their produce,"
Head of National Post-harvest Program Ambrose Agona was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience has found that a few months after the harvest
season, communities fall back to famine because we lack post-
harvest produce handling techniques," said Agona.
</P>
<P>
He said that insects, micro-organisms, rodents, mites and birds
pose the biggest threat to post harvesting storage.
</P>
<P>
The program has developed simple preservation methods through
the use of tobacco and a kind of tree powder, said Agona, adding
that when mixed in cereal produce, the powder has a strong smell
which repulses weevils for over six months.
</P>
<P>
Post-harvest storage methods are of importance to Ugandans, for
the east Africa country is an agricultural country with over 80
percent of population being farmers.

Saturday.

uniforms, took part in the parade along the Shankill Road to mark
the completion of murals daubed on walls in the area depicting
their pro-British culture.
</P>

16-year sentence for directing loyalist paramilitaries.

of Canadian Doctor Norman Bethune in a letter announced Saturday
at the unveiling ceremony in Dr. Bethune's hometown, Gravenhurst,
Ontario. The full text of the letter is as follows:
</P>
<P>
"On the occasion of the inauguration of the bronze statue of Dr.
Bethune, I wish to express, on behalf of the Chinese government
and people and in my own name, my warm congratulations to the
Memorial Hall of Bethune.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bethune is an outstanding son of the Canadian people and a
great friend of the Chinese people. He came to China, making light
of traveling thousands of miles, to help the Chinese people in the
War of Resistance against Japanese aggression and sacrificed his
precious life for this cause. Though more than six decades have
passed, his name remains a household word in China. His spirit of
internationalism and his utter devotion to others without any
thought of self are still on everyone's lips around China. He has
become the symbol of the long-standing friendship between our two
peoples. Today, the seeds of Sino-Canadian friendship that he
personally sown have yielded rich fruits.
</P>
<P>
May the spirit of Dr. Bethune shine perpetually!
</P>
<P>
May Sino-Canadian friendship last forever!"

<HEADLINE> Thousands Of Germans Rally Against Right-extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Berlin, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand people took to
the streets on Saturday to condemn right extremism in Germany,
while Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder renewed call for banning the
ultra rightist National-democratic Party of Deutschland (NPD).
</P>
<P>
In the city of Hamburg, about 2,500 people participated in a
protest with the theme of "Hamburg Against Nazi-Terror," which
display their anger at the growing violence of right-extremists
against foreigners and Jews. Dorothee Stapelfeldt, president of
the Hamburg state house, urged citizens to make more efforts for a
"democratic Hamburg" by standing up against the right-extremist
skinheads.
</P>
<P>
In estern German cities of Rostock and Eisenach, there were
also anti-right-extremism demonstrations sponsored by an alliance
of organizations named "Action Day Against Rightism".
</P>
<P>
As reported by "Bild am Sonntag," German Chancellor Schroeder
called on Bundestag and Bundesrat, the two chambers of the federal
parliament, to send a joint resolution on banning the NPD to the
Constitutional Court, if a working group of federal and state
officials recommends such a move.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he believed such a move would be a piece of "
political hygiene," and that a joint resolution would increase
pressure on the conservative high court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Tageszeitung", a Berlin-based newspaper, published
on its front pictures of 22 ultra-right wingers in Germany, at the
start of its campaign against extremism. The Norddeutsche Rundfunk
(NDR), a broadcasting service, also carried out its "Against
Hatred--For Tolerance" initiative.
