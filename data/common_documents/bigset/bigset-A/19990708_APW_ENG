<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Making Selena Documentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Filmmaker Lourdes Portillo says she decided to  
make her documentary about slain singer Selena to explore the 
social forces that transformed the popular entertainer into such a 
beloved figure. 
</P>
<P>
	At Selena's grave, her devoted fans clean her headstone and  
leave dolls, flowers and intimate notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the coverage on the television, I couldn't believe  
that this brown girl had gotten to be so famous. That's when I 
decided to make a film about Selena,'' Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The public television special, ``Corpus: A Home Movie for  
Selena,'' looks at the star's hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, 
and the legacy she left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, to be aired July 23, includes clips of Selena singing  
as a young girl, home movies, interviews with her family and a 
debate on her value as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Selena was killed in 1995 by the president of her fan club,  
Yolanda Saldivar, who is serving a life sentence for murder.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped Against NYC Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A police officer who shot an unarmed squeegee  
man while leaving a baseball game was found innocent of all charges 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Meyer, 29, could have faced 25 years in prison if he had  
been convicted of assault and reckless endangerment for shooting a 
man who tried to wash his windshield for a handout last summer. 
Meyer was off-duty at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Collins ruled that prosecutors failed to disprove  
Meyer's claim that he used his gun because he feared for his life. 
The victim, Antoine Reid, was shot once in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer's family and police in the courtroom cheered and clapped  
when Collins issued his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I acted appropriately,'' Meyer said. ``It was a horrible  
situation but justice prevailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who is suing the city for $100 million, said he was  
outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to do this to somebody else,'' Reid said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meyer had just left a New York Yankees game with his girlfriend  
and her young son when Reid tried to wash his car's windshield for 
a few coins. Meyer testified he and Reid began struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that this guy was going to do some serious damage to  
me, that he was going to kill me,'' Meyer testified. 
</P>
<P>
	But several eyewitness said Meyer was the aggressor in the  
confrontation -- that he walking forward as Reid backed away and 
shoved him across several lanes of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer still faces a police department hearing, and the police  
commissioner will decide whether Meyer stays on the force or is 
fired.

<HEADLINE> DeCicco Honored To Coach US Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Tony DiCicco is the man behind the  
women. 
</P>
<P>
	As perhaps 2,000 fans at Thursday's practice session screamed  
for Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and the rest of the U.S. soccer squad 
that has taken the nation by storm, DiCicco exited the bus and 
calmly strode, almost unnoticed, toward the field at Pomona-Pitzer 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	When the workout ended, 150 or so media members scrambled to  
surround the players as they sat in different areas of the field. 
Television cameramen jostled for position near Julie Foudy and 
Brandi Chastain. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco sat nearby, far from the madding crowd, a handful of  
reporters informally chatting with him. That, generally, is 
DiCicco's way: He stays out of the way, except when his team needs 
some instruction or a dressing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a privilege to coach this team,'' DiCicco said as  
the Americans prepared for Saturday's final with China. ``It's been 
a wonderful opportunity for all of us. This team has grown together 
and is so close to achieving what it set out to do, and they all 
are outstanding women, too. I can't think of a better job to 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When DiCicco took over the job in August 1994 from Anson  
Dorrance -- who guided the Americans to the first Women's World Cup 
title in 1991 and is the mastermind of the University of North 
Carolina soccer dynasty -- he sought guidance from some of his 
players. Hamm told him to ``coach us like men, treat us like 
women.'' He has never forgotten that advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know much about this team,'' said DiCicco, 50, who  
joined the squad as a goalkeepers' coach in '91. ``I had been 
working with U.S. Soccer and boys youth national teams. This team 
had developed a reputation for good play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I experienced this team and saw their passion for the  
game and the goals they set for themselves, it was fun to be around 
them. And it became a dream come true to end up their head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking charge, DiCicco has a 96-8-7 record, including this  
World Cup. He's led the Americans to third place at the '95 World 
Cup, gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics and last year's Goodwill 
Games, and now to the finals of the biggest women's sporting event 
ever. Not bad for someone who claims he didn't consider holding the 
job before he got it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching a national team? I don't know if I ever thought about  
being the women's national coach'' he said. ``But certainly playing 
and coaching at a high level was a dream of mind. I sought to coach 
a team that is motivated, talented and has a chance of winning, and 
that I would be proud to be associated with. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those goals have been answered by this team.''  
</P>
<P>
	As a male among these superb female athletes, DiCicco remains a  
bit of an outsider. That gives him a unique perspective about this 
team that, right now, carries the aura of the biggest rock stars. 
He had to chuckle when someone mentioned the hundreds of yelping 
youngsters who surrounded the team bus as it pulled onto the 
college grounds before practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Might this scene be similar to what Bruce Springsteen or Ricky  
Martin experiences at concerts? 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that sets this team apart is that they don't  
want to all be the homecoming queen and do the popular thing,'' he 
said. ``They just want to go out and win games and win 
championships and Olympic gold medals. That's an awesome challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The genuine pursuit of their dreams and goals is what is so  
enticing for people. Its kind of snowballed and has turned into a 
wonderful phenomena. They are finally getting their due.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is he.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tony understands us,'' veteran Joy Fawcett said. ``He  
understands we have a different approach to the game and to the 
relationships we build than the men do. He allows us to be 
ourselves, and that's been a very important part of our success.''

<HEADLINE> Look At U.S.-China Soccer Matchup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- How China and the United States match up 	
for Saturday's Women's World Cup final: 
</P>
<P>
                             *DEFENSE 	
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. defense has been spotty, affording dangerous  
opportunities for every opponent except North Korea, China has been 
very stingy. The Chinese have allowed two goals to four by the 
Americans. China's opponents rarely have gotten close to the net. 
</P>
<P>
	China's defenders, led by Wen Lirong amd Liping Wang, clear the  
ball quickly upfield to begin counterattacks. They rarely are 
caught out of position or in a scrambling situation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. defenders Carla Overbeck, Joy Fawcett, Brandi Chastain and  
Kate Sobrero have made some spectacular plays while catching up to 
attackers. But there have been too many gaping holes in the 
defense, and Chastain has struggled in particular on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	EDGE: China.  

</P>
<P>
                            *GOALKEEPER   	
</P>
<P>
	Two of the best in the world, Gao Hong -- known as ``The Great  
Wall of China'' -- and Briana Scurry, whom teammates refer to as 
``The Rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry has had far more work and has been steady, at times  
spectacular. She might need to be even better than she was against 
Brazil in the semifinals if the Americans spring leaks on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Gao predicted in February at the FIFA All-Star game that China  
would play the United States in the final. If she's as on-target 
with her saves Saturday, she might be hoisting a championship 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Scurry is in a groove and Gao hasn't needed to be.  
</P>
<P>
	EDGE: United States.  

</P>
<P>
                             *MIDFIELD   	
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese midfield moves the ball superbly, often with  
one-touch passes to breaking teammates. Not often do things get 
methodical for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Liu Ailing, they have one of the best all-around performers  
of the tournament. She is an excellent finisher and a strong 
creator. Her battles with Michelle Akers could be critical. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers has had a good tournament, particularly in controling the  
ball. If she has it on her foot for long periods, it could 
frustrate China. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristine Lilly has been very active for the Americans and joins  
the offense as well as any midfielder in the world. Julie Foudy has 
been less visible, although she set up the first U.S. goal in the 
semifinals with a terrific cross. 
</P>
<P>
	EDGE: Even.  

</P>
<P>
                             *FORWARDS   	
</P>
<P>
	Sun Wen vs. Mia Hamm. Yan Jin vs. Tiffeny Milbrett. Ouying Zhang  
vs. Cindy Parlow. 
</P>
<P>
	All three duos are dynamic and like to attack. All three are  
strong finishers and excellent passers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun has been hot and Hamm has not. The American hasn't scored in  
three games, while Sun is tied for the tournament lead with seven 
goals. Hamm looked tentative against Brazil, passing up several 
shots. Sun scored twice against Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett is the wild card. Her energetic bursts to the ball --  
and with the ball -- could free up teammates for open shots. 
</P>
<P>
	EDGE: Even.  

</P>
<P>
                              *BENCH   	
</P>
<P>
	Shannon MacMillan has been the most productive substitute in the  
tournament for any team. The Americans also have Tisha Venturini, 
another veteran of big games, available off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	China doesn't have anyone of that quality in reserve.  
</P>
<P>
	EDGE: United States.  

</P>
<P>
                             *COACHING   	
</P>
<P>
	Ma Yuanan has made all the right moves for China, which has  
gained confidence as the tournament has progressed. The Chinese are 
technically stronger than any team in the world, and they're very 
balanced. They haven't trailed in the tournament, so Ma's 
strategies have been foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony DiCicco is extremely popular with his players and has an  
uncanny sense for when to insert MacMillan into the lineup. He's 
found ways to disguise some of the weaknesses in the back, and is 
fortunate enough to have Scurry keeping the ball out of the net 
when there are breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	EDGE: China.  

</P>
<P>
                           *INTANGIBLES   	
</P>
<P>
	China has won two of three games this year against the  
Americans, including one at Giants Stadium. It beat defending 
champion Norway 5-0 in the semifinals. No opponent has put up much 
of a fight against the Chinese in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are gutsy and riding an emotional wave that could  
turn into a tsunami before nearly 90,000 at the Rose Bowl. They 
also have said anything short of winning the World Cup is not 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
	EDGE: United States.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Delays Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- Russia was forced today to postpone the  
launch of a Russian-Ukrainian satellite because of Kazakstan's 
temporary ban on use of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch of the Ocean-O weather satellite was put off until  
Friday but could be delayed even further, said Khalid Abteshev, the 
acting chief of Kazakstan's Airspace Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan suspended all launches from Baikonur on Tuesday  
pending the investigation of Monday's crash of a rocket carrying a 
Russian military satellite. Also under investigation was possible 
environmental damage caused by fuel spilling from the 
disintegrating rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazak Environmental Protection Minister Serikbek Daukeyev said  
Thursday that the crash had showered a large area of central 
Kazakstan with fuel, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Daukeyev said lab tests would determine whether the fuel had  
caused any environmental damage, but that local authorities had 
already taken measures to protect residents against poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on launches from Baikonur could be a major inconvenience  
for Russia, which leases the cosmodrome for cargo flights to the 
Mir space station and for launches of commercial and military 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow hopes Kazakstan will limit the ban to launches of the  
Proton-class booster rocket that failed Monday, instead of all 
rockets, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia fears that if Kazakstan bans all launches, the two  
countries could ``come to a disruption in bilateral and 
international obligations connected with the use of Baikonur,'' 
Rakhmanin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow is several years behind on its rent payments for  
Baikonur, but says it should be allowed to continue using the 
cosmodrome because Kazakstan has debts to Russia as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has a cargo flight to Mir scheduled for July 14 and a  
launch of a French-Russian Sesat satellite planned for July 28-29.

<HEADLINE> Missing Financier Wooed Celebrities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Martin Frankel was a name-dropper.  
</P>
<P>
	He tossed around names of rich businessmen, celebrities,  
powerful lawyers, and even saints to attract people to his bogus 
Catholic charity. Lee Iacocca, Walter Cronkite, Robert Strauss, St. 
Francis of Assisi, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the mysterious money manager from Greenwich  
really had managed to charm power brokers into supporting his 
purported charitable cause. In others, he simply lied about their 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Frankel, 44, disappeared in May with at least  
$215 million in assets from several insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Bolan, a well-known New York attorney and former federal  
prosecutor, was one of those who believed Frankel's elaborate 
stories about wanting to help the needy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolan did not return telephone calls seeking comment, but his  
attorney, Maurice Nessen, said Bolan was convinced that Frankel was 
eager to raise money for the poor through the St. Francis of Assisi 
Foundation, a charity he established in the British Virgin Islands 
in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Bolan met Frankel at his Greenwich mansion, he  
was led into a room lined with shelves filled with books about the 
Catholic church, saints and church canon, Nessen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, who always called himself ``David Rosse'' during his  
dealings with Bolan, waxed on and on during their initial 
conversation, showing an in-depth knowledge of the saints, 
especially St. Francis, who was known for helping the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put on a show and the show was very real.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bolan met Frankel through Thomas Corbally, a well-connected New  
York business consultant who introduced Frankel to various movers 
and shakers Frankel hoped would add legitimacy to the St. Francis 
foundation, which authorities now believe was a front for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	When approached by an Associated Press reporter at his London  
hotel Wednesday evening, Corbally refused to talk about Frankel. He 
told The Express, a London tabloid, that Frankel duped him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fooled like everyone else. He was a consummate liar, a  
master of deception,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has not been seen since May 4, the day before  
firefighters found documents burning inside his Greenwich mansion. 
Federal authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest on wire 
fraud and money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	While 11 insurance companies in five states were horrified to  
learn of the missing assets, so were some prominent people whose 
names had been attached to Frankel's charity without their 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired CBS newsman Walter Cronkite said he was contacted in  
January by an old friend, the Rev. Peter Jacobs, a priest living in 
Rome, and asked to become a member of the St. Francis foundation's 
advisory board. Jacobs described it as a new organization that was 
being founded to aid charities involving children and health and 
education 
</P>
<P>
	Cronkite said he refused, mainly because he was already busy  
with several other charities. Former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca 
was also listed, although he, too, has denied giving his 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, after Frankel disappeared, Cronkite learned that despite  
his refusal, his name had been listed as a member of the board on 
the foundation's mission statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Jacobs called Cronkite and left a message on his answering  
machine: ``This man has apparently run away with all the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cronkite told The Associated Press Thursday he is not surprised  
that Frankel convinced so many people to believe his pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who says he's got a billion dollars and is willing to  
give it away is likely to attract an awful lot of people,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Jacobs, nor his lawyer, John Q. Kelly, returned  
telephone calls from The Associated Press seeking comment. Jacobs 
told the Greenwich Time that he and other priests had been 
completely fooled by Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the proverbial suckers,'' he said.  
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Russia Delays Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- Russia was forced today to postpone the  
launch of a Russian-Ukrainian satellite because of Kazakstan's 
temporary ban on use of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch of the Ocean-O weather satellite was put off until  
Friday but could be delayed even further, said Khalid Abteshev, the 
acting chief of Kazakstan's Airspace Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan suspended all launches from Baikonur on Tuesday  
pending the investigation of Monday's crash of a rocket carrying a 
Russian military satellite. Also under investigation was possible 
environmental damage caused by fuel spilling from the 
disintegrating rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazak Environmental Protection Minister Serikbek Daukeyev said  
Thursday that the crash had showered a large area of central 
Kazakstan with fuel, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Daukeyev said lab tests would determine whether the fuel had  
caused any environmental damage, but that local authorities had 
already taken measures to protect residents against poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on launches from Baikonur could be a major inconvenience  
for Russia, which leases the cosmodrome for cargo flights to the 
Mir space station and for launches of commercial and military 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow hopes Kazakstan will limit the ban to launches of the  
Proton-class booster rocket that failed Monday, instead of all 
rockets, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia fears that if Kazakstan bans all launches, the two  
countries could ``come to a disruption in bilateral and 
international obligations connected with the use of Baikonur,'' 
Rakhmanin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow is several years behind on its rent payments for  
Baikonur, but says it should be allowed to continue using the 
cosmodrome because Kazakstan has debts to Russia as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has a cargo flight to Mir scheduled for July 14 and a  
launch of a French-Russian Sesat satellite planned for July 28-29.

<HEADLINE> Gay Marriage Law Weighed in Vermont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Peter Harrigan and Stan Baker try to make  
sure they're close to the phone around 11 a.m. on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost eight months now, the two men have awaited the weekly  
release of Vermont Supreme Court decisions to learn whether they 
can get married. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court decision -- which could come at any time over the  
next few months or years -- could make Vermont the first state to 
allow gay marriage. As a result, the case is being closely watched 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's any place it could stick in the country, I think  
it's Vermont,'' said Vermont Law School professor Greg Johnson. 
``It strikes some deep chords here about the tradition of 
independence, letting people do what they want with their private 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont already permits gays to adopt children, and has a gay  
rights law and a hate crimes statute, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a 37-year-old drama professor, and Baker, 53, director  
of outpatient services for a mental health agency, say they want to 
be afforded the same rights as heterosexual mates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply devoted to my relationship with Stan and would  
like our commitment to be supported by legal rights afforded other 
committed couples,'' Harrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the notion of allowing two men or two women to marry has  
not found acceptance in any state. Courts in Alaska and Hawaii have 
ruled in favor of gay marriage. But they were essentially overruled 
by the voters last November, though there still is legal wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts Vermont at the forefront of one of the biggest  
political debates of the day. No other state's high court is 
dealing with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certainly very hopeful about Vermont,'' said Evan  
Wolfson, a lawyer for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, 
a gay rights organization. Wolfson helped argue the Hawaii case and 
filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of same-sex Vermont 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's waiting with bated breath,'' said Jay Sekulow,  
chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice in 
Virginia Beach, Va., which filed a brief opposing gay marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Because marriages performed in one state are generally  
recognized in all other states, Hawaii's 1993 ruling set off some 
furious preemptive legislating around the country. Congress passed 
the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition of 
gay marriage and allowed states to ignore same-sex unions licensed 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker and Harrigan and two lesbian couples sued in 1997 when  
their town clerks, on the advice of the Vermont attorney general, 
denied them marriage licenses. As in the Hawaii and Alaska cases, 
the Vermont couples argue that marriage is a fundamental right. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal marriage would afford gay and lesbian couples a wide range  
of civil benefits in Vermont. Among them: family leave; bereavement 
leave; retirement and pension benefits; health insurance; 
inheritance; and the right to make medical decisions on behalf of a 
same-sex partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vermont court is most likely to focus on whether denying gay  
marriage is a violation of the state constitution's common benefits 
clause, akin to the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause, 
said Peter Teachout, a Vermont Law School professor. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court rules in favor of same-sex unions, opponents could  
seek to amend the state constitution to thwart the decision. But 
that's not as easy in Vermont as it is in most other places, like 
Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Two successive legislatures must approve a proposed  
constitutional amendment. It then has to be adopted by a statewide 
vote of the people. The process generally takes four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates believe hundreds or thousands of couples would marry  
before such an amendment could reach the people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once there is a breakthrough, whether it is in Vermont or  
Hawaii, the fair-minded middle of the public is going to see the 
sky didn't fall,'' Wolfson said.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Reaches Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- AlliedSignal reached a settlement  
Thursday with aerospace products makers BFGoodrich Co. and Coltec 
Industries Inc. to end its lawsuit over their proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal claimed the deal, which would create the world's  
largest manufacturer of aircraft landing gear, would violate its 
agreement with Coltec to produce landing gear systems that used 
AlliedSignal wheels and brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morristown, N.J.-based manufacturer also claimed the $2  
billion merger would create a monopoly by leaving only two 
suppliers of aircraft landing gear for military and commercial 
aircraft. It also said the merger could force it to shut down its 
South Bend plant and lay off 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Attorney General Jeffrey Modisett, who had filed briefs  
on behalf of AlliedSignal to stop the proposed BFGoodrich-Coltec 
merger, announced the agreement without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
	But a source close to the negotiations said Richfield,  
Ohio-based BFGoodrich promised AlliedSignal it would include its 
wheels and brakes on BFGoodrich landing gears and would also put 
together joint bids with AlliedSignal. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the two  
sides have worked over the past week to put together a deal to 
avoid a trial that was scheduled to begin next week in U.S. 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from Allied, BFGoodrich and Coltec would not  
immediately comment on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the settlement ends Allied's suit, it does not address  
Crane Co.'s standing in the suit. The Stamford, Conn.-based 
aerospace components company had filed a suit in New York to stop 
the merger which was dismissed by district and appeals court 
judges. Crane then joined AlliedSignal's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, announced in November, had already passed the  
scrutiny of the Department of Defense and the Federal Trade 
Commission. But it was delayed when AlliedSignal filed its lawsuit 
in February.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Pull Back; Dow Down 78.51 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today amid rising interest  
rates and a mixed batch of second-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 78.51 at 11,108.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were modestly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 6.83 at 1,389.03, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 4.24 at 2,738.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices tumbled today, with the 30-year Treasury bond  
dropping 1/2 point in price, pushing its yield up to 6.08 percent, 
from 6.04 percent late Wednesday. The rising yield served as a 
reminder to investors that higher interest rates are taking hold in 
the buoyant economy, and could threaten earnings in future 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages, seen as most vulnerable to interest rate  
increases, were among the big losers today. J.P. Morgan, a 
component of the Dow, fell 2 to 144. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks had risen to record levels in recent sessions, due  
largely to a strong outlook for second-quarter profits. But mixed 
earnings today helped take stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric confirmed those expectations, beating analysts'  
estimates by a penny. Its stock, which rose sharply Wednesday in 
advance of the report, slipped 1 3/4 to 116 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Airborne Freight said late Wednesday it will miss analysts'  
expectations by as much as 18 cents per share. Its shares slipped 1/8 
to 27 3/16, but other package delivery company stocks fell more 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose 1/4 to 38 1/8. Its shares had dropped in late  
trading Wednesday afternoon after a Florida jury ruled that tobacco 
makers are liable for making a defective product that causes 
emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. The verdict, if it 
stands, is expected to cost the tobacco industry billions in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 103.2 million shares, 
ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.46 at 653.01, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.15 at 799.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.05 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.3 percent, France's 
CAC-40 was down 0.4 percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 was down just 
a few points.

<HEADLINE> Bud Selig's First Year Was Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He travels a lot more these days, venturing from  
Milwaukee to pitch for new ballparks, to lobby politicians and to 
attend meetings and funerals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, after one year as baseball commissioner, he's essentially  
the same old Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Bud's changed in the 22 years I've known him,''  
union head Donald Fehr said this week as Selig's first anniversary 
as commissioner approached. ``Obviously, he's more knowledgeable 
about things. But he's basically the same person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means decisions are still made later rather than sooner,  
and that he sometimes tells people on opposite sides of issues what 
they want to hear rather than his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also means he still has a passion for the game and the  
desire to address its problems. 
</P>
<P>
	And it means that few people were surprised when he smacked his  
Lexus right into a construction vehicle one morning while admiring 
Miller Park, the Brewers' new stadium in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at least comfortable a year later that the ship is headed  
in the right direction,'' Selig said Wednesday, two days before the 
first anniversary of his election. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who entered baseball as controlling owner of the  
Milwaukee Brewers in 1970, was made acting commissioner from 
September 1992, when Fay Vincent was forced out. After years of 
saying he wouldn't take the job, two days after last summer's 
All-Star game, Selig was voted to five-year term and became the 
first owner-commissioner (the Brewers were put in a trust and are 
now run by his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb). 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, baseball went to Mexico for its first-ever  
international opener and played an exhibition game in Cuba for the 
first time in 40 years -- the image of Selig sitting next to Cuban 
president Fidel Castro is still memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field is where most of the controversy remained. World  
Series ticket prices doubled to $150, the average salary shot up 19 
percent to $1.72 million, there was talk of putting advertisements 
on uniforms, baseball and ESPN sued each other, Darryl Strawberry 
was given a 120-day suspension after a cocaine-related arrest, and 
the Dodgers were fined $200,000 for breaking rules on signing Cuban 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been no evident progress on Selig's desire for  
realignment or on minority hiring, despite a directive from him to 
teams to consider minorities when they fill top jobs. And there's 
been no decision on whether to ban androstenedione and other 
testosterone boosters, with owners and the union awaiting results 
of a medical study. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go from one emergency to the other,'' he said. ``The  
pressure in unrelenting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by last year's home run race, baseball attendance is  
drawing closer to its average before the 1994-95 strike. Through 
Wednesday, games averaged 27,919, just under the 27,967 average at 
a similar point last year. It's up 10.5 percent from its 25,260 
average in 1995 but down 11.7 percent from its '94 average of 
31,612. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for the Saturday telecasts on Fox averaged a 17 percent  
increase from 2.4 to 2.8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe baseball is more popular today than ever before,''  
Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, small-market owners complain they can't compete, even  
with the poorest clubs receiving $12 million to $13 million from 
revenue sharing this year. Selig formed an economic study committee 
and expects its report in 6-9 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to solve our internal problems,'' he said. ``We need  
to deal with disparity. We need to study what we have now, what we 
think we need in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The labor agreement with players is expected to expire after the  
2001 season. Some owners already are clamoring for a salary cap, 
which would only trigger the ninth work stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	While the players' association has heard rumors management might  
want to discuss an extension of the current deal with minor 
tweaking, and that Selig's key aides favor an extension, there have 
been no proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Fehr says owners and players are getting along better  
than ever. Fehr and Selig, who bitterly criticized each other from 
1994-96, seem able to talk these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relationship between Bud and I certainly had some  
flashpoints, certainly around the time when they at first refused 
to ratify the draft agreement, but it's never been personally, 
hostile. It certainly isn't now,'' Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of focusing on players, owners seem to be looking toward  
marketing, Seattle opens a new stadium July 15, and new ballparks 
open next season in Detroit, Houston, Milwaukee, San Francisco. It 
seems a month doesn't go by when Selig doesn't go to a city and 
proclaim: ``Baseball can't survive here without a new ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Expos, averaging just 8,789 at Olympic Stadium, are  
the most pressing problem. But the futures of the Minnesota Twins 
and Oakland Athletics remain uncertain. Tuesday's All-Star game in 
Boston will focus attention on the desire of the Red Sox for a new 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up ahead is starting the 2000 season in Japan, with the New  
York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals the top choices for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Selig isn't likely to grant Pete Rose's petition to  
end his lifetime ban, he may give serious consideration to the case 
of Shoeless Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Most disturbing is the likely confrontation with umpires, whose  
labor contract expires after this year. Selig wants to shift 
control of umpires from the leagues to Sandy Alderson in the 
commissioner's office, and the three-way relationship among owners, 
players and umpires has deteriorated significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one thing we learned by all the past confrontation is  
the public just doesn't want to hear about it,'' Selig said. ``You 
hope that any differences of opinion can be settled quietly. That 
is in all parties' best interests.''

<HEADLINE> Ballet Makes North American Premiere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``The Fountain of Bakhchisaray,'' a 1934  
full-length ballet, received its North American premiere by the 
Kirov Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect a heavy dose of 1930s Soviet realism, with  
class differences emphasized. Instead, at Tuesday night's 
performance at the Metropolitan Opera, the music by Boris Asafiev 
sounded light classical, sometimes like George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot is a very dramatic telling of a tragic love story  
involving four people. It is based on an 1823 poem by Alexander 
Pushkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostislav Zakharov choreographed attractive dances for each of  
the lovers, as well as for lavishly costumed dancers at a Polish 
ball, women in Khan Girei's harem in Bakhchisaray -- capital of the 
Crimean Tatars -- and a dance by fierce warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballet begins in the courtyard of a Polish palace, with a  
ball celebrating Maria's birthday. Maria was danced by Svetlana 
Zakharova; her fiance, Prince Adam, was danced by Petr Stasiunas. 
They have some cleanly danced, classically romantic pas de deux. 
Although Zakharova sometimes landed rather heavily from jumps, her 
dancing was sweetly dainty and ebullient. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatars attack, and as the young couple tries to flee, Khan Girei  
(Vladimir Ponomarev) stabs the prince and kills him. The Tatars 
capture Maria. 
</P>
<P>
	In the harem scene in Act 2, Girei ignores his favorite wife,  
Zarema, danced by Uliana Lopatkina. But he is fascinated when Maria 
is carried in. He later visits her bedroom, offering her love and 
riches. Maria plays her late fiance's harp, dances to his memory 
and gracefully rejects Girei. After he leaves, Karema enters, sees 
Girei's cap and stabs Maria to death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final act, outside Girei's palace, Karema is thrown over  
a parapet. Girei stands near the Fountain of Tears which he has had 
built to Maria's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Kirim Giray Khan, who inspired Pushkin, led the Tatars  
on raids into Europe in the 1760s and had the Fountain of Tears 
built as a tomb for his Georgian consort. It is still a tourist 
attraction in Bakhchisaray, 20 miles from Yalta in the Crimea.

<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A U.N. official accused of breeding locusts  
to destroy crops left the Iraqi capital today, bound for Jordan, 
the driver of his U.N. vehicle told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq had demanded the expulsion of Ian Broughton of New Zealand,  
who worked for the United Nations as a clearer of land mines in 
northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The government accused Broughton of burying boxes of locust eggs  
near the border town of Khanaqin, about 110 miles northeast of 
Baghdad, in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq produced no evidence that Broughton had planted locust  
eggs. Neither Broughton nor the United Nations has made any 
statement on the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Broughton was seen leaving a Baghdad hotel this morning in a  
white U.N. four-wheel drive vehicle with an unidentified colleague. 
The driver told reporters they were going to the Jordanian capital, 
Amman -- a 12-hour drive from Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	Broughton had arrived in Baghdad from northern Iraq on Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry summoned Hans von  
Sponeck, the U.N.'s Humanitarian Coordinator in Baghdad, and 
demanded Broughton's expulsion within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A ministry statement accused Broughton of a ``criminal act ...  
intended to severely harm the country's economy which is already 
suffering from the unjust sanctions,'' referring to the U.N. 
embargo imposed since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Sponeck had been scheduled to meet Culture and Information  
Minister Humam Abdel-Khaliq, now acting foreign minister, to ask 
for evidence of the Iraqi charge. It is not known whether the 
meeting took place. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Abdel-Khaliq as saying  
Wednesday that the government was demanding the United Nations cut 
its ties to the British company Greenfield Consultants, which has 
the contract to clear land mines in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has repeatedly expressed its unease with the  
clearing of mines in the Kurdish autonomous zone of northern Iraq. 
It apparently does not want the United Nations to clear mine fields 
along the border with Iran. Iraq fought a war with Iran from 1980 
to 1988 and still accuses its eastern neighbor of infiltrating 
saboteurs across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. demining project has a budget of $20 million a year. It  
is funded by the oil-for-food program under which Iraq is allowed 
to sell limited amounts of oil on condition that the revenue is 
spent on food and humanitarian services. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations last withdrew staff from Iraq at the  
government's request in November 1997 when Baghdad accused U.S. 
arms inspectors of espionage. The American disarmament experts were 
allowed to return within weeks.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Win Games, but Not Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jim Abbott pitched against the Philadelphia  
Phillies this week and said it was one of the strangest adventures 
of his new life in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked at the lineup card and realized he hadn't heard of  
many of the players he was about to face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was probably less familiar with this team than any  
other opponent I've faced,'' the Milwaukee left-hander said. ``I 
don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Join the club, Jim. The Phillies don't even get any respect in  
their own city. Although they are seven games above .500 for the 
first time since 1995, hardly anyone in Philadelphia has noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think whether people have noticed or not, we just continued  
to go about our business,'' said general manager Ed Wade, who tries 
to ignore the sickly attendance figures announced each night at 
Veterans Stadium. ``That's what we need to do now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies' plight was never more apparent than on Wednesday  
night, when a sparse crowd of 16,593 was on hand to watch Scott 
Rolen's dramatic ninth-inning homer give the Phillies a 5-4 victory 
over the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling, Paul Byrd and Mike Lieberthal had just been  
named to the NL All-Star team. Randy Wolf, the most exciting young 
pitcher to come through the organization in years, was on the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf got a no-decision and failed to become the Phillies' first  
pitcher since Marty Bystrom in 1980 to start his career 5-0. Still, 
the Phillies improved to 45-38, third in the NL East and two games 
behind the second-place Mets. They haven't been seven games above 
.500 since Aug. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem: There were 45,000 empty seats. The Vet was so  
sparsely populated that Rolen heard a small contingent of fans 
chanting his name from 700 feet away in the upper deck before 
delivering his clutch homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the whole city of Jasper showed up,'' said Rolen,  
born and raised in the small town of Jasper, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolen is only one of the young stars emerging in Philadelphia,  
unappreciated even though the Phillies play in one of the largest 
markets in the majors and only 100 miles from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other corner of the infield is Rico Brogna, who might be  
the best defensive first baseman in baseball. The Phillies are 
strong up the middle, with Lieberthal emerging behind the plate and 
Doug Glanville catching just about everything hit to center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Abreu, among the league leaders with a .330 average, is a  
rising star in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special group,'' said batting coach Hal McRae.  
``They're young, they're enthusiastic, they play hard. No other 
club in the league outhustles these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few people in baseball who noticed the Phillies was  
NL All-Star manager Bruce Bochy of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said.  
``He knew everything about all our guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling (12-4), headed to his third All-Star game, finally has  
some help in the starting rotation. He's backed up by Wolf and 
Byrd, an inspirational right-hander who went from waiver-wire 
pickup to All-Star in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling and Byrd gave the Phillies two 10-game winners before  
July for the first time since Jim Lonborg and Ken Brett in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you've got to do is come out and watch us play, and we're  
definitely exciting to watch,'' said Lieberthal, the first Phillies 
catcher to make the All-Star team since Darren Daulton in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Philly's sports fans are some of the most rabid in the  
country, they also might be the most jaded. They know that the 
Phillies entered the season with the fourth-lowest payroll in the 
National League, and resent what they perceive to be small-market 
overtures from management. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 41 home dates, the Phillies have drawn an average of  
22,734 -- nearly 3,000 more than at this point last season but still 
near the bottom of the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies are finalizing plans for a new ballpark scheduled  
to open in 2002. A hurdle was cleared this week to facilitate 
making it a downtown stadium, similar to those in Baltimore and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, a team that is one of baseball's the best-kept secrets  
continues to toil in anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have such a recognizable team,'' Lieberthal  
said. ``Until we actually win, we won't get that notoriety. We're 
starting to get it now. If we keep playing like we are, then we 
will get it.''

<HEADLINE> Unity'99 Draws White House Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A gathering of the nation's minority journalists  
turned into a must-do political event for presidential hopefuls 
Thursday, with scheduled appearances by Democrats Al Gore and Bill 
Bradley and last-minute stops by Republicans George W. Bush and 
John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	There was controversy as Bush first declined to come, then added  
a last-minute stop, sans speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just really disappointed,'' said Nancy Baca, president  
of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. ``He used us 
as a glorified photo opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush walked briefly through the Unity '99 conference's  
exhibition hall, answered a few shouted questions from a growing 
crowd of delegates, and left after less than 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalina Camia, president of Unity: Journalists of Color,  
denounced the Texas governor's brief visit at a news conference. 
She said she was notified of Bush's visit as his car approached 
Seattle's Convention Center, where more than 6,000 Asian-American, 
black, Hispanic and American Indian journalists are gathered this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Bush's stop ``inadequate,'' Camia said, ``This was  
clearly a missed opportunity for the Bush campaign and for the 
convention attendees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, she had announced McCain's decision to rearrange his  
plans and speak at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign office initially said he was too busy to attend  
the conference. But Bush changed his mind on the plane trip here 
after reading news coverage in which he was criticized for not 
attending the conference while in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference later, Bush downplayed the political  
ramifications and said he wasn't trying to match McCain, who spoke 
and answered questions for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``My presence there hopefully reaches out and says I'll be an  
inclusive-type president,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates said they approved of Bush's decision to attend, but  
felt insulted by the brevity of his visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a community that can make or break most candidates,''  
asserted Art Norman, a TV anchorman in Chicago and a member of the 
National Association of Black Journalists. ``He should be here. He 
should not overlook us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he also made his last-minute decision after reading  
news coverage. After his speech Thursday, a conference delegate 
accused him of ``pandering.'' McCain denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was unhappy that the oversight had taken place, and I  
corrected it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Vietnam war hero and former POW, McCain told the story of an  
Hispanic Medal of Honor recipient to illustrate his respect for 
diversity in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all, Republican and Democrat, be working toward a  
new American unity,'' he said. Asked about affirmative action, 
McCain said he supports it, but only in the form of training and 
education programs that create ``an equal playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who spoke shortly before McCain, emphasized the  
difference between his appearance Thursday and those of the 
Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me just say at the beginning, I did not change my  
schedule,'' Bradley said to much applause and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator and professional basketball player  
said the defining moment in his life was being present as a 
spectator in the U.S. Senate when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the fundamental (motivations) for this candidacy is the  
push for racial unity,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is scheduled to attend the convention Friday and deliver a  
speech on ``Race, Technology and the Future of the United States.''

	Clinton Ending Poverty Tour  
</P>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. AP) -- President Clinton, ending a ``remarkable  
ride'' through poverty pockets from Appalachia to Watts, today	
called for investment in people in impoverished areas. ``They	
deserve a chance to be whatever they're willing to work hard to	
be,'' Clinton said. Clinton made the remarks at the annual	
conference of the National Academy Foundation, an organization that	
helps youths. Earlier, he visited the Los Angeles community of	
Watts, scarred by historic riots, to make the case for private	
firms helping disadvantaged young people.

	Rains Cause Las Vegas Flood; 2 Dead  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavy rains pounded the Las Vegas Valley today,  
turning streets into rivers. ``This is the worst flood in Las Vegas 
since at least 1984,'' said Ron McQueen, a meteorologist with the 
National Weather Service. Two deaths were blamed on the weather. 
Motorists were plucked from flooded vehicles by roaming fire trucks 
and, in at least one case, a police helicopter. The severe flooding 
turned sections of busy Interstate 15 into a lake, bringing traffic 
to a standstill. Tourists took shelter inside casinos. No casinos 
reported any major damage. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. May Help in Congo Peacekeeping  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will consider  
sending U.S. troops to Congo as part of a possible U.N. 
peacekeeping mission following the end of an 11-month civil war in 
the volatile region, a U.S. official said today. If American 
soldiers move into the Central African nation, it will be the first 
time the United States has engaged in peacekeeping duties in 
sub-Saharan Africa since 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in Somalia in 
1993. ``We are eager to be supportive,'' State Department spokesman 
James Foley said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Bernadine Healy was named today to head  
the American Red Cross. She is filling the post that Elizabeth Dole 
left to pursue a GOP presidential bid. Healy, a heart specialist,

A former head of the National Institutes of Health, she is now dean 
of the Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health.

here today after a supporter of the Yugoslav president fired 
gunshots into the air to disrupt the rally. Police did not 
interfere with the rally by about 4,000 demonstrators, the latest 
in a series of public protests demanding Milosevic step down. A 
scheduled counter-demonstration by government supporters failed to 
materialize.

	Retail Sales Up; Jobless Claims Off  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's biggest retailers reported  
surprisingly strong sales in June as the robust U.S. economy and 
warm weather sent Americans on a buying bonanza. The Merrill Lynch 
retail index, the investment firm's barometer of sales performance 
at department stores and discount chains, was up 6.3 percent. The 
Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for 
unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 last week to 294,000, the

<HEADLINE> Search Engines Lag Behind Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Internet search engines aren't keep pace with the explosive  
growth of the Web, researchers reported today in the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Their study found that search engines -- which enable a computer  
user to find information by typing in a word or combination of 
words -- cover a diminishing fraction of Web pages and take a long 
time to list new sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The most comprehensive engine, Northern Light, covers only about  
one-sixth of the Internet pages that search engines can reach, the 
study found. That is down from one-third for the best engine 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Light is closely followed by Snap and Altavista.  
Hotbot, which led with 34 percent coverage in the previous study, 
was down to 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that it takes more than six months on  
average for a new Web page to make it into a search engine's 
listings. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 11 search engines was conducted by computer  
scientists Steve Lawrence and C. Lee Giles at the NEC Research 
Institute in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence and Giles estimated that as of February, the searchable  
Web consisted of 800 million pages containing more than 6 trillion 
characters. Their December 1997 survey put the number of pages at 
about 320 million. By comparison, the 532 miles of shelves in the 
Library of Congress contain an estimated 20 trillion characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Search engines use computers called ``spiders'' that  
continuously surf the Web. They save each page they visit, then 
follow the links on the page to find other pages. When a user types 
in a word, the engine looks in its index to see which pages contain 
it. A page that's not listed in the index will not be found. 
</P>
<P>
	The spiders are more likely to find pages that have more links  
going to them from other pages. Lawrence said that may make it hard 
for new sites to make it into search engine listings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence also said search engines may be lagging because their  
databases become more expensive as they grow, without necessarily 
creating more advertising profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Krellenstein, chief technical officer at Northern Light,  
said he believes the fraction covered by the search engines is 
actually larger, because he considers the study's estimate of the 
size of the Web a bit high. 
</P>
<P>
	Krellenstein also questioned whether search engines need to  
concern themselves with every new site. He said they focus on good 
sites that are of more interest to users. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the Web is growing so fast doesn't mean the  
quality part is growing as fast,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Track Offers Drive Thru Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) -- Starting Friday, gamblers at Lone  
Star Park can play the horses the same way they buy Egg McMuffins -- 
at the drive-through on the way to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The four service lanes are in the track parking lot, just off  
Belt Line Road, a main thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just don't have time these days,'' said track spokesman  
Darren Rogers. ``This is just something that will make life a 
little easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lone Star is the nation's second thoroughbred track to offer  
drive-up windows, following Keeneland, a track in Lexington, Ky., 
that started similar service last year, Lone Star general manager 
Corey Johnsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The booths will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. on race days.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just drive right up and make your wagers and pay for them  
and off you go,'' Johnsen said. He promised face-to-face service, 
``no Jack tn the Box speakers or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One occasional bettor, Del Solis, said he likes the idea and is  
more likely to try his luck at the drive-through. ``Sometimes I 
can't be there when the race starts so this will make it easier,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Cox, executive director of the Texas Council on Problem and  
Compulsive Gambling, said the setup might make it a bit too easy 
for compulsive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to make it an impulse reaction as opposed to  
planned activity,'' she said. ``When it is a simple act to whip in 
and buy a ticket, it takes it out of the recreational category (of) 
capturing the beauty of animals and a real sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gamblers can also cash winning tickets at the windows. For  
security reasons, the most they can collect on a ticket at the 
window is $100. They will get a voucher to pick up the rest of 
their winnings inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely through smart marketing, the 2-year-old Lone Star has  
been Texas' most successful horse track. It was the first to offer 
cash machines for gamblers and has tried to make itself 
family-friendly, with a playground and picnic grounds.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Fined $250,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration levied a  
$250,000 civil penalty Thursday against American Airlines because 
airline employees and contractors repeatedly failed to display 
their badges in high-security areas at Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	American said the workers often stuffed the badges in their  
pockets while they worked in cramped quarters, such as the belly of 
a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said that wasn't good enough -- that unless security  
agents could see the badges, it might take too long to stop an 
unauthorized person from planting explosives in bags being loaded 
on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	American appealed a February 1998 decision by an administrative  
law judge to FAA Administrator Jane F. Garvey, who upheld the 
ruling in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said Thursday it would drop the matter and not take  
it to federal appeals court. ``We'll pay the civil penalty and move 
on,'' said American spokesman Tim Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made changes in terms of procedures,'' Smith said.  
``American continually works to ensure the safety of our system and 
passengers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the FAA said the agency would have no additional  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees and contractors were cited for not wearing their  
badges in a ``security identification display area'' where access 
is limited to protect against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	According to FAA documents, American unsuccessfully argued that  
the employees and contractors didn't have to wear their badges as 
long as they could produce them upon request. But the FAA 
administrator said the airline was incorrectly interpreting the 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline also complained that the penalty exceeded those of  
similar cases.

<HEADLINE> Dell European Chief Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp.'s top European executive has  
stepped down and will be replaced by Dell's president of 
Asia-Pacific operations, the company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation of Jan Gesmar-Larsen, 39, was due to personal  
reasons, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe is a critical market for the personal-computer maker, and  
first-quarter sales fell short of company expectations. Dell's 
European revenues grew by 29 percent in the first quarter, down 
from 62 percent in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to other areas, we would like to have seen higher  
growth,'' company founder and chief executive Michael Dell told 
analysts in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Gesmar-Larsen, a former Apple Computer executive, said Wednesday  
that Dell's results were better than the industry as a whole in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people would be proud of it,'' he told the  
Austin American-Statesman. ``I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gesmar-Larsen will be replaced by John Legere, president of  
Dell's Asia-Pacific region. Legere joined Dell last year after 18 
years at AT&AMP;T Corp.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- National League umpire Tom Hallion will serve  
his three-game suspension from July 19-21 rather than this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Torre: No Timetable For Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Joe Torre doesn't have a timetable for  
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as it's fun, I'm going to keep doing it,'' the New  
York Yankees manager said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who led the Yankees to a pair of World Series titles in  
his first three seasons, said during an interview Wednesday with 
Fox Sports News: ``I'm not thinking about doing this more than my 
contract,'' which runs through the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But a day later, he said he's going to take things year to year.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I decide I've had enough, I'll probably say, `This is my  
last year.' I can't project a couple of years down the road,'' 
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if that meant he'd stay at least through 2001, Torre  
said: ``I hope I make it to '01. Let's put it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who will turn 59 later this month, learned he had  
prostate cancer on March 9 after a blood test during a routine 
physical. He had surgery, and doctors said the cancer was caught 
early and his prognosis was good. Torre rejoined the team on May 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract was due to expire after this season, but Torre  
agreed in February to a two-year extension through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made no long-term plans after that,'' he said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees set a major league record last season with 125  
victories, including an AL-record 114 during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre hit .297 in a 17-year major league career and was a  
nine-time All-Star. In his 18th year as a manager, he is 
1,246-1,219 in stints with the New York Mets, Atlanta Braves and 
St. Louis Cardinals, as well as the Yankees.

<HEADLINE> New Look for All-Star Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds and Greg Maddux will  
be watching next week while Kent Bottenfield, Paul Byrd and B.J. 
Surhoff make their All-Star game debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	When the All-Stars rosters are read off Tuesday night at Fenway  
Park, many of the players will be getting their first introductions 
on baseball's biggest summer stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's every kid's dream who grows up playing baseball to be an  
All-Star, and certainly I was one of those kids,'' said 
Bottenfield, whose NL-leading 13 wins helped him get selected to 
his first All-Star team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three players in all will make their All-Star debuts next  
Tuesday, many taking the place of familiar names who have been 
slowed by injuries and ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Atlanta's Brian Jordan, who was helped by injuries that  
forced starter Tony Gwynn to skip the game and sidelined Bonds for 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking my family to Boston with me,'' Jordan said. ``We  
were planning a vacation to Florida, but we'll be happy to take 
this detour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds won't be there for the first time since 1991. Maddux has  
been at the All-Star game for five straight years. Other regulars, 
like Mo Vaughn, Alex Rodriguez and Kevin Brown, will also have a 
rare break before the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In their place are a bunch of newcomers, like Surhoff, whose 855  
RBIs in 13 seasons were the most by an active player not to make an 
All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Texas middle reliever Jeff Zimmerman, who sent faxes to all  
30 teams two winters ago just for the chance to try out. The 
Rangers were the only team to bite and Zimmerman has made the risk 
pay off, going 8-0 with an 0.89 ERA as a rare All-Star middle 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely the ultimate pinnacle to me. Just to be  
named to an All-Star team is unbelievable,'' Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	AL manager Joe Torre selected four Yankees and seven newcomers  
on Wednesday. NL manager Bruce Bochy will bring Padres pitchers 
Andy Ashby and Trevor Hoffman with him to Fenway Park, along with 
16 players who are used to getting three days off midway through 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians, who lead the majors in wins, led both  
leagues with six All-Stars. Shortstop Omar Vizquel and right-hander 
Charles Nagy joined four starters: first baseman Jim Thome, second 
baseman Roberto Alomar and outfielders Kenny Lofton and Manny 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy replaced Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who turned down his  
bid to tend to personal business at home in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion Yankees, snubbed by the voters for the  
second straight year, still have shortstop Derek Jeter, outfielder 
Bernie Williams and pitcher David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers have four: Zimmerman, first baseman Rafael  
Palmeiro, closer John Wetteland and starting catcher Ivan 
Rodriguez. A fifth Ranger, Juan Gonzalez, said he wouldn't play if 
he wasn't a starter and the AL honored his request. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Diamondbacks also have four All-Stars, followed  
by Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and San Diego with three each. 
The Padres' Tony Gwynn was elected by the fans but will miss the 
game with a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox should have two starters, shortstop Nomar  
Garciaparra, the fan's choice, and Pedro Martinez (15-2, 2.02 ERA), 
the likely starting pitcher. Second baseman Jose Offerman was 
selected as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the 30-man NL squad will make its All-Star  
debut next week, with 16 players suiting up for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 11 pitchers are All-Star rookies: Bottenfield, Byrd,  
Atlanta's Kevin Millwood and Houston's Jose Lima, Mike Hampton and 
Billy Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson and Philadelphia's Curt Schilling were  
also picked for the NL staff. San Francisco's Robb Nen was selected 
but will miss the game with a callous on his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy said he will pick another reliever, with Los Angeles' Jeff  
Shaw, the Mets' Armando Benitez and Cincinnati's Scott Williamson 
as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the NL reserves are catchers Mike Lieberthal of  
Philadelphia and catcher Dave Nilsson of Milwaukee; infielders Jeff 
Bagwell of Houston, Sean Casey of Cincinnati, Alex Gonzalez of 
Florida, Jeff Kent of San Francisco and Ed Sprague of Pittsburgh; 
and outfielders Jeromy Burnitz of Milwaukee, Luis Gonzalez of 
Arizona and Gary Sheffield of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the reserves, only Sheffield and Bagwell have been All-Stars  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The other AL reserves are Detroit catcher Brad Ausmus;  
infielders Ron Coomer of Minnesota, Tony Fernandez of Toronto and 
John Jaha of Oakland; and outfielders Shawn Green of Toronto and 
Magglio Ordonez of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the pitchers are Kansas City's Jose Rosado, Tampa  
Bay's Roberto Hernandez, Baltimore's Mike Mussina and Anaheim's 
Troy Percival. 
</P>
<P>
	The other AL starters are Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr.,  
Tampa Bay DH Jose Canseco and Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis' Mark McGwire and the Cubs' Sammy Sosa headline the NL  
starters. The lineup also includes Arizona's Matt Williams at third 
and Jay Bell at second, New York catcher Mike Piazza, Cincinnati 
shortstop Barry Larkin and Colorado outfielder Larry Walker.

<HEADLINE> Boy Convicted of Murdering Neighbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTOW, Fla. (AP) -- A teen-ager was found guilty Thursday of  
fatally bludgeoning and stabbing his 8-year-old neighbor and then 
stuffing her body into the frame of his waterbed. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted 15-year-old Joshua Phillips of first-degree  
murder in the death of Maddie Clifton, who lived across the street 
from him in a Jacksonville neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had urged jurors to convict the boy of manslaughter,  
saying the killing was not premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to act out of some form of vengeance,'' defense  
attorney Richard Nichols told jurors. ``We're not here to act as a 
bunch of well-dressed vigilantes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua showed no emotion as the verdict was read. Maddie's  
parents, Steve and Sheila Clifton, blinked back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddie disappeared Nov. 3, 1998, prompting a search of her  
Jacksonville neighborhood involving hundreds of volunteers. Her 
decomposing body was found seven days later stuffed in the frame of 
Joshua's water bed across the street from her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua's attorney argued that the Maddie's murder wasn't  
premeditated and urged jurors to convict him of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to act out of some form of vengeance,'' defense  
attorney Richard Nichols told jurors. ``We're not here to act as a 
bunch of well-dressed vigilantes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in his closing argument Thursday, the prosecutor, State  
Attorney Harry Shorstein, said Phillips ``made a conscious 
decision'' to kill Maddie. ``That's premeditated murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives testified during the trial that Joshua confessed to  
the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Joshua's story, he accidentally hit Maddie in the  
eye with a baseball while they were playing in his backyard. She 
began screaming, and he panicked, dragged the girl into his 
bedroom, where he hit her with a bat and then stabbed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence shows us there was an accident that deteriorated  
into panic and then murder,'' Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shorstein said Joshua's story was unlikely and suggested  
that the murder may have been sexually motivated. There was no 
blood on the ball, no blood in the yard and no dirt on Maddie's 
body or clothes. An autopsy showed Maddie was beaten over the head 
and stabbed at least 11 times in the chest and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua, who was 14 at the time, was tried as an adult. Since he  
is under 16, he cannot be sentenced to death in Florida. He could 
be sent to prison for life with no chance of parole.

<HEADLINE> Budget Surpluses, Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Watching all those forecasts of future budget  
surpluses roll onward and upward, the congressman called it 
amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as if every month there is a new projection, and I  
have a feeling if we wait long enough, it will be a zillion dollar 
surplus,'' said Rep. Vito Fonsella of New York's Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a Republican, and like his party's leaders, he doesn't  
want to wait to cut taxes. He told the House ``a big chunk of this 
so-called surplus'' should be used for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders want cuts of about $850 billion over the next  
10 years. The House Ways and Means Committee will start drafting a 
tax cut bill next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton has other plans, for increased spending on  
education, the environment, new retirement tax breaks, prescription 
drug benefits under Medicare and other programs. He has a more 
limited, targeted tax cut plan; and while he said he'd consider 
other proposals, Democrats are saying he'd veto the kind of tax 
cuts the Republicans want. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Republicans agree that Social Security revenues,  
which account for 95 percent of the surplus anticipated in the next 
budget year, should be off-limits, not to be tapped by borrowing 
for general government spending as has been the pattern in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security surplus is estimated at $1.9 trillion over  
the next decade, and both sides say that should be locked away, 
reducing the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	That narrows the field for the certain debate over how to use  
the rest of the surpluses, projected at about $1 trillion over the 
next 10 years. The president and congressional leaders are to meet 
next week to talk about the budget and the projected surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections are the key to all of this. Nobody doubts that there  
are going to be surpluses, but the detailed estimates stretching 
out for the next 15 years can only be educated guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers assume uninterrupted economic growth over the next  
decade, and political decisions that shrink federal spending, to 
stay within limits set by a 1997 budget agreement between Congress 
and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Early that year, the projection for 1999 was of a $117 billion  
budget deficit. Revenues went up unexpectedly, Clinton and Congress 
made their budget deal, and the estimate was cut to $52 billion. 
The latest estimate is of a $120 billion surplus when this budget 
year ends on Sept. 30. But all of that surplus is in Social 
Security revenues. The budget Congress shapes with appropriations 
each year will still be $4 billion in deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, the Congressional Budget Office projects a $14 billion  
surplus, but that comes with a caveat. It happens only if Congress 
enforces -- and Clinton signs -- cuts in domestic programs to abide 
by the 1997 caps. 
</P>
<P>
	Those limits squeeze spending options even more tightly in 2001  
and 2002, when they expire. The assumption that they will hold is a 
shaky one at best, particularly with defense spending headed up and 
a commitment already made to put more money into road building. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the surplus projections assume that Congress will  
hold spending increases within the rate of inflation through 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	That would require a decade of federal spending discipline never  
seen before. And some sort of political consensus to do it, 
spanning four congressional and two presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other variables. Wars and disasters cost money that  
can't be foreseen. The emergency appropriation Congress just passed 
lowers projected surpluses by $40 billion over the next 11 years, 
according to the Congressional Budget Office. And there certainly 
will be more emergency appropriations -- a designation that exempts 
them from the spending limits -- during the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything adds up to substantial surpluses well into the new  
century, with less certainty about how much, for all the 
projections that spell out totals long in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one political certainty. Clinton and most of the  
members of Congress debating what to do with the money will be long 
out of office before the projections come due and prove right or 
wrong.

	Heavy Rains Flood Las Vegas Streets  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavy rains poured on Las Vegas today, creating  
floods that smashed mobile homes, swallowed hundreds of cars and 
led to at least two deaths. ``It's a nightmare,'' said Nevada 
Highway Patrol spokesman Scott Flabi. ``It's one of the worst 
things I've ever seen.'' Sections of busy Interstate 15 resembled a 
lake, bringing traffic to a standstill. Most major intersections 
were under water. Block walls along a flood channel collapsed. 
Firefighters rescued motorists whose cars were sucked into the 
water.

	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan  
visited Sierra Leone today to drum up international assistance for 
a new peace accord that has come under attack for including amnesty 
for war criminals. The accord, signed by Sierra Leone President

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of kids committing and falling  
victim to crime has been dropping since 1993, according to a 
government report on the state of American children. The report 
painted an improving and mostly hopeful picture of children and 
teens, with vaccinations and preschool enrollment up and teen 
smoking and childbirth down. The entire report, issued by the 
Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, is

<HEADLINE> World Cup Succes Overwhelming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Title IX. The 1996 Olympics. The WNBA.  
</P>
<P>
	And now the Women's World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	All have been major steps in the progression of women's sports  
in the United States. Marla Messing, who has overseen the 
phenomenal success of the soccer tournament that concludes 
Saturday, isn't about to forget that. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither are the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing the impact of Title IX on the field,'' Messing  
said Wednesday. ``Not on the organization of the tournament, but on 
who is playing for the United States. These are Title IX babies. 
They are reaping the benefits of the legislation that has enabled 
them to play soccer their whole lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, when Title IX was passed in 1972, requiring that women  
be allowed to participate in athletics in the same proportion as 
their share of a school's undergraduate student body, exactly half 
of the U.S. team had been born. All of them would prosper from the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Title IX opened up opportunities for girls to play sports  
through college,'' Brandi Chastain said. ``By getting those 
opportunities, we've been able to show young girls that they can do 
what we have done, that the chance to do it is there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The '96 Olympics also contributed to the success of the World  
Cup. The biggest American stars in the Atlanta Games were the 
basketball, soccer and softball players and the gymnasts. The 
Olympics proved there was an audience for women's sports, and this 
tournament cultivated that audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest success story emanating from the achievements in  
Atlanta has been the WNBA, and Messing believes the basketball 
league has aided the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WNBA helped us be successful by showing the way as a  
(professional women's) league,'' she said. ``Hopefully our success 
will help other women's sports be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like a cultural shift, and the way the tournament  
caught fire, we've tipped into something. We think this will be a 
seminal moment, that people will look back in 20 years and say, 
`That event is responsible for the development of women's 
sports.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. But everyone involved in this event, which has sold  
more than 650,000 tickets and grabbed headlines in this nation 
rarely reserved for soccer, realizes the 1999 tournament could be 
an aberration. They don't want to believe it, but they can't ignore 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a hard act to follow, it is an impossible act to  
follow,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``We shouldn't be so 
foolish as to think this will happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the soccer community can build on what Messing and her  
co-workers have accomplished, which is remarkable in itself. 
Unquestionably, this has been the most successful women's sports 
events ever staged. Organizers spent more than $30 million, but 
will make a tidy profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, women's soccer has established itself as a  
coming sport -- perhaps not in countries where cultural and societal 
limitations are placed on what women can achieve, but certainly in 
many of the nations that participated. Led by the United States, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a stupendous tournament,'' Cooper said. ``It's the  
level of enthusiasm, which is partly due to the success of the 
American team and the media reaction. If others are smart, they 
should think this stuff is hot and learn from USA '99 and see how 
the game has gained respectability and popularity.''

<HEADLINE> Good Weather Hurts Grain, Soybeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell sharply Thursday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as continued ideal growing weather 
reinforced expectations farmers will harvest bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean prices collapsed to new lows, with corn  
settling below $2 a bushel for the first time in years, as major 
farm-growing states basked in ideal weather for producing optimal 
crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is predicting farmers will harvest 9.45 billion  
bushels of corn this year, but market participants now suspect the 
figure will rise close to or above 10 billion bushels. Farmers are 
expected to harvest a record 2.88 billion bushels of soybeans, and 
that figure also is expected to go higher unless crops are affected 
by an early frost. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have spiraled downward in recent months as investors note  
both U.S. and foreign inventories of corn and soybeans remain high 
despite recent increases in export activity. Corn available for 
immediate delivery has fallen to its lowest price since December 
1987, while soybeans are at their lowest levels since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts predict recovery in the entire farm sector will take a  
year or more, a fact that Thursday led the American Farm Bureau 
Federation to ask for $9 billion in new and previously announced 
disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.62 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 4 3/4 cents to $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans fell 7 1/4 cents to 
$4.15 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle and pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .23 cent to 62.12 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 76.45 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .43 cent to 46.07 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
.50 cent to 36.47 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Hits Truck, Derails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE LAKE, Texas (AP) -- An Amtrak train carrying 235 passengers  
struck a truck Thursday, derailing nine cars and injuring 18 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The eastbound Sunset Limited was traveling from Los Angeles to  
Orlando, Fla., when it hit the rig shortly before noon, Steven 
Taub, an Amtrak spokesman, said. Track was torn up and two engines 
and seven cars were off to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't that big of a bump,'' said Sally Brichler, 36, of  
Deltona, Fla., who was traveling with her daughters, ages 9 and 5. 
``A couple of big jolts. It didn't even knock the milk off our 
tray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said they heard the train's whistle blowing just  
before the collision with the truck, which was pulling a salt water 
tank. Some riders crawled through a window as smoke filled the 
cars. Screaming could be heard, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	An engineer and an engineer in training had to be pulled from  
the wreckage by rescuers who broke out the engine windshield. The 
engineer was listed in guarded condition with a head injury, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver was unharmed.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were investigating three possible charges  
against the driver, including failure to have a log book as 
required by law, improperly stopping on a railroad and for having 
bad brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	David Keith, administrator of the Rice Medical Center in Eagle  
Lake, said most of the injured had bumps, bruises or were suffering 
from heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we would consider serious,'' he said. ``A lot of them  
were shaken up. A lot of them were in tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Goggans, an assistant conductor on the train, said  
passengers were calm in the aftermath of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the brakes go into emergency before we actually hit,''  
he said. ``You just grab on. You don't know what to expect. We knew 
something was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no warning lights or gates at the rural crossing  
where the accident happened, about 62 miles west of Houston. About 
28 trains a day travel on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers gathered under trees to shade them from the  
90-plus-degree heat and school buses were being used to take them 
to Eagle Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the passengers were Cindy McCain, the wife of Sen. John  
McCain, and their 13-year-old son, Jack. They two, who were unhurt, 
were headed to Florida for a vacation, said McCain spokesman Howard 
Opinsky. The senator himself was on a plane, headed to Seattle for 
a speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunset Limited was involved in the worst accident in  
Amtrak's 28-year history. On Sept. 22, 1993, 42 passengers and five 
crew members died when the train went off a bridge into a bayou 
near Mobile, Ala. The bridge had been damaged minutes earlier when 
it was hit by a towboat. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Amtrak's City of New Orleans ran into a truck at a  
crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people and injuring more 
than 100.

<HEADLINE> `Time-Out for Diversity' Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- American newspapers have a way to go before they  
reflect the racial and cultural mix of their communities, but they 
say they're making headway in assessing the problem and deciding 
how to tackle it. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of newspapers around the country took a week in May to  
consider diversity of sources in news stories as an element of 
accuracy, in an exercise sponsored by the Associated Press Managing 
Editors and the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Their follow-up reports were distributed here Thursday at Unity  
'99, an eight-day conference for minority journalists that ends 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone will not get the need for diversity, but they do  
understand making their stories accurate,'' The Dallas Morning News 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The APME and ASNE are calling for a second ``Time-Out for  
Diversity and Accuracy'' in February -- this time including 
journalism schools and the electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring round of soul-searching involved more than 140  
newspapers as well as domestic bureaus of The Associated Press, 
Reuters, Gannett News Service and the Knight Ridder-Tribune 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the print organizations that signed on, 95 submitted  
follow-up reports -- 94 of them supporting the premise that 
diversity is essential to accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our newspapers are not inclusive enough to regularly  
portray the diversity of (their) communities, then we are 
presenting a fundamentally inaccurate report,'' said a statement by 
David Yarnold, managing editor of the San Jose Mercury News and 
APME diversity chairman, and Wanda S. Lloyd, his ASNE counterpart 
and news executive for planning at The Greenville News in South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y., noted that it  
formed a diversity committee that sifts through top stories of the 
day ``to spot opportunities for diversity and mainstreaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paper also changed the way it covered the city -- shifting  
from geographical areas to neighborhoods, and now has a reporter 
covering Rochester's large deaf community. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange County Register in California and Newsday, in  
Melville, N.Y., created beats covering some underrepresented 
communities and such issues as immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News Leader in Staunton, Va., offers a monthly $50  
bonus for the ``most consistent or most creative length a reporter 
or editor goes to in order to diversify our report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald has enlisted its marketing-promotions  
department ``to encourage minority organizations to help us tell 
their story,'' determining that ``we must take a proactive approach 
... rather than passively wait for them to seek us out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News hopes to continue community tours begun  
during the May time-out: ``We've made it a priority for our 
staffers to go out to areas where they don't live to meet some 
folks they don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evaluations turned up some missed opportunities and  
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some days showed a superb range of diverse sources,'' said The  
Des Moines Register in Iowa. ``Others seemed to rely heavily on 
administrative sources or white male news sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Examiner found a way to gauge its diversity  
effort: ``In a city that is now majority minority, we know that 
stories are not accurately portraying the community if they do not 
include Asian and Hispanic names.''

<HEADLINE> Palladium, Coffee Futures Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures fell sharply Thursday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade as continued ideal growing weather reinforced 
expectations farmers will harvest bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, palladium and coffee futures soared.  
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean prices collapsed to new lows, with corn  
settling below $2 a bushel for the first time in years, as major 
farm-growing states basked in ideal weather for producing optimal

for immediate delivery has fallen to its lowest price since 
December 1987, while soybeans are at their lowest levels since 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also sank to their lowest since the early 1970s as  
harvesting of the winter wheat crop picked up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts predict recovery in the entire farm sector will take a  
year or more, a fact that Thursday led the American Farm Bureau 
Federation to ask for $9 billion in new and previously announced 
federal disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.62 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 4 3/4 cents to $1.99 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans 
fell 7 1/4 cents to $4.15 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
amid heavy dealer buying tied to concern Russia will not make large 
shipments of the metal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While some market participants said Russia continues to make  
unannounced sales of the industrial metal to Western automobile and 
jewelry manufacturers, many investors continue to note the absence 
of long-term shipping contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also are concerned Russia will maintain a duty on  
metals exports that has halted most shipments since May. Russia 
accounts for nearly three-fourths of the world's palladium supply. 
</P>
<P>
	September palladium rose $9.85 to $331 an ounce. October  
platinum rose $3.80 to $352.20 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures surged on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York as investors bet cooler weather heading into Brazilian growing 
regions would last long enough to cause damage to young trees and 
coffee flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted, however, that cooler temperatures would  
not translate into freezing weather over the next six days. Coffee 
prices have been rising and falling in recent months as weather 
forecasts hint at the possibility of cold weather in Brazil, the 
world's largest producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has harvested bumper crops and is on track to produce  
another large one unless foul weather strikes during its winter 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices also were supported after the Association of  
Coffee Producing Countries, which accounts for 75 percent of world 
shipments, agreed to limit exports to 50 million bags a year 
through June 2001. Some analysts were skeptical, however, since 
many of the member countries regularly exceed their quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	September arabica coffee rose 2.35 cents to 96.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Asia Rejects UEFA Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Asian Football Confederation on Thursday  
rejected the offer from UEFA of a half berth in the 2002 World Cup 
finals and said again it would boycott qualifying for the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	AFC general secretary Peter Velappan said the 45 confederation  
delegates voted unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia has expressed its appreciation to UEFA and its president,  
Lennart Johansson, for so magnanimously giving half a seat to 
Asia,'' Velappan said. ``But as FIFA has not acceded to AFC's 
request for three seats plus two (co-hosts Japan and South Korea) 
... Asia is compelled to boycott 2002 qualifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Velappan said the AFC delegation would express its feelings to  
FIFA by walking out of the Extraordinary Congress on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was decided by all the delegates, who felt Asia has been  
shabbily treated on this issue and this was an unanimous 
demonstration of solidarity,'' Velappan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No comment. I have no comment for I have not been officially  
notified of this,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFC decision came only hours after UEFA's Executive  
Committee had unanimously supported Johansson's offer, on behalf of 
the European confederation, to give one half of one of its 15 
places in the finals to Asia.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Ballot-Label Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state Supreme Court struck down as  
unconstitutional Thursday a law that would have identified on 
voting ballots whether candidates supported term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 225, approved by 52 percent of voters in 1998,  
ordered California's legislators and congressional delegation to 
support a proposed U.S. constitutional amendment on term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed amendment would limit House members to three  
two-year terms, and senators to two six-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the proposition said politicians who did not  
support the amendment would have an inscription alongside their 
names on the ballot reading, ``Disregarded voters' instruction on 
term limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's unanimous ruling stated that the measure, with its  
coercive language, was an improper attempt to amend the U.S. 
Constitution. The Constitution states that only Congress and state 
legislatures can amend it. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 225 was scheduled to take statewide effect next  
year. It had already been used in a series of special elections in 
Alameda County, in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	It may have influenced the outcome of one close race, in which  
Green Party candidate Audie Bock upset former Oakland Mayor Elihu 
Harris for a state Assembly seat. Alongside the name of Harris, a 
Democrat, was the notation that he had declined to pledge to 
support term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonly known as the ``scarlet letter'' law because of the  
ballot brand, Proposition 225 was sponsored by a group called U.S. 
Term Limits as part of a nationwide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	An Arkansas law sponsored by the same group, limiting terms of  
the state's representatives in Congress, was ruled unconstitutional 
by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling invalidated similar laws elsewhere, including an  
initiative passed by California voters in 1992. Term limits for 
California legislators, approved by the voters in 1990, remain in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts in eight other states have struck down ``scarlet letter''  
laws on a variety of grounds, including free speech, voting rights 
and interference with the constitutional amendment process.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Leaders Suggest Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake Olympics leaders briefed board  
members today on $113 million worth of cuts to the $1.43 billion 
budget for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney and chief  
operating officer Fraser Bullock said the cuts will shrink a $300 
million shortfall to $187 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney was confident of raising enough money to cover the  
smaller shortfall. He has been traveling around the country to meet 
with potential corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their interest in the games is not shadowed by the scandal,''  
Romney told the SLOC board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the budget cuts, Romney said SLOC will add two full-time  
sales people to drum up sponsorships. ``One thing you never cut 
back on is the people knocking on doors selling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock emphasized that ``our first and foremost objective is to  
have great games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' cuts are expected to be adopted by trustees in  
September, lowering the budget to $1.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident we're not going to be leaving unpaid bills for  
taxpayers or anyone else,'' Romney told a press conference 
Wednesday. ``We're back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed cutbacks come after a dollar-by-dollar review of  
the budget, said Bullock, who also serves as its chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, Bullock said, was to slice everything but essential  
spending for athletes and to leave a legacy for Utah's youth. 
</P>
<P>
	The new budget would leave intact SLOC's $59 million repayment  
for sports facilities and a $40 million endowment for their 
operation after the games. It also would allow U.S. athletes to 
train at the Utah Winter Sports Park between now and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Although an uproar from athletes caused Romney to back off from  
his earlier suggestion that the Utah Winter Sports Park be closed 
at long stretches before the Olympics, the park will skip building 
renovations and equipment purchases to save more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC's managers came up with $169 million in cuts, but $56  
million of those are offset by added costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the additions corrected mistakes in the original budget  
written last year. It also includes such unforeseen costs as $5 
million in legal expenses because of the U.S. Justice Department's 
investigation of Salt Lake's bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of the bid committee, the predecessor to the SLOC,  
have been accused of spending lavishly on International Olympic 
Committee members during the city's quest for the games, sparking 
scandal and now reform in the Olympic world. The Justice Department 
has been investigating for more than seven months but has not 
brought criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune said today that the federal investigators  
have delivered the case to Justice Department prosecutors. The 
newspaper said the next phase could take weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to investigate,''Justice spokesman Brian Steel  
said. ``There is no timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget cuts being proposed by the SLOC leaders include items  
amounting to $72 million that they would like to restore if the 
money can be found. The budget keeps a $136 million contingency in 
case expenses are higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed cutbacks are diverse.  
</P>
<P>
	There would be no information booths for spectators unless some  
group in the community steps forward, and the SLOC would spend $5 
million less on opening, closing and other ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC would cut $2.3 million out of its budget for housing  
games officials, including a portion of IOC members' rooms, and 
$300,000 out of the opening IOC session before the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the number of test events -- athletic contests that give  
staffers a chance to practice -- will be cut from 56 to 52, and the 
full staff, including volunteers, will work at only 17 of those, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only those employees who need to learn from the games in Sydney,  
Australia next summer will attend, and when members of the Olympic 
community come to Utah, they can expect fewer dinners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the budget analysis has been good for pinpointing  
ways money doesn't need to be spent. For example, $5.4 million is 
proposed to be cut from the telecommunications budget, in part 
because a sponsor donated excess cellular phones that bus drivers 
can use rather than radios. 
</P>
<P>
	An expensive and sophisticated software program for tracking  
personnel, which has failed at two prior games, can be replaced 
with off-the-shelf business software, Bullock said. ``I said, 
'simplify, simplify, simplify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the cuts are proposed in two areas: getting  
rid of $38 million worth of inflation cushion and saving $30 
million in staff expenses, essentially 18 percent of what was 
budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the committee has not yet put a number on the  
proposed staff size, since volunteers -- many of them executives on 
loan -- will replace workers and some of the savings comes in hiring 
people later than planned. The SLOC had expected to employ 750 at 
games time. 
</P>
<P>
	On the revenue side, Bullock said staff is considering selling  
more tickets. At present, 55 percent of the 1.6 million event 
tickets will be up for sale after the world's Olympic community and 
media use 45 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Moroccan Sets New Mile Run Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj figures he can break the world  
record in the mile. His own record. The one he set Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan shaved 1.26 seconds off the 6-year-old mark of  
Noureddine Morceli when he outran Kenyan Noah Ngeny down the final 
straightaway to win in 3 minutes, 43.13 seconds at the Golden Gala 
track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have gone as low as 3:42 without the comeback of  
Ngeny, who distracted me in the final 150 meters,'' El Guerrouj, 
24, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan also went below Morceli's old record of 3:44.39,  
finishing second in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the 1997 world championship in the 1,500 at Athens,  
Greece, El Guerrouj did not set limits to his ambition after his 
record performance Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope God continues to give me strength because I want to be  
the strongest in the world at all distances between 1,500 and 
5,000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, who broke the world mark set by Morceli in the  
1,500 meters at Rome last year, plans to rest a week in Belgium 
before running the 1,500 in the next IAAF Golden League meet at 
Paris July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	By breaking one of track's most hallowed records, El Guerrouj  
stole the limelight from American sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Maurice Greene set a meet record of 9.85 seconds  
in the 100 meters, .06 seconds off the world mark he set at Athens 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson, running his first 200 meters in six weeks, beat  
Ato Boldon, who had been the fastest over the distance this season. 
Johnson also set a meet record, 19.93, and said he was just glad 
``because I'm healthy again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had missed the U.S. championships and the opening Golden  
League meet at Oslo, Norway, last week because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones extended her four-year unbeaten streak in the  
women's 200 with her second consecutive victory in the Golden 
League series and remained in the running for the $1 million 
jackpot, which she shared last year with El Guerrouj and distance 
runner Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia. The money is split among all 
athletes who win the same event in all seven Golden League meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other still in the running for the jackpot include Allen Johnson  
in the 110-meter hurdles, Wilson Kipketer in the 800, Erick Walder 
in the long jump, Bernard Barmasai in the 3,000 steeplechase, 
Gabriela Szabo in the women's 3,000 and Svetlana Masterkova in the 
women's 800. 
</P>
<P>
	The mile and the 100 meters do not count for the Golden League.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co's Can Minimize Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The tobacco industry is by no means backed into a  
corner as it tries to fend off possibly billions of dollars in 
damage awards, following a jury's verdict holding them responsible 
for making thousands of Florida smokers sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette makers have numerous legal options available to  
minimize the damage, and those defenses will emerge as the second 
phase of the massive class-action suit begins, legal experts said 
Thursday. Their fight could push back any final ruling from the 
jury on monetary damages for weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first class-action lawsuit by smokers to go to trial, the  
jury on Wednesday said five tobacco companies engaged in ``extreme 
and outrageous conduct'' in making a defective product that causes 
emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next phases, the jury is to decide how much to award the  
lawsuit's nine original plaintiffs. The judge also must deal with 
the complex process of hearing claims of the other members of the 
class, which could number up to 500,000 sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of complicated stuff here,'' Stephan Landsman, a  
law professor at DePaul University, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest threat to the suit is the industry's demand  
that the class action be decertified, meaning that the nine smokers 
who have sued would be barred from representing thousands of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts who folllow tobacco stocks for Wall Street securities  
firms anticipate the case will be decertified, noting Florida is 
the lone state to allow a class-action lawsuit by smokers to reach 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may take months,'' said David Adelman, a tobacco analyst  
for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``It's going to be thrown out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in 1994 and certified as a class action two  
years later by a Florida appeals court. Circuit Judge Robert Kaye, 
who presided over the trial, will hold a hearing on the issue later 
this month, but is not expected to dissolve the class, meaning an 
appeal to higher courts is a near certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Most courts thus far have rejected such class actions, saying  
that the reasons for smoking and the diseases are too different to 
bundle all smokers together. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a class-action suit by  
six smokers in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Union health funds have filed class-action suits in 38 states.  
At least nine have been thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Louisiana Supreme Court in February upheld a class  
of smokers and ex-smokers seeking money for medical testing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami-Dade County Circuit Court Thursday, attorneys and the  
judge discussed when to start the next phase of the case, in which 
evidence will be heard on the health damage suffered by the nine 
main plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the earlier phase, tobacco company lawyers will be  
able to argue that these smokers bear personal responsibility by 
assuming the risk of smoking, knowing it wasn't healthful. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the jury has already sided with the smokers, that defense  
may fail, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to go into that case feeling sorry for the  
tobacco companies or even liking them,'' said Robert H. Alexander, 
Jr., co-chairman of the American Bar Association's product 
liability committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still appropriate though for plaintiffs to be (held)  
responsible for creating the situation they're complaining about. 
It's a matter of how receptive the jury is to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs told Judge Kaye Thursday they will be ready for  
the next phase in two weeks. The tobacco attorneys requested two 
months. Kaye could set the start date on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida plaintiffs want at least $200 billion in damages.  
Named as defendants are the nation's five biggest cigarette makers 
and two industry groups: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett 
Group Inc., as well as the Council for Tobacco Research and the 
Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Solar Wind Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Particles streaming out from the sun catch a  
magnetic wave and surf across the solar system at almost two 
million miles an hour, a speed twice as fast as experts had 
predicted, according to new measurements from satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The high speed flow from the sun, called the solar wind, has  
been a mystery to scientists for 37 years because they expected the 
particles to poke along at a mere one million miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	New measurements by two science satellites have solved the  
puzzle, researchers said Thursday, by showing that the solar wind's 
speed is boosted by magnetic waves that spiral out from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solar wind is accelerated out of the sun by magnetic waves  
in much the same way a surfer rides the waves to the shore,'' said 
John L. Kohl of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings have revolutionized our understanding of the  
sun's outer atmosphere and the solar wind,'' said George Withbroe, 
a director in NASA's office of space science. 
</P>
<P>
	The solar wind is composed of electrically charged particles --  
atoms and electrons -- constantly flowing from the sun's outer 
atmosphere, or corona. The one-to-two million degree heat of the 
corona strips electrons from oxygen and hydrogen atoms, creating 
the charged particles. The stream of gas and electrons streak 
across the solar system, blasting unprotected planets, and racing 
outward into deep space, reaching a point, experts say, about nine 
billion miles from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnetic field surrounding the Earth protects it from the  
erosion of the solar wind, but most other planets are not as lucky. 
Experts, for instance, believe it was the solar wind that stripped 
away any atmosphere from Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solar wind is staggering in size. Every eight hours, the  
sun puts out gas equal to all of the gases in the Earth's 
atmosphere,'' said Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had speculated about the solar wind, but its  
existence was not confirmed until the Mariner spacecraft took 
measurements in 1962, the same year that John Glenn made his first 
spaceflight. But the experts were surprised when the Mariner found 
the speed of the winds was twice as fast as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the high-speed mystery was solved with the help of a  
robot spacecraft hauled into orbit aboard the space shuttle that 
returned John Glenn to space last October. 
</P>
<P>
	The solution came from measurements taken by the Spartan 201  
spacecraft, carried into orbit by the shuttle, and by the SOHO, a 
sun-observing spacecraft jointly owned by NASA and the European 
Space Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartan and SOHO instruments detected oxygen and hydrogen  
atoms spiraling along vibrating magnetic fields that stream out 
from the corona. The atoms pick up speed from the push of the 
wavelike motion of the magnetic fields, Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two solar diameters out from the sun's outer atmosphere, the  
oxygen atoms are traveling at more than a million miles an hour, 
said Leonard Strachan, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory. He said the hydrogen atoms travel at a 
lower speed, about 600,000 miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the solar wind reaches the vicinity of the Earth, he  
said, it is traveling at more than 500 miles per second, almost two 
million miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	To illustrate this speed, Strachan said it takes the shuttle  
about 90 minutes to orbit the Earth. The oxygen atoms in the solar 
wind, he said, could complete an Earth orbit in one minute.

<HEADLINE> Stride Rite Chairman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- After just six months on the job, the  
chairman and chief executive officer of the Stride Rite Corp. 
resigned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I disagree with the board about the direction of change  
in the company, as a shareholder, I wish Stride Rite only the best 
in the future,'' James A. Eskridge said in a prepared statement 
released by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskridge had been named the footwear maker's chief in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Stride Rite officials denied any directional change at the  
footwear company, best known for its Keds sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've basically been on a track to grow the brands that we  
own,'' including Sperry Top-Sider, Tommy Hilfiger and Nine West 
Kids, said John Kelliher, the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelliher declined to say if the departure was amiable.  
</P>
<P>
	Eskridge came to the company from Mattel Inc., where he held a  
number of managerial positions. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stride Rite searches for a new CEO, Myles J. Slosberg,  
whose grandfather started the business in 1918, will be the 
company's interim head. 
</P>
<P>
	Slosberg has been a member of Stride Rite's board since the  
early 1960s and ran various divisions until his retirement in the 
mid-1980s, when he began a second career as a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane M. Sullivan, who headed up the children's business for  
several years, has been elected as company president and chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanna M. Jacobson, who just last month resigned in order to  
spend more time with her young children, will stay on an interim 
basis as vice chairman during the transition periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson, who joined Keds in 1996 to boost the then-struggling  
label, plans to serve as a consultant once the transitions are 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Stride Rite fell $1.87 1/2, or 18 percent, to $8.56 1/4 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Skeptical of Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- NBA players ended their union meeting  
Thursday opposed to an age restriction and skeptical that proposed 
rules changes will lead to an increase in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we're not going to accept an age limit,''  
said Brent Barry of the Chicago Bulls, a member of a six-man union 
committee formed to address the issue of players as young as 18 
coming into the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also formed another committee to respond to the  
proposed rules changes for the 1999-2000 season. One new rule would 
give a player 5 seconds to pass or shoot. Another would limit most 
defensive contact on the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players said the changes ignored the root of the problem  
that has caused the trend toward low-scoring games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us are old enough to remember 120-point games,'' said  
40-year-old Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic, who entered the 
league in 1981. ``From what we've seen of these new rules, they're 
barking up the wrong tree. There's a false hope if they think this 
is going to change the pace of the game. We're not in desperate 
need of rules changes, we need a fresh approach to the offensive 
style of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main issues at the union's annual meeting was whether  
there should be a minimum age for NBA players. About 50 players 
attended, and Thursday's five-hour session was the longest of the 
three-day conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The players also voted Thursday that no player, from the  
lowest-paid rookie to the highest-paid superstar, will be exempt 
from paying the so-called escrow tax -- up to 10 percent of their 
paychecks -- to the owners in the final three years of the current 
six-year collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a tax will kick in if owners pay more than 55 percent of  
basketball-related income to the players in the 2000-01 season. 
</P>
<P>
	A side letter to the labor agreement calls for extended  
negotiations on the issue of college underclassmen and high school 
players entering the league, a trend that has increased 
considerably in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA Commissioner David Stern has called for a minimum age  
requirement, perhaps 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want an absolute limit,'' said Michael Curry of the  
Milwaukee Bucks. ``We want something that's fair to those who are 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players threw out several ideas, saying the league could form  
some sort of minor league system similar to the one in baseball so 
that younger players can develop their games rather than sitting on 
the ends of NBA benches. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one player called for mandatory college education  
programs for players entering the NBA out of high school. Another 
proposed a mentor program using retired players who want to stay 
involved in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a one-rule-for-everyone answer,'' Schayes said.  
``We need a system with the right alternatives for the right 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schayes and union delegates Herb Williams, 41, and Eddie  
Johnson, 40, have been around long enough to see the league go from 
the high-octane, run-and-gun style of the early 1980s to the 
defensive-oriented, offensively-challenged style of the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was a member of a special 16-member NBA committee that  
discussed proposed rules changes in June. At that meeting, Miami 
Heat coach Pat Riley proposed eliminating the 3-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Most players said the new 5-second rule and the defensive  
hands-off rule could merely end up causing more fouls, more free 
throws and less free-flowing action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played for a team in Denver that didn't have a single  
24-second violation all season,'' Schayes said. ``Defenses had much 
more leeway then, and we were still able to score. What's happened 
is that teams now play their hardest on defense and rest on 
offense. We want to look for ways to reinvigorate the pace.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Trial's Trainer is Happy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yagli won't be in the Bowling Green Handicap on  
the grass Saturday at Belmont Park, much to the delight of Lou 
Goldfine, trainer of Federal Trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best,'' Goldfine said of Yagli. ``From now on, we  
want to avoid him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trial is not bad, either.  
</P>
<P>
	He was switched to the grass last fall, and in his last three  
starts he won the Canadian Turf Handicap at Gulfstream Park and the 
Hialeah Turf Cup, then ran a strong second to Yagli in the 1 1/4-mile 
Manhattan Handicap on June 5 at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some horses have to have a fast pace in front, and some must  
have the lead,'' Goldfine said Thursday when six horses were 
entered for the 1 3/8-mile race. ``He's versatile. It's a big 
advantage. I'd be very disappointed if he didn't run a good race on 
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trial will be co-highweighted at 118 pounds with Parade  
Ground, fourth in the Manhattan. Robbie Davis will ride Federal 
Trial, and Shane Sellers will be aboard Parade Ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the $150,000 Bowling Green are Chorwon, 115, Calvin  
Borel; Honor Glide, 113, Jose Santos; Fahris, 113, Richard 
Migliore; and Heavens East, 111, Mike Smith

<HEADLINE> Sting Beat Rockers 75-62 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Sting combined a  
record-setting 3-point performance by Dawn Staley with dominating 
work on the boards to overpower the lowly Cleveland Rockers 75-62 
on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Staley hit a club-record five of her six 3-point attempts and  
wound up with 22 points and five assists, leading the Sting to 
their fourth victory in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte, which made a franchise-record nine of 13 3-pointers,  
also got 13 points and eight rebounds from Vicky Bullett and seven 
boards apiece from Charlotte Smith and Andrea Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sting (5-5) had a 34-19 rebounding advantage over a  
Cleveland team that came in with a WNBA-worst record of 2-10 and a 
league-low scoring average of 64 points. The Rockers' rebound total 
was the lowest this season for a Charlotte opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockers, who never led, lost their fourth game in a row and  
fell to 0-7 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva Nemcova had 11 points and Janice Braxton 10 for the Rockers,  
who completed a four-game road trip in which they were outscored by 
a combined 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to their inside problems, the Rockers lost point  
guard Suzie McConnell Serio to foul trouble just past the midway 
stage of the first half. Cleveland turned it over six times the 
rest of the half, clearing the way for the Sting to go up by as 
many as 10 on the way to a 31-24 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Staley hit four 3-pointers to help Charlotte stretch its lead to  
13 less than nine minutes into the second half. The Sting's biggest 
lead was 17 in the closing minutes.

<HEADLINE> Japan Cabinet OKs Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Cabinet approved a sweeping plan today to  
transform the way Japan does business -- loosening restraints on 
competition, reducing government influence, and gearing the 
capitalist system to serve consumers, not producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, issued amid Japan's worst recession since World  
War II, reflect a new consensus among officials and normally 
intransigent bureaucrats that things must change, said Economic 
Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future Japan should not be led by government initiative  
but by competition of free individuals,'' Sakaiya said. ``It will 
be a different economy than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are dictated by necessity. Record unemployment, a  
spiraling budget deficit and nine years of economic doldrums leave 
no doubt the economic system needs an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even measures seen unfeasible three years ago, two years ago,  
last year are being implemented,'' said Sakaiya, promoting the plan 
to make markets more efficient, expand consumer options and give 
better returns to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya said the biggest change is in the role of bureaucrats,  
who during the 1980s were credited with engineering an economic 
miracle by focusing resources on strategic industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will no longer actively pick the economy's  
winners and losers, nor coddle endangered industries. It will now 
leave most of that to markets and private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the plan is as short on details as it is sweeping in  
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed for specifics, Sakaiya pointed to current deregulation  
of the financial sector and said a dozen action plans were in the 
works for some undetermined date. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that Thursday's report would not die as similar  
recommendations had before in the face of bureaucratic resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report ... is a Cabinet decision,'' Sakaiya said.  
``Therefore, this report has set the fundamental direction of 
future policy and is binding on all agencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines come after unemployment hit a record of 4.8  
percent in March and April, though it eased to 4.6 percent in May. 
In another optimistic sign, consumers are already buying more 
computers and compact cars and plan to travel more this summer, 
according to a survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is struggling with its deepest recession in 50  
years, and total government debt has outstripped Japan's $4 
trillion economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has earmarked more than $500 billion this year  
for tax cuts, spending on roads and bridges and other measures to 
stimulate the economy. Government spending helped push Japan's 
gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and services 
produced within its borders -- up 1.9 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Japan's Cabinet approved $4.25 billion  
supplementary budget to create 720,000 new jobs by subsidizing 
companies and nonprofit organizations to hire workers who have lost 
jobs during the recession.

<HEADLINE> Monte Wants Tyson, Who Doesn't? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Heavyweights, good, bad and mediocre, used to hope to get a  
fight against Mike Tyson because it got them attention and their 
biggest paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they want Tyson, not only for the celebrity and the money,  
but because his iron cloak of intimidation turns out to be made of 
cloth. 
</P>
<P>
	One who wants to fight Tyson when the former undisputed champion  
comes back yet again, probably in October, is Monte Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike ought to give me an opportunity, just like someone gave  
him an opportunity,'' Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	It, however, is not going to happen for the 28-year-old New  
Yorker with a 20-0 record and a gift of gab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not now,'' said Shelly Finkel, a Tyson advisor. ``Monte's a  
sweet kid. I know him, but it's too early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it is. Barrett didn't turn pro until he was 25, and he  
could use seasoning against tougher competition than he has yet 
met. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Francois Botha proved Tyson, who turned 33  
June 30, is very vulnerable at this stage of his career. Botha got 
knocked out by a perfect right-hand punch in the fifth round Jan. 
16, but until then he made Tyson look small and slow. 
</P>
<P>
	So it might not be good business at this time to match a hungry  
fighter, who is 6-foot-3 and a good athlete, against Tyson, who 
cannot afford to lose. Nor can the money men behind him afford to 
have him lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Tyson, Barrett also has a promotional deal with America  
Presents. The promoter, of course, has a lot more money tied up in 
Tyson, who also has deals with Showtime and the MGM Grand at Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The affable Barrett, married with three children, took up boxing  
at age 21 and says he'll be out of it by age 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to have more kids and I want to enjoy life,'' Barrett  
said. Once into boxing, however, a lot of guys have had trouble 
getting out. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett competed in basketball, baseball, gymnastics (floor  
exercises) and football at John Adams High School in Queens and was 
a good enough linebacker to be offered scholarships to Grambling, 
East Carolina and Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a Prop 48 and I went Westchester Community College for a  
year,'' Barrett said. ``Then they dropped football and I dropped 
out and went to work full time in construction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day Barrett was lifting weights, he said, ``and this guy was  
hustling guys in the gym, telling them give me $15 a day, I'll 
teach you how to box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett started in amateur boxing under 83-year-old trainer Al  
Davis, who, with Jimmy Glenn, trains him as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	After posting a 37-3 record, with 24 knockouts, Barrett turned  
pro in September 1996 under the management of Joe DeGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he was preparing to become a pro, he was introduced  
to promoter Don King. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said King offered him a $70,000-$80,000 contract, a  
condo and a salary of $900 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the length of the contract, Barrett said, ``Forever.''  
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said that on his wedding day June 7, 1995, King flew him  
to Ohio to meet Tyson at his boxing camp at Orwell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about people we know and about boxing,'' Barrett  
said of the meeting. ``We played basketball. He was putting dents 
in the backboard, but they (the shots) weren't going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shot Monte Barrett wants is one at Tyson in the ring.

<HEADLINE> Stride Rite Chairman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- After just six months on the job, the  
chairman and chief executive officer of the Stride Rite Corp. is 
stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I disagree with the board about the direction of change  
in the company, as a shareholder, I wish Stride Rite only the best 
in the future,'' James A. Eskridge said Thursday in a prepared 
statement released by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskridge had been named the footwear maker's chief in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Stride Rite officials denied any directional change at the  
footwear company, best known for its Keds sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've basically been on a track to grow the brands that we  
own,'' including Sperry Top-Sider, Tommy Hilfiger and Nine West 
Kids, said John Kelliher, the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelliher declined to say if the departure was amiable.  
</P>
<P>
	Eskridge came to the company from Mattel Inc., where he held a  
number of managerial positions. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stride Rite searches for a new CEO, Myles J. Slosberg,  
whose grandfather started the business in 1918, will be the 
company's interim head. 
</P>
<P>
	Slosberg has been a member of Stride Rite's board since the  
early 1960s and ran various divisions until his retirement in the 
mid-1980s, when he began a second career as a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane M. Sullivan, who headed up the children's business for  
several years, has been elected as company president and chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanna M. Jacobson, who just last month resigned in order to  
spend more time with her young children, will stay on an interim 
basis as vice chairman during the transition periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson, who joined Keds in 1996 to boost the then-struggling  
label, plans to serve as a consultant once the transitions are 
complete.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Truckers End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- More than 200,000 Argentine  
truckers began returning to work today, ending a nationwide strike 
that disrupted shipments of everything from food to gas to 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis eased late Wednesday when Argentine lawmakers agreed  
to delay the start of a controversial new tax on cars, trucks and 
other vehicles until November -- weeks after the country's 
presidential election in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The 98-81 vote by the lower house of Congress came on the third  
day of the strike, in which long caravans of trucks parked 
alongside key highways and refused to deliver goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial tax -- up to 1.5 percent of the value of their  
vehicles -- was adopted earlier this year in an attempt to raise 
$700 million for much-needed increases in teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Disgruntled drivers said the new tax amounted to an unfair  
burden of thousands of dollars on their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
	No major violence was reported from the three-day strike in  
which drivers slowed traffic but did not block highways outright. 
There were reports of scattered incidents, however, with one truck 
carrying dairy goods shot at Tuesday night and a driver of a 
delivery van punched by a group partially blocking a road. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day stoppage slowed or halted deliveries of gasoline,  
milk and other foodstuffs in some areas, but shipments were back to 
normal on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Carlos Menem's government suggested he could go so far  
as to declare a state of siege if the strike had persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of wrangling, congressional lawmakers voted to  
postpone the deadline for paying the vehicle tax until Nov. 15. 
Senate approval was expected to follow, but was considered 
virtually a formality. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina has been weathering a recession and continues to  
battle high unemployment, which is 12.4 percent and climbing.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Loiselle Has Elbow Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates reliever Rich Loiselle had  
reconstructive right elbow surgery Thursday and will miss the rest 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Loiselle, who had 29 saves as a rookie in 1997, threw three  
times on the sidelines last week but had pain each time. He was 
forced to cut short his final workout due to the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed by Dr. James Andrews, the Birmingham,  
Ala., specialist who has operated on a number of major league 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Loiselle, 27, began the season as the Pirates' closer, but lost  
the job a week into the season. He was 3-2 with a 5.28 ERA, 14 
strikeouts and nine walks in 15 games before going on the disabled 
list May 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates hope Loiselle can pitch again by the start of next  
season.

<HEADLINE> Police Must Learn Court Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers who pulled  
over a speeding car had no idea a backseat passenger was carrying 
drugs in her purse. But they ended up looking inside it anyway, a 
search now condoned by the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling is part of an annual summer ritual in which police  
departments across America are detailing for officers the Supreme 
Court's latest ``dos'' and ``don'ts'' of their work -- guidelines 
that become part of the fabric of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wyoming troopers had noticed a hypodermic syringe in the  
driver's shirt pocket, and he admitted having used it to take 
drugs. That sparked a search of the whole car. This spring, the 
nation's highest court said the purse search was legal even though 
police had no reason to suspect the passenger of any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In the court's recently ended 1998-99 term, police won some and  
lost some. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court defines the constitutional boundaries that have to  
be respected whenever the police interact with citizens,'' said 
Steven Shapiro, national legal director of the American Civil 
Liberties Union. ``The court's role is to tell police when they 
have crossed a line they cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen McSpadden, general counsel of the National Association  
of Police Organizations, added, ``Police look to the court for 
clear-cut rules'' at the intersection of individual rights and 
societal safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Television and the movies have taught generations of Americans  
about the court's most famous ruling on police procedure, a 1966 
decision called Miranda vs. Arizona that said police must warn 
criminal suspects of their rights to remain silent and have a 
lawyer's help before questioning them. 
</P>
<P>
	McSpadden said efforts are underway to familiarize law  
enforcement officers with the court's relevant latest decisions. 
They included these: 
</P>
<P>
	--If police have reason to believe a car's driver has committed a  
crime, may they search the possessions of all passengers in that 
car? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
	--May police generally search motorists and their cars after  
ticketing them for routine traffic violations? No. 
</P>
<P>
	--Can police let TV camera crews and other news media accompany  
them when they enter someone's home to conduct a search or make an 
arrest? No. 
</P>
<P>
	--Can police tell people loitering with known street gang members  
to move on, and arrest them if they refuse? No. 
</P>
<P>
	--May police, acting without court warrants, seize someone's car  
from a public place if they believe it was used for a crime? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's at work here is that a court generally deferential to  
law enforcement is not about to let states or communities give 
unbridled discretion to individual officers,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important law-enforcement victory came in the Wyoming  
decision, one liberals criticized but McSpadden called ``an example 
of the court's sensitivity to the needs of everyday law 
enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects against  
unreasonable police searches and seizures, generally requires 
police to obtain court warrants. But the Supreme Court since 1925 
has carved out numerous exceptions when police targets are in 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The most publicized law-enforcement setback came when the court  
struck down a Chicago ordinance that allowed police to break up 
groups of loiterers if one or more were recognized as street gang 
members, and to arrest those who refused to move along. In the 
three years it was enforced, the ordinance resulted in 45,000 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	McSpadden said the law was ``clearly overbroad because it swept  
in innocent individuals who had no connection with gang activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our people tell us the ordinance was an effort by Chicago's  
elected officials to pump up the statistics on the city's anti-gang 
efforts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro said the Chicago ordinance ``simply went too far'' and  
let some police officers engage in ``racial profiling'' -- treating 
someone as a criminal suspect based on nothing more than skin 
color. 
</P>
<P>
	David Strauss, a University of Chicago law professor and  
police-procedure expert, said the most recent Supreme Court 
decisions are typical of the current court, which unlike courts led 
by late Chief Justices Earl Warren and Warren Burger, has no fixed 
criminal-justice agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Warren court of the 1960s was intent on cleaning up what  
they saw as police abuses, and the Burger court of the 1970s and 
1980s waged a campaign to make things easier for law enforcement,'' 
Strauss said. ``This court is mildly sympathetic to the needs of 
law enforcement but prepared to say crime-fighting efforts went too 
far.''

<HEADLINE> Lighthouse Nears Ocean-Safe Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Cape Hatteras Lighthouse has made most of  
the move from its old perch on a badly eroded beach ahead of 
schedule. It will take several more weeks for it to settle in at 
its new home. 
</P>
<P>
	Movers still must slide the lighthouse a final 5 feet of the  
2,900-foot trip, then ease it on rails over a concrete pad that 
will be part of the new foundation. A contractor said today that 
crews worked late Wednesday and probably will spend today getting 
the pad ready to receive its huge occupant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 208-foot tower, the tallest brick lighthouse in the United  
States, was moved about 151 feet on Wednesday. Workers spent most 
of the day surveying the final distance and laying wooden supports 
for the moving rails over the foundation. Until this point, the 
rails rested on a gravel roadway built for the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next two months, crews will build a new foundation of  
up to 140,000 bricks for the spiral-striped tower. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday, movers had not yet decided whether the lighthouse  
will be pushed over its new base on Friday or Monday -- ending its 
move to a safer spot 1,600 feet from the rough Atlantic surf. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service decided to spend $10 million to move  
the 4,800-ton landmark before it tumbled into the sea. Some feared 
the move might cause the 129-year-old brick tower to crack or fall 
over, but the lighthouse appeared to be in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was expected to take four to six weeks, but it took  
only three. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse once guided ships in the treacherous waters off  
Cape Hatteras, known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Electronic 
and satellite navigation have superseded its beacon, though the 
light still burned nightly until it was extinguished March 1 for 
the first time since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service plans to relight the lighthouse on  
Labor Day and open it to the public again next Memorial Day.

<HEADLINE> Elite Pros Skipping Milwaukee Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Like the city in which it is played, the  
Greater Milwaukee Open is working-class and relatively unglamorous 
-- and the working-class, unglamorous golfers in its field like it 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour's elite players almost never visit Brown Deer Park, the  
public course on which the 32-year-old tournament has been played 
since 1994. The GMO, as the event is widely known, is a chance for 
golf's second-tier players to fatten their wallets and hone their 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Through schedule changes, venue changes and a yearly struggle to  
attract a topflight field, the event, which begins today, has 
survived and thrived. Tournament director Dan Croak said ticket 
sales are better than last year, and the purse is a record $2.3 
million, with the winner taking home $414,000. 
</P>
<P>
	This year the event was bumped from its traditional Labor Day  
weekend slot to mid-July on the tour schedule, to follow the 
Western Open in suburban Chicago during the tour's summer sweep of 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great time to have a golf tournament in Wisconsin,''  
Croak said. ``We were very pleased with the adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, next week's event is the British Open, one of golf's  
four majors. Many pros like to take the week off, or travel to the 
British Isles early to combat jet-lag and work on their games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GMO refuses to see the scheduling move as a setback.  
Croak noted that the tournament's results now count in the Ryder 
Cup points standings, which determine the field for the biennial 
showdown of the world's top golfers. Previously, Ryder Cup teams 
already were named before the tournament was played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our field is better this year than it was last year, and I  
think it's partly due to the fact the tournament is more important 
to golfers now,'' Croak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prominent golfers have visited Brown Deer. Tiger Woods  
made his professional debut here in 1996, and John Daly and Vijay 
Singh both have played in Milwaukee recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest name in the 1999 field is Minnesota native Tom  
Lehman, who is ranked 25th in the world but hasn't won in America 
since 1996. Only two players who have won on tour this year, Carlos 
Franco and Duffy Waldorf, will play. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Jeff Sluman will return, but the galleries'  
sentimental favorite again this year likely will be Steve Stricker 
from Madison, Wis., who was the runner-up to Sluman at the GMO last 
year and finished fifth at last month's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricker's caddie will be his wife, Nicki. Last year she was too  
busy to tote her husband's bag; she was giving birth to their first 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain golfers on tour wouldn't miss Milwaukee for the world.  
Mark Calcavecchia has played in the last 18 GMOs, while Loren 
Roberts -- who plays so well in the tournament, fellow pro Skip 
Kendall once called it ``the Loren Roberts annuity'' -- has been 
here each year since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have players who are very loyal to us because we put on a  
good show, and we take care of the players,'' Croak said. ``That's 
the only secret to getting players to play in your event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Maginnes will play in the GMO a week after his caddie,  
Garland Dempsey, collapsed during the third round of the Western 
Open. Dempsey is still hospitalized, and tournament officials 
weren't sure Tuesday who would carry Maginnes' bag.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Meets With Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Unable to ease public fears, Los Alamos  
National Laboratory canceled plans Thursday to release a common 
strain of bacteria into the atmosphere to test new biowarfare 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents who attended a public meeting Wednesday night in  
White Rock, about 10 miles downwind from the test site, said they 
were worried about the possible dangers. White Rock has a 
population of about 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Cobb, the lab's associate director for threat reduction,  
said Thursday that the tests were ``provably safe with a high 
degree of scientific certainty,'' but that he decided to cancel 
them because ``maintaining the trust and confidence of our 
neighbors is essential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the bacterium, Bacillus globigii, is a  
harmless organism found in root vegetables such as potatoes and 
carrots. It was intended to serve as a stand-in for deadly bacteria 
such as anthrax in a test of the toaster-size detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The laboratory said that to prove the detectors work under  
real-world conditions, they must be tested outdoors, where the air 
contains dust, pollen and other contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those at the meeting said they distrust the lab and were  
afraid they would be part of some secret biological experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's so safe, why don't you release it into the office of  
someone in Washington, D.C.?'' asked Pat Wolf, a resident of Santa 
Fe, about 30 miles east of Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	M.A. Buchholz, who lives about two miles from the test site,  
said: ``I don't want to be your guinea pig, thank you very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lab planned to conduct one test a month for a year,  
releasing about 10 grams of bacteria overnight, when the winds are 
low.

<HEADLINE> MLS All-Star Starters Are Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marco Etcheverry, last year's most valuable  
player, and five other D.C. United players were selected Thursday 
to start for the Eastern Conference in the MLS All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	Etcheverry, the Bolivian midfielder, led all players in fan  
voting with 50,949, 9,000 more than his closest rival, United 
teammate and defender Eddie Pope (41,850). 
</P>
<P>
	The match, to be played July 17 at San Diego, will be part of a  
doubleheader with an exhibition match between Chivas of Mexico, and 
Universidad Catolica of Chile. After last season's format of 
pitting the American stars against their international 
counterparts, this year's game reverts back to matching East vs. 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Etcheverry and Pope will be joined in the starting lineup by  
teammates Tom Presthus in goal, defender Jeff Agoos, midfielder Ben 
Olsen and forward Roy Lassiter, the league leader with 14 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Defender and former U.S. national team captain Thomas Dooley and  
his front-running teammate Brian McBride from the Columbus Crew 
also were selected, along with midfielders Carlos Valderrama of the 
Tampa Bay Mutiny, John Harkes of New England and Tab Ramos of the 
New York-New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western Conference starters were dominated by the defending  
MLS champion Chicago Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the Fire's Eastern European connection, forward Roman  
Kosecki and midfielder Peter Nowak of Poland and defender Lubos 
Kubik of the Czech Republic, led five Chicago players on the 
starting team. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Thornton, who replaced Jorge Campos as the No. 1 goalkeeper  
in Chicago, and U.S. national team midfielder Chris Armas also were 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose Clash placed two players on the starting team for  
the West: forward Raul Diaz Arce and U.S. national team midfielder 
Eddie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the West team were defenders Marcelo Balboa of  
Colorado and Alexi Lalas of the Kansas City Wizards, midfielder 
Cobi Jones of the Los Angeles Galaxy and Preki of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserves for both teams will be announced Friday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Want Last Vote on HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans, firing a strategic salvo  
over patients' rights, said Thursday they will use a 
Democratic-written bill as the vehicle for opening a debate next 
week on health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	But under an agreement reached last week, Republicans still get  
to offer the final amendment after four days of debate. And they 
are expected to use that penultimate vote to substitute their own 
bill for the entire Democratic measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter where you start out. It matters where you  
end up, which is Republicans will pass a Republican bill,'' said 
Eric Ueland, a top aide to Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who is 
leading the GOP on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, assuming the debate would begin with the GOP bill and  
with an eye toward the 2000 elections, had planned to force the 
majority Republicans to cast votes on a series of amendments 
placing more restrictions on HMOs and covering more people. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to get these politically sensitive votes on the record  
now, Democrats will be forced to offer amendments to their own 
bill. And that's just what they'll do, they said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of maneuvering demonstrates the bankruptcy of the  
Republican position on this issue,'' said Massachusetts Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy, an author of the Democratic measure. ``Parliamentary 
tactics won't allow members to duck this issue any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Manley, a spokesman for Kennedy, acknowledged ``we'll have  
to be a little more creative in crafting the amendments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican tactic, announced by Nickles, put them on the  
offensive in the patient rights debate for the first time in weeks. 
Democrats had forced them to schedule next week's debate after 
refusing for more than a week to let the Senate conduct any other 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing that large majorities of Americans fear that  
their health insurance company may someday deny them needed care, 
Democrats believe the issue could be pivotal in the race over which 
party will control the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who regularly pushes the Democrats' HMO plan,  
plans to hammer the issue again Friday on a California trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the provisions in the GOP plan only cover the 48 million  
people who are in federally regulated health insurance plans, 
mostly people who work for large companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say they want their proposed patient rights written  
into federal law and applied to all Americans. Among them would be 
forcing HMOs to pay for reasonable emergency room care, giving 
patients' a choice of doctors and allowing women direct access to 
obstetricians and gynecologists. 
</P>
<P>
	They also want to force insurance companies to pay for care that  
doctors determine to be medically necessary and allow patients who 
are harmed by denials of care to sue their HMOs or other managed 
care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	And they want a prohibition on insurance companies allowing only  
short hospital stays after mastectomies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new GOP strategy would allow Republicans to vote for some of  
the more popular provisions when they first come up and then vote 
to substitute the narrower Republican bill when the final amendment 
comes up, said a Senate GOP leadership aide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this was a political exercise from the very beginning,  
we had no choice but to factor in the political consequences and 
craft our bill accordingly,'' the aide said, speaking on condition 
of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Agrees to GOP Nuke Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chinese espionage and nuclear security  
flap could prompt the first major reorganization of the Energy 
Department since its inception 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators welcomed reports Thursday that Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson had agreed to accept a semiautonomous 
nuclear weapons agency within his department. Until this week he 
had strongly resisted such an agency. 
</P>
<P>
	While there remained disagreement over some details, Richardson  
is ready to go along with ``the notion of a semiautonomous agency'' 
overseeing all nuclear weapons programs within the department, 
according to an Energy Department official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Department staff members met with congressional aides Thursday  
and were expected to continue negotiations next week to work out 
remaining differences in the proposed reorganization, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson could not be reached for comment Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to move on this,'' Richardson told The Washington  
Post, which first reported the energy secretary's willingness to 
accept the semiautonomous agency after weeks of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., one of three Republican senators who  
has argued that a largely independent agency was the only way to 
assure accountability within the weapons program, said Thursday he 
welcomed Richardson's apparent change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson and Republican senators have wrangled for weeks over  
how the department should be restructured in response to the 
political uproar over lax security at nuclear weapons labs and the 
alleged theft -- mostly in the 1980s -- of nuclear weapons secrets by 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Richardson has argued that his initiatives  
strengthening counterintelligence and security, including the 
naming of retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger as ``security 
czar,'' was addressing the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, although still in  
the department, would consolidate control over the three nuclear 
weapons labs -- Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore -- as well 
as the Nevada nuclear test site and various nuclear material 
production and assembly plants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said in a telephone interview that he hoped to talk  
with Richardson shortly to get a better understanding of the 
secretary's position. Apparently he ``has seen that something very 
dramatic ought to happen'' to improve accountability within the 
weapons program. ``He has come full circle and now its only a 
matter of details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici and two other Republican senators -- Jon Kyl of Arizona  
and Frank Murkowski of Alaska -- have argued for weeks for an agency 
that would fence off nuclear weapons programs within the Energy 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to offer the proposal for full Senate action,  
possibly as early as next week when Congress returns from its 
recess. Democrats had threatened to block consideration of the 
measure, but with the administration trying to work out a 
bipartisan compromise, any attempt at a filibuster on the issue 
would be difficult to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said that two Democratic senators -- Bob Kerrey of  
Nebraska and Dianne Feinstein of California -- had recently signed 
on to the measure as cosponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed reorganization's prospects in the House were less  
certain. Some House Republicans would like to see the nuclear 
weapons programs removed from the Energy Department altogether, 
while others have expressed reservation about even a semiautonomous 
agency within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and Energy Department sources also said there  
remained disagreement between the Senate Republicans and Richardson 
on how independent such a new agency should be within the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson wants a clear understanding that the energy secretary  
will continue to have broad authority over the agency director, who 
will be given undersecretary status, and that the new agency will 
remain accountable to department-wide counterintelligence and 
security offices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican senators have insisted that the new agency  
have its own security and counterintelligence offices with minimal 
interference from other parts of the department. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you create a semiautonomous agency you put everything  
necessary to run the agency within the agency'' including security 
and counterintelligence functions, said Domenici. He said while the 
secretary would remain ``in charge'' the new agency should not be 
``infringed upon'' by other parts of the department.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Won't Fight Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A woman accused of planting bombs in the  
1970s as a radical member of the Symbionese Liberation Army has 
chosen not to fight extradition, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	By agreeing to extradition, Sara Jane Olson will essentially  
admit she is Kathleen Ann Soliah, a woman who the FBI said has been 
in hiding for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Olson, she married, had children and became an active  
member of her St. Paul community. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators say that as Ms. Soliah, she placed pipe bombs  
under two Los Angeles police cars in 1975 in retaliation for a 
shootout with police the year before in which six SLA members were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been wanted on murder conspiracy ever since.  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles authorities plan to fly her to the city early next  
week; a bail hearing has been set for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Olson wants to put this matter behind her as quickly as  
possible so she can be reunited with her husband and daughters, 
return to St. Paul and resume her volunteer work in the 
community,'' her lawyer, Howard Bass, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old woman and her physician husband have three  
daughters. Supporters say she is a typical ``soccer mom'' and 
occasional actress who has led an exemplary life of service to her 
family, church and community.

<HEADLINE> 3 Track Records Broken in 21 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With three of track and field's most prestigious  
world records broken in 21 days, and the possibility of more to 
come, the sport is buzzing in the buildup to next month's World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Records have fallen in succession in the men's 100 meters,  
decathlon and mile, setting standards in the defining sprint, 
multi-event and middle-distance disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj smashed the mile record Wednesday  
night at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, clocking 3 minutes, 43.13 
seconds, slicing 1.26 seconds off Noureddine Morceli's 6-year-old 
mark of 3:44.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Noah Ngeny, a 20-year-old Kenyan, also ran under the previous  
record, finishing second in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday at Prague, Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic broke  
Dan O'Brien's 7-year-old record in the decathlon. Dvorak amassed 
8,994 points, beating O'Brien's mark by 103 points and falling just 
short of the ``magical barrier'' of 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The record spree began June 16 at Athens, Greece, where Maurice  
Greene ran 9.79 in the 100, eclipsing Donovan Bailey's 1996 record 
of 9.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene kept up his scintillating season by running 9.85 at Rome,  
equaling the third-fastest 100 in history. It was the fastest time 
ever run without being a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Records in those and other events could be threatened during the  
course of the summer, which includes the World Championships at 
Seville, Spain, Aug. 20-29. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj broke the mile record on the same track where he set  
the 1,500-meter mark of 3:26.00 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After being helped by Kenyan pacemakers Robert Kibet and William  
Tanui until the bell lap, El Guerrouj found himself in a thrilling 
head-to-head duel in the final lap with Ngeny, who broke Jim Ryun's 
world junior record two years ago. El Guerrouj finished just a 
couple of strides ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Moroccan joined a select group who have held the  
mile and 1,500-meter records at the same time, including former 
British stars Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj will next run at Nice July 17, when he will attack  
the 2,000-meter record, held by Morceli. Then he plans to try and 
better his 1,500 mark in a Golden League meet at Paris July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, El Guerrouj has designs on Haile Gebrselassie's  
world record for the 5,000 of 12:19.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Prince of the Desert,'' El Guerrouj has assumed  
the mantle of his great Moroccan predecessor, Said Aouita. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hold every record that Aouita did,'' he said. ``I  
want to be the strongest in the world at all distances between 
1,500 meters and 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was Said Aouita, then Morceli. Now it's the hour of  
Hicham. Now I believe only the clock can beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj has won world 1,500-meter titles indoors and  
outdoors, holds world records at 1,500 indoors and outdoors, and 
holds the indoor mile record. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major title missing from his collection is an Olympic  
gold medal. He tripped and fell during the 1996 Olympic 1,500-meter 
final when he was favored for the gold. After El Guerrouj's fall, 
Morceli went to win the race. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Bush Told Not To Knock Speeches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The best marital advice Laura Bush ever got from  
her mother-in-law, former first lady Barbara Bush, was: ``Don't 
criticize his speeches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, herself a potential first  
lady now that her husband is seen as the GOP presidential 
front-runner, recalls in the August issue of Redbook: ``She had 
criticized one of HER George's speeches, and he came home for weeks 
afterward with letters saying it was his best one ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyway, one night we were pulling into the driveway and he  
said: `Tell me the truth. How was my speech?' And I said, `It 
wasn't that good.' Then he drove right into the garage wall.''

<HEADLINE> US Waiting Answer On Panda Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Zoo expects to hear from China  
next month about the zoo's offer to pay for borrowing two baby 
pandas, a zoo official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo officials who traveled to China with the offer ``were  
received warmly, but no commitments were made,'' said Robert J. 
Hoage, chief of public affairs for the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Beck, the zoo's associate director for biological  
programs; Devra Kleiman, a senior scientist; and Lisa Stevens, 
curator of pandas and primates, spent a week in China just before 
Fourth of July weekend. They are to provide details of their trip 
at a news conference Friday. Officials with the Chinese Embassy 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo's one remaining panda, Hsing-Hsing, is 28 years old and  
suffers from severe arthritis and an irreversible kidney condition. 
Zoo officials are not predicting how long he will live, although 
Hoage said pandas in the wild rarely live past their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing is feeling better since he's been on medicine for  
arthritis and anemia, antibiotics and a ``Pepcid-like'' stomach 
pill, Hoage said. He's eating about 20 pounds of bamboo a day along 
with sweet potatoes, apples, carrots and a gruel containing cottage 
cheese, rice, honey and vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing and another panda, Ling Ling, were diplomatic gifts  
from China in 1972 after President Nixon's historic visit. Ling 
Ling died of hardening of the arteries seven years ago, and none of 
the pair's five cubs survived. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,000 giant pandas live in the wild in China, their  
only native habitat, and 100 live in Chinese zoos. Since they are 
endangered, China no longer gives pandas as gifts and does not sell 
pandas overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo Atlanta recently reached an $11 million agreement to lease a  
pair of 2-year-old pandas as part of a 10-year study on why pandas 
are not interested in mating while in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Zoo, one of the few U.S. zoos that charge no  
admission, cannot afford $11 million, Hoage said. It hopes China 
will accept its offer of $2.5 million over 10 years, along with 
proposals for extensive, collaborative educational and research 
projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	They include the developing a national census of giant pandas in  
the wild, a radio tracking and satellite monitoring system and 
hormonal research on what makes it difficult to breed pandas in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo anticipates possibly as much as $1 million a year in  
financial returns from the pandas through increased concession 
sales if China accepts its offer.

<HEADLINE> Dock Workers Back, Talks To Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Dock workers who left ships and trucks  
idling for two days at the Port of Oakland returned to work 
Thursday as longshoremen laboring without a contract bedeviled 
management with other tactics across the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have slowdowns at all major ports up and down the coast  
-- Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Oakland, Los Angeles and Long Beach,'' 
Phil Resch, a spokesman for the management's Pacific Maritime 
Association, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By not showing early or working through their lunches, the  
union's 14,500 workers will prevent some ports from keeping their 
gates open and freight moving efficiently throughout the day, Resch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to tell how much the tactics will cost  
businesses, but they were already having an impact at the West 
Coast ports, which collectively handled $266 billion in goods last 
year, the PMA said. 
</P>
<P>
	One cargo ship leaving Seattle Thursday was less than full  
because its containers couldn't be loaded in time, said that port's 
director, Imbert Matthee. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which began refusing the overtime in Los Angeles and  
Long Beach, Calif., Tuesday morning, expanded the action to all 
ports on Thursday, Resch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're not doing is working extra,'' said Steve  
Stallone, a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse 
Union in San Francisco. ``They feel they're not getting good faith 
from the PMA right now in negotiations, so why should they be 
busting their butts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on a new three-year contract were set to resume  
Friday morning, both sides said. The old contract expired on July 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkout in Oakland, the nation's fourth-largest port, and  
the lack of flextime work at other ports could eventually harm 
retailers importing time-sensitive fashion merchandise and prevent 
manufacturers from getting just-in-time parts deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	But many companies anticipated labor trouble, planning as early  
as last January to move up shipments or deliver them by air or 
through East Coast ports this month, said Robin Lanier, a lobbyist 
for the Mass Retail Association in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of concern there might be a strike that would  
shut the whole West Coast down,'' she said. ``The disaster 
everybody's been wringing their hands about for six months really 
hasn't happened here, but it was enough to have lit up my phone 
yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact was more immediate in Oakland, where the Port  
Authority collects fees for cranes, dockage and other services that 
can average $60,000 per ship, said Roberta Bradley, a port 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkout by the port's 1,400 workers forced Oakland-bound  
ships to slow down across the Pacific or wait at anchor in San 
Francisco Bay. Giant cranes stood motionless and deliveries of 
everything from California fruit and computer components to 
Hawaiian cows sat on the docks and ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallone said the walkout was spontaneous and not connected to  
the contract talks. He said it was a safety issue -- management's 
refusal to hire an extra worker under each crane to keep track of 
containers being moved. 
</P>
<P>
	But the PMA, which asked the National Labor Relations Board to  
force the Oakland workers back to the docks, considers the timing 
of the safety request to be suspicious, Resch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been working every day, year-in and year-out without  
this new request that they had. Now all of a sudden they bring it 
up as an issue,'' Resch said. ``Our first question is, is it a 
safety issue or something else?''

<HEADLINE> Scramble for World Cup Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Soccer moms and celebrities were leading the  
ticket broker scramble for seats to Saturday's sold-out Women's 
World Cup finale at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe half the seats we're selling are going to parents  
getting seats for their daughters,'' said Sandy Simon, owner of 
Good Time Tickets in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 88,000 tickets have been sold for the games pitting  
the United States against China in the final and Brazil and Norway 
in the third place showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers were getting $75 to $500 for nosebleed seats and $600 to  
$1,000 for the best seats. Newspaper classified ads were jammed 
with private party ads listing tickets from $75 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, a ticket was being offered for $800.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's as big or bigger than a Rose Bowl or Super Bowl game,''  
said Simon, who furiously answered telephones with another 14 
employees taking orders even before Good Time opened its doors. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace may have matched the Super Bowl frenzy for Simon, but  
the prices have a ways to go. Brokered ticket prices for Super 
Bowls have reached $2,500 while scalper prices have reached $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon said many of his clients belonged to the celebrity crowd.  
``They are bringing their kids, I mean, multi-Academy Award-type 
people,'' he said Thursday, refusing to name names. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're having a lot of fun,'' said John Bober, manager of Tyson  
Ticket Service in Beverly Hills. ``We're selling to families. They 
are taking the kids, the soccer clubs. We sell Dodger tickets to 
the same people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than celebrities, Bober said his customers were ``more  
Joe Blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 8.6 million soccer players in the United States, 2.5  
million are girls, according to American Youth Soccer Organization. 
About 635,000 boys and girls, ages 5 to 18, play in AYSO's 1,000 
leagues nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotels and motels around the Rose Bowl have been booked for  
weeks and restaurants are jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been telling people this event was going to be a big  
deal, but we never thought it would be like this,'' World Cup 
spokesman Steve Vanderpool said. ``It just blows us away at the 
organizing committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Credentials have been given to 2,000 media members, including  
300 international journalists. Vanderpool said the thrill for him 
Saturday will be the sound of the crowd with all those youngsters 
in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of a roar, it's a kind of a shriek. It's more like the  
Beatles walking out at Shea Stadium,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup mania is easily explained, Vanderpool said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the common game played by the world. You don't have to be  
big or tall to play. You can be any size and be a good soccer 
player,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittany Whitworth, an 18-year-old Glendora resident who's  
played soccer since she was 8, won't get to see the United States 
vs. China matchup. She has to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``But my little sister is going. She's shagging balls. It's all  
sold out and everyone wants to go. I'll just have to watch it on 
TV,'' the teen-ager said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, every AYSO soccer girl wants to go to this. It's a treat  
for us to have all these tickets to sell,'' Simon said, noting that 
his supply was ``getting slim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police warned fans without tickets to stay away from the Rose  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there will be scalpers on the premises,'' Simon said.  
``The only risk you take there is somebody could print up a dupe. 
Also, somebody could purchase stolen tickets.''

<HEADLINE> Hamm, Akers Are World Cup All-Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Five Americans, including veteran stars  
Mia Hamm and Michelle Akers, were chosen for the 1999 Women's World 
Cup All-Star team Thursday, with seven Chinese players also 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and China, which meet in Saturday's  
championship game at the Rose Bowl, dominated the team, chosen by 
the FIFA Technical Study Group. It is the first team ever chosen 
during a Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry and defenders Brandi Chastain and  
Carla Overbeck joined Hamm, a forward, and Akers, a midfielder, on 
the elite team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's awesome,'' Hamm said. ``With all the great players,  
that's a real honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She looked down the all-star roster and seemed surprised that  
other of her teammates didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're missing Kristine Lilly, who's one of the very best,  
and Tiffeny Milbrett,'' Hamm noted. ``But you look at the players 
who are on there, and it would have been hard to leave any of them 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was difficult to decide.''  
</P>
<P>
	The technical study group analyzed each player's strengths and  
all-around game. The FIFA group described Hamm as an ``explosive, 
strong team player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akers was assessed as ``charismatic, excellent header,  
powerful.'' Scurry was seen as ``composed, good positional sense 
and excellent shot-stopper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain was described as ``strong, good in the air, dominates  
left side.'' Overbeck was picked because of her ``good vision and 
covering of the defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akers, 33, a mainstay of the American team for 14 years, was  
excited to learn she was on the all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's great. My dad will be very happy,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Akers has two goals in the tournament, as does Hamm.  
</P>
<P>
	China's all-stars include forward Sun Wen, the tournament's  
leading scorer with seven goals, and goalkeeper Gao Hong, who has 
allowed only two goals in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese forward Jin Yan also was selected, as were midfielders  
Liu Ailing and Zhao Lihong, and defenders Wang Liping and Wen 
Lirong. 
</P>
<P>
	The only all-stars from other countries were forward Ann Kristin  
Aarones of Norway, midfielders Sissi of Brazil and Bettina Wiegmann 
of Germany, and defender Doris Fitschen of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry, who called her shutout against Brazil in the semifinals  
the best game of her career, has yielded only three goals. One of 
them was put into the American net by Chastain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing well at this tournament,'' she said, ``and  
working hard the last six months. I have more confidence as a 
player and I'm a better goalie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard will donate $16,000 in the players' names to the SOS  
Children's Village, an official charity of FIFA, the world 
governing body for soccer.

<HEADLINE> Poland Lets Coca Cola-Resume Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A government agency gave approval Thursday  
for Coca-Cola to resume production at a plant shut down last week 
when bacteria was found in plastic bottles of mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said the company would continue its  
own testing Friday at the plant near Wroclaw in southwest Poland 
and hoped to announce the resumption of production next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the go-ahead to be able to begin producing,'' said  
Sonya Soutus, Coca-Cola's Central Europe communications manager. 
``We still want to finish our internal testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soutus said details of what caused the bacteria contamination  
would be announced when the company completed its testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola recalled an estimated 180,000 half-liter plastic  
bottles of Bonaqa Plus mineral water last week because of the 
bacteria, which was found to be nonhazardous. It also shut down the 
bottling plant near Wroclaw on July 2 to determine how the 
contamination occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall was the company's second in Poland in a week, after  
all of its one-third liter returnable glass bottles were pulled 
back because of mold found inside some of them. Coca-Cola then 
announced more stringent cleaning methods for the returnable 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	No illness has been reported in Poland from Coca-Cola beverages,  
and the company said it took the extraordinary measures of 
recalling its products to maintain consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems in Poland came a few weeks after more than 200  
people complained of illness after drinking Coca-Cola products in 
Belgium and France, forcing the company to make a costly recall of 
its beverages there.

<HEADLINE> Conn. OKs Witness Protection Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut's governor on Thursday signed  
into law a witness protection program named for an 8-year-old boy 
who was shot to death to keep him from testifying in a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and law enforcement officials said the legislation  
creates the most comprehensive state-run witness protection program 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``An attack on a witness is an attack on our judicial system,''  
Gov. John G. Rowland said. ``Our citizens must have confidence that 
our systems work and that they're protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers were galvanized into coming up with a better way to  
protect witnesses, especially children, after the shooting deaths 
last January of Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown and his mother, Karen Clarke, 
in their Bridgeport home. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler and his brother, Adrian, are charged with  
murdering mother and son as the boy screamed, ``Mommy! Mommy! 
Mommy!'' The boy was going to testify against Russell Peeler in a 
drive-by murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridgeport police said they had provided special protection for  
the family, but Ms. Clarke had asked them to discontinue the 
patrols outside her house because she found them intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law allows the state to take custody of child witnesses  
if their parents fail to take steps to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	It also creates the ``Leroy Brown and Karen Clarke Witness  
Protection Program.'' The new program requires the chief state's 
attorney to offer protection to witnesses if they want it and 
inform them of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	It also stiffens the penalty for intimidating a witness and sets  
up a toll-free hot line that witnesses can call if they need help. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy's uncle said the boy and his mother would not have been  
killed if the new system had been in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that Karen and B.J. had to be martyrs in  
order for this to take place,'' said Oswald Clarke, who flew to 
Connecticut from his home in Florida for the bill-signing.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Appears Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has made a  
second apperance before a grand jury investigating whether campaign 
gifts influenced the rejection of a proposed Indian casino in 
Wisconsin and whether he lied about it to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to answer all of their questions. I'm happy to do  
so,'' Babbitt told reporters as he left the federal courthouse on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the proceedings ``very professional'' but would not  
comment further. Babbitt had also testified before the grand jury 
on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-month investigation by Independent Counsel Carol Elder  
Bruce into the Interior Department's rejection of a request by 
three Chippewa tribes to open a casino in Hudson, Wis., is 
apparently nearly conclusion. Bruce has indicated she wants to wrap 
the matter up by mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	The special prosecutor is trying to determine whether Babbitt  
lied under oath before a Senate committee about the circumstances 
surrounding the casino decision, particularly whether it was 
influenced by promises of campaign contributions to the Democratic 
Party by other tribes opposed to the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The rival tribes later gave the Democratic National Committee  
nearly $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has vigorously denied any connection between campaign  
contributions and the decision to reject the casino. He also has 
denied intending to mislead senators during the sometimes 
contentious Senate hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But a longtime friend, Paul Eckstein, a lobbyist for the tribes  
seeking the casino, testified to the same Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee that Babbitt -- during a meeting the day the 
casino decision was made -- alluded to Democratic campaign 
contributions and pressure from the White House to have the matter 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has said Eckstein misunderstood the conversation.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Hits More Snags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke's troubled nomination to be  
U.N. ambassador is drawing new opposition, with at least four 
Republican senators now signaling their intentions to hold up a 
floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Mitch  
McConnell of Kentucky and George Voinovich of Ohio have joined Sen. 
Charles Grassley of Iowa in putting so-called ``holds'' on the 
nomination, various sources said Wednesday. The nomination has been 
delayed more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican Senate source suggested as many as six senators  
may be working to delay or block the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an effort to select a new envoy to China to replace  
former Sen. James Sasser hit an unexpected snag. In an apparent 
lapse of protocol, the administration neglected to notify the 
Chinese about the proposed nomination of retired Adm. Joseph W. 
Prueher before it became widely reported two months ago, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still angry over the U.S. bombing of their embassy in  
Yugoslavia, Chinese officials are now voicing displeasure over 
Prueher's role in a U.S. naval operation in the Straits of Taiwan 
in 1996 during a tense period in U.S.-Chinese relations, according 
to congressional and diplomatic sources who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and McConnell want to apply pressure on the White House to  
nominate an Ohio law professor for a ``Republican'' position on the 
Federal Election Commission, said the sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor, Bradley A. Smith of Capital University in  
Columbus, Ohio, had been recommended by Republican leaders for the 
vacancy on the commission, which is divided between two Democrats 
and two Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spokesman John Czwartacki declined to comment on the holds.  
By tradition, any senator can block, at least for a time, any 
nomination, anonymously if he or she chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on the subject of the FEC vacancy, Czwartacki noted  
that presidents traditionally give leaders of the other party the 
prerogative in picking their party's FEC representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a White House that tried to pick the other  
party's nominees,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Voinovich is seeking to delay the nomination for other reasons,  
said his aide, Mike Dawson. Not only does the Ohio Republican want 
to make sure there is a roll call vote on the nomination, but ``he 
has concerns about Holbrooke's nomination for policy reasons,'' 
Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth senator, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, had already  
put a hold on Holbrooke to protest what he contends is State 
Department retribution against government employee at the U.N. 
mission in New York for telling members of Congress about waste and 
inefficiency at the international organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats said they hoped the new delays would be short  
lived, and characterized the new holds as an attempt by GOP leaders 
to exert leverage over the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former ambassador to Germany and assistant  
secretary of state, is the architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv called Holbrooke  
``supremely qualified'' for the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential to our national interest that he be put in  
place and the Senate ought to vote on his nomination as soon as 
possible,'' Toiv said. The nomination last week won the support of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Beijing post, failing to give China a preview of  
Prueher's selection was a major diplomatic breach of protocol, 
suggest some officials close to the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here, said,  
``We've gotten information only from the media. We have not been 
officially notified yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, a spokesman for the White House National Security  
Council, David Leavy, on Wednesday disputed that the delay amounted 
to a diplomatic snub of China. He noted that even though the 
proposed nomination had been widely reported, and confirmed by some 
administration officials, it still had not been announced formally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're vetting him (Prueher). Our legal office is vetting the  
nomination. When we're done with the process, then we'll move 
forward,'' Leavy said. ``The Chinese don't have a problem'' with 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Foley said the  
United States has delivered a detailed written report to China to 
support its insistence that the May 7 embassy bombing was 
accidental. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and 
injured 20 other people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese have called the U.S. explanation, earlier delivered  
in person by U.S. diplomat Thomas Pickering, unpersuasive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will (also) inform the Chinese of all appropriate  
information on any further results of our internal review with 
respect to the question of whether any disciplinary action is 
called for,'' Foley said.

<HEADLINE> Morris: Pirates Rookie of Year? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Three months into his first major league  
season, Warren Morris of the Pittsburgh Pirates has received 
perhaps the ultimate compliment for a young second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	He has earned the Bill Mazeroski seal of approval.  
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski, regarded as the best-fielding second baseman in  
history, got his first in-person look at Morris this week after 
working with him for 10 days early in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski's assessment: Good field, good hit, good power, good  
player, good person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be around a long time,'' said Mazeroski, who  
watches most of his baseball on TV. ``He handles himself well. He's 
got a good head on his shoulders, and he knows how to adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski also has noticed a little of himself in Morris, even  
if it would be out of character for Mazeroski to discuss it in 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris is a ballplayer, not a talker, just like Mazeroski was as  
the Pirates' slick-fielding but relatively soft-spoken second 
baseman from 1956-72. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to listen,'' Mazeroski said. ``A lot of the  
younger players today don't know how to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris also knows how to hit -- not just for average, but for  
power. Like a player named Mazeroski, still the only man to end 
Game 7 of a World Series with a home run, in 1960 against the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Maz, like Morris.  
</P>
<P>
	Morris duplicated Mazeroski in the drama department, ending the  
1996 College World Series with a series-winning homer, his only 
homer all season for LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flattered to be compared to him in any way,'' said Morris,  
who has helped the surprising Pirates stay around .500 all season. 
``Nothing in me is about individual records or things of that 
nature, I do things quietly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except at the plate. With a .294 average, 9 homers and 43 RBIs  
going into Thursday night's game against the Chicago Cubs -- 
excellent power numbers for a middle infielder -- he is being 
mentioned along with Joe McEwing of St. Louis, Preston Wilson and 
Alex Gonzalez of Florida, and Benny Agbayani of the New York Mets 
for the NL Rookie of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates never have had a Rookie of the Year, not even  
Mazeroski, who hit .255 as a parttime player in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not campaigning for it,'' Morris said. ``What are you  
trying to do, jinx me? It's way too early to talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Morris has been exactly what general manager Cam Bonifay  
predicted when he traded right-hander Esteban Loaiza to Texas for 
Morris, then a Double-A player, nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris doesn't get rattled when he makes a mistake -- and, with  
only seven errors, he has made few. He has the ability to shake off 
a poor night, a perquisite in a sport where the season lasts 162 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has fielded exceptionally well, as evidenced by the  
Pirates' 104 double plays -- the second most in the NL and only 57 
fewer than they had last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is he seems to adjust to breaking  
pitches and fastballs, and a lot of being successful in the big 
leagues is being able to make adjustments,'' manager Gene Lamont 
said. ``You make adjustments, they make adjustments, then you have 
to adjust again and he's been able to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most minor leaguers, Morris watched a lot of baseball on TV  
before reaching the majors. But he tried not to be too intimidated 
or overwhelmed by the skill level of the game's top players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any preconceived notions going into this  
season,'' he said. ``On TV, every home runs looks like it's 800 
feet, nobody makes errors and they're the fastest runners you've 
ever seen. My attitude was that I would go there and do my best and 
if things didn't work out, so be it.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks closed mixed Thursday, with Tokyo  
prices edging slightly higher as Hong Kong shares fell and 
Thailand's key index plunged 3.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares rose slightly after the Cabinet approved a  
supplementary budget worth 520 billion yen ($4.25 billion) aimed at 
stimulating the ailing labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 8.75 points,  
or 0.05 percent, to 17,967.65. On Wednesday, the Nikkei had lost 
91.83 points, or 0.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds set aside in the latest budget will finance the  
government's program to create about 720,000 jobs through measures 
such as subsidies to companies and nonprofit organizations hiring 
displaced workers, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's jobless rate recently hit an all-time high of 4.8  
percent in March and April before easing to 4.6 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese  
yen. In late trading, the dollar bought 122.38 yen, up 0.42 yen 
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and slightly above its late New York 
level of 122.23 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices fell slightly, dragged down by heavy  
selling in the futures market and concerns that more companies 
might make big stock sales to raise cash amid the recent stock 
market rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 31.14 points, or 0.2 percent,  
to 14,226.30. The Hang Seng had fallen 0.8 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in two companies, Cable and Wireless HKT and China  
Resources Enterprises Holding Ltd., which had made big stock sales 
this week, fell sharply for a second straight session. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, Thailand, shares plunged 3.8 percent after Thai  
Farmers Bank PCL announced it will raise 24 billion baht through a 
rights issue, or issuing more shares for sale to existing 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed down 19.46 points,  
or 3.8 percent, at 496.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said investors were panicky after Thai Farmers Bank  
announced its capital increase plan Thursday afternoon. The market 
expects other banks to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a typical reaction as the market is already shaky,''  
said Eric Holman of SG Asia Credit PCL. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Florida Execution Turns Bloody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- A 344-pound killer nicknamed ``Tiny'' bled  
all over himself as he was put to death in Florida's new electric 
chair Thursday, prompting demands that all executions be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the blood that stained Allen Lee Davis' collar  
and covered the front of his white shirt appeared to come from his 
mouth and chest, but state officials said it was from a nosebleed 
and insisted the new chair worked properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only source of blood was from the nose. He had a  
nosebleed,'' said Cory Tilley, a spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy report said there were no significant injuries on  
Davis' body. The report stated he had ``several predisposing risk 
factors'' for nosebleeds -- including hypertension and treatment for 
arthritis with aspirin and Motrin, which are both blood-thinners. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 54, went to his death for the murders of a pregnant woman  
and her two daughters, ages 5 and 9, during a 1982 robbery. His 
lawyers had tried to stop the execution on the grounds that the 
voltage wouldn't be enough to kill a man as fat as Davis quickly 
and painlessly. 
</P>
<P>
	After the execution, Davis lawyer Marty McClain said a chart of  
the voltage showed that the current used fell short of the 2,300 
volts necessary to put someone to death humanely. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida called on the  
governor to halt all executions until the state can ensure that 
they can be conducted humanely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Florida's record of executions, and the Legislature's  
obsession with electrocution as the method of execution, has been 
barbaric,'' said Howard Simon, the state ACLU's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International USA said Davis' bloody execution  
``demonstrates that the state's attempt to `improve' the process of 
executions cannot remove the cruelty inherent in state killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new chair replaced ``Old Sparky,'' which had been used to  
execute more than 200 people since 1923. The electrical equipment, 
however, came from the old chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials said the old chair was falling apart. It  
had also raised concern after a 1997 execution in which flames shot 
from the head of the condemned man. The problem -- later blamed on 
an error in the way sponges were applied to his head -- led inmates 
to argue that the electric chair amounts to cruel and unusual 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' execution gave Florida's next condemned man grounds for a  
legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Thomas Provenzano, who was scheduled to die on  
Friday, won a postponement from the state Supreme Court after 
arguing that Davis' execution demonstrated the electric chair still 
does not work properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Provenzano, 50, killed a bailiff and mortally wounded another in  
a shooting rampage in 1984 at an Orlando courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	This was believed to the first time in 44 Florida executions  
since capital punishment resumed in 1979 that the inmate bled. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was condemned for the slayings in Jacksonville of  
37-year-old Nancy Weiler, who was three months pregnant, and her 
two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was pronounced dead, blood had poured out onto  
his collar and blood on his chest had spread to about the size of a 
dinner plate, oozing through the buckle holes on the leather chest 
strap holding him to the chair. 
</P>
<P>
	John Weiler, the victims' husband and father, witnessed the  
execution, seated directly in front of Davis on the other side of a 
glass partition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The execution today was a legal, moral and righteous one,'' he  
said. He cried several times throughout his statement. ``I can 
assure you my God approves.''

<HEADLINE> Italian Wins Tour de France Stage 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOIS, France (AP) -- His fans call him the ``King of Sprints''  
and the ``Lion King'' -- not to mention SuperMario. 
</P>
<P>
	So it seemed apt that Mario Cipollini chose the former home of  
French kings to win the fastest stage in the history of the Tour de 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Blois, in view of the imposing royal castle, the  
Italian sprinter came off a stone bridge spanning the Loire River 
to surge past Germany's Erik Zabel and win the fourth stage in a 
photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a perfect sprint,'' he said, paying tribute to his  
Saeco teammates who worked so hard to position him for the final 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
	A favorable tailwind, cool weather conditions, a relatively  
straight course and wide, flat roads all set the scene for an 
average speed of 31.290 mph -- shattering the previous record of 
30.707 mph set in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Stuart O'Grady finished third, followed by Tom  
Steels, the Belgian who won the two previous stages. Estonia's Jaan 
Kirsipuu was fifth, but kept the leader's yellow jersey he captured 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 121-mile route took the riders through flat roads from the  
town of Laval on the Mayenne River to Blois in the Loire Valley. 
The royal castle there, which housed King Francois I, among others, 
was also where Joan of Arc prepared her campaign against the 
English at Orleans in 1429. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Tuesday's third stage, two riders broke from the pack  
early and held a long lead. Gianpaolo Mondini of Italy and Anthony 
Morin of France survived an early breakaway by 10 riders. They 
built a lead of more than six minutes over 62 miles before the pack 
started gaining late in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The final sprint went down to a photo finish, and Zabel was  
deprived of a stage win on his 29th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, O'Grady moved up to second place, 16  
seconds behind. Steels, who wants to be wearing yellow when the 
race nears his home country later in the week, was third at 21 
seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In fourth place was Lance Armstrong, the American making a  
gallant comeback from testicular cancer, 24 seconds behind. Zabel 
was in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong plans to wait for Sunday's time trial and then the  
mountain stages before making his real challenge. But this week, in 
the early, flat stages, it is the sprinters like Cipollini who are 
in command. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning Wednesday's stage in 3 hours, 51 minutes and 45  
seconds, the 32-year-old Italian captured his ninth career Tour de 
France stage victory, and his first this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini is now ninth in the overall standings, 44 seconds  
behind Kirsipuu. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year's Tour has had little of the controversy that  
enveloped last year's race when a drug scandal almost scuttled the 
entire event. 
</P>
<P>
	Manolo Saiz, sports director of the ONCE team who was initially  
banned from this year's Tour for involvement in the doping scandal 
but then was reinstated, said in an interview in Le Monde Wednesday 
that he thought ``90, if not 99 percent of the riders in this 
year's Tour de France are clean.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Dealer's Links Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators are looking into whether  
racist gunman Benjamin Smith had help carrying out his deadly 
rampage against Jews, blacks and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is questioning Smith's family and friends and is probing  
his ties to the World Church of the Creator, a hate group based in 
East Peoria which Smith followed, said Attorney General Janet Reno 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, federal prosecutors said they could find no evidence  
that the man who sold Smith his weapons, Donald Fiessinger, had 
ties to extremist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents had said earlier that they were investigating  
whether Fiessinger, 64, supplied guns to other racist extremists. 
Fiessinger faces a charge of selling firearms without a federal 
firearms permit for the sale of several guns, including two 
handguns bought by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is believed to have used the guns on a three-day killing  
spree through Illinois and Indiana that targeted blacks, Jews and 
Asians. Two people were killed and nine others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The spree ended Sunday with Smith's apparent suicide following a  
police chase. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators still want to know if Smith had help.  
</P>
<P>
	However, under rules written in the 1970s to curb unwarranted  
FBI probes of civil rights groups and anti-Vietnam War groups, the 
Justice Department must discover evidence of criminal conduct 
before an investigation can be begin against the World Church of 
the Creator. 
</P>
<P>
	``The standard is that we have got to have a reasonable  
indication of criminal conduct on the part of the group,'' Reno 
said. ``And we are going to review all the issues with respect to 
this matter to determine what would be appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Hale, the leader of the World Church of the Creator, was  
interviewed Wednesday by FBI agents at the East Peoria house where 
he lives with his parents, a middle-class home that doubles as the 
headquarters for the hate group. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Hale, agents have interviewed Smith's parents and his  
ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said he has evidence that Smith was acting on his own: a  
certified letter allegedly handwritten by Smith and postmarked July 
2 from the Chicago suburb of Wilmette. It states that Smith was 
breaking from the church because he was ``unable and unwilling to 
follow a legal revolution of values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith could not legally buy handguns because an ex-girlfriend  
had obtained a protective order against him. But records in 
Fiessinger's home show that he sold cheap, low-caliber handguns to 
more than 50 people over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger became the target of a federal investigation in June  
after agents learned he was allegedly selling guns illegally from 
his apartment in Pekin, a central Illinois town south of Peoria. 
Agents raided his apartment in July, but did not arrest Fiessinger 
because he was cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	After reading a newspaper description of Smith on Tuesday,  
Fiessinger called investigators to say he sold Smith two pistols in 
June.

	The Southwest suffered monsoon conditions Thursday, pelted by  
showers and thunderstorms that turned streets into rivers and 
stranded motorists on top of their cars in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The average annual rainfall in the Las Vegas Valley is 4.1  
inches, but by early afternoon, up to 3 inches had fallen and more 
was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a storm created rain in parts of the northern  
Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes, with strong wind and rain 
in Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wisconsin communities of Mondovi and Medary, wind knocked  
down trees and power lines, ripped off roofs and crushed campers. 
One woman was injured when a tree crashed through the wall of their 
Mondovi home. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong weather also struck Lewiston, in southeastern  
Minnesota. 
</P>

	The lawsuit, filed in April in U.S. District Court in Camden,  
N.J., claims that a former bookkeeper and assistant of agent Sal 
DiFazio stole the money from Jones by depositing it in the accounts 
of two other professional basketball clients of the company. The 
suit doesn't explain how the money was later taken from those 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Atlantic Sports Management Inc. and DiFazio  
have repaid about $960,000 to Jones, a former Temple University 
player. Jones, who also seeks more than $500,000 in compensatory 
damages and interest, contends he is still owed more than $540,000. 
</P>
<P>
	DiFazio disputes the dollar figure, saying an auditor for  
Atlantic Sports has told him the amount is ``substantially less.'' 
He has until July 19 to file a response with the federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have taken every possible measure to correct the problem  
after the fact, including repaying all the monies which were known 
to be misappropriated'' DiFazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' attorney and current agent, Leon Rose, refused to comment  
because the case is in litigation. He said Rose was in Florida 
running a basketball camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims that two checks totaling $302,802 were drawn  
on Jones' checking account and deposited between March and May 
1998, into the account of another player, Aaron McKie. A third 
check for $89,500 was deposited into player Marc Jackson's account. 
The suit doesn't explain how the money was taken from those 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also claimed that beginning in 1996, certain agents and  
officers of Atlantic Sports, including bookkeeper Debi Donnelly, 
began working together to systematically steal from Jones' 
accounts. It doesn't specify how much else was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged fraud came to light in October 1998, when Jones  
requested an audit. He ended all contractual relationships with 
DiFazio Jan. 20.

<HEADLINE> Conn. OKs Witness Protection Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut's governor has signed into  
law a witness protection program named for an 8-year-old boy who 
was shot to death to keep him from testifying in a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and law enforcement officials said the legislation  
creates the most comprehensive state-run witness protection program 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``An attack on a witness is an attack on our judicial system,''  
Gov. John G. Rowland said Thursday. ``Our citizens must have 
confidence that our systems work and that they're protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers were galvanized into coming up with a better way to  
protect witnesses, especially children, after the shooting deaths 
last January of Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown and his mother, Karen Clarke, 
in their Bridgeport home. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler and his brother, Adrian, are charged with  
murdering mother and son as the boy screamed, ``Mommy! Mommy! 
Mommy!'' The boy was going to testify against Russell Peeler in a 
drive-by killing case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridgeport police said they had provided special protection for  
the family, but Ms. Clarke had asked them to discontinue the 
patrols outside her house because she found them intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law allows the state to take custody of child witnesses  
if their parents fail to take steps to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	It also creates the ``Leroy Brown and Karen Clarke Witness  
Protection Program.'' The new program requires the chief state's 
attorney to offer protection to witnesses if they want it and 
inform them of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	It also stiffens the penalty for intimidating a witness and sets  
up a toll-free hot line that witnesses can call if they need help. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy's uncle said the boy and his mother would not have been  
killed if the new system had been in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that Karen and B.J. had to be martyrs in  
order for this to take place,'' said Oswald Clarke, who flew to 
Connecticut from his home in Florida for the bill-signing.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Edge Down / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages, which has been rising for two months, edged 
down to 7.65 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 7.71 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb for the past two  
months and have fluctuated from their low for this year of 6.74 
percent set at the end of January to a high of 7.71 percent set 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.30 percent this week, down from the average of 7.34 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.96 percent this week, down from 6.05 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported on  
Wednesday that mortgage loan applications rose 2.6 percent last 
week even though mortgage rates had crept up in the same week.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Returns To Fillies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Silverbulletday, seventh in the Belmont  
Stakes June 5 in her debut against males, will return to 
competition against 3-year-old fillies Saturday at Monmouth Park -- 
and they're not exactly rushing to welcome her back. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pegram's winner of 11 of 13 starts drew only four rivals  
for the 1 1-16-mile Monmouth Breeders' Cup Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, the odds-one favorite, will start from the  
outside post, which shouldn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five's good,'' trainer Bob Baffert said Thursday by telephone  
from California. ``Out there she can break and do things her way. 
You don't worry to much about a five-horse field, anything less may 
be different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to be coming out of the one hole,'' Baffert said.  
``Down there you can get pinned in, but outside she'll have a clear 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday galloped over the Monmouth track Thursday  
morning in her first real exercise since arriving Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just loved the track,'' said Peter Hutton, a Baffert  
assistant. ``She galloped about a mile and a half this morning and 
was really going well. Her ears were pricked, and she was taking it 
all in stride. I couldn't pull her up. She's happy, has settled in 
nicely, and seems to really like the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, who will be ridden by Jerry Bailey, had her  
final serious work for the Oaks on Monday at Churchill Downs, 
breezing six furlongs in 1:11 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the field for the $250,000 Oaks are Bag Lady, Aaron  
Gryder; West's Secret, no rider; Chatter Patter, no rider, and Boom 
Town Girl.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A new book of Mormon humor? The very idea  
draws horselaughs from some members of the faith known for its 
seriousness and sobriety. Yet it's true -- and the publisher is The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried hard not to offend anybody,'' said Jack Lyon,  
managing editor of church-owned Deseret Book, which released 
``Best-Loved Humor of the LDS People'' this spring. ``We did select 
things people could use if giving a talk in church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An example:  
</P>
<P>
	``Question: How are bishops chosen?  
</P>
<P>
	``Answer: The stake leaders find the most righteous, spiritual,  
most loved person in the ward -- and then they call her husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, this is not comedy club stuff. But it's heading in the right  
direction, say those who want to show there's fun beneath the 
faith's buttoned-down image. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kirby, considered by many the preeminent Mormon humorist  
today, thought for years that most of his fellow believers were a 
pretty pinched lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I equated Mormons with the way they behaved in church,'' said  
Kirby, a humor columnist for The Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	This was, after all, the church whose canonical Doctrine and  
Covenants states: ``Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, 
from all laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your 
pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby continued: ``I operated on the premise that church was a  
place where humorless people go. I misinterpreted reverence for 
humorlessness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That changed with Kirby's first foray into Mormon humor, a  
satirical column about five types of Mormons, which he wrote for a 
newspaper where he used to work. Though his Mormon publisher hated 
it, the column brought a flood of letters from church members who 
loved it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby felt like a miner cracking his shins on the mother lode.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised that Mormons, particularly -- I know Jewish  
people do it and Catholics to a large extent -- used humor to make 
their lot in life a little more tolerable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the depth of it was even more surprising, because you get  
people who are very staunch members of the church who laugh about 
the inconsistencies or the vagaries in our behavior and the 
mysteries of the gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, they are able to laugh at themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	Psst! begins a joke that has made the rounds, though it isn't in  
the new book: How do you tell the difference between a Mormon 
wedding and a non-Mormon wedding? At the Mormon wedding, the 
bride's mother is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The punch line plays on the traditional Mormon propensity for  
large families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The really funny Mormon stuff is uniquely Mormon. It's  
something that comes from being part of the family,'' said Pat 
Bagley, political cartoonist at the Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Mormons use humor as a decompression device, ``a way to let off  
some of the pressure that builds up'' and to say things that are 
true but which, unadorned with humor, might seem heretical or mean. 
For example, he says, ``It's not politic to say 19-year-old 
missionaries are dumb,'' but it's safe to say the same thing in a 
joke or cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Elouise Bell, a retired Brigham Young University English  
professor and author of a collection of humorous essays titled 
``Only When I Laugh,'' observed: ``The essence of really good humor 
is a kind of surprise. Well, I think culturally Mormons don't like 
surprises in outward things. I mean, look at the architecture. And 
there are very few startling pronouncements made from pulpits week 
to week, year to year, decade to decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irreverent humor can be both unsettling and subversive, and its  
purveyors scorned as impious or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``A humorist is a person who thinks otherwise,'' Bell said.  
``Well, thinking otherwise can get you into trouble in any 
establishment -- in the military, in most churches, in most 
educational institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pitfalls associated with thinking otherwise were very much  
on the minds of three editors who compiled the material for 
``Best-Loved Humor of the LDS People.'' (Kirby likes to call it, 
``The Correlation Committee-Approved Humor of the LDS People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, among the dozens of examples of humor from church leaders  
there is nothing in the book from church President Gordon B. 
Hinckley, known for his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said editor Jay Parry, ``He is delightful and he is very funny.  
But it's the kind of thing that you had to have been there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby credits Hinckley with sensing that Mormonism, in the midst  
of a global expansion, needs to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you assimilate all different types of people into one  
religion?'' It's best done through tolerance and making a human 
connection, he said, ``and humor for me is the best way to do 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Compromise Close on Olympic Bands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The chief executive for the Sydney  
Olympics has ruled out United States and Japanese school band 
members from the opening ceremony of next year's Summer Games but 
says a compromise deal is close to being finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Hollway met with United States, Japanese and Australian  
band leaders for nearly four hours at SOCOG's headquarters 
Thursday. While a compromise was close, he said, ``There is no hope 
that they will play in the Olympic opening ceremony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band leaders will meet with SOCOG again Friday to complete a  
deal which is likely to see the children perform at other Olympic 
venues and at Sydney landmarks such as the Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. band leader Roy Anthony, who before the meeting described a  
deal as unlikely and warned of possible legal action, reversed his 
stance by the end of the proceedings, saying he felt ``very 
comfortable'' with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The only detail confirmed was that the bands will be retained to  
play at various Olympic venues and in Sydney during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney's Olympic ticket drive has been drowned out by the  
marching band controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,300 Americans and 200 Japanese marching band members  
were booked to play at the opening ceremony only to be rejected 
after a public outcry in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by the band leaders, including those in  
Atlanta, ahead of Thursday's meeting with Hollway, described SOCOG 
president Michael Knight as ``harsh and insensitive'' over the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us has an invitation on SOCOG letterhead, signed by  
(ceremonies director) Ric Birch, indicating that we were to be a 
representative part of the 2000 piece marching band from around the 
Pacific Rim,'' the statement said. ``We also have a video 
presentation of Mr. Birch offering the same invitation to each of 
our students. We indicated to Mr. Knight that we feel that SOCOG is 
indeed involved in this concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also accused SOCOG of ``cultural hypocrisy'' for  
inviting Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti to open the Olympic 
basketball and gymnastics venues while dropping the bands because 
they are not Australians. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony said the children were invited last September to perform  
at the Sept. 16, 2000, opening ceremony and had been preparing ever 
since. He said the students had taken alternative courses in their 
studies to be ready for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students have been turned out for doing nothing wrong,''  
Anthony said. ``We were invited by SOCOG. We didn't solicit this. 
They asked us to come and be part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are going to have a hard time accepting that we've  
abided by all (SOCOG'S) demands and all their wishes and yet 
they're saying no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said of the compromise deal, ``It's a step down from the  
opening ceremony and no-one pretends otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to go to court we would strenuously defend our  
position but I don't believe that's likely,'' Knight said. ``I 
think we will reach the compromise, I think that the overwhelming 
majority of kids would like to embrace the compromise.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 78.51 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today amid rising interest  
rates and a mixed batch of second-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 0.95 at 11,186.41, having pared a loss of 95 points in the 
first hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators recovered from early declines. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.45 at 1,398.31, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 24.85 at 2,767.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices tumbled today, with the 30-year Treasury bond  
dropping 1/2 point in price and its yield rising to 6.08 percent from 
6.04 percent late Wednesday. The rising yield served as a reminder 
to investors that higher interest rates are taking hold in the 
buoyant economy, and could threaten earnings in future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages, seen as most vulnerable to interest rate  
increases, were among the big losers today. J.P. Morgan, a 
component of the Dow, fell 1 3/4 to 144 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks had risen to record levels in recent sessions, due  
largely to a strong outlook for second-quarter profits. But mixed 
earnings today put stocks on divergent paths. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric beat analysts' estimates by a penny. Its stock,  
which rose sharply Wednesday in advance of the report, slipped 9/16 
to 117 3/8 as investors locked in their profits from Wednesday's gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq drew some of its strength from Yahoo!, which rose 4 1/4 to  
171 5/16 after reporting earnings that topped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	But other companies continued to warn of weakness. Airborne  
Freight said late Wednesday it will miss analysts' expectations by 
as much as 18 cents per share. Its shares fell 1 11/16 to 25 1/2, and 
other package delivery company stocks fell along with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose 1 1/8 to 39. Its shares had dropped in late  
trading Wednesday afternoon after a Florida jury ruled that tobacco 
makers are liable for making a defective product that causes 
emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. The verdict, if it 
stands, is expected to cost the tobacco industry billions in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, analysts said the verdict was no real surprise.  
Investors bought back the stock on the belief that legal wrangling 
may delay payments to plaintiffs for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 254.7 million shares, 
ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.23 at 656.24, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.82 at 798.32.

<HEADLINE> Track Offers Drive Thru Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) -- You say you just don't have the time  
to gamble? A Texas race track is looking to make things a little 
easier -- with a drive-through. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, gamblers at Lone Star Park can play the horses  
the same way they buy fast food. The four service lanes are in the 
track parking lot, just off Belt Line Road, a main thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Lone Star is the nation's second thoroughbred track to offer  
drive-up windows, following Keeneland, a track in Lexington, Ky., 
that started similar service last year, Lone Star general manager 
Corey Johnsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The booths will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. on race days.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just drive right up and make your wagers and pay for them  
and off you go,'' Johnsen said. He promised face-to-face service, 
``no Jack-in-the-Box speakers or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One occasional bettor, Del Solis, said he likes the idea and is  
more likely to try his luck at the drive-through. ``Sometimes I 
can't be there when the race starts so this will make it easier,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Cox, executive director of the Texas Council on Problem and  
Compulsive Gambling, said the setup might make it a bit too easy 
for compulsive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to make it an impulse reaction as opposed to  
planned activity,'' she said. ``When it is a simple act to whip in 
and buy a ticket, it takes it out of the recreational category (of) 
capturing the beauty of animals and a real sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gamblers can also cash winning tickets at the windows. For  
security reasons, the most they can collect on a ticket at the 
window is $100. They will get a voucher to pick up the rest of 
their winnings inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old horse track was the state's first to offer cash  
machines for gamblers and has tried to make itself family friendly, 
with a playground and picnic grounds.

<HEADLINE> Girl, 13, Convicted of Plot To Kill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A 13-year-old girl faces up to  
eight years in a juvenile detention center after being convicted of 
plotting to kill teachers and students, then blow up her school. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot was discovered in April, just days after the massacre  
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-grader, whose name was not released because of her  
age, had made a hit list and drawn a map of Bair Middle School in 
Sunrise, with the location of security cameras and stick figures 
representing the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sabotage at the end of the year will be known as the South  
Florida massacre,'' she wrote in a letter outlining her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was found guilty Wednesday of soliciting at least seven  
people to help her carry out the killings. Sentencing was set for 
July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Kenneth Hassett said the incident was an  
immature child's attempt to get attention.

<HEADLINE> EEOC Sues Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has  
filed a lawsuit against Boeing, claiming the huge aerospace 
manufacturer unfairly withdrew job offers to applicants it believed 
had disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, alleges  
violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the cases of 
four Boeing job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	EEOC lawyer Michelle Gonzalez contended that in each case,  
Boeing declined to hire the applicant after a company-sponsored 
physical exam found evidence of some disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez said there was no medical justification for the  
company's conclusions in each case. In one case, she said, the 
worker's own doctor contradicted the diagnosis by Boeing's medical 
screener. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the Seattle-based company had  
not seen the lawsuit and would not comment until it had. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, seeks an injunction, back pay,  
penalties and possibly jobs for the applicants. It does not name a 
dollar amount.

<HEADLINE> ABC Radio Signs Matt Drudge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge is now a  
member of the ABC family -- although his hiring sparked a family 
feud. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Radio Networks has signed Drudge to anchor a two-hour weekly  
radio show that debuts Sunday, despite objections from the 
president of ABC News. ABC News, like the radio networks, is a 
division of ABC Inc., which made the final decision to hire Drudge. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will consist of topical commentary and listener  
call-ins, ABC said. Drudge is the author of the Internet site ``The 
Drudge Report,'' is host of a weekly television show on Fox News 
Channel, and has recently done a radio show for WABC in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt Drudge is an entertainment brand. He is considered  
separate from the news side of things,'' said Michelle Bleiberg, 
spokeswoman for ABC Radio Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Drudge's Web site was credited with first publicizing the story  
of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. But many 
journalists consider him more of a gossip columnist than a news 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Drudge was sued for defamation by former White House aide Sidney  
Blumenthal over a false report about Blumenthal's past. Drudge 
quickly retracted and apologized hours after sending out the item 
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News President David Westin strongly objected to Drudge's  
hiring, according to a network executive who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity, but he was ultimately overruled. Westin was not 
available for comment on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Drudge was not immediately available for comment on Thursday. He  
told The Washington Post the criticism from Westin ``doesn't bother 
me at all. Hopefully one day I can become an apple of his eye ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drudge's show will have its national debut on ABC-owned stations  
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta and 
Denver. The radio network is also syndicating the show to other 
stations.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Up; Wheat Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures prices advanced early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat futures were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans moved higher as investors continued to  
consolidate positions following sharp losses earlier this week. 
Prices were expected to face continued pressure, however, from 
forecasts for near-ideal Midwestern growing weather over the next 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were mixed, pressured by harvesting of the winter  
wheat crop, but supported by reports of increased export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was unchanged at $2.65 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.05 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/2 cents to $1.10 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1/2 cent to $4.23 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mixed, while feeder cattle futures  
retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures advanced 
strongly. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .42 cent to 62.45 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .65 cent to 76.70 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose 1.18 cents to 45.75 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
rose 3.58 cents to 39.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Take Over Mexican Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican financial regulators on Thursday took  
control of Grupo Financiero Serfin SA, the country's third largest 
financial services company and the largest yet to fall victim to 
the fallout of Mexico's 1994 peso collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The government Bank Savings Protection Institute said it would  
auction the company. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest step by the Mexican government to keep the  
fragile banking system afloat despite unpaid loans and volatile 
markets in the wake of the December 1994 peso devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover of Serfin was widely expected since last month. The  
bank had reported some $1.4 billion losses and financial regulators 
had ordered shareholders to inject fresh capital to cover about 
$1.4 billion in reserves, deferred taxes and obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting earlier Thursday, shareholders declined to do so  
and agreed to accept a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Bank Savings Protection Institute, known as  
IPAB, will oversee the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Serfin has 560 branches throughout Mexico, more than 12,000  
employees, 2.5 million clients and 13 percent of Mexico's banking 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the units of the financial group will be sold together,  
including its brokerage and insurance units, to increase the value 
of the sale, said IPAB executive secretary Vicente Corta. 
</P>
<P>
	However, pension fund manager Afore Garante, in which Serfin has  
a 51 percent stake, may be sold in a separate process. Afore 
Garante is also backed by Chilean pension fund manager Habitat, 
with a 9 percent stake, and Citigroup's local banking unit Citibank 
Mexico, with the remaining 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Serfin management will continue to run the institution  
and will pursue plans to reduce staff to 10,000 by the end of this 
year, increase deposits and intensify collection of bad loans, 
Corta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corta told a news conference that London-based HSBC Holdings PLC  
will retain its 19.9 percent stake in the group, at least until 
Serfin is auctioned between six and eight months from now. 
</P>
<P>
	He said HSBC was interested in participating in the auction, but  
declined to mention which other banks may take part. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have taken over about a dozen banks since  
the sudden peso devaluation sent interest rates soaring, leading to 
widespread defaults amid Mexico's worst economic setback since the 
Great Depression.

<HEADLINE> Drug Antitrust Suit Stays in Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government will proceed with a  
$120 million lawsuit accusing a generic drug maker of causing 
prices of two widely prescribed tranquilizers to skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan, in refusing Wednesday to  
dismiss the antitrust case, said the Federal Trade Commission may 
ask the court to permanently block the practices of Mylan 
Laboratories Inc. and award monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Mylan lawyers had argued that the remedies sought exceeded those  
permitted by law because the FTC's authorizing statute did not 
specifically allow them. Mylan also argued that the commission's 
authority to bring antitrust cases to court is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping alive the federal complaint, Hogan narrowed a  
companion claim filed by 31 states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC seeks at least $120 million for refunds to consumers of  
the two anti-anxiety drugs, lorazepam and clorazepate. The states 
did not set a price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gratified by the decision,'' FTC spokeswoman Victoria  
Streitfeld said. ``It's good news for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government accuses Mylan of cutting off competition by  
reaching an exclusive deal with a key supplier, Profarmaco S.R.L. 
of Milan, Italy. Other suppliers cannot make adequate quantities 
for Mylan's competitors, essentially shutting them out, the 
government argues. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuits, the exclusive deal caused prices of  
lorazepam and clorazepate to rise by more than 25 times virtually 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Mylan says the exclusive deal was designed to guarantee an  
uninterrupted source of ingredients. The company notes that prices 
for generic drugs still are much less than the amount brand-name 
manufacturers charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana G. Barnett, executive vice president for Mylan, said the  
Pittsburgh-based drug maker remained confident that it would 
prevail in a trial, which is not expected for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There remains no basis in fact for the FTC's charges against  
Mylan,'' he said. ``Mylan never had a monopoly in lorazepam or 
clorazepate, as the FTC charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan dismissed portions of the states' complaints that seek to  
recover damages from Mylan for purchases from its competitors. The 
states had argued that the competitors also were able to raise 
prices because of Mylan's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ruled that states cannot sue on behalf of  
indirect purchasers, such as wholesalers that buy the drugs from 
Mylan, unless state law specifically permits it. Those claims by 
several states were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors each year issue more than 18 million prescriptions for  
lorazepam, a generic version of Ativan, for treating anxiety, 
tension, agitation and insomnia. More than 3 million prescriptions 
for clorazepate are issued a year. Clorazepate, the generic version 
of Tranxene, is used to treat anxiety and hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	The states that filed the complaint are Alaska, Arkansas,  
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New 
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, 
Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Key Index in Japan Closes Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The approval of a supplementary budget by Japan's  
Cabinet boosted the key index on the Tokyo stock exchange today. 
The dollar edged higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 8.75 points,  
or 0.05 percent, to 17,967.65 at the close of trading. On 
Wednesday, the average closed down 91.83 points, or 0.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.38 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.42  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and slightly above its late New 
York level of 122.23 yen overnight. The U.S. currency ranged 
between 122.22 yen and 122.44 yen in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices rose after the Cabinet  
approved a supplementary budget worth $4.25 billion aimed at 
stimulating the ailing labor market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	They added, however, that investors were awaiting a second  
additional budget to pay for public works -- something Finance 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he won't consider until economic 
growth data for the April-June quarter is released later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds set aside in the proposed budget would go to finance  
the government's program to create about 720,000 jobs through 
measures such as subsidies to companies and nonprofit organizations 
hiring displaced workers, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget was still awaiting approval by Japan's Parliament.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders also noted that investors continued to cash in on the  
stock market's recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Nikkei added 202.59 points, or 1.13 percent,  
finishing at 18,135.06 -- its highest closing level since Sept. 25, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 7.93 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,469.09. The 
TOPIX closed down 1.70 points, or 0.11 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 597.15 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 644.96 million 
shares Wednesday. Declines outnumbered advances 698 to 488, while 
140 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar edged higher against the yen,  
benefiting from weakness in the euro, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0200 in late afternoon trading, down  
from $1.0243 late Wednesday in Tokyo. But it was up slightly from a 
low earlier in the day of dlrs 1.0186. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Japanese currency, the euro was quoted in late  
afternoon trading at 124.94 yen, down from 125.06 yen late 
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	While the dollar gained against the yen in the wake of the  
euro's decline, comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers limited the greenback's rise, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday in the United States, Summers warned  
Japan's central bank against intervening to prop up the U.S. 
currency -- something it has done several times in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's ``manipulation'' of its currency would not help restore  
prosperity, Summers said, adding that ``the focus in Japan has to 
be on strengthening the fundamentals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government has said it wants to limit the yen's  
rise, as a stronger Japanese currency makes the nation's exports 
more expensive abroad and reduces the yen value of companies' 
foreign profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell in late  
afternoon trading to 1.6250 percent from Wednesday's finish of 
1.6350 percent, driving its price up to 101.52 yen from 101.43 yen 
the previous day.

	Anti-Milosevic Protests Continue  
</P>
<P>
	PROKUPLJE, Yugoslavia (AP ) -- Opposition protesters kept up  
demands for President Slobodan Milosevic to resign, brawling	
briefly with a handful of his supporters and ignoring gunshots	
fired in the air to disrupt the demonstration. About 4,000 people	
demonstrated Thursday in the southern Serbian town of Prokuplje,	
the latest in a series of almost daily protests aimed at bringing	
down Milosevic. No one was seriously injured, but tensions soared	
as protesters and a handful of government supporters shoved each	
other and traded punches, while protest leaders and a few police	
appealed for calm.

	Research: Tea Reduces Heart Attack  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but  
researchers now say a daily cup of tea could do the job just as 
well, reducing the chance of a heart attack by 44 percent. The 
study by Dr. Michael Gaziano, a heart specialist at the Harvard 
Medical School-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, 
suggests that may be because tea contains powerful amounts of 
flavonoids, natural substances that make blood cells less prone to 
clots, which can cause heart attacks. Flavonoids also are one of 
the most powerful antioxidants, which offset the damaging effects 
of oxygen in the body, such as fatty deposits in the arteries.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist guerillas attacked a mobile army  
encampment in mountains just south of Colombia's capital Thursday, 
touching off fierce clashes that killed dozens of soldiers and 
rebels. The army claimed it had beaten back a guerrilla drive on 
Bogota, a modern city whose roughly 6 million inhabitants live 
relatively untouched by a 35-year civil conflict felt more directly 
in the poor countryside. There were conflicting estimates of each 
side's casualties in the combat, which began at dawn near 
Gutierrez, a small Andean town 27 miles south of Bogota.

	Las Vegas Streets Flooded by Heavy Rains

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavy rains poured on Las Vegas today, creating  
floods that smashed mobile homes, swallowed hundreds of cars and 
led to at least two deaths. ``It's a nightmare,'' said Nevada 
Highway Patrol spokesman Scott Flabi. ``It's one of the worst 
things I've ever seen.'' Sections of busy Interstate 15 resembled a 
lake, bringing traffic to a standstill. Most major intersections 
were under water. Block walls along a flood channel collapsed. 
Firefighters rescued motorists whose cars were sucked into the 
water.

<HEADLINE> Mrs Clinton Touring Upstate N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) -- Alysia Miller was hustling to finish  
her errands, but she paused on the sidewalk in this Adirondack 
Mountains village long enough to consider upstate New York's 
newfound national celebrity as a political proving ground. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Miller snorted at the idea that Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
semiformal debut as a New York Senate candidate this week is being 
billed as a ``listening tour through upstate New York.'' Albany, 
where Mrs. Clinton ends her campaign-style swing Friday, may be 
north of New York City, but it is still roughly 150 miles of mostly 
Republican real estate south of here. 
</P>
<P>
	``She says she wants to know us, but how can she? She's never  
been here,'' Ms. Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who filed preliminary campaign paperwork Tuesday  
but has not formally declared her candidacy, has never lived in New 
York. Her possible GOP rival in 2000, New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, has been trying to brand the first lady a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the hell does she know about New York State?'' asked Mike  
Campisi of Tupper Lake, N.Y., as he loaded purchases into the 
saddlebags of his motorcycle. ``I mean give me a break. She should 
run in Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's that bit of unpleasantness about the bugs. The  
New York media have been having fun for two weeks with the 
dismissive remark of a Hillary Clinton aide, quoted anonymously in 
the New York Daily News, apparently ruling out a Clinton family 
vacation in the ``fly-infested Adirondack Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's already insulted us,'' Ms. Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Adirondacks were one New York State locale mentioned this  
spring as a possible vacation destination for the Clintons, who are 
also said to be house hunting in and around New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, there are black flies in the Adirondacks, a vast state park  
in New York's ``North Country,'' and yes, they do bite. 
</P>
<P>
	But all in all, the dry spring and pesticides have made this a  
pretty trouble-free year, said Ray LaRose, from his post next to 
the Adirondacks fishing maps at the Blue Line sport shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that bad. We wouldn't have as many tourists as we do  
in the summer if it were. And we wouldn't have stayed as long as we 
have, either,'' said LaRose, a former GOP town supervisor in 
Saranac Lake and a 78-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Saranac Lake gained fame in the early decades of this century as  
a place to seek treatment for tuberculosis. Some of the ornate 
wooden sanatoria and ``cure cottages'' still stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Saranac Lake is mostly a summer resort. A bit threadbare in  
spots, the town is no stranger to either wealth or politics. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of prominent New York families have long kept cottages  
or ``camps'' here, and one of those summer homes is now owned by 
Monica Lewinsky's stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a buzz here last summer, owing to unconfirmed  
sightings of the former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the crack about the flies and the months of media  
speculation about Mrs. Clinton's possible Senate candidacy, there 
is a certain sense of fatigue already -- more than a year before the 
2000 election to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Edna Becker is a little sick of all the talk about Mrs. Clinton,  
but unlike others interviewed Wednesday, Mrs. Becker doesn't rule 
out voting for the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's better than that mayor of New York,'' Mrs.  
Becker said.

<HEADLINE> Greg Norman Gets Golf Clubs Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- A man charged with stealing two sets  
of clubs from golfer Greg Norman returned them when he realized 
they were ones Norman uses in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he knew at the time he'd stolen THE tournament  
clubs of Greg Norman,'' explained police Officer Bill Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he realized that, he ``panicked and brought them back,''  
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Jankowski, 22, was arrested Wednesday night and charged  
with grand theft and violation of probation for swiping the 
custom-made Cobra clubs from Norman's garage Saturday. Police said 
Jankowski had done work on Norman's roof about a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The clubs were returned to Norman before he left Tuesday for  
Scotland to prepare for the British Open, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman said he was ``very pleased to get my tournament clubs  
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jankowski remained behind bars Thursday without bond.

<HEADLINE> Panel Questions U.S. Arms Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government commission has concluded that the  
top levels of the U.S. government are poorly prepared to combat the 
threat of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons spreading around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel headed by John Deutch, former director of the Central  
Intelligence Agency, recommends appointment of a deputy to the 
National Security Council to coordinate prevention of such a crisis 
as well as preparations by various government agencies. The 
commission studied potential disasters and how government would 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been such a proliferation of technology that a new  
threat can emerge with little or no warning. We have to be prepared 
for it, and we're not,'' said Deutch in a telephone interview. He 
discussed the commission's findings after reports on some of its 
conclusions in The (Baltimore) Sun and The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission finds that the U.S. Government is not  
effectively organized to combat proliferation,'' the panel said in 
a summary of the 140-page report expected to be released next week, 
according to The Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Deutch, the Commission to Assess the Organization  
of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of 
Mass Destruction includes Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., vice chairman; 
former Reps. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., and Dave McCurdy, 
D-Okla.; Henry F. Cooper, former head of the Strategic Defense 
Initiative; former Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.; Ambassador Robert 
Gallucci, a Clinton appointee; and Daniel Poneman, who worked on 
national security matters for Presidents Carter and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Scenarios studied included a disgruntled Russian scientist  
selling nuclear-weapons fuel to Iran, or anthrax being released in 
a crowded subway. 
</P>
<P>
	``These events have not taken place. But they could,'' the panel  
warns. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly alarming are threats from economic problems in  
Russia. Seven times since 1992, weapons-grade nuclear materials 
have been stolen and the Russian government doesn't know how much 
material it has. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 threat that needs attention is the continual  
disintegration of Russia as a civil society,'' an unidentified 
commission member told The Sun. Deutch, however, said the report 
does not rank a variety of emerging threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dangers are posed by China's export of missiles, North  
Korea's ability to manufacture weapons, instability in the Middle 
East and Asia and terrorist efforts to obtain weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress created the panel 18 months ago to assess how the  
government is dealing with the threats and to offer 
recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Modifies GeoCities Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. modified the rules for its  
GeoCities Internet community after users called a boycott to 
protest a policy that appeared to claim rights to content posted on 
personal Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! announced the change on Wednesday through a message  
posted on the GeoCities site under the headline: ``We hear you!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yahoo does not claim ownership of content you place on your  
Yahoo GeoCities site,'' the message said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules give the company nonexclusive rights that can be  
used only to display and promote the Web sites of GeoCities users. 
In its previous guidelines, the company claimed to have 
``perpetual, irrevocable'' rights to any content posted on 
GeoCities pages, which often contain the work of professional 
photographers and writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry users created a boycott Web site, but called off the  
effort after Yahoo! changed its policy. 
</P>

for $3.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cipollini Again Sprints To Tour Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMIENS, France (AP) -- Mario Cipollini surged to victory in  
today's fifth stage of the Tour de France for his second 
consecutive stage triumph in cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian, known as ``Lion King'' and the ``King of Sprints,''  
is living up to his nicknames at this year's Tour after a slow 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Steels of Belgium finished second, followed by Estonian Jaan  
Kirsipuu, who retained the yellow leader's jersey for the fourth 
day. Robbie McEwen of Australia was fourth, and German Erik Zabel 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth stage was one of the longest of the Tour, a 145-mile  
ride through rolling wheat fields and past grand cathedrals like 
the Gothic masterpiece at Chartres, with its famed stained-glass 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Wednesday, when a favorable tailwind led to a record  
speed for the stage, the riders faced a headwind today and the 
average speed was nearly 6 miles slower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, Steels moved up to second and Stuart  
O'Grady was third. Lance Armstrong, on the comeback from testicular 
cancer, was fourth, and Cipollini fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was marked by an early breakaway, this time at the  
2-mile mark. A group of 10 riders made the break, instigated by 
Frenchman Jacky Durand and his Belgian teammate on Lotto-Mobistar, 
Thierry Marechal. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had as much as a 6-minute, 15-second lead, but that  
soon was whittled down by the advancing pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Magnus Backstedt held a brief lead near the end, but  
was soon overtaken, and the race was set for another furious, 
wide-open sprint. Cipollini's Saeco teammates again moved him into 
position, and the Italian sprinted to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Cipollini chose the former home of French kings to  
win the fastest stage in tour history. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Montoya Nearing Rookie Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELKHART LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- The CART FedEx Championship Series  
season reaches the halfway point with Sunday's Texaco/Havoline 200 
and Juan Montoya already is closing in on some impressive records. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, a 23-year-old Colombian, replaced Alex Zanardi after  
the two-time PPG Cup champion returned to Formula One this season. 
Since taking over the seat at Target/Chip Ganassi Racing, ``The 
Great Juan'' has been sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	He has four poles and four wins in his first nine CART events.  
That is one victory short of the rookie record of five, set by 
Nigel Mansell in 1993. Mansell also set the record of seven poles 
by a first-year driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya has led in eight races this season, for a total of 564  
laps at the front of the pack. That puts him within easy reach of 
Zanardi's rookie record, set in 1996, of 610 laps led. 
</P>
<P>
	``Records are nice, but I am just trying to be consistent,''  
Montoya said. ``If we keep doing things the way we have been, then 
the records will come. But the championship is most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya has the lead in that race, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The kid, who was last year's European Formula 3000 champion,  
holds a 112 to 87 points lead over Gil de Ferran in the series 
standings. Dario Franchitti is third with 85, followed by 
three-time Road America winner Michael Andretti with 78. 
</P>
<P>
	``The championship is still wide open,'' Andretti said. ``There  
are 11 more races to go, but this is the time to start gathering 
some points and keep Montoya from building up too big a lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race on the four-mile road course is the first in a stretch  
of six events in seven weeks, the busiest part of the 20-race CART 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	This is another new track for Montoya, but that hasn't stopped  
him from shining on any of the other road or street circuits he has 
seen for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya won from the pole on the temporary street circit in Long  
Beach, Calif.; he finished second from the pole on the natural 
terrain road course in Portland, Ore.; and he won from the pole two 
weeks ago on the temporary road course at Cleveland's Burke 
Lakefront Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he earned 59 of a possible 66 points in those three  
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Road racing is what I grew up with,'' Montoya said. ``I like  
the ovals. They are new and fun, but the road circuits are more 
familiar and a little easier for me to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is looking forward to racing at Road America, the longest and  
fastest of CART's road circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested here and I loved it,'' Montoya said.  
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who earned his first CART victory last year at Road  
America, feels much the same way about the track. His win ignited a 
run that carried Franchitti to two more victories and moved him 
from eighth to third in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Elkhart,'' Franchitti said. ``It's a fun track to drive  
on. It's long, it's fast and it's interesting. Even if you don't 
win, it's a great place to race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and provisional qualifying are scheduled Friday.

<HEADLINE> Online Racial Divide Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The disparity on the Internet between whites  
and black and Hispanic Americans is growing toward a ``racial 
ravine,'' in many cases even after accounting for differences in 
income, a new government report said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department's latest survey, ``Falling Through the  
Net,'' showed dramatic gains in the number of Americans who own 
computers and use the Internet. But it also cited money, education 
and whether a person lives in an urban area as key factors 
affecting whether they use technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Net is increasingly becoming part of our national heritage  
-- for some people,'' said Larry Irving, a Commerce undersecretary 
and President Clinton's top telecommunications adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Most troubling for government experts were indications these  
disparities can't be blamed solely on differences in income. Among 
families earning $15,000 to $35,000, for example, more than 33 
percent of whites owned computers, but only 19 percent of blacks 
did -- and that gap has widened nearly 62 percent since 1994 despite 
plunging computer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when holding income constant, there is still a yawning  
divide among different races and origins,'' the report said, 
warning of a society in which ``the 'haves' have only become more 
information-rich ... while the 'have-nots' are lagging even further 
behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Ruffin of Columbia, Mo., who is black, bought a computer  
for her family two months ago because she believed her four 
daughters needed Internet access to succeed in school. But the 
costs were steep: her new computer, monthly telephone charges, 
monthly Internet fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black children are already behind, already at a  
disadvantage,'' Mrs. Ruffin said. ``If everyone else is on the 
Internet, getting an advantage, then black children need access. 
... (But) I don't see many black parents understanding the 
importance of it. They have other things more important on their 
minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government survey also found, predictably, that as income  
rises, the likelihood of PC ownership and Internet use also rises. 
Families with incomes above $75,000 were more than five times as 
likely to own a computer at home and 10 times more likely to have 
Internet access than families who earned less than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	And the gaps in computer ownership and Internet use narrowed  
between white families and blacks and Hispanics earning more than 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a way to buy your way out,'' said Irving, adding that  
falling computer prices will continue to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Other key findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--About 47 percent of all whites own computers, but fewer than  
half as many blacks do. About 25.5 percent of Hispanics own 
computers, but 55 percent of Asians do. Asian families also are 
most likely to have Internet access, with 36 percent online. 
</P>
<P>
	--A child in a low-income white family is three times more likely  
to have Internet access as a child in a comparable black family and 
four times more likely than a Hispanic child. 
</P>
<P>
	--People with college degrees are more than eight times more  
likely to own a computer and 16 times more likely to have Internet 
access than people with elementary school educations. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, the third such survey by the government since 1995,  
did not suggest specific ways to encourage Internet use or computer 
ownership except to recommend continuing to provide online access 
at community centers, such as schools, libraries and other 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows minorities to come into an area that's populated by  
themselves and learn how to use the technology,'' agreed Willie 
Atterberry, chairman of the AfroNet Web site and magazine in Los 
Angeles. ``You don't have to worry about going to Silicon Valley. 
It comes to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech Corp. and the National Urban League announced  
Wednesday they will spend $350,000 to build five new Internet 
community centers in Aurora, Ill., Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis 
and Milwaukee. And 3Com Corp. said it will spend $1 million in 
donated equipment and training in 10 cities to help teach students 
to be computer network engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the information age, there cannot be two separate  
societies,'' said Milton Little of the Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry experts suggested that minorities might also be  
discouraged by computers and the Internet as difficult to learn, or 
at least consider the Web a medium whose benefits haven't been 
sufficiently explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think the advantage of being online has been  
instilled in them,'' said Trevor Farrington, a director at the 
Massachusetts-based African American Internetwork, a Web site aimed 
at blacks. ``I really don't think they understand it. They think 
it's too technical, (but) it's as easy to use as TV and it's 
better. Once they understand that, it should grow.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady May Seek Husband's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday  
that she would ask her husband, President Clinton, to do some 
campaigning for her if she moves forward with a New York Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows a lot about New York,'' she said. ``He's done very  
well in New York and I would look forward to his campaigning for me 
if I decide to run ... (and) if I can get on his schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters on the second day of her inaugural  
campaign tour of New York, Mrs. Clinton said she would serve a full 
six-year term if she wins the Democratic nomination and is elected 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, eyeing the Republican Senate  
nomination, has refused to say whether he would serve the entire 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of both have questioned whether Mrs. Clinton and  
Giuliani want to use the Senate as a stepping stone for a White 
House bid in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	At a health care discussion with employees the Bassett  
Healthcare Center, Mrs. Clinton said her experience as architect of 
the Clinton administration's failed health care reform effort 
convinced her that progress toward universal health care must be 
made incrementally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, coming out of that experience I remain committed to  
the idea of providing quality, affordable health care for every 
American, but I now come from the school of smaller steps,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she stopped for lunch, fittingly, in the village of  
Clinton, where she was greeted by a crowd of more than 500. Among 
them was Gilda Mazzura, who held a hand-lettered sign that read: 
``I'm 92 and I'll vote 4-U.'' Mrs. Clinton hugged the elderly 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	She paused to sign 13-year-old Zach Kussin's leg cast. He fell  
off his bike and broke his leg last month. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the crowd was welcoming, one person held a sign  
that read, ``Go back to Arkansas.'' Mrs. Clinton has never lived or 
worked in New York, prompting charges from some Republicans, 
including Giuliani, that she is a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
	In Utica, Mrs. Clinton talked with senior citizens and others.  
After a member of the audience remarked that she would still be 
repaying the cost of her college education when she became a senior 
citizen, Mrs. Clinton said, ``I have long favored making college 
tuition tax deductible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's junior senator, Democrat Charles Schumer, had made  
the tuition tax deduction proposal a centerpiece of his successful 
campaign last year to unseat the Republican incumbent, Alfonse 
D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton formed a committee earlier this week aimed at  
exploring a possible Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	She told reporters that forming the exploratory committee ``is  
not the final step'' and that she wanted to make sure that New 
Yorkers ``are receptive and willing to support me and my ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while Mrs. Clinton said she was enjoying the campaigning,  
she conceded ``it is a different feeling to be the person who is in 
the spotlight voluntarily and speaking on my own behalf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, she said she is in favor of the death penalty  
as ``appropriate for society,'' but added that she was not ``an 
enthusiastic death penalty supporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton refused to answer a question about whether she  
thought Giuliani had been a good mayor. ``That is something for the 
people of New York to decide,'' she said. She also refused to say 
how she differed from Giuliani politically, claiming ``there will 
be plenty of time in a campaign to go into that.'' In fact, the two 
agree on such things as support for abortion and gay rights and gun 
control.

<HEADLINE>  Theo Fleury Signs With Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Six-time All-Star Theo Fleury, expected to help  
fill a void created by Wayne Gretzky's retirement, signed Thursday 
with the New York Rangers as an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old right wing, who played all or part of 11 NHL  
seasons for the Calgary Flames before being traded to the Colorado 
Avalanche in March, said he had some contact with Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pointed out the good things about New York and talked about  
his experiences of playing in New York,'' Fleury said during a 
conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers announced it was a multiyear contract, but declined  
to disclose any details. Reportedly, the deal was for at least four 
years at $8 million to $10 million per year with an option for a 
fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, however, said, ``At the end of three years. it will give  
me a good idea if I can keep playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there was a no-trade clause in the contract  
``because I'm a guy who likes to know where I'm going to be from 
year to year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche did not want to give Fleury a no-trade deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no bitter feelings against Colorado,'' he said. ``I was  
excited to be in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had five goals and 12 assists in 18 playoff games for the  
Avalanche, who were beaten in seven games by Dallas in the Western 
Conference finals. His numbers for the season were 40 goals and 53 
assists in 75 games. He has 374 goals and 480 assists in his 
regular-season career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be a Ranger,'' Fleury said, adding he was  
surprised and impressed by a trip to Winnipeg to talk to him by 
Neil Smith, president and general manager of the Rangers, and Dave 
Checketts, president and CEO of Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far they've gone out and improved the team tremendously  
since last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who failed to make the playoffs last season,  
earlier signed free agents Valeri Kamensky, a left wing for the 
Avalanche, and Stephane Quintal, a defenseman, who played for the 
Montreal Canadiens.

<HEADLINE> Eddie Jones Sues Ex-Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets guard Eddie Jones has sued  
his former agent, saying that a former employee of the agent stole 
more than $1 million from Jones and has not repaid all the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in April in U.S. District Court in Camden,  
N.J., claims that a former bookkeeper and assistant of agent Sal 
DiFazio stole the money from Jones by depositing it in the accounts 
of two other professional basketball clients of the company. The 
suit doesn't explain how the money was later taken from those 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Atlantic Sports Management Inc. and DiFazio  
have repaid about $960,000 to Jones, a former Temple University 
player. Jones, who also seeks more than $500,000 in compensatory 
damages and interest, contends he is still owed more than $540,000. 
</P>
<P>
	DiFazio disputes the dollar figure, saying an auditor for  
Atlantic Sports has told him the amount is ``substantially less.'' 
He has until July 19 to file a response with the federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have taken every possible measure to correct the problem  
after the fact, including repaying all the monies which were known 
to be misappropriated'' DiFazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' attorney and current agent, Leon Rose, refused to comment  
because the case is in litigation. He said Rose was in Florida 
running a basketball camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims that two checks totaling $302,802 were drawn  
on Jones' checking account and deposited between March and May 
1998, into the account of another player, Aaron McKie. A third 
check for $89,500 was deposited into player Marc Jackson's account. 
The suit doesn't explain how the money was taken from those 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also claimed that beginning in 1996, certain agents and  
officers of Atlantic Sports, including bookkeeper Debi Donnelly, 
began working together to systematically steal from Jones' 
accounts. It doesn't specify how much else was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged fraud came to light in October 1998, when Jones  
requested an audit. He ended all contractual relationships with 
DiFazio Jan. 20.

<HEADLINE>  3 Track Records Broken in 21 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With three of track and field's most prestigious  
world records broken in 21 days, and the possibility of more to 
come, the sport is buzzing in the buildup to next month's World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Records have fallen in succession in the men's 100 meters,  
decathlon and mile, setting standards in the defining sprint, 
multi-event and middle-distance disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj smashed the mile record Wednesday  
night at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, clocking 3 minutes, 43.13 
seconds, slicing 1.26 seconds off Noureddine Morceli's 6-year-old 
mark of 3:44.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Noah Ngeny, a 20-year-old Kenyan, also ran under the previous  
record, finishing second in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday at Prague, Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic broke  
Dan O'Brien's 7-year-old record in the decathlon. Dvorak amassed 
8,994 points, beating O'Brien's mark by 103 points and falling just 
short of the ``magical barrier'' of 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The record spree began June 16 at Athens, Greece, where Maurice  
Greene ran 9.79 in the 100, eclipsing Donovan Bailey's 1996 record 
of 9.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene kept up his scintillating season by running 9.85 at Rome,  
equaling the third-fastest 100 in history. It was the fastest time 
ever run without being a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Records in those and other events could be threatened during the  
course of the summer, which includes the World Championships at 
Seville, Spain, Aug. 20-29. 
</P>
<P>
	Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation, said the sport is going through ``a magical moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These record results are incredible, and let's hope it  
continues,'' he told The Associated Press. ``It's important that we 
have a big turnover of stars, and from a range of countries. The 
sport keeps evolving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj broke the mile record on the same track where he set  
the 1,500-meter mark of 3:26.00 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After being helped by Kenyan pacemakers Robert Kibet and William  
Tanui until the bell lap, El Guerrouj found himself in a thrilling 
head-to-head duel in the final lap with Ngeny, who broke Jim Ryun's 
world junior record two years ago. El Guerrouj finished just a 
couple of strides ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Moroccan joined a select group who have held the  
mile and 1,500-meter records at the same time, including former 
British stars Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj will next run at Nice July 17, when he will attack  
the 2,000-meter record, held by Morceli. Then he plans to try and 
better his 1,500 mark in a Golden League meet at Paris July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, El Guerrouj has designs on Haile Gebrselassie's  
world record for the 5,000 of 12:19.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Prince of the Desert,'' El Guerrouj has assumed  
the mantle of his great Moroccan predecessor, Said Aouita. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hold every record that Aouita did,'' he said. ``I  
want to be the strongest in the world at all distances between 
1,500 meters and 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was Said Aouita, then Morceli. Now it's the hour of  
Hicham. Now I believe only the clock can beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj has won world 1,500-meter titles indoors and  
outdoors, holds world records at 1,500 indoors and outdoors, and 
holds the indoor mile record. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major title missing from his collection is an Olympic  
gold medal. He tripped and fell during the 1996 Olympic 1,500-meter 
final when he was favored for the gold. After El Guerrouj's fall,

<HEADLINE> Farm Bureau Seeks Aid For Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) -- The American Farm Bureau Federation on  
Thursday called on Congress to approve $5 billion in additional 
federal aid to supplement a $4 billion package for farmers 
suffering a deepening financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau's ``AgRecovery Action Plan'' calls on lawmakers  
to provide $2 billion to boost exports of farm products, $2 billion 
to reform and expand a federal safety net for farmers suffering 
from prices that are spiraling lower and $5 billion to ``help 
farmers cope with the growing cost of complying with federal 
regulatory mandates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau in the past has criticized the Clinton  
administration for slapping trade sanctions on some countries that 
import large amounts of American commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has worked to address those complaints by  
allowing exemptions for farm products to such countries as Iran and 
Libya. But critics contend more must be done to actually boost U.S. 
exports around the world in the face of subsidized programs in 
Europe and elsewhere that make American products appear more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions outlined in the Farm Bureau's plan ``are needed  
to immediately halt the human toll the farm crisis is taking in 
rural America and to prevent further economic disasters from 
destroying America's family-based system of agriculture,'' said 
Farm Bureau President Dean Kleckner. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronomists predict American farmers are on track for another  
bumper crop this year, which could inflate inventories already at 
their highest in years because of weaker-than-normal export demand 
and heavy competition from competing foreign growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures on Thursday tumbled below $2 a bushel on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, settling at their lowest price for spot 
delivery since 1987. Soybean and wheat futures prices tumbled to 
their lowest since the early 1970s.

<HEADLINE> NBC, GE Equity Up ValueVision Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- NBC and GE Equity have doubled their  
stake in ValueVision International Inc. to nearly 40 percent by 
exercising warrants to purchase about $175 million worth of stock 
in the direct marketer. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies, both divisions of General Electric Co.,  
already owned a 19.9 percent stake in ValueVision. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, announced Wednesday, ``is a huge credibility boost  
for ValueVision,'' said Bob Evans, an analyst with Craig-Hallum 
Capital Group in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision announced earlier this week that it had boosted its  
television reach by 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1991, ValueVision for years floundered as the  
nation's third-largest home shopping network, behind QVC and the 
Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the past year, under new chairman and CEO Gene McCaffery,  
ValueVision has expanded from late-night television sales into 
other avenues of retailing, particularly electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from ValueVision, NBC and GE Equity, as well as  
analysts, say the world of broadcast and cable television and the 
Internet are quickly converging to create a powerful retail selling 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a world of increasing convergence, the importance of  
electronic shopping opportunities via the television should grow 
dramatically,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC Cable and an NBC 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers can view merchandise on television and then order  
online. Or viewers can buy merchandise tied to NBC programming on 
VVTV, or via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffery believes ValueVision now will be in an ideal position  
to sell to both Internet shoppers and TV home shoppers.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Leaders Suggest Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake Olympics leaders briefed board  
members today on $113 million worth of cuts to the $1.43 billion 
budget for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney and chief  
operating officer Fraser Bullock said the cuts will shrink a $300 
million shortfall to $187 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney was confident of raising enough money to cover the  
smaller shortfall. He has been traveling around the country to meet 
with potential corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their interest in the games is not shadowed by the scandal,''  
Romney told the SLOC board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the budget cuts, Romney said SLOC will add two full-time  
sales people to drum up sponsorships. ``One thing you never cut 
back on is the people knocking on doors selling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock emphasized that ``our first and foremost objective is to  
have great games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' cuts are expected to be adopted by trustees in  
September, lowering the budget to $1.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident we're not going to be leaving unpaid bills for  
taxpayers or anyone else,'' Romney told a press conference 
Wednesday. ``We're back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed cutbacks come after a dollar-by-dollar review of  
the budget, said Bullock, who also serves as its chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, Bullock said, was to slice everything but essential  
spending for athletes and to leave a legacy for Utah's youth. 
</P>
<P>
	The new budget would leave intact SLOC's $59 million repayment  
for sports facilities and a $40 million endowment for their 
operation after the games. It also would allow U.S. athletes to 
train at the Utah Winter Sports Park between now and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Although an uproar from athletes caused Romney to back off from  
his earlier suggestion that the Utah Winter Sports Park be closed 
at long stretches before the Olympics, the park will skip building 
renovations and equipment purchases to save more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC's managers came up with $169 million in cuts, but $56  
million of those are offset by added costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the additions corrected mistakes in the original budget  
written last year. It also includes such unforeseen costs as $5 
million in legal expenses because of the U.S. Justice Department's 
investigation of Salt Lake's bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of the bid committee, the predecessor to the SLOC,  
have been accused of spending lavishly on International Olympic 
Committee members during the city's quest for the games, sparking 
scandal and now reform in the Olympic world. The Justice Department 
has been investigating for more than seven months but has not 
brought criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune said today that the federal investigators  
have delivered the case to Justice Department prosecutors. The 
newspaper said the next phase could take weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to investigate,''Justice spokesman Brian Steel  
said. ``There is no timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget cuts being proposed by the SLOC leaders include items  
amounting to $72 million that they would like to restore if the 
money can be found. The budget keeps a $136 million contingency in 
case expenses are higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed cutbacks are diverse.  
</P>
<P>
	There would be no information booths for spectators unless some  
group in the community steps forward, and the SLOC would spend $5 
million less on opening, closing and other ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC would cut $2.3 million out of its budget for housing  
games officials, including a portion of IOC members' rooms, and 
$300,000 out of the opening IOC session before the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the number of test events -- athletic contests that give  
staffers a chance to practice -- will be cut from 56 to 52, and the 
full staff, including volunteers, will work at only 17 of those, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only those employees who need to learn from the games in Sydney,  
Australia next summer will attend, and when members of the Olympic 
community come to Utah, they can expect fewer dinners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the budget analysis has been good for pinpointing  
ways money doesn't need to be spent. For example, $5.4 million is 
proposed to be cut from the telecommunications budget, in part 
because a sponsor donated excess cellular phones that bus drivers 
can use rather than radios. 
</P>
<P>
	An expensive and sophisticated software program for tracking  
personnel, which has failed at two prior games, can be replaced 
with off-the-shelf business software, Bullock said. ``I said, 
'simplify, simplify, simplify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the cuts are proposed in two areas: getting  
rid of $38 million worth of inflation cushion and saving $30 
million in staff expenses, essentially 18 percent of what was 
budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the committee has not yet put a number on the  
proposed staff size, since volunteers -- many of them executives on 
loan -- will replace workers and some of the savings comes in hiring 
people later than planned. The SLOC had expected to employ 750 at 
games time. 
</P>
<P>
	On the revenue side, Bullock said staff is considering selling  
more tickets. At present, 55 percent of the 1.6 million event 
tickets will be up for sale after the world's Olympic community and 
media use 45 percent.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Man Charged in Terrorism Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors have charged a New Jersey man with  
lying to a federal grand jury investigating the World Trade Center 
bombing and other terrorist activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafa Elnore, 39, was arrested at his Jersey City, N.J., home  
and charged with 10 counts accusing him of giving false testimony 
about his attendance at firearms training and participation in 
bomb-making activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment unsealed Wednesday said Elnore lied to a grand  
jury investigating terrorism in the United States, including the 
Feb. 26, 1993, World Trade Center bombing that killed six people 
and injured more than 1,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Elnore was questioned in late 1997 and early 1998 as the grand  
jury turned its attention to terrorist groups linked to the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Elnore has denied any wrongdoing, said his lawyer, Mahmoud  
Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Elnore faces a maximum sentence of five years in  
prison on each count. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also are investigating whether Elnore was involved  
in a conspiracy to murder Rabbi Meir Kahane nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Elnore denied knowing anything about a plot to kill Kahane, the  
leader of the Jewish Defense League who was slain Nov. 5, 1990 in a 
Manhattan hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, El Sayyid A. Nosair, was acquitted of the murder in  
a 1991 state trial, but was convicted in 1995 on a federal charge 
of murder in aid of racketeering. He was sentenced to life in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices slipped moderately Friday  
morning as investors took profits amid a lack of new evidence of 
recovery in Japan's economy. The dollar edged up against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 97.64 points,  
or 0.54 percent, to 17,840.01 points at the end of the morning 
session. On Thursday, the average gained 8.75 points, or 0.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.62 yen in late morning, up 0.24 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and marginally above its late New York level 
of 122.61 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices started lower following a decline on Wall Street.  
Prices also suffered some investor concern about the outcome of the 
``special quotation'' settlement for July Nikkei option contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a lack of new signs about the health of the Japanese  
economy, analysts said the quotation shouldn't push the benchmark 
average too far from Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really are no real incentives for investors to buy or  
sell this morning,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the 
stock division at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	And while approval of a supplementary budget by Japan's Cabinet  
gave stocks a boost Thursday, analysts said the market is already 
looking for a second spending package. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, investors were cashing in on the stock market's  
recent rally, which saw the Nikkei index hit an almost two-year 
high of 18,135.06 points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 11.81 points, or 0.80 percent, to 1,457.28. 
The TOPIX fell 7.93 points, or 0.54 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar changed little from its late New  
York level as many investors remained on the sidelines ahead of the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said dollar-selling interest among players seems to be  
fading somewhat, but the greenback's rise will be capped as 
enthusiasm for purchasing the currency is also waning. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 125.34 yen, up from  
124.94 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6750 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6350 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.08 yen from 101.43 yen.

<HEADLINE>  3 Track Records Broken in 21 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With three of track and field's most prestigious  
world records broken in 21 days, and the possibility of more to 
come, the sport is buzzing in the buildup to next month's World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Records have fallen in succession in the men's 100 meters,  
decathlon and mile, setting standards in the defining sprint, 
multi-event and middle-distance disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj smashed the mile record Wednesday  
night at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, clocking 3 minutes, 43.13 
seconds, slicing 1.26 seconds off Noureddine Morceli's 6-year-old 
mark of 3:44.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Noah Ngeny, a 20-year-old Kenyan, also ran under the previous  
record, finishing second in 3:43.40. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday at Prague, Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic broke  
Dan O'Brien's 7-year-old record in the decathlon. Dvorak amassed 
8,994 points, beating O'Brien's mark by 103 points and falling just 
short of the ``magical barrier'' of 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The record spree began June 16 at Athens, Greece, where Maurice  
Greene ran 9.79 in the 100, eclipsing Donovan Bailey's 1996 record 
of 9.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene kept up his scintillating season by running 9.85 at Rome,  
equaling the third-fastest 100 in history. It was the fastest time 
ever run without being a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Records in those and other events could be threatened during the  
course of the summer, which includes the World Championships at 
Seville, Spain, Aug. 20-29. 
</P>
<P>
	Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation, said the sport is going through ``a magical moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These record results are incredible, and let's hope it  
continues,'' he told The Associated Press. ``It's important that we 
have a big turnover of stars, and from a range of countries. The 
sport keeps evolving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj broke the mile record on the same track where he set  
the 1,500-meter mark of 3:26.00 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After being helped by Kenyan pacemakers Robert Kibet and William  
Tanui until the bell lap, El Guerrouj found himself in a thrilling 
head-to-head duel in the final lap with Ngeny, who broke Jim Ryun's 
world junior record two years ago. El Guerrouj finished just a 
couple of strides ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Moroccan joined a select group who have held the  
mile and 1,500-meter records at the same time, including former 
British stars Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj will next run at Nice July 17, when he will attack  
the 2,000-meter record, held by Morceli. Then he plans to try and 
better his 1,500 mark in a Golden League meet at Paris July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, El Guerrouj has designs on Haile Gebrselassie's  
world record for the 5,000 of 12:19.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Prince of the Desert,'' El Guerrouj has assumed  
the mantle of his great Moroccan predecessor, Said Aouita. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hold every record that Aouita did,'' he said. ``I  
want to be the strongest in the world at all distances between 
1,500 meters and 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was Said Aouita, then Morceli. Now it's the hour of  
Hicham. Now I believe only the clock can beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj has won world 1,500-meter titles indoors and  
outdoors, holds world records at 1,500 indoors and outdoors, and 
holds the indoor mile record. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major title missing from his collection is an Olympic  
gold medal. He tripped and fell during the 1996 Olympic 1,500-meter 
final when he was favored for the gold. After El Guerrouj's fall, 
Morceli went to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Double Olympic champion Michael Johnson, meanwhile, looks to be  
back in top form, after a quadriceps injury kept him out of the USA 
Championships. He won the 200 meters at Rome in 19.93, his first 
sub-20 clocking since setting the world record of 19.32 at the 1996 
Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson plans to attack the 400 record of 43.29, held for 11  
years by Butch Reynolds.

<HEADLINE> Governor's Affair Focus in Miss. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- With Mississippi's lame duck governor on  
the defensive after admitting to an extramarital affair, the 
crowded field vying to replace him in January is banking on voters 
wanting to restore dignity to the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice, who is barred from seeking a third  
term, first denied then confessed in June to having an affair with 
the sweetheart of his teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 65-year-old Fordice, who has had a rocky relationship with  
the Legislature and the media the past eight years, announced he 
wanted a divorce from his wife of 44 years so he could marry Ann 
Creson of Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all the eight Democrats and six Republicans on the  
Aug. 3 primary ballot have been boasting of their strong marriages, 
their happy children and their small-town values. 
</P>
<P>
	Claudine Gary, 70, who is active in GOP politics in Leflore  
County, said Fordice's affair ``has armed (candidates) with 
something to throw stones at. I flinch more from that than anything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issues are few. Mississippi's economy -- fueled by the gambling  
industry and its spinoff businesses -- is booming. Unemployment 
outside the perennially impoverished Delta has hovered around 4 
percent, the lowest in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the boom going while improving public education and  
reducing crime have been the main focus of the campaign, as they 
were in the last two elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest among voters is flagging, even though the offices of  
governor and lieutenant governor are both being vacated for the 
first time in eight years. Recent polls show undecided voters make 
up as much as 30 percent of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the gubernatorial election is Democratic Lt. Gov.  
Ronnie Musgrove's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a boyish sincerity to him,'' said Marty Wiseman, a  
political scientist at Mississippi State University. ``He's got 
enough country in him that he doesn't come across as a slick city 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Supreme Court Justice Jim Roberts, a balding, stout  
54-year-old Democrat, acknowledges he is far behind Musgrove. The 
attorney, who is in his first statewide race, has worked in 
Mississippi's youth courts and ran the state Highway Patrol in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, the candidates all tout conservative themes  
and show unanimity on the issues of education and crime -- for the 
former and against the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Parker, 49, a former congressman, is considered the  
front-runner, mainly because he leads in fund raising. Despite 10 
years in Congress, Parker has spent considerable energy on 
improving his name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Briggs, 49, is fighting to overcome the loss he suffered  
in 1995, when Musgrove unseated the Republican as lieutenant 
governor.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Stocks Down After Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Just seven months after agreeing to pay states more  
than $200 billion, the tobacco industry faces another potentially 
massive award -- this time to hundreds of thousands of smokers 
suffering from emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Wednesday held the nation's five largest tobacco  
companies liable for making a defective product in the first 
class-action lawsuit by smokers ever to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco stocks were generally lower today.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury found that the industry ``engaged in extreme and  
outrageous conduct ... with the intent to inflict severe emotional 
distress,'' which could support an award of punitive damages in the 
trial's next phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Those damages could exceed even the national settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	``The verdict will almost certainly be regarded as a landmark in  
finally holding the tobacco industry accountable for the damage it 
does in addicting children and in causing tobacco-related 
disease,'' said Bill Novelli, president of the Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1994 on behalf of as many as 500,000  
sick Florida smokers and the heirs of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the jury decides what, if any, damages should be awarded to  
the lawsuit's nine representative class members, then the 
half-million other members will be free to seek recovery. The 
plaintiffs are seeking at least $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Other verdicts against the industry have been reversed, and some  
analysts predict the cigarette companies may be able to dismantle 
the class-action -- have it ``decertified'' on appeal -- in order to 
fight individual claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the industry does not get the case decertified, then this  
would be a stepping stone to a very large number of awards against 
the industry,'' said Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	A class-action typically is created to avoid wasting time  
litigating similar claims by numerous plaintiffs. Cigarette makers 
have argued the technique isn't appropriate in smoker cases because 
there are too many issues unique to each plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adelman, tobacco analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,  
said he expects the class will be decertified and that the case 
``is going to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it is not decertified, it will break down into a  
lawsuit for each and every smoker,'' Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry will be allowed to raise defenses in the next phase  
of the case that it wasn't able to raise in the first phase, such 
as whether the individual smokers assumed the risk of smoking 
knowing it was unhealthy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only five  
times -- three were overturned on appeal and the two others are 
being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the jury heard eight months of testimony and had  
thousands of industry documents garnered over decades of tobacco 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Former surgeons general, ex-tobacco industry scientists and  
doctors testified about the havoc smoking can wreak on the body, 
the difficulty in trying to quit and the manufacturers' refusal to 
cooperate with health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry claimed there is no scientific proof that smoking  
causes any illness and that the public is well aware that smoking 
is risky. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury agreed with the smokers on all counts, including  
their claims that the industry deceived them about the dangers of 
smoking, hid research results, stopped scientific work that 
promised to produce safer cigarettes and advertised to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs and family members openly wept and hugged each other  
as the verdict was read in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye barred lawyers in the case from  
discussing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were the nation's five biggest cigarette makers  
and two industry groups: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett 
Group Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers, but it does not prohibit lawsuits by 
individuals such as this one. 
</P>
<P>
	At today's court session, lawyers disagreed about when the jury  
should come back to consider damages. Lawyers for the smokers 
suggested two weeks, but industry lawyers asked for two months to 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye will set a timetable after hearing  
each side's plans when court convenes again Monday. Cigarette 
makers have until July 19 to file papers in support of motions, 
notably requests for a mistrial and decertification of the class, 
which would disband the smokers' group.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Said Will Fight Oct. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's future is shaping up, just as the  
former heavyweight tries to do the same with his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will return to the ring Oct. 2 in Las Vegas for his first  
fight since stopping Francois Botha in the fifth round Jan. 17, his 
manager said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well in that bout, manager Shelly Finkel told The  
Associated Press that Tyson would fight again Dec. 11 on a 
pay-per-view card. Both fights would be held at the MGM Grand 
hotel-casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	No opponents have been selected for either of the two fights,  
but possible opponents for Oct. 2 include Zeljko Mavrovic of 
Croatia or Germany's Axel Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the MGM Grand confirmed that the Oct. 2 date was  
``the next available date we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first fight would be televised on the Showtime cable  
network. It would be Tyson's first non pay-per-view fight since he 
stopped Buster Mathis Jr. on the Fox network on Dec. 16, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Tyson wins, he is scheduled to fight a pay-per-view  
fight Dec. 11, with an upgraded opponent along the lines of Andrew 
Golota or Shannon Briggs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old former heavyweight champion has fought only once  
-- against Botha -- since his infamous biting of Evander Holyfield's 
ears ended their fight in the third round June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The most feared heavyweight of his time in the late 1980s, Tyson  
has fought only 12 times in the last decade. He is 9-3 in those 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has been in Phoenix since last month, shedding pounds to  
get ready for the boxing portion of his training that will begin 
sometime in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson weighed the heaviest of his career when he fought Botha,  
223 pounds, and reportedly weighed 275 pounds when he was released 
from a Maryland prison May 24 after his latest jailing for 
attacking two men following a traffic altercation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Finkel said Tyson will continue to be promoted by  
Denver-based America Presents, which promoted his comeback fight 
against Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who split with promoter Don King after accusing him of  
taking more than $100 million in his earnings, had a two fight deal 
with America Presents that was signed after he got his boxing 
license back in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Finkel said a new contract expected to be signed this week ties  
the former champion to America Presents for another four fights.

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes On Salmon Issue in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Campaigning in the Northwest, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush says Pacific Coast salmon should be protected, but 
not at the expense of dams on the Snake River. 
</P>
<P>
	An environmental group, American Rivers, has identified the  
Snake River as the most endangered river in the nation, reporting 
that its fish population has dropped by 90 percent since four dams 
were constructed in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	At a brief news conference after his arrival Wednesday night at  
Spokane International Airport, the Republican presidential 
front-runner was asked about the salmon issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important for us to protect the fish, but I  
think we can do so in a way that doesn't cause the dams to have to 
be breached,'' he said. ``I understand how significant the dams 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to complete a study next  
year on whether breaching the dams is the best way to help the 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	While environmentalists say that removing the earthen portions  
of the four dams would allow water and salmon to flow freely past 
them, industry groups say the move would also render the dams 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush planned a breakfast address this morning to about 700  
people who paid $20 each to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not intended to be a fund-raiser,'' Bush press  
secretary Mindy Tucker said. ``It's to let the people in Spokane 
know why he is running, his philosophy of compassionate 
conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fund-raiser was arranged for later in the day, at the  
Seattle-area home of telecommunications tycoon Craig McCaw. That 
event was expected to raise at least $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, on his first swing through Washington, is hoping his  
presidential bid is better received than the campaigns of his 
father in the Evergreen State. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush lost Washington's electoral votes in the  
1988 and 1992 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle visit has created a bit of controversy, since Bush  
declined an invitation to speak before a national conference of 
minority journalists. His office issued a statement saying he was 
too busy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we are not able to schedule everything on this  
first trip,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democratic candidates -- Vice President Al Gore and former  
Sen. Bill Bradley -- both agreed to address the Unity '99 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 53, has collected the endorsements of many top Republican  
leaders during this western swing. On Wednesday, a six-pack of GOP 
governors -- from Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah 
-- endorsed him in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking in Spokane, Bush was to fly to Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to talk to 200 kids about the perils of the  
Internet and then meet with Microsoft executives at the software 
giant's suburban campus before the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has called for freeing Internet sales from  
duties and tariffs. He also supports a permanent federal 
research-and-development tax credit and has pledged not to raise 
federal personal or corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has also proposed intensifying efforts to combat  
intellectual piracy and supports raising the limit on the number of 
highly skilled workers allowed into the country under so-called 
H-1B visas.

<HEADLINE> June, Year to Date Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	June sales and sales for the fiscal year to date reported by  
leading retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales compare the current year's sales with those of the  
previous year. Retailers are ranked according to results at the end 
of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting periods vary slightly. Most retailers' fiscal years  
end in late January or early February. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales include those from stores open at least a year, also known  
as same-store or comparable store sales, and total sales. Retailers 
release only percentage changes for same-store sales, while they 
provide dollar figures and percentages for total sales.

provide a more accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than 
total sales.

<HEADLINE> Female Trouble: Now Believable? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- When his cult classic film ``Female  
Trouble'' came out in 1974, its premise seemed really farfetched, 
but now it's almost believable, writer-director John Waters says. 
</P>
<P>
	The film cast the late cross-dressing actor Divine as Dawn  
Davenport, a suburban misfit who wants to be famous so badly she 
sees going to the electric chair as a career highlight. She becomes 
an unwed mother, stripper, prostitute, mugger, child abuser, 
beautician's wife, junkie and a murderous nightclub performer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kicking off a B-movie film series at Ohio State University on  
Wednesday night, Waters introduced the director's cut of ``Female 
Trouble,'' which is scheduled for theatrical release early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed out that the film's treatment of homosexuality and  
incest seems a lot less shocking than it was 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters told students gathered at the campus arts center that his  
kind of creativity was discouraged at every school he attended. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can make a snuff movie now and get an A,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> GE Profits Rise 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- General Electric Co. reported its  
second-quarter profits rose 15 percent, led by strong performances 
in its aircraft engines, power systems and financial services 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's fifth-biggest corporation said Thursday it earned  
$2.82 billion, or 85 cents per share, compared with $2.45 billion, 
or 74 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 9 percent to $27.41 billion, up from $25.07  
billion, reflecting growth from globalization and product services. 
</P>
<P>
	GE's results were 1 cent per share ahead of analyst  
expectations, according to First Call Corp. However, GE stock was 
down 93 3/4 cents to $117 on the New York Stock Exchange as traders 
took profits after bidding the share price up in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	At GE Capital Services, GE's financial unit, profits rose 17  
percent to $1.09 billion, up from $933 million in the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At GE Power Systems, profits increased 34 percent to $499  
million, up from $372 million a year ago. Profits in the aircraft 
engines division rose 20 percent to $512 million from $427 million 
as the unit won more than 50 percent of the world's engine orders 
for airline passenger jets. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's profits rose 15 percent to $544 million from $475 million  
as the TV network had strong ratings during the key May sweeps 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, GE's companywise earnings  
rose 15 percent to $4.98 billion, or $1.50 per share, compared with 
$4.34 billion, or $1.31 per share, in the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 8 percent in the first six months to $51.58  
billion, up from $47.69 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Courts Jewish Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, in pursuit of a U.S.  
Senate seat from New York, is assuring Jewish leaders she considers 
Jerusalem ``the eternal and indivisible capital'' of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	She also says she will actively advocate locating the U.S.  
Embassy there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, the timing of such a move must be sensitive to  
Israel's interest in achieving a secure peace with its neighbors,'' 
Mrs. Clinton wrote Mandell I. Ganchrow, the president of the Union 
of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, which represents 
nearly 1,000 Orthodox synagogues in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Thursday, Ganchrow called the statement  
by the first lady significant. ``I think it is important she 
understands the seriousness of the issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would want to meet with her and try to gauge her emotional  
attachment to these issues,'' the retired surgeon said. ``I think 
that's fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his campaign for the White House in 1992,  
also said Jerusalem should be recognized as Israel's capital. He 
did not follow through once in office, saying the future of the 
city was to be determined by Israel and the Palestinian Authority 
in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Clinton has blocked the shift of the U.S. Embassy to  
Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, using a waiver provision in a 1995 law 
that had authorized the relocation. He cited the prospect of 
negotiations and concerns about the security of Americans and U.S. 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is determined to establish a  
state on the West Bank and in Gaza, with its capital in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Mrs. Clinton's letter, dated last Friday and  
responding to a written inquiry from Ganchrow, was obtained by The 
Associated Press after an account was published in Forward, a 
Jewish newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is hoping to succeed Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,  
D-N.Y., a leader in the congressional effort to move the U.S. 
Embassy to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential opponent in the Senate race, Republican Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani of New York, has taken strong stands in support of 
Israel and against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews traditionally vote Democratic in New York and across the  
nation, although Giuliani has received strong Jewish support in his 
two successful mayoral campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton had voiced support for a Palestinian state, a  
position that could alienate some Jewish voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In her letter she made no mention of Palestinian aspirations,  
which the president has supported without specifically calling for 
a state. Instead, Mrs. Clinton stressed her ``strong support for 
Israel and the example it sets as a stable democracy in the Middle 
East.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally consider Jerusalem the eternal and indivisible  
capital of Israel, and I admire the leadership of Senator Moynihan 
on this issue,'' she wrote the Orthodox leader. 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, Ganchrow thanked the first lady for her ``strong  
support for Israel'' and her ``stated view'' on Jerusalem as its 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department deputy spokesman James Foley said Mrs.  
Clinton had expressed her own views. He said Israel and the 
Palestinians had agreed to take up Jerusalem in negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co's Can Minimize Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Cigarette makers have a number of legal weapons  
available to minimize the damage caused by a jury's verdict holding 
them responsible for making thousands of Florida smokers sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Those weapons will emerge as the second phase of the massive  
class-action suit begins, pushing back any final ruling from the 
jury on monetary damages for weeks or months, legal experts said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first class-action lawsuit by smokers to go to trial, the  
jury on Wednesday said five tobacco companies engaged in ``extreme 
and outrageous conduct'' in making a defective product that causes 
emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next phases, the jury is to decide how much to award the  
lawsuit's nine original plaintiffs. The judge also must deal with 
the complex process of hearing claims of the other members of the 
class, which could number up to 500,000 sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of complicated stuff here,'' Stephan Landsman, a  
law professor at DePaul University, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest threat to the suit is the industry's demand  
that the class action be decertified, meaning that the nine smokers 
who have sued would be barred from representing thousands of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts who folllow tobacco stocks for Wall Street securities  
firms anticipate the case will be decertified, noting Florida is 
the lone state to allow a class-action lawsuit by smokers to reach 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may take months,'' said David Adelman, a tobacco analyst  
for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``It's going to be thrown out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in 1994 and certified as a class action two  
years later by a Florida appeals court. Circuit Judge Robert Kaye, 
who presided over the trial, will hold a hearing on the issue later 
this month, but is not expected to dissolve the class, meaning an 
appeal to higher courts is a near certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Most courts thus far have rejected such class actions, saying  
that the reasons for smoking and the diseases are too different to 
bundle all smokers together. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a class-action suit by  
six smokers in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Union health funds have filed class-action suits in 38 states.  
At least nine have been thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Louisiana Supreme Court in February upheld a class  
of smokers and ex-smokers seeking money for medical testing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami-Dade County Circuit Court Thursday, attorneys and the  
judge discussed when to start the next phase of the case, in which 
evidence will be heard on the health damage suffered by the nine 
main plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the earlier phase, tobacco company lawyers will be  
able to argue that these smokers bear personal responsibility by 
assuming the risk of smoking, knowing it wasn't healthful. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the jury has already sided with the smokers, that defense  
may fail, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to go into that case feeling sorry for the  
tobacco companies or even liking them,'' said Robert H. Alexander, 
Jr., co-chairman of the American Bar Association's product 
liability committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still appropriate though for plaintiffs to be (held)  
responsible for creating the situation they're complaining about. 
It's a matter of how receptive the jury is to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs told Judge Kaye Thursday they will be ready for  
the next phase in two weeks. The tobacco attorneys requested two 
months. Kaye could set the start date on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida plaintiffs want at least $200 billion in damages.  
Named as defendants are the nation's five biggest cigarette makers 
and two industry groups: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett 
Group Inc., as well as the Council for Tobacco Research and the 
Tobacco Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks of most of the companies continued to fall Thursday, just  
as they had after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds lost 75 cents to close at $30.12 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Loews Corp., parent of Lorillard, lost $1.12 1/2 to 
$77.93 3/4. British American Tobacco, parent of Brown &AMP; Williamson, 
fell 56 1/4 cents to $17.75. Brooke Group, parent of Lorillard, fell 
$1.56 1/4 to $21.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris, which suffered the heaviest loss Wednesday, rose  
slightly, gaining 37 1/2 cents to $38.25.

<HEADLINE> War on Poverty Yields Few Victories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ever since Lyndon Johnson declared war on  
poverty 35 years ago, the government has had little success 
elevating depressed areas like those President Clinton toured this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurturing economic revival in poor pockets of Appalachia, inner  
cities and the rural South has sometimes proven all but impossible, 
say some veterans of those wars. 
</P>
<P>
	More progress has been made among poor people than poor places.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a war on poverty,'' says Housing Secretary  
Andrew Cuomo, who went with Clinton on his poverty tour. ``Maybe 
there was a skirmish on poverty for a brief period of time. We have 
done the broad people-based programs -- Social Security, Medicaid, 
welfare. But we have never done intensive geographically targeted 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton says it's these ignored areas of America that are the  
untapped markets of tomorrow. He wants Congress to give tax 
incentives, tax credits and loan guarantees to people who invest 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good thing that we encourage people to invest  
in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, but they ought to have 
the same incentive to invest in the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, 
in the native American reservations and the inner cities,'' Clinton 
told people in Clarksdale, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	That's been tried, counter the president's critics.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know how many times we've saved Appalachia?'' says Robert  
Rector, analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``We have 
the Appalachian Regional Commission. We have the Economic 
Development Administration. We have community development block 
grants. We have done this over and over and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Besharov, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,  
says government money given to communities is sometimes spent 
unwisely. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does improve people's status, they often pack up and move  
out, he says. ``I would aim for a people strategy, not a place 
strategy,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	James Galbraith, a professor at the University of Texas' Lyndon  
Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs, commends Clinton for 
raising awareness about places untouched by the nation's economic 
boom, but says what begets business activity is building better 
schools and roads and raising the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you throw business activity in a region where that does not  
exist, then you have a sweatshop phenomenon,'' Galbraith says. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty experts agree, however, that many programs aimed at  
helping individuals have worked. 
</P>
<P>
	When LBJ declared a war on poverty in his 1964 State of the  
Union address, 19 percent of the population was living in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1997 -- the most recent data available -- that number had  
fallen to 13.3 percent of the population. That's one of every seven 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security drastically reduced the poverty rate among the  
elderly. Still, the poverty rate for children remains near 20 
percent, a bare improvement from Johnson's day. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson took his own poverty tour, visiting tarpaper cabins and  
meeting with workers. In Inez, Ky., he talked with Tom Fletcher, a 
jobless father of eight, who made $400 a year scrounging for coal. 
So intent was their conversation that neither noticed when a gust 
of wind tore off the door of an outhouse nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	On another celebrated poverty tour, in the spring of 1967, New  
York Sen. Robert Kennedy was moved to tears by the squalor he saw 
in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, was Johnson's ``Mr.  
Poverty.'' Many of the programs launched then remain today -- 
Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start and Job Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Their effort, however, stalled during the Vietnam War.  
Confidence in the government's ability to solve social problems 
waned. By the time Ronald Reagan became president, many Americans 
agreed with him that the government had gotten too big and that 
solutions should come from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Reagan said the war on poverty was a failure,''  
Shriver said in an interview. ``It was not a great success, that's 
true, because we didn't have the money. I told Lyndon Johnson 
myself that we needed two or three times the money we had to 
overcome the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life is better in Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta -- a  
little better. 
</P>
<P>
	Sociologist Cynthia ``Mil'' Duncan of the University of New  
Hampshire, who wrote a book about Appalachia and rural Mississippi, 
says residents in their 30s and 40s say the quality of their lives 
has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were growing up, they didn't have plumbing in their  
homes and they lived in really deplorable conditions. Black 
children were pulled out of school to work in the fields. That 
doesn't happen anymore,'' Ms. Duncan said. ``People now are living 
more often in trailers and homes with plumbing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she adds: ``I did interview people in the 1990s in two-room  
shacks without plumbing, so it's not that it's all fixed.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Examines Secret Beckwith Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The FBI is examining secretly recorded  
jailhouse conversations in which Byron De La Beckwith purportedly 
brags of shooting blacks and talks about how to dispose of bodies 
in a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith, 78, was convicted in 1994 of the ambush killing of  
NAACP official Medgar Evers outside his home in 1963. He is serving 
a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings were made from 1996 to 1998 by Donald Tominello,  
a onetime Beckwith family friend who says he intends to use the 
material to write a book, The Clarion-Ledger reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper included excerpts from a recording supposedly made  
in 1997, in which Beckwith is said to admit shooting blacks ``once 
in awhile, and what's wrong with that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said agents are reviewing that tape and about 30 others,  
along with letters written by Beckwith. The tapes have been sent to 
an FBI lab in Washington to determine their authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities decided to examine the tapes primarily because of a  
conversation Tominello supposedly had with Beckwith regarding the 
possibility of bodies in McIntyre Lake, not far from Beckwith's 
hometown of Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith questions whether anything would be found if the lake  
were dredged. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you threw somebody in the lake, they usually float up a  
few days later,'' he is quoted as saying. ``What you should do is 
cut 'em open and then tie things around them.'' That way, ``the 
fish will just eat him up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith's attorney, Merrida Coxwell Jr., said that even if  
Beckwith is the person speaking on the tapes, the information can't 
be trusted because of Beckwith's failing health. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be skeptical what he has said about involvement in  
something else,'' Coxwell said. ``I certainly don't know that I 
would run and drain a lake.''

	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only

<HEADLINE> New Look for All-Star Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds and Greg Maddux will  
be watching next week while Kent Bottenfield, Paul Byrd and B.J. 
Surhoff make their All-Star game debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	When the All-Stars rosters are read off Tuesday night at Fenway  
Park, many of the players will be getting their first introductions 
on baseball's biggest summer stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's every kid's dream who grows up playing baseball to be an  
All-Star, and certainly I was one of those kids,'' said 
Bottenfield, whose NL-leading 13 wins helped him get selected to 
his first All-Star team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three players in all will make their All-Star debuts next  
Tuesday, many taking the place of familiar names who have been 
slowed by injuries and ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Atlanta's Brian Jordan, who was helped by injuries that  
forced starter Tony Gwynn to skip the game and sidelined Bonds for 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking my family to Boston with me,'' Jordan said. ``We  
were planning a vacation to Florida, but we'll be happy to take 
this detour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds won't be there for the first time since 1991. Maddux has  
been at the All-Star game for five straight years. Other regulars, 
like Mo Vaughn, Alex Rodriguez and Kevin Brown, will also have a 
rare break before the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In their place are a bunch of newcomers, like Surhoff, whose 855  
RBIs in 13 seasons were the most by an active player not to make an 
All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Texas middle reliever Jeff Zimmerman, who sent faxes to all  
30 teams two winters ago just for the chance to try out. The 
Rangers were the only team to bite and Zimmerman has made the risk 
pay off, going 8-0 with an 0.89 ERA as a rare All-Star middle 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely the ultimate pinnacle to me. Just to be  
named to an All-Star team is unbelievable,'' Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	AL manager Joe Torre selected four Yankees and seven newcomers  
on Wednesday. NL manager Bruce Bochy will bring Padres pitchers 
Andy Ashby and Trevor Hoffman with him to Fenway Park, along with 
16 players who are used to getting three days off midway through 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians, who lead the majors in wins, led both  
leagues with six All-Stars. Shortstop Omar Vizquel and right-hander 
Charles Nagy joined four starters: first baseman Jim Thome, second 
baseman Roberto Alomar and outfielders Kenny Lofton and Manny 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy replaced Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who turned down his  
bid to tend to personal business at home in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion Yankees, snubbed by the voters for the  
second straight year, still have shortstop Derek Jeter, outfielder 
Bernie Williams and pitcher David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers have four: Zimmerman, first baseman Rafael  
Palmeiro, closer John Wetteland and starting catcher Ivan 
Rodriguez. A fifth Ranger, Juan Gonzalez, said he wouldn't play if 
he wasn't a starter and the AL honored his request. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Diamondbacks also have four All-Stars, followed  
by Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and San Diego with three each. 
The Padres' Tony Gwynn was elected by the fans but will miss the 
game with a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox should have two starters, shortstop Nomar  
Garciaparra, the fan's choice, and Pedro Martinez (15-2, 2.02 ERA), 
the likely starting pitcher. Second baseman Jose Offerman was 
selected as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the 30-man NL squad will make its All-Star  
debut next week, with 16 players suiting up for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 11 pitchers are All-Star rookies: Bottenfield, Byrd,  
Atlanta's Kevin Millwood and Houston's Jose Lima, Mike Hampton and 
Billy Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson and Philadelphia's Curt Schilling were  
also picked for the NL staff. San Francisco's Robb Nen was selected 
but will miss the game with a callous on his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy said he will pick another reliever, with Los Angeles' Jeff  
Shaw, the Mets' Armando Benitez and Cincinnati's Scott Williamson 
as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the NL reserves are catchers Mike Lieberthal of  
Philadelphia and catcher Dave Nilsson of Milwaukee; infielders Jeff 
Bagwell of Houston, Sean Casey of Cincinnati, Alex Gonzalez of 
Florida, Jeff Kent of San Francisco and Ed Sprague of Pittsburgh; 
and outfielders Jeromy Burnitz of Milwaukee, Luis Gonzalez of 
Arizona and Gary Sheffield of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the reserves, only Sheffield and Bagwell have been All-Stars  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The other AL reserves are Detroit catcher Brad Ausmus;  
infielders Ron Coomer of Minnesota, Tony Fernandez of Toronto and 
John Jaha of Oakland; and outfielders Shawn Green of Toronto and 
Magglio Ordonez of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the pitchers are Kansas City's Jose Rosado, Tampa  
Bay's Roberto Hernandez, Baltimore's Mike Mussina and Anaheim's 
Troy Percival. 
</P>
<P>
	The other AL starters are Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr.,  
Tampa Bay DH Jose Canseco and Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis' Mark McGwire and the Cubs' Sammy Sosa headline the NL  
starters. The lineup also includes Arizona's Matt Williams at third 
and Jay Bell at second, New York catcher Mike Piazza, Cincinnati 
shortstop Barry Larkin and Colorado outfielder Larry Walker.

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits Another Low; Dollar Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro slipped to another low against the  
dollar in New York Thursday but rebounded on rumors that the 
European Central Bank might intervene in markets to support its 
flagging currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro went as low as 1.0146, its latest in a series of new  
lows against the dollar, but rose back to $1.0214 in late New York 
trading on market rumors of ECB intervention. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0226 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has been struggling since its debut in January as signs  
of weakness in the European economy and the conflict in Kosovo have 
darkened prospects for the region's new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also rose against other major currencies amid signs  
of continued strength in the U.S. economy. Bullish comments from 
incoming Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers Thursday reinforced 
the positive sentiment toward the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about where the economy is,'' Summers said in a  
television interview on NBC's ``Today,'' just one week into his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 122.61 Japanese yen, up from 122.23.  
The dollar also was quoted at 1.5713 Swiss francs, up from 1.5693, 
and 1.4720 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4700. The British pound fell 
to $1.5588 from $1.5603. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9150 German 
marks, up from 1.9128 and 6.4226 French francs, up from 6.4144.

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes On Salmon Issue in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Campaigning in the Northwest, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush says Pacific Coast salmon should be protected, but 
not at the expense of dams on the Snake River. 
</P>
<P>
	An environmental group, American Rivers, has identified the  
Snake River as the most endangered river in the nation, reporting 
that its fish population has dropped by 90 percent since four dams 
were constructed in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	At a brief news conference after his arrival Wednesday night at  
Spokane International Airport, the Republican presidential 
front-runner was asked about the salmon issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important for us to protect the fish, but I  
think we can do so in a way that doesn't cause the dams to have to 
be breached,'' he said. ``I understand how significant the dams 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to complete a study next  
year on whether breaching the dams is the best way to help the 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	While environmentalists say that removing the earthen portions  
of the four dams would allow water and salmon to flow freely past 
them, industry groups say the move would also render the dams 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush planned a breakfast address this morning to about 700  
people who paid $20 each to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not intended to be a fund-raiser,'' Bush press  
secretary Mindy Tucker said. ``It's to let the people in Spokane 
know why he is running, his philosophy of compassionate 
conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fund-raiser was arranged for later in the day, at the  
Seattle-area home of telecommunications tycoon Craig McCaw. That 
event was expected to raise at least $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, on his first swing through Washington, is hoping his  
presidential bid is better received than the campaigns of his 
father in the Evergreen State. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush lost Washington's electoral votes in the  
1988 and 1992 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle visit has created a bit of controversy, since Bush  
declined an invitation to speak before a national conference of 
minority journalists. His office issued a statement saying he was 
too busy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we are not able to schedule everything on this  
first trip,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democratic candidates -- Vice President Al Gore and former  
Sen. Bill Bradley -- both agreed to address the Unity '99 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 53, has collected the endorsements of many top Republican  
leaders during this western swing. On Wednesday, a six-pack of GOP 
governors -- from Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah 
-- endorsed him in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking in Spokane, Bush was to fly to Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to talk to 200 kids about the perils of the  
Internet and then meet with Microsoft executives at the software 
giant's suburban campus before the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has called for freeing Internet sales from  
duties and tariffs. He also supports a permanent federal 
research-and-development tax credit and has pledged not to raise 
federal personal or corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has also proposed intensifying efforts to combat  
intellectual piracy and supports raising the limit on the number of 
highly skilled workers allowed into the country under so-called 
H-1B visas.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada, Attendants Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Reaching a deal just minutes after a strike  
deadline passed, Air Canada and its 5,100-member flight attendants 
union agreed on a new contract today and averted a systemwide 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela Sachs, head of the flight attendants section of the  
Canadian Union of Public Employees, said the union negotiated 
improved retirement income, safer and healthier working conditions 
and wage increases of 5 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent over three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good contract for our 5,000 members, it is a good  
contract for the company and the future of labor relations, and it 
will allow us to give superior service to our customers,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sachs said the union didn't get everything it was looking for in  
retirement benefits, but she was satisfied that the company agreed 
to a task force to study the pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came too late for many travelers, who had already  
been forced to re-book flights, find other airlines or cancel their 
plans because of the potential for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, which handles about 60,000 passengers a day on 660  
to 700 flights, had said it would halt all its flights if there was 
a strike. The airline had stopped taking reservations for flights 
from Thursday through July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada had offered refunds on tickets and helped with  
alternative travel arrangements as it tried to avoid stranding 
passengers for the third time in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret the inconvenience caused to our customers over the  
uncertainty of the past few days and we thank them for their 
understanding,'' said Jean-Jacques Bourgeault, senior executive 
vice-president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada said full details of the agreement will not be  
released until union members ratify the agreement. Union officials 
will be briefing members across the country next week and a 
ratification vote will be held the week of July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor dispute came as Canada's largest airline has just  
started to emerge from the effects of last September's pilots 
strike. That dispute shut down Air Canada for two weeks, alienating 
customers and burdening the airline with a big 1998 loss.

<HEADLINE> Elf Plans To Fight TotalFina Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Elf Aquitaine SA chairman Philippe Jaffre vowed  
Thursday that the French oil company will fight an unsolicited $43 
billion takeover bid from rival TotalFina SA. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to senior management, Jaffre said it was too early  
to outline Elf's defense, but he predicted that Total's bid would 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
	TotalFina launched its offer Monday in an attempt to create the  
world's fourth largest oil company in terms of capitalization. The 
proposed group also would be Europe's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf has rejected the all-stock bid as hostile, although the bid  
has the backing of the French government. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaffre said TotalFina's offer was badly timed because the merger  
would lead to a duplication of exploration and production 
activities as well as overcapacity in refining operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor against a merger would be the need to sell the  
chemical assets of the combined group at some point, Jaffre said in 
comments to Elf staff that were released to news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't hide from you that we have ourselves studied the idea  
of a linkup with Total, but (these) three issues have convinced us 
that it was premature,'' Jaffre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaffre said TotalFina's chairman, Thierry Desmarest, had not  
attempted to convince Elf of the merits of his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might have been able to work together to find satisfactory  
solutions, but hostility and the poor timing instantly destroys the 
key degree of trust between equals needed to build a real merger,'' 
Jaffre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elf is master of its own destiny,'' Jaffre said. ``The Total  
bid will fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Total and Elf have been under presser to increase their size  
because of the recent consolidation in the oil sector. Total moved 
first by concluding a merger with Belgium's Petrafina. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf failed in a hostile bid to take over Norway's Saga Petroleum  
last week.

<HEADLINE> Outrage Toward U.S. Lamb Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Outraged at new penalty tariffs on  
their lamb exports, Australia and New Zealand today accused the 
United States of hypocrisy and promised to seek retribution in 
international trade forums. 
</P>
<P>
	The new tariffs on foreign lamb shipped into the United States  
were announced in an effort to protect U.S. producers, who had 
complained their livelihoods were threatened by cheaper lamb 
shipped from New Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Australian Prime Minister John Howard, on a Tokyo visit,  
said he would tell President Clinton at a meeting scheduled in 
Washington next week that he is appalled by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no possible justification for this,'' Howard told  
reporters. ``On every score, it is deserving of total 
condemnation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Agriculture Minister Mark Vaile used the Australian  
slang for genuine -- dinkum -- as he criticized the U.S. decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action demonstrates to the world that the U.S. is not  
fair dinkum about fair trade,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's decision, effective July 22, will impose a border tax  
of 9 percent on the first 31,851 metric tons -- about 70 million 
pounds -- of foreign lamb, the amount imported into the United 
States last year. Lamb imports above that level will carry a 40 
percent tariff, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia and New Zealand have built lamb markets in the United  
States worth more than $150 million a year. About 95 percent of 
lamb sold in America now comes from those two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. announcement on Wednesday that it would impose the  
tariffs comes just months before it will host World Trade 
Organization talks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the  
United States last month called for the WTO to launch a new world 
trade round, and for it to include agricultural trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia and New Zealand said they would jointly take the issue  
before the WTO, which mediates trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Zealand cannot and will not let the matter rest,'' said  
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. ``We have immediately started active 
consideration of our WTO options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said the United States has argued ``long and loudly that  
it favors free trade and the opening up, in particular, of 
agricultural markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now taken a decision which strikes at the credibility of  
its rhetoric,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Picks Pan Am Baseball Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four hard-throwing young pitchers highlight the  
United States' roster selected Thursday for the upcoming Pan Am 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Mulder of the Oakland Athletics, Matt Riley of the  
Baltimore Orioles, Brad Penny of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and 
Bobby Seay of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays will anchor the U.S. 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulder, the second pick in the 1998 draft, is 4-5 with a 3.66  
ERA for Triple-A Vancouver; Riley is 5-1 with a 2.67 ERA for 
Double-A Bowie; Penny is 2-6 with a 4.52 for Double-A El Paso; and 
Seay is 2-4 with a 2.80 ERA for Class-A St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Former major league general managers Bob Watson and Pat Gillick  
selected the players for the tournament, which will take place July 
25-Aug. 2 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams in the Pan Am tournament will qualify for the  
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-man U.S. roster includes 11 pitchers, three catchers, six  
infielders and four outfielders. Only players not on major league 
teams' 40-man rosters were eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Johnson, a first base prospect with the New York Yankees,  
was not selected after the Yankees refused to make him available. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the pitchers are Steve Rain (Cubs), Dan Reichert  
(Royals), J.C. Romero (Twins), Scott Stewart and Derek Wallace 
(Mets), Dan Wheeler (Devil Rays) and Todd Williams (Reds). 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Greene (Brewers), Marcus Jensen (Cardinals), and Matt  
LeCroy (Twins) will be the catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Dawkins (Reds), Shawn Gilbert (Dodgers), Jason Hardtke  
(Reds), Adam Kennedy (Cardinals), Craig Paquette (Mets) and Jon 
Zuber (Phillies) will play infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Bergeron and Milton Bradley (Expos), Dave Roberts  
(Indians) and Lance Berkman (Astros) are the outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers Dave Holdridge (Mariners), Dave Pavlas (Yankees) and  
Dave Telgheder (Indians); catcher Jim Tatum (Rockies) and 
outfielder Mike Neill (Athletics) are the alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Detroit Tigers manager Buddy Bell will manage the team.  
Jackie Moore, Reggie Smith, Marcel Lachemann, Joe Carbone and Dick 
Cooke round out the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will prepare for the Pan Am Games by playing a series  
of exhibitions in Tucson, Ariz., July 16-19.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players To Face Marijuana Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- NBA players are being warned by their  
union reps: Smoking marijuana in July could lead to a failed drug 
test in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there are guys out there using, and hopefully  
they'll get the message that they have to stop,'' player rep Jim 
McIlvaine of the New Jersey Nets said Wednesday at the union's 
annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	A fact sheet being handed out to player representatives for the  
29 teams states that marijuana can stay in a person's system for 
60-90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	And with marijuana being added to the NBA's list of banned  
substances for the 1999-2000 season, the union wants its 
pot-smoking members to knock it off now so they won't produce a 
dirty urine sample when training camps open. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the testing comes, the proof will be in the pudding,''  
said union director Billy Hunter, who scoffed at a report in 1997 
saying about 70 percent of the league's players either use 
marijuana or are heavy drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players taking part in the union meeting said there are a  
number of marijuana users, although they claim the total is nothing 
close to 70 percent of the player population. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players, including Chris Webber, Mookie Blaylock, Vernon  
Maxwell and J.R. Rider, have been arrested on marijuana-related 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento Kings guard Jason Williams was kicked off his college  
team at Florida for testing positive for marijuana twice. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players who test positive at training camp must undergo a  
mandatory counseling program. A second positive test brings a 
$15,000 fine, and any third or subsequent positive test results in 
a five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	All players will be tested when training camps open in October,  
and rookies will be tested four times per season on a random basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that if guys are using, they got the message  
last year that they'll be tested,'' Tyrone Corbin of the Atlanta 
Hawks said. ``Some guys, just like society in general, don't get 
the message until they're caught. Hopefully, they'll get this 
message and it won't put their careers in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steroids were also added to the league's banned substances list  
during the last collective bargaining negotiations. 
Androstenedione, the testosterone-producing substance taken by 
baseball slugger Mark McGwire and others, is not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA is like any industry, there's going to be people on  
drugs,'' Jim McIlvaine of the New Jersey Nets said. ``As role 
models, people need to know that we don't condone its use. 
</P>
<P>
	A player also can be tested during the regular season if an  
arbitrator decides, after a hearing, there is reasonable cause to 
believe a player has used, possessed or distributed any prohibited 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone testing positive for steroids gets a five-game suspension  
for the first offense, a 10-game suspension for a second offense 
and a 25-game suspension for a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for such illegal narcotics as cocaine, heroin and PCP  
are much more severe. A positive drug test -- or a conviction or 
guilty plea to a crime involving one of those drugs -- can lead to 
disqualification from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a very big problem in the league,'' said  
Corbin, who was at Vancouver's airport in 1997 when Blaylock, his 
Hawks teammate, was found to be carrying marijuana by a 
drug-sniffing dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic said reports of widespread  
usage are overblown. However, he said drug use -- and not just 
marijuana -- was a serious problem when he entered the league in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything going on today is mild compared to 20 years ago,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> 670,000 Baby Seats Being Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Baby equipment maker Cosco has recalled about  
670,000 car seats because the handle locks can release when the 
seat is used as a carrier, allowing infants to fall out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus, Ind.-based company announced the recall on its  
Internet site Thursday and said there have been 151 reports of 
handles releasing on Cosco Arriva and Turnabout carriers, injuring 
at least 29 children. 
</P>
<P>
	The company noted it was instituting the recall in cooperation  
with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents should continue using these rear-facing infant car  
seats, but should not use the carrying handle until a repair kit 
has been installed,'' Ricardo Martinez, head of the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a statement made 
available by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall involves Cosco models made from March 1, 1995 to  
Sept. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can get a free repair kit, which the company says can  
easily be installed at home, or more information by calling Cosco 
at 800-221-6736 from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EDT, Monday through 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Information also can be obtained, and repair kits ordered, at

<HEADLINE> Ben Crenshaw Exits British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- U.S. Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw  
pulled out of next week's British Open, organizers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw faxed the Royal and Ancient Club saying he did not  
consider his game up to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to give my space to somebody who could make better use  
of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, 47, has finished 213th and 268th on the U.S. Tour the  
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was exempt from qualifying for the Open by virtue of his 1995  
Masters victory. Crenshaw tied for second at the British Open 
behind Jack Nicklaus in 1978 at St. Andrews, and Seve Ballesteros 
at Lytham in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	His withdrawal came a day after former Ryder Cup captain Tom  
Kite announced he was pulling out because of poor form. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will miss the Open with a hip injury.

<HEADLINE> LendingTree on Web's Cutting Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Doug Lebda had everything in order before  
applying for a mortgage. He made a good living as a 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers executive and his credit record was 
impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it took him several weeks to nail down the best mortgage  
rate and months before he finally closed on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have driven onto a car dealer's lot and got a loan for  
the same amount of money as my mortgage and driven away in a new 
car the same day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Lebda, 29, came up with the idea to start an online  
business that encourages lenders to bid for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of going to one lender, why not let several of them  
compete for my business?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the premise behind LendingTree, an Internet venture that  
encourages consumers to browse its site for the best deals on 
mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and more. 
</P>
<P>
	LendingTree doesn't underwrite loans. Instead, it prequalifies  
borrowers for lenders. For consumers, it offers a unique chance to 
have lenders compete for their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize how much of a seminal change this was for  
banks,'' Lebda said. 
</P>
<P>
	LendingTree (www.lendingtree.com) is far from alone in the  
fledgling online mortgage industry. Some of the other players are 
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), GetSmart (www.getsmart.com), Microsoft's 
HomeAdvisor (www.homeadvisor.com) and iOwn (www.iOwn.com). 
</P>
<P>
	Since LendingTree's Web site went up in February 1998, its  
network has grown to nearly 50 lenders. LendingTree is trying to 
recruit even more. 
</P>
<P>
	In its early days, the site would receive about 15 visits a day.  
Today, it gets hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebda declined to discuss financial details about the  
privately-held company. But in one recent day, Lebda said, the site 
took in more than 2,000 applications, valued at $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending Tree makes its money by charging lenders a small fee for  
each loan application they receive. 
</P>
<P>
	If a loan closes, LendingTree gets a second payment, ranging  
from several hundred dollars for a mortgage to a fraction of that 
amount for an approved credit card application, Lebda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebda said both consumers and lenders save time and money by  
using the service. For lenders, the loan origination process can be 
shortened, and they can draw potential customers from a larger 
geographical area. 
</P>
<P>
	For borrowers, he said, it's a timesaving convenience and also  
can result in lower credit costs because of increased competition 
among lenders for a customer's business. 
</P>
<P>
	While savings are possible online, Keith Gumbinger, vice  
president of HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., mortgage research 
firm, cautions that many local lenders offer better deals than 
those available from Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suggests that borrowers try to learn something about an  
online lender and how their privacy will be protected before 
providing sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular part of the LendingTree site is its mortgage  
business, and that puts the company in a good position for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the online mortgage industry captures less than 2  
percent of the nation's $1.3 trillion mortgage market, but that 
should grow to nearly 10 percent of the market by 2003, according 
to James Punishill of Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Punishill said LendingTree has the most compelling business  
model of them all. ``The tough part is getting their message to 
consumers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have always done this one way, and this requires a  
behavioral change. In the old world, you'd pick up the newspaper 
and see a bunch of rates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When visitors log on to the LendingTree Web site, they are not  
bombarded with promotions about rates. Instead, they are asked to 
fill out an application and wait for lenders to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	It usually doesn't take long. The typical mortgage applicant  
hears back in two days or less. It often takes only a few hours for 
an applicant to get responses from four lenders, Lebda said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew from the start that this would work because consumers  
really hate getting loans,'' he said. ``The market is huge, and 
it's perfect for e-commerce. It's not like a sweater that you want 
to try on before you buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make it work, LendingTree has been signing on some of the  
country's top financial institutions, including CitiBank, Chase 
Manhattan, Bank One and The Money Store. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also works with Snap, Priceline.com and Wachovia in  
different deals that allow those companies to use LendingTree's 
technology for their own online ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	LendingTree employs about 70 people at its Charlotte  
headquarters, which resembles a call center. Employees sit in front 
of computer terminals, answering questions from consumers and 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's biggest challenge is to convince large financial  
institutions that e-commerce is not just a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always been one step of the financial institutions with  
our technology,'' he said. ``We can't get two steps ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Punishill said LendingTree isn't the only company using the  
Internet to bring borrowers and lenders together. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these online companies have unique things that make  
them viable,'' he said. ``There's only going to be a few winners in 
this industry, and it looks like LendingTree will be among them.''

<HEADLINE> Grudges, Goals in China-U.S. Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Sure, sports and politics shouldn't mix. But  
there's too much friction now between China and the United States 
for their clash in the Women's World Cup final to be just about 
scoring goals. 
</P>
<P>
	For some Chinese, a drubbing of the U.S. women in Saturday's  
eagerly anticipated match would help avenge the May 7 bombing of 
China's embassy in Yugoslavia by a U.S. stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really hope they lose face,'' said Wang Zhanjun, a Beijing  
factory worker. ``Economically, militarily, we can't punish 
America, so we have to use soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grudges aside, Chinese sports fans long starved of success in  
men's international soccer are looking forward to finally seeing 
China make good. The Chinese men have never even qualified for a 
World Cup, let alone been in a position to win one. So the success 
of the women has seemed almost heaven-sent. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Ailing and Sun Wen -- China's top women players -- are on  
their way to becoming household names in China. One official 
newspaper refers to the team as ``China's roses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Wu Yi, China's most senior female politician and a tough  
trade negotiator, has gotten swept up in the excitement. Wu, a 
Cabinet member, reportedly interrupted a speech Sunday to provide 
game updates during China's 5-0 semifinal victory over Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar battering of America could go a long way to restoring  
China's national pride. 
</P>
<P>
	In the atmosphere of suspicion clouding China-U.S. relations  
after the embassy bombing, conspiracy theories are spilling over 
into the sporting arena. There seems little chance that Saturday's 
final can match the ``ping-pong diplomacy'' China and the United 
States used 28 years ago to help bridge the gulf between them. 
</P>
<P>
	Government-run media have raised doubts about the evenhandedness  
of the referees for the championship game, saying officials in 
previous clashes between the two teams clearly favored the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	They've also suggested that U.S. organizers of the World Cup  
sought to trip up the Chinese women by deliberately making them 
trek back and forth across America and its four time zones in the 
competition's earlier rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beijing Morning Post calculated that including their trip to  
and from China, the team will have flown 25,793 miles, or once 
around the planet, compared to just 4,763 miles for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers, the newspaper suggested, planned it like that  
``because the Chinese team is the American team's biggest obstacle 
to taking the championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen how long after the competition the glow  
will last and whether the Chinese women's success in America will 
translate into greater funding and popularity for their 
long-overlooked sport back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang, the factory worker, who also leads a fan club for a men's  
soccer team, is already planning to get his group of drum-beating, 
whistle-blowing soccer enthusiasts to attend women's games in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a real macho, not caring about the women, but  
I'll pay attention now,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The national team's Swiss marketing company, International  
Sports and Leisure, hopes World Cup fame will attract sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu Ying, 67, was so inspired by the team's performance that she  
phoned the Beijing Morning Post to announce her plans to enroll her 
10-year-old granddaughter in a sports school to play soccer. She 
also urged Beijing's more than 10 million residents to donate one 
yuan each (about 12 cents) to fund women's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chinese women's soccer is a hundred times stronger than the  
men, but their rewards are too little,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's success already is putting pressure on China's men  
to buck up and raising questions about whether they deserve the 
largesse lavished on them since professional leagues were set up 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to male soccer players, the women players' incomes  
are pitifully small, but they repeatedly make it to the World 
Cup,'' Wu Yi, the Cabinet member, was quoted by the state-run 
Xinhua News Agency as saying. ``Male players should learn from 
their spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the women are world champions, the men will have to crawl  
into a hole. They'll lose so much face,'' added Li Feng, a soccer 
fan who works in advertising. ``It will really give the men a 
push.''

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Expected for Bull Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Call it bravado or bad judgment, hundreds of  
runners are expected to line up this weekend for the second annual 
running of the bulls in the tiny town of Mesquite. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Phil Immordino expects up to 1,000 runners to pay for  
the privilege of being chased by bulls in an Americanized version 
of the 400-year-old running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the most dangerous thing I've ever done, but it's the  
most dangerous thing I've ever done on purpose,'' said Devin 
Loving, who ran last year and plans to run this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a kick,'' he said. ``It's manly, macho, dangerous, but  
ultimately stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immordino promised more action by recruiting Mexican fighting  
bulls, known to be more aggressive than the range bulls used last 
year. The event has been moved to a track that is longer and 
narrower -- making the confrontation between runners and bulls 
potentially more contentious. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phones have been ringing off the hook,'' Immordino said  
Thursday. ``We've signed up more than 400 runners so far, and last 
year more than half the runners signed up on site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runners pay $65, and can make additional runs at $20 each,  
Immordino said. The runs will be Saturday and Sunday morning, with 
a bullfight and other events planned for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 700 runners and 8,000 spectators turned out last year at a  
quarter-mile-long track on the outskirts of Mesquite. This year's 
run will be at the city's rodeo grounds on a winding course a 
third-of-a-mile long and 10 feet narrower than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Three runners suffered minor injuries last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The run is expected to be an economic boon for the town,  
situated 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas on the Nevada-Arizona 
line. The event comes in the dead of summer, when temperatures 
routinely top triple digits and tourism is in the doldrums.

<HEADLINE> Market for Pollution Credits Viable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --A $23 million project involving  
energy-efficient light bulbs in Mexico could lead to a global 
market for trading credits rewarded to countries or companies for 
curbing greenhouse gas emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank and other officials involved in the project said  
Thursday it was the first time an international treaty on climate 
change was used to verify emissions reductions. The accord will be 
reviewed in November in Bonn, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``The learning experience from this first pilot can be used to  
formalize the development of rules'' for monitoring the reduction 
of greenhouse gases under the Kyoto Protocol, said Trygve Larsen, 
vice president of Det Norske Veritas, an international verification 
foundation based in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial countries, including the United States, agreed in  
December, 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, to reduce emissions of 
heat-trapping greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, sometime 
between 2008 and 2012. President Clinton has signed the protocol, 
but Congress has not ratified it. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce costs, the agreement envisions a system in which  
countries obtain emission-reduction credits from other countries 
that already have met certain pollution levels. Critics argue it 
will be difficult to verify such emission reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach officials discussed Thursday would involve private  
companies creating and transferring greenhouse emission-reduction 
credits. For example, a company could obtain a credit with a 
certain dollar value by building a power plant in a developing 
country. It could then sell that credit on the market or acquire 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
	To gain international acceptance that any emission reductions  
achieved are genuine requires certification by an independent, 
internationally recognized third party auditor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many companies around the world are eager to get started with  
this,'' Larsen said at a news conference at the World Bank. The 
bank planned and supervised the Mexican project with Norway 
providing part of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in the Mexican cities of Monterrey and Guadalajara  
replaced ordinary light bulbs with energy saving ones that are 75 
percent more efficient and last 10 times longer. The objective was 
to require less electricity and thus reduce emissions of carbon 
dioxide from power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Det Norske Veritas confirmed the lighting helped cut the  
equivalent of 171,168 tons of carbon dioxide from 1995 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the climate treaty, only industrialized nations are  
obliged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the treaty's 
provisions for creating and transferring greenhouse gas credits are 
designed to offer industrialized nations a more cost-effective 
means of achieving emissions reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The private sector typically views environmental  
responsibility as a cost,'' Larsen said. ``However the ability to 
certify emissions reduction according to an internationally 
acceptable standard will give environmental projects a profit 
incentive.''

<HEADLINE>  Montoya Nearing Rookie Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELKHART LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- The CART FedEx Championship Series  
season reaches the halfway point with Sunday's Texaco/Havoline 200 
and Juan Montoya already is closing in on some impressive records. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, a 23-year-old Colombian, replaced Alex Zanardi after  
the two-time PPG Cup champion returned to Formula One this season. 
Since taking over the seat at Target/Chip Ganassi Racing, ``The 
Great Juan'' has been sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	He has four poles and four wins in his first nine CART events.  
That is one victory short of the rookie record of five, set by 
Nigel Mansell in 1993. Mansell also set the record of seven poles 
by a first-year driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya has led in eight races this season, for a total of 564  
laps at the front of the pack. That puts him within easy reach of 
Zanardi's rookie record, set in 1996, of 610 laps led. 
</P>
<P>
	``Records are nice, but I am just trying to be consistent,''  
Montoya said. ``If we keep doing things the way we have been, then 
the records will come. But the championship is most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya has the lead in that race, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The kid, who was last year's European Formula 3000 champion,  
holds a 112 to 87 points lead over Gil de Ferran in the series 
standings. Dario Franchitti is third with 85, followed by 
three-time Road America winner Michael Andretti with 78. 
</P>
<P>
	``The championship is still wide open,'' Andretti said. ``There  
are 11 more races to go, but this is the time to start gathering 
some points and keep Montoya from building up too big a lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race on the four-mile road course is the first in a stretch  
of six events in seven weeks, the busiest part of the 20-race CART 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	This is another new track for Montoya, but that hasn't stopped  
him from shining on any of the other road or street circuits he has 
seen for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya won from the pole on the temporary street circit in Long  
Beach, Calif.; he finished second from the pole on the natural 
terrain road course in Portland, Ore.; and he won from the pole two 
weeks ago on the temporary road course at Cleveland's Burke 
Lakefront Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he earned 59 of a possible 66 points in those three  
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Road racing is what I grew up with,'' Montoya said. ``I like  
the ovals. They are new and fun, but the road circuits are more 
familiar and a little easier for me to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is looking forward to racing at Road America, the longest and  
fastest of CART's road circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested here and I loved it,'' Montoya said.  
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who earned his first CART victory last year at Road  
America, feels much the same way about the track. His win ignited a 
run that carried Franchitti to two more victories and moved him 
from eighth to third in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Elkhart,'' Franchitti said. ``It's a fun track to drive  
on. It's long, it's fast and it's interesting. Even if you don't 
win, it's a great place to race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and provisional qualifying are scheduled Friday.

<HEADLINE> Emma Thompson at Awards Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Emma Thompson says she's flummoxed over what name  
to give her child. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every name I think of gets pooh-poohed by my partner, the  
young Mr. Greg Wise,'' Thompson said. ``I have sort of given up 
thinking of names now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who won an Academy Award in 1991 for her performance  
in ``Howards End,'' made her remarks before a screenwriting awards 
ceremony -- her last public outing before her October due date, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been toying with names like Winston and Clementine, but  
I don't think they are going to wash,'' Thompson said, referring to 
Winston Churchill and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also said she's in semi-retirement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Having reached 40 this year, if they were going to find  
someone to play opposite me they would have to exhume him,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Daniel Wins 10,000 Track Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Leigh Daniel has  
little experience as a distance runner. She looked like a veteran 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting until just the right moment to make her move, Daniel  
overtook Yuri Kano of Japan with four laps to go and pulled away 
steadily to win the women's 10,000 meters in the University Games 
for the first American gold medal outside of swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, who took up the sport seriously four years ago,  
completed the grueling 25 laps around the newly sanctioned track at 
Son Moix Stadium in 32 minutes, 58.80 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early, I was just trying to say with the Japanese girl. Then I  
knew from my coaches we were slowing down,'' the 20-year-old Texas 
Tech student said. ``It seemed like it was a good time to make a 
move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel built a lead of about 50 yards in the span of a lap, and  
breezed home. 
</P>
<P>
	She showed no ill effects from the 86 degree heat and heavy  
humidity which took its toll on others. Morocco's Narjat Karzaz, in 
position to take the bronze with a lap remaining, started to 
stumble over the final 100 meters and collapsed, unconscious, just 
short of the finish line. She was taken away on a stretcher and 
given fluids intravenously. Two other runners also failed to 
complete the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, the NCAA champion in the 10,000 and runner-up in the  
5,000, called the conditions ``very good,'' and celebrated her gold 
by carrying a tiny American flag on a victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
	She must progress to become a threat on the international scene,  
failing to qualify for the world championships by placing seventh 
in the U.S. national championships last month. But the tenacity and 
talent are there. 
</P>
<P>
	Kano was second in 33:16.41 and Denmark's Annemette Densen, who  
ran with the leaders until 3,500 meters remained, finished in 
33:36.11 for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Yuhisleidis Cumba Jay won the day's other gold with a 61  
feet, 4 1/4 inch put of the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimmer Tomoko Hagiwara helped Japan break the University Games  
record in the women's 400-meter medley relay and also picked up her 
fourth medal of the competition by winning the 200-meter individual 
medley. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan won the relay in 4:09.90, slicing more than a half-second  
off the games record set by the United States four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third games swimming mark to fall, after Japan's Miki  
Nakao cracked the standard for the women's 200 backstroke and Mark 
Warkentin broke the record for the men's 800 freestyle. Warkentin 
goes after his American record-tying fifth gold Friday in the men's 
1,500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans grabbed six medals in the pool Thursday, as Cara Lane  
won the women's 1,500 freestyle to go with her prior victory in the 
800 free, Thomas Hanna won the men's 200 individual medley, and 
Beau Wiebel took the men's 200 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	In diving, world champion Ioulia Pakhalina and Irina Lashko of  
Russia went 1-2 in the women's 1-meter springboard event, with 
American Jenny Lingamfelter third. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> No Air Bag Probe for DaimlerChrysler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal transportation officials have decided  
against opening a formal investigation of children killed by air 
bags in DaimlerChrysler minivans, saying the number is in line with 
similar incidents involving other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official said  
Wednesday that while the total number of such deaths was higher 
than those in other vehicles, when the rate was calculated it was 
no worse than that of other vehicles because DaimlerChrysler was 
the first to offer passenger-side airbags 
</P>
<P>
	The NHTSA did decide to launch a formal defects investigation of  
Hyundai Motor Co.'s two-door Accent model. Passenger-side airbags 
in the Accent had killed five people, all children or small adults, 
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the NHTSA will continue to gather further information  
about DaimlerChrysler's air bags, and those of other automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, NHTSA laboratory testing found that inflating air bags  
in some DaimlerChrysler minivans could seriously injure or kill 
short female passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to continue to monitor the situation, because  
although we don't see any evidence in the real world of a problem, 
we nevertheless continue to be concerned about the results we had 
in the laboratory,'' the NHTSA official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocacy groups have urged the safety agency to force  
DaimlerChrysler to recall the more than 2 million minivans the 
company has built since 1994 and replace the air bags with less 
forceful ones. Most of those minivans were built before Chrysler 
Corp.'s acquisition last year by Germany's Daimler-Benz.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Hits Truck, Derails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE LAKE, Texas (AP) -- An Amtrak train carrying 235 passengers  
struck a truck Thursday, derailing nine cars and injuring 18 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The eastbound Sunset Limited was traveling from Los Angeles to  
Orlando, Fla., when it hit the rig shortly before noon, Steven 
Taub, an Amtrak spokesman, said. Track was torn up and two engines 
and seven cars were off to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't that big of a bump,'' said Sally Brichler, 36, of  
Deltona, Fla., who was traveling with her daughters, ages 9 and 5. 
``A couple of big jolts. It didn't even knock the milk off our 
tray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said they heard the train's whistle blowing just  
before the collision with the truck, which was pulling a salt water 
tank. Some riders crawled through a window as smoke filled the 
cars. Screaming could be heard, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	An engineer and an engineer in training had to be pulled from  
the wreckage by rescuers who broke out the engine windshield. The 
engineer was listed in guarded condition with a head injury, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver was unharmed.  
</P>
<P>
	David Keith, administrator of the Rice Medical Center in Eagle  
Lake, said most of the injured had bumps, bruises or were suffering 
from heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we would consider serious,'' he said. ``A lot of them  
were shaken up. A lot of them were in tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Goggans, an assistant conductor on the train, said  
passengers were calm in the aftermath of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the brakes go into emergency before we actually hit,''  
he said. ``You just grab on. You don't know what to expect. We knew 
something was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no warning lights or gates at the rural crossing  
where the accident happened, about 62 miles west of Houston. About 
16 trains a day travel on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers gathered under trees to shade them from the  
90-plus-degree heat and school buses were being used to take them 
to Eagle Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the passengers were Cindy McCain, the wife of Sen. John  
McCain, and their 13-year-old son, Jack. They two, who were unhurt, 
were headed to Florida for a vacation, said McCain spokesman Howard 
Opinsky. The senator himself was on a plane, headed to Seattle for 
a speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunset Limited was involved in the worst accident in  
Amtrak's 28-year history. On Sept. 22, 1993, 42 passengers and five 
crew members died when the train went off a bridge into a bayou 
near Mobile, Ala. The bridge had been damaged minutes earlier when 
it was hit by a towboat. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Amtrak's City of New Orleans ran into a truck at a  
crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people and injuring more 
than 100.

<HEADLINE> McCarty: NCAA Title to WNBA Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Anyone who doubts the role of confidence  
in basketball hasn't talked to Stephanie McCarty. In three months, 
she has gone from the toast of the NCAA tournament to getting 
benched in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The top scorer on the best team in college basketball last  
season, McCarty followed her Purdue career by quickly working her 
way into the Charlotte Sting's starting lineup. But she responded 
to her promotion by lapsing into an uncharacteristic shooting slump 
that hurt her team and landed her back in a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I'm going through a little funk,'' said McCarty, who  
has come off the bench in the past two games after shooting only 23 
percent during her five games as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	The inconsistency of McCarty's rookie season has been a stark  
turnabout for a player who had perhaps the greatest prep career by 
a woman in Indiana history before becoming the second-leading 
career scorer at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring a state-record 2,869 points in high school,  
McCarty scored 2,182 in college, including an average of 20.4 as a 
senior. She was an All-American and the top female athlete in the 
Big Ten, and topped off her college career by becoming the first 
player to cut down the nets after the Boilermakers' 17-point 
victory over Duke in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sting, who made the playoffs in each of the WNBA's first two  
seasons, drafted McCarty with the hope that the addition of a good 
outside shooter would help them challenge Houston for league 
supremacy. Early signs were that Charlotte made a wise choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off the bench, McCarty made 55 percent of her field-goal  
attempts over the Sting's first three games and scored in double 
figures each time. So when small forward Tracy Reid went on the 
injured list with a sore knee, it seemed natural to fill her spot 
in the starting lineup with McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCarty scored only 17 points over the next five games,  
missing 20 of 26 field-goal attempts. After McCarty missed all 
eight of her shots in a two-game stretch, coach Marynell Meadors 
sent her back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty has made five of eight shots in the two games since her  
demotion, and Charlotte has won both times to climb into second 
place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like having Stephanie come off the bench now,'' Meadors  
said. ``It seems to be good for her. She's more relaxed, and 
there's not as much pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who scored in double figures in every game of her  
senior season, said there are no easy answers for her struggles in 
the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is mental,'' she said. ``When I go out and  
miss a couple of shots, I get down. I'm my hardest critic. I know I 
can shoot. I need to go out and do it. And if it's not falling, I 
need to keep shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty has had to make the usual adjustments that college  
players encounter in the jump to the pros: dealing with compressed 
schedules, more travel and players who are bigger, stronger and 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	A big difference she has found is that she can't take as much  
time to shoot in the pros because the defenders can close on her 
faster. Meadors is working with McCarty in practice to help develop 
a quicker release. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it comes down to is I need to get more confidence,''  
McCarty said. ``I'm not here to do anything flashy. I just want to 
help this team win, and confidence is a big part of that.''

<HEADLINE>  1 Dead, Hundreds Rescued From Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- The smell of acrid smoke and the sound  
of fire alarms woke passengers on an overnight ferry from Germany 
to Norway today, when a fire below decks forced a pre-dawn 
evacuation of hundreds of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	A distress call from the Prinsesse Ragnhild went out at 2:13  
a.m., within moments of the fire's detection, and the decision was 
quickly made to abandon the ferry, which had 1,167 passengers and 
172 crew members on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out -- either in the engine or machine room -- from  
causes still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	A 70-year-old woman died hours later of heart failure in a  
hospital in this Swedish port city, where the ferry was towed, said 
Per Oertenvall, a physician. He refused to release her name or 
nationality, although news reports said she was Norwegian. 
</P>
<P>
	Reported injuries were limited to three passengers treated for  
smoke inhalation -- in what experts praised as a textbook evacuation 
of the 670-foot-long ferry sailing from Kiel, Germany, to Oslo, 
Norway. The passengers evacuated the boat 11 miles off Sweden's 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I noticed the smell of smoke in the cabin ... and then the  
alarm sounded ... and then it was just a matter of getting dressed 
as fast as you could and take your most important things with 
you,'' Knut Gran of Norway told Norway state radio NRK. 
</P>
<P>
	While passengers filed into lifeboats, another ferry and a  
smaller boat pulled alongside within a half hour, taking on 500 
passengers. Twenty other vessels and six helicopters later joined 
the effort, rescuers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calm seas and windless weather helped the evacuation. Within  
about four hours, the fire was under control and virtually all 
passengers -- most of them Norwegian tourists -- were taken off and 
brought to Goteborg. The ship was also towed to the Swedish port 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any panic,'' 70-year-old Marit  
Stakvik-Joergensen of Oslo told Swedish news agency TT. ``Some 
probably thought at first that it was just a drill, but when they 
put the life jackets on and felt the smoke, then they understood it 
was serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for many, it was still jarring.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty scary,'' said a young Norwegian boy, Marius  
Johansen. ``It felt like a long time in the little boat, but really 
it was probably half an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne-Lise Gaustad, an elderly woman from Norway, said she and  
others were given wet towels to breathe through because of smoke. 
``I still have a headache,'' she said. ``We're pretty shaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The engine room seems badly damaged and ``looks like an  
ashtray,'' Arne Slorafoss, a Norwegian passenger, told NRK. 
Slorafoss, a truck driver, volunteered to stay aboard and help the 
crew with salvage efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The close call chilled Scandinavians who recalled two ferry  
disasters in the region this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 7, 1990, the Scandinavian Star passenger ferry caught  
fire on an overnight run from Denmark to Norway, killing 159 people 
in the same waters off western Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1994, 852 people died when the Estonia ferry went  
down in heavy seas en route to Stockholm from the Estonian capital 
Tallinn. Only 137 people survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Konrad Havig of Norway's Maritime Directorate said the earlier  
disasters brought about safety improvements, including improved 
signs and markings for evacuation and smoke detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation of the Prinsesse Ragnhild ``is a textbook example  
of how something like this should be handled. It seems that way, at 
least,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Charge for Complaining in Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- At the Better Business Bureau here, you can  
complain all you want to -- but it'll cost you. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which has traditionally had no fees for its service,  
began this month to charge $9.50 for handling each complaint 
against a business. The bureau contends the fee is needed to speed 
up services, but officials at other BBB offices say that charging 
money is against their mission. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas, a current exception to the fee is when a complaint is  
filed over the bureau's World Wide Web site. Also, the fee will be 
waived for consumers who say they can't afford it, according to Jay 
Newman, president of the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The Council of Better Business Bureaus, the Virginia-based  
overseer of BBB offices, now forbids charging for the agency's 
Internet services. But the Dallas bureau will seek permission from 
the council in October to charge $9.50 for handling complaints 
filed on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman contends that such revenues will allow the Dallas BBB to  
expand and speed up services for consumers as well as invest more 
in technology. He says the bureau spends $19.90 to process a 
complaint, excluding arbitration and mediation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas bureau, which serves 13 counties, handles an average  
of about 1,400 complaints monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to charge somebody who's already been scammed  
for the privilege of telling me about it,'' John Riggins, president 
of the Better Business Bureau of Fort Worth, told The Dallas 
Morning News in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about a dozen of the 132 BBB chapters in the United States  
and Puerto Rico now charge for various services, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud the desire to want to cut new ground, but we're  
tax-exempt for a reason,'' said Riggins, ``and one is to serve the 
public. I just don't think that we want to charge. It flies in the 
face of the mission of the organization.''

<HEADLINE> AutoNation Buys 16 More Franchises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- AutoNation Inc., the largest owner of car  
dealerships, announced plans Thursday to acquire 16 more franchises 
in five states for about $200 million cash as part of its 
continuing expansion into the nation's major markets. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation said the dealerships combined generate about $1  
billion in annual revenue. And more deals are on the way: Spokesman 
Oscar Suris said dealerships worth an additional $10 billion in 
revenue are in the acquisition pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company, formerly called  
Republic Industries Inc., plans eventually to turn its dealerships 
into a nationwide network of one-stop shopping centers for new and 
used cars, service, parts, rentals and accessories under the 
AutoNation USA name. 
</P>
<P>
	Run by billionaire financier H. Wayne Huizenga, AutoNation began  
buying new-car dealerships in December 1996 and within months was 
the largest automotive retailer in the nation. The latest additions 
to the AutoNation chain are in California, Colorado, Florida, Texas 
and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	In Southern California, AutoNation is buying the nine-franchise  
York Automotive Group, which will give it 69 franchises in the 
region. York operates seven franchises in Valencia, a Ford 
dealership in Huntington Beach and a Land Rover franchise in 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, AutoNation plans to buy the six-franchise Maria  
Smith Automotive Group, which includes Town &AMP; Country Chrysler in 
Seattle, Kirkland Ford, Bellevue Dodge and Kirkland 
Pontiac-Buick-GMC. The company also is buying Prestige Ford in 
Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation also said it will buy Shamrock Ford in Dublin,  
Calif., near San Francisco; Phil Steakley Chevrolet in Dallas; 
Smith Toyota in Sunrise, Fla.; and Courtesy Ford in Littleton, 
Colo., near Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Maria Smith deal has closed; the others are still  
subject to approval by the automakers and state governments, Suris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation also recently announced plans to expand its ability  
to sell cars over the Internet through a new nationwide World Wide 
Web site, AutoNationDirect.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AutoNation closed down 56 1/2 cents Thursday, at $15.50,  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also owns National Car Rental Systems Inc.  
and Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc., had 1998 sales of $17.5 billion. With 
the latest deals, AutoNation will have 276 dealerships with 394 
new-car franchises in the nation's top 50 markets.

<HEADLINE>  Moroccan Sets New Mile Run Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj figures he can break the world  
record in the mile. His own record. The one he set Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan shaved 1.26 seconds off the 6-year-old mark of  
Noureddine Morceli when he outsprinted Kenyan Noah N'Geny on the 
final stretch at the Gold Gala track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have gone as low as 3:42 without the comeback of  
N'Geny, who distracted me in the final 150 meters,'' the 
24-year-old El Guerrouj said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan also went below Morceli's old record, finishing  
second in 3:43.30. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1977 world champion in the 1,500 at Athens, Greece, El  
Guerrouj set a mile record of 3:43.13 but did not set limits to his 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope God continues to give me strength because I want to be  
the strongest in the world at all distances between 1,500 and 
5,000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, who broke the world mark set by Morceli in the  
1,500 meters at Rome last year, said he planned to rest a week in 
Belgium before running the 1,500 meters at the next stage of the 
IAAF Golden League in Paris on July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	By breaking one of track's most hallowed records, El Guerrouj  
stole the limelight from American sprinters who still produced 
outstanding performances at the Italian meet. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Maurice Greene set a meet record of 9.85 seconds  
in the 100 meters, .06 off his world mark set in Athens last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson, running his first 200 meters in six weeks,  
upset Ato Boldon, who had been the fastest over the distance so far 
this season. Johnson also set a meet record, in 19.93, and said he 
was just glad ``because I'm healthy again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had missed the U.S. championships and the opening GL stage in  
Oslo, Norway, last week because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones extended her four-year unbeaten streak in the  
women's 200 by scoring her second consecutive victory in the Golden 
League Series and staying in the running for the $1 million 
jackpot. The rich money prize is shared by all athletes who win the 
same event in all seven GL meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who shared last year's jackpot with El Guerrouj and long  
distance runner Haile Gebrselassie, said she was returning home to 
stay with the family and train quietly before the next GL leg.

3,000 and Svetlana Masterkova in the women's 800.

<HEADLINE> NASA Clears Telescope for Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The largest and most powerful X-ray  
telescope ever to be launched will leave aboard the space shuttle 
Columbia on July 20, the anniversary of man's first moon landing, 
NASA said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-day shuttle mission, led by Eileen Collins, NASA's  
first female commander, is scheduled to be launched at 12:36 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission had been surrounded in uncertainty since an Air  
Force rocket left a military satellite in the wrong orbit back in 
April. The problem was traced to an upper-stage motor. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory has the same type of  
motor, and NASA wanted to be sure there was nothing wrong with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra's attached motor is supposed to place it in an oval  
orbit, with a high point one-third of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	In development since the 1970s, Chandra is meant to detect faint  
sources of cosmic X-rays, such as quasars, exploded stars and 
possibly black holes.

<HEADLINE>  McCarty: NCAA Title to WNBA Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Anyone who doubts the role of confidence  
in basketball hasn't talked to Stephanie McCarty. In three months, 
she has gone from the toast of the NCAA tournament to getting 
benched in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The top scorer on the best team in college basketball last  
season, McCarty followed her Purdue career by quickly working her 
way into the Charlotte Sting's starting lineup. But she responded 
to her promotion by lapsing into an uncharacteristic shooting slump 
that hurt her team and landed her back in a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I'm going through a little funk,'' said McCarty, who  
has come off the bench in the past two games after shooting only 23 
percent during her five games as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	The inconsistency of McCarty's rookie season has been a stark  
turnabout for a player who had perhaps the greatest prep career by 
a woman in Indiana history before becoming the second-leading 
career scorer at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring a state-record 2,869 points in high school,  
McCarty scored 2,182 in college, including an average of 20.4 as a 
senior. She was an All-American and the top female athlete in the 
Big Ten, and topped off her college career by becoming the first 
player to cut down the nets after the Boilermakers' 17-point 
victory over Duke in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sting, who made the playoffs in each of the WNBA's first two  
seasons, drafted McCarty with the hope that the addition of a good 
outside shooter would help them challenge Houston for league 
supremacy. Early signs were that Charlotte made a wise choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off the bench, McCarty made 55 percent of her field-goal  
attempts over the Sting's first three games and scored in double 
figures each time. So when small forward Tracy Reid went on the 
injured list with a sore knee, it seemed natural to fill her spot 
in the starting lineup with McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCarty scored only 17 points over the next five games,  
missing 20 of 26 field-goal attempts. After McCarty missed all 
eight of her shots in a two-game stretch, coach Marynell Meadors 
sent her back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty has made five of eight shots in the two games since her  
demotion, and Charlotte has won both times to climb into second 
place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like having Stephanie come off the bench now,'' Meadors  
said. ``It seems to be good for her. She's more relaxed, and 
there's not as much pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who scored in double figures in every game of her  
senior season, said there are no easy answers for her struggles in 
the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is mental,'' she said. ``When I go out and  
miss a couple of shots, I get down. I'm my hardest critic. I know I 
can shoot. I need to go out and do it. And if it's not falling, I 
need to keep shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty has had to make the usual adjustments that college  
players encounter in the jump to the pros: dealing with compressed 
schedules, more travel and players who are bigger, stronger and 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	A big difference she has found is that she can't take as much  
time to shoot in the pros because the defenders can close on her 
faster. Meadors is working with McCarty in practice to help develop 
a quicker release. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it comes down to is I need to get more confidence,''  
McCarty said. ``I'm not here to do anything flashy. I just want to 
help this team win, and confidence is a big part of that.''

<HEADLINE> Mother of Switched Baby Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAFFORD, Va. (AP) -- The mother of one of two girls switched at  
birth more than four years ago reacted angrily when a judge ordered 
the custody hearing moved to the hometown of the other family. 
</P>
<P>
	Screaming ``she's my child'' outside the Stafford County  
courthouse where the ruling was made Wednesday, Paula Johnson vowed 
to get custody of Rebecca Grace Chittum from the families that have 
been raising her, the Free Lance-Star of Fredericksburg reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court Judge J. Martin Bass  
refused to hear Ms. Johnson's custody bid for her biological 
daughte, who was switched with another newborn in 1995. Bass handed 
the case to the court in Buena Vista, where Rebecca lives with 
families rearing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson said Wednesday night she will appeal the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach Ms. Johnson at her Stafford County home today  
were unsuccessful. Her lawyer was in court and unavailable for 
comment, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the switch was discovered, the families raising the two  
girls -- Callie Conley and Rebecca -- agreed to work together and 
share visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But discord has been growing, and now both sides have filed  
court papers seeking custody of both girls. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were inadvertently switched at the University of  
Virginia Medical Center more than four years ago, but the mistake 
was not discovered until last year during DNA testing conducted as 
part of a child support disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Callie, the biological daughter of Kevin Chittum and Whitney  
Rogers, went home with Ms. Johnson. Chittum and Ms. Rogers died in 
a car accident a year ago, around the time the switch was 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca, the biological daughter of Ms. Johnson and her former  
boyfriend, Carlton Conley, went home with Chittum and Ms. Rogers, 
and has been raised since their death by the dead couple's two sets 
of parents.

	JUPITER ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- A man charged with stealing two sets  
of clubs from golfer Greg Norman returned them when he realized 
they were ones Norman uses in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he knew at the time he'd stolen THE tournament

	Once he realized that, he ``panicked and brought them back,''  
Smith said.

</P>
<P>
	The clubs were returned to Norman before he left Tuesday for

<HEADLINE>  Moroccan Sets New Mile Run Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj figures he can break the world  
record in the mile. His own record. The one he set Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan shaved 1.26 seconds off the 6-year-old mark of  
Noureddine Morceli when he outsprinted Kenyan Noah N'Geny on the 
final stretch at the Gold Gala track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have gone as low as 3:42 without the comeback of  
N'Geny, who distracted me in the final 150 meters,'' the 
24-year-old El Guerrouj said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan also went below Morceli's old record, finishing  
second in 3:43.30. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1977 world champion in the 1,500 at Athens, Greece, El  
Guerrouj set a mile record of 3:43.13 but did not set limits to his 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope God continues to give me strength because I want to be  
the strongest in the world at all distances between 1,500 and 
5,000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, who broke the world mark set by Morceli in the  
1,500 meters at Rome last year, said he planned to rest a week in 
Belgium before running the 1,500 meters at the next stage of the 
IAAF Golden League in Paris on July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	By breaking one of track's most hallowed records, El Guerrouj  
stole the limelight from American sprinters who still produced 
outstanding performances at the Italian meet. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Maurice Greene set a meet record of 9.85 seconds  
in the 100 meters, .06 off his world mark set in Athens last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson, running his first 200 meters in six weeks,  
upset Ato Boldon, who had been the fastest over the distance so far 
this season. Johnson also set a meet record, in 19.93, and said he 
was just glad ``because I'm healthy again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had missed the U.S. championships and the opening GL stage in  
Oslo, Norway, last week because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones extended her four-year unbeaten streak in the  
women's 200 by scoring her second consecutive victory in the Golden 
League Series and staying in the running for the $1 million 
jackpot. The rich money prize is shared by all athletes who win the 
same event in all seven GL meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who shared last year's jackpot with El Guerrouj and long  
distance runner Haile Gebrselassie, said she was returning home to 
stay with the family and train quietly before the next GL leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Those keeping a winning streak for the jackpot after the Golden  
Gala included Allen Johnson in the 110-meter hurdles, Wilson 
Kipketer in the 800, Erick Walder in the long jump, Bernard 
Barmasai in the 3,000 steeplechase, Gabriela Szabo in the women's 
3,000 and Svetlana Masterkova in the women's 800.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Won't Fight Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A woman accused of planting bombs in the  
1970s as a radical member of the Symbionese Liberation Army will 
not fight extradition nor challenge her identity, her lawyer said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By agreeing to extradition, Sara Jane Olson will essentially  
admit she is Kathleen Ann Soliah, a woman who the FBI said has been 
in hiding for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Olson, she married, had children and became an active  
member of her St. Paul community. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators say that as Ms. Soliah, she placed pipe bombs  
under two Los Angeles police cars in 1975 in retaliation for a 
shootout with police the year before in which six SLA members were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been wanted on murder conspiracy ever since.  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles authorities plan to fly her to the city early next  
week where a bail hearing has been set for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Olson wants to put this matter behind her as quickly as  
possible so she can be reunited with her husband and daughters, 
return to St. Paul and resume her volunteer work in the 
community,'' her lawyer, Howard Bass, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old woman and her physician husband have three  
daughters. Supporters say she is a typical ``soccer mom'' and 
occasional actress who has led an exemplary life of service to her 
family, church and community.

<HEADLINE> Networks Air Murder Suspect's Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks rushed to broadcast Benjamin  
Smith's venomous words as experts wondered whether that amounted to 
giving the racist shooting suspect the attention he had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Today'' show and ABC's ``Good Morning America'' both  
showed interviews of the 21-year-old Smith, blamed by authorities 
for shootings that killed two and wounded nine. It ended Sunday 
with Smith's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ABC interview, conducted by a documentary filmmaker,  
Smith said a racial holy war was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they violate our constitutional rights and say we can't put  
out our literature, we have no choice but to resort to acts of 
violence and really to plunge this country into a terrorist war 
they've never seen before,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News purchased the video, for an undisclosed price, from  
Beverly Peterson, a Kiplinger fellow at Ohio State University. She 
had interviewed Smith as part of a documentary on racial hate 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' beat ABC by one day in obtaining footage of Smith  
through a fluke: A network intern who was a student at Indiana 
University had interviewed Smith for a school project. ``Today'' 
showed portions of the interview Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On NBC, Smith described Jews as ``a parasitic race'' and  
suggested that blacks be deported to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC considered the impact of Smith's words before broadcasting  
them, said Mike Bass, senior broadcast producer on ``Today.'' He 
said the story's biggest question was why Smith did it, something 
the white supremacist's words helped explain. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at ABC, Su-Lin Nichols, echoed that: ``We felt  
that airing the interview was helping to put the event in 
context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two experts in criminology believed the videos helped explain  
hate groups. Jack Levin, a sociology professor at Northeastern 
University, compared this video broadcast to Geraldo Rivera's 
interview of skinheads a decade ago that prompted anti-hate crime 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is also a danger in showing too much, said Brian  
Levin, an assistant professor of criminal justice at California 
State University, San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people in this movement crave fame,'' Levin said. ``What  
we might be doing is subtly encouraging people who are vulnerable 
to go out and posthumously get their 15 minutes of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After broadcasting Smith's words on ``Today,'' host Matt Lauer  
acknowledged that supremacist groups received more publicity with 
such airings than by distributing pamphlets. But Morris Dees of the 
Southern Poverty Law Center, the expert Lauer interviewed, lauded 
``Today'' for public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ABC and CBS expressed interest in Peterson's video, which  
was shopped to the networks by the head of her journalism program 
at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, the network came under attack for not disclosing that  
it paid for the video supplied by a friend of one of the Columbine 
High School gunmen. This Wednesday, on ``Good Morning America,'' 
Diane Sawyer indicated that ABC News bought material and she would 
replay a portion of the interview on her program.

<HEADLINE> USA Network Goes With Unconventional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As its shorthand title suggests, the new USA  
Network drama ``GvsE'' takes a flip look at the battle between good 
and evil. 
</P>
<P>
	In the realm of television, USA Network programming chief  
Stephen Chao sees a different kind of eternal struggle: the one in 
which unconventional shows compete for shelf space with 
cookie-cutter fare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the crime is if you spend all the money that we  
(networks) spend to make television shows and you just imitate 
forms that are already there. That's a total waste of money,'' he 
said. ``You should end up in jail for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chao, who's marking his first year at the cable channel, is in  
the right spot to exercise his brand of idealism. USA Network has 
managed to pin audiences with wrestling, reruns and truly cheesy 
and predictable series (``La Femme Nikita'' aside) but could use 
some fresh moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really like the network unless a 'Jaws' rerun was on,  
but I liked Chao,'' said Josh Pate, who created ``GvsE'' with his 
twin brother, Jonas. ``None of us are crazy about the programming, 
but this is a beginning of a new era for USA Network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Chao can do better, or at least do something different, he  
has a boss likely to let him try. He and USA Network owner Barry 
Diller were successfully paired once before, at fledgling Fox 
Broadcasting Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Chao, a producer at the time, helped then-Fox Inc. chairman  
Diller muscle in on the turf of the big three networks with the 
late 1980s reality-TV innovations ``COPS'' and ``America's Most 
Wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As his track record indicates -- and his Harvard University  
education notwithstanding -- Chao isn't likely to turn USA Network 
into an intellectual haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he enjoys as a viewer, Chao, who favors jeans and  
T-shirt, ticks off the following: World Wresting Federation, MTV, 
``The Simpsons,'' and, of course, ``shows with a twist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``GvsE,'' his first USA Network series, is just that. The  
fantasy-drama turns Los Angeles into a stamping ground for agents 
of the devil who prey on vulnerable souls. Their adversaries: The 
Corp, who are in service to the Almighty. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton Rohner (``Murder One'') and Richard Brooks (``Law &AMP;  
Order'') co-star in the series debuting 8 p.m. EDT Sunday, July 18. 
The supporting cast includes former NFL player Deacon Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	If the premise echoes other shows (including the recently  
departed ``Brimstone,'' which pitted Peter Horton against evil), 
the style doesn't. The show has a decidedly retro look, including 
the ``Afro'' hairstyle and 1970s wardrobe sported by Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	That contrasts with the new-wave editing featuring quick cuts  
and fervid, split-screen images. The show was pitched in shorthand, 
Josh Pate says, as ``techno Blaxploitation'' with a satiric edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the tradition of deconstructive science fiction, like  
'Ghostbusters,' 'Men in Black,''' Pate adds. ``I think even 'Buffy 
the Vampire Slayer' gets kind of deconstructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pate brothers have a ``vernacular sense of fun and humor  
that I don't see that often in TV but I see a lot in films (like) 
'Pulp Fiction' or 'Men in Black,''' said Chao. ``I just think they 
have a very smart voice ... and they don't write in 'TV words.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As Chao sees it, TV words are those conventions followed by  
popular series like ``NYPD Blue'' or any Aaron Spelling drama. 
``But if you look at film, there's a little more variety and a few 
more interesting voices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he considers it a variation on the drama format,  
``GvsE'' is not ``off the deep end,'' Chao said. He knows because 
he's taken the plunge before. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an idea comes around that's as pure and simple as 'COPS'  
was in 1988, I would jump on it in a second. I just haven't seen 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other upcoming programs include an as-yet undetailed drama from  
teen heartthrob-turned-producer Shaun Cassidy (who did the 
short-lived but eye-catching drama ``American Gothic'') and a 
Hallmark miniseries, ``Attila the Hun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chao says he doesn't have a master plan for the network, other  
than junking its women-in-jeopardy films and finding shows like 
``GvsE'' that tweak the television picture and win viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than enough, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``As a programmer, you put on the most interesting shows you  
can, you find the best voices, and they're not all similar. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are, you're not doing your job.''  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Rothschild Collection Could Fetch $40 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Their fortune destroyed by the Nazis during World  
War II, the Austrian arm of the Rothschild clan has placed a 
spectacular collection of art and furnishings on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few names as big as Rothschild,'' said Alex  
Hope, who organized today's sale for Christie's. ``There will be 
very few collections that will rival this in importance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 250 paintings, pieces of furniture and decorative objects  
evoke another era -- a time when barons Nathaniel and Albert von 
Rothschild, scions of the Austrian arm of the 250-year-old banking 
dynasty, were the foremost collectors in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The fabulous collection they amassed is expected to fetch more  
than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Their descendants are selling the treasures because they no  
longer have opulent homes in which to display the pieces. While the 
Nazis protected the family's art collection, they ruined the 
Rothschilds financially, destroying their factories and 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Photographs of Nathaniel Rothschild's home in Vienna, included  
in the auction catalog, demonstrate the dramatic change in the 
family's fortunes since the first half of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	One photo, of the drawing room, shows a painting by the Dutch  
master Franz Hals, ``Portrait of Tieleman Roosterman,'' valued by 
Christie's at $4 million to $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just one of many precious objects in the room, competing  
for attention with lavish furniture and Oriental carpets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Nazis seized the Rothschilds' property in 1938, the  
art remained hidden, mostly in salt mines, until it was recovered 
by American soldiers after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection then was turned over to the Austrian government,  
which put it on display in the country's museums and libraries. It 
finally agreed to return it to the Rothschild family in February, 
to right what it called an ``immoral'' wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope said only the collection of the Rothschilds' brother,  
Ferdinand -- who worked in the London branch of the family's 
financial houses -- rivals the items on sale at Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the three inspired the term ``le gout Rothschild,'' a  
reference to their predilection for works of surpassing quality, 
frequently with a royal connection. 
</P>
<P>
	A wooden commode, or cabinet, that was commissioned by Louis XVI  
and later furnished his private library at Versailles exemplifies 
the Rothschilds' collecting style. It is expected to sell for $2.4 
million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other notable items on sale is a Book of Hours made in  
Flanders in the early 16th century. Its red velvet cover is clean 
and soft, and the colors of the 67 full-page illuminations remain 
brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, expected to fetch $3.3 million to $4.9 million, was  
kept in the National Library of Vienna and rarely displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of Ferdinand's collection is on public view at  
Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, 50 miles northwest of London, 
but the auction could be the last chance for the public to view the 
Austrian treasures. 
</P>
<P>
	Although museums from around the world have shown interest in  
the sale, private buyers are likely to outbid museums for most of 
the pieces, Christie's said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Entering Gold Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- As gold prices wilt, so goes  
South Africa's mining industry: Five gold-mining companies asked 
for layoffs Thursday, and the government said it would implore 
Western countries to help bolster the metal's value. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoff request is the latest bad news for South Africa's  
vital but declining gold industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The five marginally profitable mines asked the Gold Crisis  
Committee on Thursday for permission to cut their workforces by a 
total of 11,700 jobs, further exacerbating worries over dropping 
employment in the mining sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gold Crisis Committee -- on which ministry, industry and  
union representatives sit -- urged the five mines seeking layoffs to 
find another way out of their financial crunch, said Ayanda Nkuhlu, 
a ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies include Oryx, Libanon, Randfontein Estates, Durban  
Roodepoort Deep and Buffelsfontein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England sold some gold reserves Wednesday, causing  
prices to drop by $6.80 to reach $257 an ounce Thursday. South 
Africa's government called the sale ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, one of the country's oldest firms, East Rand  
Proprietary Mines, announced it would move to liquidate because it 
could no longer make a profit with gold at its current price, down 
about 11 percent since May. The liquidation would lay off 5,000 
miners. 
</P>
<P>
	The events prompted a large protest Wednesday outside the mining  
ministry and the British diplomatic mission in the capital, 
Pretoria, 80 miles north of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to dissuade European countries from selling off  
their reserves and causing further pain, a delegation of gold 
industry and union officials will begin a tour Sunday to Britain, 
Germany, France and Switzerland, Minerals and Energy Minister 
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said. 
</P>
<P>
	They will meet central bank and government officials in each  
country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa is still the world's leading gold producer, and the  
metal provides 20 percent of the country's export earnings. But 
with the longtime slide in prices, it has fallen to half its former 
workforce of 500,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	However, while the union and industry joined forces to fight  
declining gold prices, they were at loggerheads over labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Union of Mineworkers said it had hit a deadlock  
with industry in contract negotiations for coal and gold workers. 
With the two sides differing over a wage increase, negotiations 
were due to continue, but no new date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold crisis is a major challenge to the African National  
Congress government, which has promised to improve the lives of 
South Africa's millions of impoverished blacks, 42 percent of whom 
are unemployed.

<HEADLINE> FEC: Voter Law Increases Rolls by 7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 7 million Americans have registered to  
vote since 1994 because of the ``motor voter'' law, the Federal 
Election Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, registration among the voting-age population rose  
to 70.15 percent in 1998 -- the highest percentage in a 
non-presidential election year since 1970, the commission said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Voter Registration Act, which took effect in 1995,  
was designed to make it easier to register. It required 44 states 
and the District of Columbia to let people register by mail, when 
they renew their driver's licenses and when applying for welfare or 
disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	But an increase in registration doesn't necessarily mean higher  
turnout in elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the motor voter law has created an ``upward pressure in  
the turnout figure,'' actual turnout declined between 1994 and 
1998, said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of 
the American Electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of voters declined from 39 percent of those  
eligible to 36 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC said motor vehicle offices yielded the highest volume of  
registration applications, 43 percent, while 25 percent of new 
registrations were by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of registered voters rose from 124.6 million in 1994  
to 136.6 million in 1998, a 10 percent jump. Some of the increase 
would have occurred anyway, as the number of people reaching voting 
age increased, said Bill Kimberling, deputy director of the Office 
of Electoral Administration at the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC estimated that about 7 million people registered as a  
direct result of the motor voter law. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, New Hampshire and  
Wyoming were exempted from the law because they either register 
voters on Election Day or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC study also excluded Nevada, which didn't reply to the  
commission's questionnaire.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Programs Aimed At Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	America's war on poverty has been fought mostly with programs  
for poor people. But since the 1960s, some presidents also have 
launched an array of initiatives to revitalize depressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
	JOHNSON: Created the Department of Housing and Urban Development  
and the Office of Economic Opportunity. Started the Model Cities 
Program, which gave cities money to tear down old buildings and 
replace them with new housing and commercial projects. Funded urban 
renewal in ghetto areas by providing money for housing, social 
services, job training and community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	NIXON: Started the Community Development Block Grant Program,  
which still provides lump sums to cities for redevelopment projects 
determined by local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	CARTER: The Urban Redevelopment Action Grant program gave  
assistance to targeted economic development projects in urban 
areas. Signed the Community Reinvestment Act, the first major 
program to fight discrimination by mortgage lenders. Set up an 
office at HUD to focus on revitalizing neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	REAGAN: Slashed funds for community development, triggering  
greater support from the private sector and foundations. Offered 
low-income housing tax credit that provided tax breaks for 
businesses to invest in low-income housing. During his two terms, 
many states set up enterprise zone programs to foster economic 
activity in poor neighborhoods with tax subsidies and regulatory 
relief for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	BUSH: Started a block-grant program to cities for housing  
rehabilitation and development. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Launched empowerment zones, which are economically  
disadvantaged areas that offer tax relief to attract new business 
as well as housing redevelopment and enhanced local services. Gave 
extra funding to community development corporations. Gave cities 
approval to dismantle old public housing development projects and 
replace them with townhouses and single-family homes for the poor.

<HEADLINE> Search Engines Lag Behind Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Internet search engines aren't keep pace with the explosive  
growth of the Web, researchers reported today in the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Their study found that search engines -- which enable a computer  
user to find information by typing in a word or combination of 
words -- cover a diminishing fraction of Web pages and take a long 
time to list new sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The most comprehensive engine, Northern Light, covers only about  
one-sixth of the Internet pages that search engines can reach, the 
study found. That is down from one-third for the best engine 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Light is closely followed by Snap and Altavista.  
Hotbot, which led with 34 percent coverage in the previous study, 
was down to 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that it takes more than six months on  
average for a new Web page to make it into a search engine's 
listings. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 11 search engines was conducted by computer  
scientists Steve Lawrence and C. Lee Giles at the NEC Research 
Institute in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence and Giles estimated that as of February, the searchable  
Web consisted of 800 million pages containing more than 6 trillion 
characters. Their December 1997 survey put the number of pages at 
about 320 million. By comparison, the 532 miles of shelves in the 
Library of Congress contain an estimated 20 trillion characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Search engines use computers called ``spiders'' that  
continuously surf the Web. They save each page they visit, then 
follow the links on the page to find other pages. When a user types 
in a word, the engine looks in its index to see which pages contain 
it. A page that's not listed in the index will not be found. 
</P>
<P>
	The spiders are more likely to find pages that have more links  
going to them from other pages. Lawrence said that may make it hard 
for new sites to make it into search engine listings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence also said search engines may be lagging because their  
databases become more expensive as they grow, without necessarily 
creating more advertising profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Krellenstein, chief technical officer at Northern Light,  
said he believes the fraction covered by the search engines is 
actually larger, because he considers the study's estimate of the 
size of the Web a bit high. 
</P>
<P>
	Krellenstein also questioned whether search engines need to  
concern themselves with every new site. He said they focus on good 
sites that are of more interest to users. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the Web is growing so fast doesn't mean the  
quality part is growing as fast,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Oakland Dock Workers End Walkout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Dock workers returned to their jobs today  
after shutting down the Oakland port for two days in the middle of 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant cranes were once again lifting cargo on and off ships at  
the port, where containers of everything from California fruit and 
computer components to Hawaiian cows had been stuck in transit, 
port spokeswoman Roberta Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkout by 1,400 workers forced cargo-laden vessels to slow  
down across the Pacific Ocean or wait at anchor in San Francisco 
Bay just outside the port, which handles 12 percent of West Coast 
shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is back at work,'' said Steve Stallone, a spokesman  
for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union local 
representing the stevedores at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	He said talks would resume Friday in San Francisco with  
management's Pacific Maritime Association over a new three-year 
contract with the West Coast's 10,000 longshoremen. They have been 
working without a contract since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The PMA had asked the National Labor Relations Board to force  
the longshoremen back to the docks. Stallone said union members 
decided Wednesday night to return to work and put the issue that 
prompted the walkout to an arbitrator once a contract is in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallone said the work stoppage was spontaneous and not directed  
by union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkout began Tuesday morning in protest of a management  
decision not to hire a second ``signalman'' below each of the 
port's massive cranes. It's a safety issue, the union said, 
pointing to the potential for serious accidents as the cranes 
transfer trucking containers between tractor-trailers and cargo 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Management characterized the demand as an illegal and  
unnecessarily expensive padding of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The work stoppage was limited to the Oakland port, although  
longshoremen in Los Angeles and Long Beach refused to work overtime 
or during lunch. Dock work continued normally in San Diego, Seattle 
and Portland, Ore.

<HEADLINE> Report: China City Cites McDonald's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- A Chinese city has accused McDonald's Corp. of  
breaking the country's labor law and failing to provide more than 
1,000 part-time workers old age and medical insurance, a report 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Bureau of the southern city of Shenzhen said a  
recent investigation showed that only 400 of McDonald's 1,480 
part-time employees were insured, China's semi-official China News 
Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the part-time workers never signed any labor contracts  
with the restaurant, the American fastfood chain is still 
responsible to sign them up for state-run insurance as required by 
law, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officials have issued a letter to the company  
requesting an unspecified amount of back payments for the workers, 
except students and people who already have coverage at other 
companies they work for, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's greater China representatives were not available for  
comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most employees work for four to eight hours a day for 50 to 88  
cents per hour, the report said.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Managers Want More Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For every player who felt slighted after being  
left off the All-Star game rosters, managers Joe Torre and Bruce 
Bochy can only sympathize and plead for understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The dilemma for both was having more deserving players than they  
had room on their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre and Bochy agreed Thursday that the toughest part of  
assembling their teams for the 70th All-Star Game Tuesday night at 
Boston was deciding which players to leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many deserving players not on the club,'' said  
Torre, who will manage the American League for the second time in 
three years. ``I know Bruce is aching the same way I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it would be difficult,'' said the NL's Bochy, who is  
managing in his first All-Star game. ``When you try to figure it 
out, you start thinking about players who deserve to go but you 
don't have a spot for them. It was a little tougher than I 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Torre and Bochy said they would like rosters expanded by  
five players to provide more room for the managers to fit in 
deserving players. All-Star rosters were set at 28 players from 
1969 until last year when they went to 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said the toughest call for him was in the outfield.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many you can choose,'' he said, ticking off names  
like Troy O'Leary of Boston and Jermaine Dye of Kansas City, both 
hitting over .300 with 17 home runs going into Thursday's games, 
but left off the AL team. 
</P>
<P>
	He also mentioned Mike Sweeney and Johnny Damon of Kansas City,  
Toronto's Carlos Delgado and Seattle teammates Alex Rodriguez and 
Edgar Martinez as players he would have selected if he had room. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said his most difficult call was passing on Harold Baines  
of the Baltimore Orioles. ``It was so tough with the great years 
he's had, with his reputation, to have to leave him off the team,'' 
Torre said. ``He's been around a long time and he's putting up 
terrific numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baines was batting .341 with 18 home runs and 60 RBIs as  
Baltimore's designated hitter going into Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre at first had to pass on Cleveland pitcher Charles Nagy,  
then added him when Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees was 
forced to withdraw in order to take care of personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching was tough for me,'' Bochy said. ``In the National  
League, we're seeing some of the best in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned relievers Armando Benitez of New York, John Rocker  
of Atlanta and Jeff Shaw of Los Angeles who were left off despite 
fine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Position players he had to pass on included outfielders Roger  
Cedeno of New York, leading the NL in stolen bases, and Henry 
Rodriguez of Chicago, the league's No. 4 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mets were tough,'' he said. ``Their infield (John) Olerud,  
(Edgardo) Alfonzo, (Rey) Ordonez and (Robin) Ventura, all could 
have made it. But because of the parameters, they were left off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star regulations require that every team have at least one  
representative on the team. By adding five more roster spots, Torre 
and Bochy said deserving players could be acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting there, being there and recognized is the most  
important thing,'' Torre said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Examines Secret Beckwith Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The FBI is examining secretly recorded  
jailhouse conversations in which segregationist Byron De La 
Beckwith purportedly brags of shooting blacks and talks about how 
to dispose of bodies in a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith, 78, was convicted in 1994 of the ambush killing of  
NAACP official Medgar Evers outside his home in 1963. He is serving 
a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings were made from 1996 to 1998 by Donald Tominello,  
a onetime Beckwith family friend who says he intends to use the 
material to write a book, The Clarion-Ledger reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper included excerpts from a recording supposedly made  
in 1997, in which Beckwith is said to admit shooting blacks ``once 
in awhile, and what's wrong with that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said agents are reviewing that tape and about 30 others,  
along with letters written by Beckwith. The tapes have been sent to 
an FBI lab in Washington to determine their authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities decided to examine the tapes primarily because of a  
conversation Tominello supposedly had with Beckwith regarding the 
possibility of bodies in McIntyre Lake, not far from Beckwith's 
hometown of Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith questions whether anything would be found if the lake  
were dredged. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you threw somebody in the lake, they usually float up a  
few days later,'' he is quoted as saying. ``What you should do is 
cut 'em open and then tie things around them.'' In that way, ``the 
fish will just eat him up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith's attorney, Merrida Coxwell Jr., said that even if  
Beckwith is the person speaking on the tapes, the information can't 
be trusted because of Beckwith's failing health. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be skeptical what he has said about involvement in  
something else,'' Coxwell said. ``I certainly don't know that I 
would run and drain a lake.''

<HEADLINE> Dirty Scopes Sicken Lung Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Pencil-thin scopes used to look inside patients'  
lungs sickened two people in New York state because the instruments 
were not properly disinfected, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the  
instruments, called bronchoscopes, were contaminated with bacteria 
because they weren't connected properly to machines that flush them 
with disinfectant. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronchoscopes are used to diagnose respiratory diseases such as  
tuberculosis and lung cancer. The tubes, about 5 feet long, are 
inserted into a patient's lungs through the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC investigated cases of 30 patients at three New York  
state hospitals whose lung fluids were contaminated by bacteria 
from bronchoscopes in 1996 and 1998. Two of the patients became ill 
with pneumonia-like symptoms, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third patient tested positive for tuberculosis, but  
researchers couldn't determine if it was caused by a contaminated 
bronchoscope.

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Lawler Runs for Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The latest pro wrestler to enter politics  
got the 25 signatures needed to qualify for the election before 
even leaving the building where he picked up the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry ``The King'' Lawler, 49, went to the Election Commission  
offices Wednesday, and people waiting for jury duty assignments 
filled his petition to run for mayor of Memphis. Many got 
autographs from Lawler in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what I bring to the table is somebody who has no  
strings attached, no political past, don't owe anything to any 
special interest groups or any groups whatsoever and can look at 
every situation with just some common sense,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawler's candidacy adds more interest to what already was an  
intriguing race that includes two-term incumbent Willie Herenton, 
the city's first elected black mayor, and City Councilman Joe Ford, 
brother of former U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Sr., an ardent foe of 
Herenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawler, a wrestling fixture in Memphis for nearly three decades,  
works for the national World Wrestling Federation as a commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, former WWF wrestler Jesse Ventura was elected  
governor of Minnesota. Bob Backlund, another former WWF wrestler, 
is running for Congress in Connecticut this year.

gain the skills they need for high-tech jobs. With Clinton was 
Magic Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers star who has

at department stores and discount chains, was up 6.3 percent. The

changes in its treatment of women, Navy leaders are considering 
restoring official recognition to the aviators group that was host 
for the debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehabilitating the Tailhook Association is a remaining piece of  
``unfinished business'' in the Navy's effort to put the scandal 
behind it, Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that the Tailhook episode is an ``emotional  
and sensitive issue,'' Johnson said he is weighing only the 
practical question of whether Tailhook belongs back in the Navy 
fold as an organization meant to foster camaraderie and 
professional enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seriously at work with the leadership of the Tailhook  
Association, working to make sure that we've learned the lessons we 
needed to learn -- which we have -- and that we've institutionalized 
those lessons,'' Johnson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The admiral said he would make a recommendation to Navy  
Secretary Richard Danzig shortly. Other Navy officials, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said the intention is to sanction a modest 
level of official Navy participation in the 1999 Tailhook 
convention, scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Sparks, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonny McClung, a retired Navy captain who has been president of  
the Tailhook Association since 1995, said in an interview Thursday, 
``We think the timing is right'' to get back in the Navy's good 
graces. His organization, named for the hook on a plane that snags 
an arresting cable on the landing deck of an aircraft carrier, has 
about 10,000 members -- down from its 1991 peak of about 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its annual conventions, which include professional  
seminars, the group sponsors college scholarships for children of 
former naval aviators and publishes a magazine on carrier aviation 
called Hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson attended the September 1991 convention of Tailhook  
members at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel but was never touched by the 
scandal, which triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. 
Lawrence Garrett and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, 
then the chief of naval operations. It also led to lawsuits, 
multiple investigations and changes in the Navy -- including more 
emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment awareness and an opening 
of more aviation opportunities for women. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1991 the Navy ended all support ``in any manner  
whatsoever, direct or indirect'' for Tailhook. For several years 
afterward, the Senate required that it be informed of any Tailhook 
participation by any Navy or Marine Corps officer whose nomination 
for promotion was before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he has great confidence that Tailhook's new leaders  
will set the right course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at the organization itself, what their vision is,  
what their commitment is, how they view themselves as we go into 
the 21st century, and what that means for the United States Navy,'' 
Johnson added. If the organization has really changed its ways, 
``then I would be in a position to support it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear how Congress will react, although Sen. John  
Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wrote to 
Danzig on March 31 urging a restoration of official ties to 
Tailhook. He said it would boost morale and help encourage pilots 
to stay in the Navy and Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they keep it clean, above-board and proper,'' then  
Tailhook conventions can be helpful to the Navy, Rep. Ike Skelton 
of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on House Armed Services 
Committee, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Duff Campbell, of the National Women's Law Center and an  
expert on issues involving women in the military, said in an 
interview she has mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing for them to say it won't happen again, but are  
they treating women aviators with welcoming arms?'' she said. If 
the organization is sincerely committed to supporting women fliers, 
and not just men, then it probably will be beneficial to restore 
official Navy recognition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any discussion of Tailhook is bound to recall the debauchery of  
the 1991 convention in Las Vegas, for which the Defense Department 
Inspector General implicated 117 officers for sexual assault, 
indecent exposure and other acts, and faulted the Navy's leaders 
for failing to stop the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Navy careers were ruined by the scandal although no one was  
court-martialed.

<HEADLINE> Campus Aide Arrested Over Gun Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A gang member who worked as a campus aide at  
a local high school was arrested for trying to sell a sawed-off 
shotgun to a teen-age student, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lau, 22, was taken into custody Wednesday when he  
arrived at work at John Marshal High School. He was booked for 
investigation of possession of an unregistered firearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lau allegedly approached an 18-year-old senior at the school  
last month about buying the weapon. The student reported the 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Lau is a member of the Wah Ching, an Asian  
crime syndicate allegedly involved in illegal gambling and 
extortion. He had been arrested once while a juvenile, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	School district officials said they didn't know of Lau's past  
when he was hired in September 1997. A check of Lau's background 
did not turn up any record of the earlier arrest, said school 
district police Chief Wesley Mitchell.

<HEADLINE> Court Tells Ameritech To Drop Codes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The Michigan Supreme Court ruled  
unanimously Thursday that local telephone companies cannot force 
customers to dial five or six extra digits in order to use another 
local long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves long-distance phone calls made within areas  
where Ameritech Michigan and long-distance companies like AT&AMP;T 
Corp. and MCI Communications Inc. compete head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech had claimed it could require customers to dial a  
five-digit code before the call would be handled by another 
company. The other companies argued that state law required 
Ameritech to handle their calls just like any other long-distance 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the ruling changes little that is in effect now,  
although the court returned the case to the state Public Service 
Commission for consideration of costs due various companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a customer standpoint nothing changes. ... It is business  
as usual,'' said Sara Snyder, a spokeswoman for Ameritech. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Pruyn, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T Communications of  
Michigan Inc., called it a win for consumers, who he said will save 
money as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes after years of wrangling over opening  
Michigan's long-distance market. It overturns part of a Court of 
Appeals ruling handed down earlier, including the lower court's 
decision that PSC orders for Ameritech to cut some charges to the 
long-distance carriers were improper. 
</P>
<P>
	The PSC took up the dispute in 1992, and eventually ruled for  
the long-distance companies, telling Ameritech to get rid of the 
codes. It also ordered Ameritech to reduce access charges -- the 
fees it charged long-distance carriers for using its phone lines -- 
by 55 percent in areas that still required access codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Those decisions were reinstated by the Supreme Court on  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China's Team Wants Home Cooking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- On Tuesday, it was order in, Chinese  
food. On Wednesday, it was order in, Chinese food. The following 
night, ditto. 
</P>
<P>
	China's soccer team is hungry for some home cooking.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ma Yuanen patiently fielded questions about his players  
and their upcoming World Cup championship match against the United 
States, then suddenly grew animated when asked about his team's 
stay in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food is too simple, the variety is too limited, so we  
always have orders delivered from Chinese restaurants,'' Ma said, 
smiling and gesturing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese are accustomed to having a spread of many dishes  
with a variety of tastes at each meal, unlike the meat-and-potatoes 
or chicken-and-peas simplicity of basic American fare. 
</P>
<P>
	Even well-meaning Chinese-Americans haven't been of much help.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have met many warmhearted Chinese people,'' Ma said,  
speaking through an interpreter. ``You meet Chinese people, you 
take at least two hours to chat; it's a cultural thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want the food.''  
</P>
<P>
	Food and flights -- without even considering food on flights --  
have been the biggest adjustments for the Chinese players and staff 
during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting the trip from Massachusetts earlier this week for  
Saturday's game at the Rose Bowl, the Chinese have made four 
cross-country trips and built up 12,673 frequent flyer miles during 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The American players have flown less than half that much, with  
just one cross-country trip and a total of 5,498 miles. The 
Americans played their semifinal up the coast at Stanford, while 
the Chinese were back East in Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let that cost us energy; we have just tried to stay  
with our program,'' Ma said. ``That (the travel) has been something 
that has been out of the control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you worry about those things, it can affect you. We just  
want to be psychologically ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the traveling time and eating out of cardboard cartons  
hasn't seemed to bother China's players. They sailed through their 
group with a 3-0 record, outscoring opponents 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Russia 2-0 in the quarterfinals, they overwhelmed  
defending World Cup champion Norway 5-0 in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	China has scored 19 goals in the tournament, one more than the  
United States, and Sun Wen is the top individual scorer with seven 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gao Hong, one of the best goalkeepers in the world, has allowed  
only two shots to get past her in the five games. Her American 
counterpart, Briana Scurry, has been almost as successful, giving 
up just three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	China beat the United States in two of their last three  
meetings, and Ma, asked to compare the teams, said the Americans 
have a very good, aggressive attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very familiar with the USA team and its tactics,'' the  
coach said. ``We're quite familiar with each key player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team has good ball-controlling ability, and very fluent  
combinations between the players. We have very good organization 
overall, defending and attacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High-scoring forward Sun said that, while the United States has  
a fine front line, she believes China might have more depth on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a high level with all three of our lines,  
the forwards, the midfield and the defense,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ma wasn't very happy Thursday when the American practice -- and  
the accompanying media circus -- lasted well into China's practice 
period at Pomona-Pitzer college. But, in an earlier conversation, 
he said he liked the championship matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very exciting match. No matter which team wins, it will  
be a good performance,'' the coach said. ``If China wins, the whole 
country will be totally excited.''

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Rise in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds rose by $15.29 billion in the latest week to $871.03 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $9.65 billion to $720.48 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets rose by $5.64 billion to $150.55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $15.08  
billion to $588.04 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets rose by $12.18 billion to 
$537.34 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $2.90 billion 
to $50.70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.459 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.429 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.41 percent from 4.35 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.34 percent from 4.31 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.51 percent from 4.44  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.43 percent from 4.40 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.03 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts dipped to 0.86 percent from 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.18 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.17 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.52 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.49 
percent; 4.73 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.71 percent; and 
4.92 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.89 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bob Hill To Become Fordham Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former NBA coach Bob Hill will be hired as men's  
basketball coach at Fordham, a source close to the university told 
the Associated Press on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who compiled a 257-212 record in parts of seven seasons  
with New York, Indiana and San Antonio, will replace the departed 
Nick Macarchuk, according to a source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. A news conference announcing Hill's hiring is likely to 
be scheduled early next week, the source added. Details of a 
contract weren't immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk, who coached the Rams for 12 years, resigned to take  
the coaching job at Stony Brook, which is moving up to Division I 
as an independent starting next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordham was prepared to name Hofstra's Jay Wright as the coach  
on June 16, but Wright had a change of heart the night before. 
Siena's Paul Hewitt and Lafayette's Fran O'Hanlon were mentioned as 
candidates for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's last coaching job was with San Antonio. He was fired by  
general manager Gregg Popovich in 1996 after the team got off to a 
3-15 start. Popovich replaced Hill on the bench and last month 
completed San Antonio's surge to its first-ever NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who has also been an assistant at Bowling Green,  
Pittsburgh and Kansas, was recently mentioned as a candidate for 
the Cleveland and Orlando NBA jobs, both of which have since been 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordham moved to the Atlantic 10 Conference from the Patriot  
League in 1995 and has had little success, losing 80 of 108 games 
in four seasons. The Rams have not played in the NCAA tournament 
since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Seek Delay in Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Republican National Committee panel  
searched Thursday for a way to goad states into pushing back their 
presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary have  
launched the nominating season. Other states have been scheduling 
their primaries earlier and earlier in an effort to have more say 
in who gets the party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm horrendously opposed to front-loading because a long  
process over many months is about the only way we have of assessing 
presidential candidates in this country,'' said RNC member Morton 
Blackwell of Virginia told the party's Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC sought to address the issue in 1996 by instituting rules  
that award states more delegates if they push back their primary 
contests. ``This particular bundle of carrots has not been an 
efficient incentive,'' said John Ryder, an RNC member from 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	An impromptu survey by RNC Rules Committee Chairman Tom  
Sansonetti showed that only three states pushed back their primary 
dates since 1996 -- and 17 states moved them forward. Twenty-four 
states didn't change. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell proposed to do away with the 1996 rules and start  
fresh, but his effort was rejected. Tom Rath of New Hampshire said 
the incentives might have ``retarded some of the rush'' to hold 
earlier primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson is putting together a separate advisory panel of  
senior Republicans to study the issue. The panel will issue 
findings by the end of the year, so suggestions can be considered 
during the RNC winter meeting in California next January. 
</P>
<P>
	Any changes to existing party rules would take effect with the  
2004 Republican primary.

<HEADLINE> MSNBC Cancels Hockenberry Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MSNBC has canceled newsman John Hockenberry's  
nightly talk show after six months on the air, the second time the 
correspondent has lost a show on the network in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockenberry announced on the air Wednesday that the next night's  
show would be his last. One of his final discussion topics, he told 
viewers, might be why cable TV ``sucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not immediately return a call to his office Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC spokesman Cory Shields confirmed the cancellation but had  
no further comment. MSNBC, which is struggling in prime time 
against Fox News Channel, is expected to announce a new schedule 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It is expected to include a new hour-long biography series  
anchored by Matt Lauer, ``Headliners and Legends.'' CNBC's 
``Hardball,'' with Chris Matthews as host, may also soon shift to 
MSNBC as CNBC prepares to expand its financial news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockenberry will return to ``Dateline NBC,'' where he is a  
reporter. His weekend newsmagazine, ``Edgewise,'' was canceled by 
MSNBC two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Oly. Committee Ponders Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Olympic Games' budget hole is getting  
shallower. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee executives detailed $113 million  
in budget cuts Thursday, a savings board members were told would 
shrink the gap between revenue and spending from $300 million to 
$185 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With corporate sponsors in the pipeline, it should not be  
difficult to close that gap, said SLOC president Mitt Romney, who 
has spent recent weeks traveling around the country meeting with 
chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He and chief operating officer Fraser Bullock proposed the cuts  
Thursday, but the board management committee won't vote on a new 
$1.34 billion budget until September. The biggest shares of the 
$113 million in cuts are $30 million out of staffing and $38 
million out of the inflation cushion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the city won't be dressed up as much, but we think we  
can still do a great job with the games,'' Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney promised, ``The kind of changes we're making we don't  
think will be noticed by the spectators or athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $113 million, $72 million in cuts are on a list of items  
the committee would restore if enough money is raised. 
</P>
<P>
	The board Thursday also approved ethics, open meetings and open  
records policies promised last winter during the height of the 
scandal over how Salt Lake bent the rules to win the 2002 Winter 
Games. And the board voted to expand itself by three members, to 
53. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ethics policy requires trustees and top executives to  
disclose all personal and family conflicts of interest regularly, 
to turn over to SLOC any gifts worth $100 or more, and to get 
permission to spend SLOC money on meals or gifts worth more than 
$25. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will soon name an ethics officer -- a part-time  
volunteer -- to resolve ethical questions. 
</P>
<P>
	An information room will be stocked with the committee's public  
documents, but if a staffer has to dig into filing cabinets, the 
cost will be $25 an hour. Many documents, particularly those 
dealing with sponsor agreements, will remain closed, as will the 
detailed budget. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC rank-and-file staffers will be subject to a separate ethics  
policy, still in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the raps on the bid committee -- and the organizing  
committee it became -- was that a closed atmosphere allowed 
corruption to go undetected. Gov. Mike Leavitt promised the new 
policies would open the committee to greater public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee executives have been blamed for spending more than  
$1 million on shopping sprees, travel, cash, free medical care and 
scholarships for International Olympic Committee members and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has been investigating for seven months,  
but prosecutors are still going over witness interviews, documents 
and records to see if there is enough evidence to bring criminal 
charges. No decision is imminent, a Justice Department official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the scandal no longer is an issue with the  
executives he solicits to sponsor Salt Lake's games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their interest in the games is not shadowed by the scandal.  
I've heard time and time again, `That's old news.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is proposing to cut 8 percent of the SLOC budget,  
Romney said he wants to add two more sales people to go after 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing you never want to cut back on is the people knocking  
on the doors, selling,'' he told the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members asked few questions about the proposed cuts,  
though they sought assurances that the games themselves won't be 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The board tabled a measure sought by ex-officio member Randy  
Dryer to affirm leaving legacy venues for Utah residents as a top 
objective of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After a closed-door meeting, the board's management committee  
authorized executives to negotiate a renewal of the $170 million 
line of credit with NationsBank. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustee Ken Bullock, executive director of the Utah League of  
Cities and Towns, opposed the vote and two representing the state 
Legislature and governor abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the question of when the state, cities and towns get  
$58 million from SLOC, a payback of a sales tax collected since 
1989 and used to build skating rinks, ski jumps and the luge track. 
</P>
<P>
	Years ago, before SLOC knew that it would not get the bulk of  
its broadcast revenue until March 2002, it agreed to pay back the 
money in January 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Now NationsBank wants the state and cities to wait, and Romney  
wants the same thing because otherwise, SLOC will have to borrow 
the $58 million at a cost of $2 million-plus in interest and games 
cancellation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, however, said their $29 million share is a big deal to  
cities and towns, which shouldn't be asked to wait if other parties 
-- such as the U.S. Olympic Committee and IOC -- don't make similar 
sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bank is wanting to reduce its risk at the expense  
of the cities and towns,'' Bullock said after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Boy Convicted of Murdering Neighbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTOW, Fla. (AP) -- A teen-ager was convicted Thursday of  
bludgeoning and stabbing his 8-year-old neighbor to death and 
hiding her body by stuffing it into the frame of his water bed. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated for more than two hours before convicting  
15-year-old Joshua Phillips of murdering Maddie Clifton, who lived 
across the street from him in Jacksonville. He could be sentenced 
to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua showed no emotion as the verdict was read. Maddie's  
parents, Steve and Sheila Clifton, blinked back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day of justice for Maddie,'' Sheila Clifton said  
outside the courthouse, clutching a bracelet with Maddie's name on 
it. ``That piece of my heart that's gone is waiting on the other 
side, waiting on the other side for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who was 14 at the time of the murder, was tried as an  
adult. Under Florida law, he cannot get the death penalty because 
he is under 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddie disappeared Nov. 3, 1998, prompting a search of her  
neighborhood by hundreds of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, the boy's mother, Melissa Phillips, grew  
suspicious of an odor in his room. When she pulled aside the frame 
of his bed, she saw Maddie's feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua told police that he accidentally hit Maddie in the eye  
with a baseball while they were playing in his backyard. She began 
screaming, and he panicked, fearing his father would punish him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he dragged Maddie into his bedroom and when she wouldn't  
stop screaming, he hit her in the head with a bat. When she kept 
moaning, he grabbed a knife and stabbed her in the neck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers argued that Maddie's murder was not premeditated  
and urged jurors to convict the teen of manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Ford Offer Swells to $30 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The amount Ford Motor Co. has agreed to  
pay to settle potential lawsuits brought by relatives of the six 
people killed and 14 injured in a February explosion has swelled to 
$30 million, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had said last month that it planned to pay $20 million.  
</P>
<P>
	In a two-page memorandum obtained by The Detroit News, Ford said  
it will offer each of the 20 families a $1-million lump sum 
payment. The company also will pay the salaries, benefits and 
medical insurance for the injured workers, and the families of the 
six deceased workers, until they are or would have been 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also will provide trust funds for the minor children of the  
workers killed and injured. The trust funds are valued at about 
$100,000 each, the memorandum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each family also will receive a separate $25,000 payment that  
can be used for any purpose, including to pay for a memorial or to 
donate to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman John Spelich declined to elaborate on Ford's  
written offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for the privacy of the families, we will not  
discuss this matter further publicly,'' Spelich told the News for a 
report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will submit a more complete, legally binding settlement  
offer in the next two weeks, and officials on both sides hope to 
have settlements signed and completed by the end of the month or 
early August. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Ford would pay a minimum of $11.7 million  
in estimated salaries and benefits for the employees over the next 
20 years, while the state would pay more than $5 million in workers 
compensation insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer would require the families to waive all claims against  
Ford, Rouge Steel and any other company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The families have the confidential offers from Ford and I  
continue to recommend that they accept what is a very generous 
offer from Ford,'' David Christensen, an attorney for one of the 
families, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six workers were killed and 14 seriously injured when a  
six-story boiler exploded without warning at the powerhouse that 
provided electricity for the 1,100-acre complex in Dearborn. The 
complex is home to six Ford plants and Rouge Steel, which employ a 
total of 10,000 workers there. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, three employees have filed suits in Wayne Circuit Court  
against Rouge Steel, but not against Ford. The three are the family 
of Ken Anderson, 44 of Wyandotte, who died as a result of injuries 
sustained in the accident; Patrick Pilzninski, 46, of Westland; and 
Ralph Irvin, 53, of Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Officers in Cuban Episode Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Eight Coast Guard officers who tried to stop six  
Cuban refugees from swimming to shore last week have been removed 
from law enforcement duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers currently are working on search-and-rescue missions  
or environmental duties, spokesman Lt. Ron LeBrec said Thursday. 
They will not return to law enforcement until an internal 
investigation is completed, probably within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Televised reports showed the Coast Guard blasting the refugees  
with a hose as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 150 yards 
from shore June 29. The agency swarmed them as they jumped 
overboard and swam toward land. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the swimmers was doused with pepper spray. Two reached  
the beach and four were plucked from the water and detained aboard 
a Coast Guard cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's Cuban community protested the Coast Guard's actions,  
blocking off the only road connecting Miami Beach's trendy South 
Beach and downtown Miami, and a major highway west of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. policy, foreigners who reach U.S. shores are allowed  
to seek asylum, but those intercepted at sea are returned to their 
homeland or another country. 
</P>
<P>
	The six were taken to an Immigration and Naturalization Service  
detention center for processing and released the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We in the Coast Guard feel for the plight of these illegal  
migrants,'' said Admiral Thad Allen, commander of the Coast Guard 
district which includes South Florida. ``However, the Coast Guard 
is mandated to enforce U.S. laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The admiral said he will review the use of hoses against the  
refugees, but is not willing to ban the practice because of its 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard statistics show 940 Cuban refugees have been  
detained at sea and returned to their homeland so far this year. 
That is almost as many as the 1,047 interdictions for all of 1998.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Wants Education Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continuing a weeklong trickle of  
announcements, House Republicans said Thursday that tax breaks to 
help pay for private education and public school construction will 
be part of their tax cut bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest proposal from Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House  
Ways and Means Committee, sets the GOP on a collision course with 
President Clinton, who vetoed a bill with similar private school 
benefits last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Archer, R-Texas, said the measure -- a priority for  
Republican conservatives -- would ``lighten the education tax bite'' 
and give parents ``more choices as they design the best education 
for their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, a version of which is already moving in the Senate,  
would allow private universities for the first time to offer 
prepaid tuition programs like those currently used by 19 states for 
public universities. It would also make both types of plans 
completely tax-exempt instead of deferring taxes, as current law 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer also wants to expand IRA-like savings accounts for  
education so that they apply to the costs of public or private 
elementary and secondary schools, not just higher education. The 
maximum annual amount that could be contributed would rise from 
$500 to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the proposal would change rules for revenue bonds  
so that state and local governments could more easily raise money 
for public school construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the three proposals would cost about $8 billion over  
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the private school benefits would divert too much  
federal money away from public schools and would do less than a 
Clinton alternative to help needy public schools modernize or 
replace dilapidated buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``While they purport to provide assistance to millions of  
families, the benefit is a pittance to all but the very wealthy,'' 
said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top Democrat on the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer, whose committee initiates all tax legislation in  
Congress, has taken advantage of the Capitol Hill news lull during 
the weeklong Independence Day recess to release several parts of a 
tax relief bill expected to total about $850 billion over 10 years 
using projected budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous announcements sketched out plans to cut top capital  
gains rates from 20 percent to 15 percent and create new tax breaks 
for people who care for an elderly relative at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to come are some of the most costly pieces of the plan,  
including a broad reduction in income taxes, cuts in inheritance 
taxes and elimination of the ``marriage penalty'' in which millions 
of two-earner couples pay more tax than if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Archer is considering three alternatives for the cut  
in income taxes: adjusting one or more brackets so that more income 
is taxed at lower rates, an across-the-board rate reduction that 
would gradually reach 10 percent over a decade and a 
``bottom-line'' cut in which taxpayers could take a certain 
percentage off their taxes on Internal Revenue Service forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee plans to begin moving its tax  
package next week. Its greatest significance may be as a Republican 
political statement, since Clinton is unlikely to sign it into law 
and wants some of the money used for Medicare and increased 
spending. It also faces uncertainty in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, also  
favors a broad tax cut in addition to several more specific 
reductions, said spokeswoman Ginny Flynn. Roth, R-Del., is 
considering an adjustment to the lowest 15 percent tax bracket so 
that people pay lower rates on more of their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are likely to be significant differences between Roth  
and Archer on the tax bill, starting with the total. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth is planning for a bill costing $792 billion over 10 years  
and wants some of projected budget surpluses specifically set aside 
for Medicare reform. Archer's bill is expected to reach $850 
billion and is less definite about Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Roth is less likely to include a cut in capital  
gains taxes and more likely to advance major proposals to expand 
private retirement savings. His name, after all, is now in 
Webster's dictionary because of the popular Roth IRA.

<HEADLINE> Two Rookies Favored in Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Allen Doyle and Bruce Fleisher were  
walking up to the 18th hole on the final day of the Senior Tour 
qualifying school when Fleisher breathed a sign of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been a tough week and it was almost over. Doyle, though,  
saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to him, `You know, there are going to be two or three  
guys out of this tour school that are going to win over a million 
dollars and they are going to have real good years.' He said, `Why 
shouldn't that be us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a year later, Fleisher and Doyle rank 1-2 on the  
Senior Tour money list and, yes, each has made more than $1 
million. Today, they began play in the U.S. Senior Open as two of 
the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has asked me, did I expect to have done what I did?'' Doyle  
said. ``And you know, I said, `Not really.' And he pretty much 
acknowledged that he really hadn't expected to do quite as well as 
he had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither received much professional acclaim before this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, whose unorthodox swing resembles a slap shot in hockey,  
spent most of his career as an amateur before becoming, at the age 
of 47, the oldest rookie ever on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher had a nondescript career as a touring pro and even  
dropped off the tour for a few years in the 1980s to work as a club 
pro so he could make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've found new life on the Senior Tour, where younger is  
definitely better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm finally starting to have some fun this year,'' said  
Fleisher, who became eligible for the Senior Tour when he turned 50 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Hale Irwin is starting to have some fun again  
after struggling early in the year. He entered the Open with 
victories in three of his last five tournaments, including a 
seven-stroke win in the Senior Players Championship at the TPC of 
Michigan two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in 156-man field were Larry Nelson, No. 3 on the money  
list; Vicente Fernandez, last year's runner-up; Graham Marsh, 
winner of The Tradition this year; and Christy O'Connor, coming off 
a victory in the State Farm Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is being played at Des Moines Golf and Country  
Club, a 6,888-yard, par-72 layout that never before had been the 
site of a major tournament. With its undulating greens, the course 
puts a premium on approach shots and putting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be an exciting tournament,'' Fleisher  
said. ``Hopefully, no one will get so hot like Irwin did a couple 
of weeks ago and blow everybody away. He may do it again. Who 
knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't think a low number is going to be the answer this  
week,'' he said. ``I think the greens are too difficult. I don't 
know if anyone knows the greens that well to really excel at this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin said a golfer will have to master those greens to win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a significant test for all of us,'' he said.  
``I think ... a good majority of the test will come around the 
greens -- not terribly unlike the U.S. Open this year where a good 
bit of the test was around the greens. I think we will see much the 
same here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Handling the course also will require patience, Doyle said. With  
72 holes to play, he said there's no reason to get upset over one 
or two mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to handle it properly and realize there is a long way  
to go,'' he said. ``It's not so much the guy who makes the most 
birdies that is going to win, but the guy who makes the fewest 
bogeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for that sour-looking swing, Doyle said he knows it offends  
the purists, but it works for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a kid, the club pro used to tell me, `If you can drive it  
pretty good and you've got a pretty good short game, you will be 
able to score,''' Doyle said. ```So don't ever pay attention to 
anybody that can't beat you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always have kept that to heart.''

<HEADLINE> Cool Front Breaks Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's finally cooled off across the East, but the  
debate is heating up in New York after 200,000 people endured a 
19-hour blackout during a deadly heat wave that smothered the 
region for three days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem to me that over the years they would develop  
more of a fail-safe system,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday 
of Consolidated Edison, which cut power throughout upper Manhattan 
one night earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered outages continued to plague thousands of people  
Wednesday in mid-Atlantic states and the Northeast. But 
temperatures finally sank below the baking, humid level that 
contributed to at least 23 deaths since last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After the blackout, fear and chaos, parts of Manhattan's  
Washington Heights neighborhood burst into celebration. The 
blackout affected Manhattan above 155th Street. 
</P>
<P>
	But Giuliani voiced the frustrations of residents and merchants  
who slept outside to escape overheated apartments and guard their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 police officers were deployed in a move designed to  
prevent the widespread looting that happened during a 25-hour 
blackout in 1977. There were nine arrests and only a few stores 
were robbed, though some witnesses described groups of youths 
prowling the neighborhood armed with baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed didn't have the capability to divert power from any other  
section of the city, and the situation was made worse by 
heat-damaged cables, spokeswoman Toni Yuille said. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility offered partial reimbursement for lost perishables,  
but Giuliani has threatened to sue Con Ed for losses to residents 
and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lose all the meat,'' said Reso Infante, manager  
of La Mundial specialty meat market in upper Manhattan. The stench 
of spoiled meat wafted from the open freezer door up the rickety 
wooden stairs to the sidewalk. Infante estimated the loss at 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Colon threw out about $70 worth of groceries from his  
refrigerator and sent his mother and grandmother to stay with an 
aunt across town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a tight budget as it is, and we didn't need this,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat wave started Sunday, bringing temperatures over 100  
degrees and intense humidity to many areas across the Midwest and 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also suffered big losses.  
</P>
<P>
	Allen Family Foods Inc. in Delaware lost 33,000 chickens from  
Saturday through Monday, said Tom David, director of live 
operations. The company has more than 20 million birds in the field 
at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland-based Perdue Farms Inc., which bills itself as the  
nation's third-largest poultry producer, said it had not tallied 
its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the area's growers produced more than 600 million birds  
last year and it would take a loss of millions of birds to affect 
the price of poultry, said Bill Satterfield of Delmarva Poultry 
Industry Inc. in Georgetown, Del.

<HEADLINE> Baker Hughes Accused of Trade Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A Mexican firm is suing Baker Hughes for $400  
million, accusing the Houston-based energy supply company of 
stealing trade secrets after backing out of an acquisition 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambar Mexicana, an oil drilling service based in Ciudad del  
Carmen, Mexico, claims Baker Hughes was trying to buy Ambar so it 
could enter the Mexican market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambar's suit, filed in federal court in Houston, says Baker  
Hughes backed out of the deal and purchased a Mexican competitor of 
Ambar, then used Ambar's trade secrets to unfairly compete against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't comment on pending litigation,'' said Gary Flaharty,  
Baker Hughes' director of investor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed by attorney Herbert Lackshin of Houston, seeks  
$100 million in compensatory damages and $300 million in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, during acquisition talks, Baker Hughes ``continued to  
reassure Ambar of its intent to acquire Ambar's business'' and 
instructed Ambar not to bid new contracts in Ambar's name so the 
contracts could be bid and awarded jointly to Baker Hughes and 
Ambar, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Unknown to Ambar at the time, Baker Hughes had purchased one of  
Ambar's competitors, Zapata International. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ambar has reason to believe that (Baker Hughes), through  
Zapata, is using Ambar's prices, business plan, marketing 
information, customer information, and all of Ambar's proprietary 
business information and trade secrets to unfairly compete with 
Ambar,'' the suit said.

<HEADLINE> Cycling Union: Drug Report Is Untrue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The International Cycling Union denied today a  
published report that a Tour de France cyclist tested positive for 
a banned drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The French sports daily L'Equipe reported that one of four  
riders tested were found to have taken corticosteroids after 
Saturday's prologue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was not one positive case,'' UCI spokesman Enrico  
Carpani told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs which  
are not classed as steroids, are banned unless prescribed by 
doctors for specific medical conditions such as asthma and 
rhinitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Four cyclists were tested after Saturday's prologue, including  
Lance Armstrong as winner of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark's Bo Hamburger, Spain's Manuel Beltran and Colombia's  
Joaquim Castelblanco were the others tested, L'Equipe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official who carried out the test, Jacques de Ceaurriz,  
director of France's national laboratory for testing and drugs, 
refused to confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EEOC: Toyota Unit Exclusionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- By filling positions mainly through union  
and personal referrals, a unit of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. at 
Port Newark illegally excluded blacks and women from its work 
force, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These policies and practices have resulted in an applicant  
pool which does not reflect labor market availability for females 
and blacks,'' the EEOC said in a federal civil rights lawsuit 
against Toyota Logistics Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The practices violate Title VII, the agency said, asserting the  
law bars hiring discrimination including how an employer announces 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the EEOC said the practices, while  
``superficially neutral,'' made it hard for blacks and women to 
learn of openings for drivers and auto accessories installers. 
</P>
<P>
	``White males as a group were the ones able to get knowledge of  
the company's jobs from the union or present employees who are 
generally white males themselves,'' the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	When women did learn of openings, Toyota Logistics did not hire  
them, the EEOC lawsuit claimed, citing the case of Sandra Burrows, 
a qualified black woman who put in an application in August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being told she would be called when Toyota Logistics was  
hiring, she was never called, although the company continued to 
hire men into those positions, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrows, 39, learned of the openings -- which carry union wages  
and benefits -- from her husband, who works for another employer at 
Port Newark, said a person familiar with the case who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota spokeswoman Diana DeJoseph said the company had no  
comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port Newark operation employs about 175 workers and 12  
managers, who handle about 130,000 vehicles arriving from Japan and 
U.S. plants before sending them to dealers in the Northeast and New 
England, DeJoseph said from the company's U.S. headquarters in 
Torrance, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC is seeking monetary damages of up to $300,000 for every  
victim. It has no estimate yet on how many people it believes were 
discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
	It also seeks a judge's order barring Toyota Logistics from  
engaging in biased hiring practices.

<HEADLINE> Filings Detail Execs' Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford, head of BankBoston,  
will receive a stock compensation plan worth millions of dollars 
following the company's proposed acquisition by Fleet Financial 
Group, Inc., according to documents filed Thursday with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford, who will serve as president of the combined bank, will  
receive 300,000 shares of restricted stock following culmination of 
the deal, and he'll have options to purchase 300,000 more, 
according to the documents filed by Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have proposed a maximum offering price per share  
of $43.35, meaning each bloc of shares would be worth about $13 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive compensation specialists said that's in line with the  
going rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is within the perspective of executive compensation. It's  
not particularly startling, although all executive compensation is 
startling,'' said Judith Fischer, managing director of Executive 
Compensation Advisory Services of Springfield, Va., a firm that 
helps companies come up with executive payment plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined bank, to be named Fleet Boston, would initially be  
headed by Murray. After two years, Murray, 59, would step down as 
chief executive but stay on as chairman, succeeded as CEO by 
Gifford, 56. The following year, Gifford would also take over as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents, which will be distributed to shareholders of both  
companies, said Gifford, will receive a base salary of at least 
equal to that of Fleet CEO Terrence Murray, and a bonus of not less 
than 90 percent of Murray's. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Murray had a base salary of $992,200, and he received  
a $3.4 million bonus. He also has a multimillion dollar long-term 
stock compensation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford earned $869,231 in base salary last year, and a $1.9  
million bonus. And BankBoston's board of directors raised his 
salary to $900,000 for 1999, said company spokeswoman Marjorie 
Arons-Barron. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also guaranteed a retirement package of at least $1.25  
million a year, according to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders for both companies will meet Aug. 11 to discuss the  
proposed $16 billion merger. If they approve it, the resulting 
company would be the nation's eighth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must also be approved by regulators.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Tours With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- It was supposed to be President  
Clinton's moment. After all, he was the first U.S. president to 
visit an American Indian reservation in more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But some in the audience began chanting for Jesse Jackson, who  
hadn't uttered a word and was struggling to stay in Clinton's 
shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speak, Jesse, Speak!'' a few people called. ``Run, Jesse,  
Run!'' others said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is how it's been since Clinton began his national poverty  
tour in Appalachia three days ago with Jackson at his side. Even 
Clinton gave a nod to Jackson for helping shape his message of 
economic empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank my good friend Jesse Jackson for never letting  
us forget our common obligations,'' Clinton said Wednesday. Jackson 
did not address the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, their pairing made for interesting political theater.  
Clinton and Jackson may not have literally been competing with each 
other, but their reputations as men of the people certainly were. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not more popular than he is,'' Jackson said as he awaited  
Clinton on the tarmac at South Dakota's Ellsworth Air Force Base. 
``Both of us are well known, but he is the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday evening in Arizona, Clinton settled at the head of a  
U-shaped table inside a tortilla factory in Phoenix. There was no 
place at the table for Jackson. He sat with four others on a row of 
chairs perpendicular to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Jackson who invited Clinton to address his Wall Street  
Project, which proposed among other things the notion of treating 
inner cities like foreign markets when it comes to trade and 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, Jackson has worked with Clinton's advisers on  
folding his program into Clinton's economic agenda -- and Jackson's 
feelings were a bit hurt in May when Clinton hauled a group of 
corporate executives to Atlanta without inviting him. At the time, 
Jackson was still on the outs with White House officials because of 
his trip to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Clinton's economic advisers, speaking Wednesday on  
condition of anonymity, said Jackson ``never tried to micromanage'' 
what the president did with his ideas. ``Any good idea has many 
fathers, but he's certainly been an inspiration for many of our 
efforts,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night in Memphis, Clinton and Jackson went to the civil  
rights museum in the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. 
was assassinated in 1968. After their tour, Jackson grabbed a cell 
phone and called the widow of Ricky Byrdsong, the former 
Northwestern University basketball coach shot to death last week by 
a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jackson finished the conversation, he handed the phone to  
Clinton so he could chat with the slain man's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson worked the masses alongside Clinton at Ellsworth. On the  
far edge of the crowd, a woman held up a sign that read, ``Jesse 
Rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wanted to thank Jackson for bringing the three American  
soldiers back from Yugoslavia unharmed. Jackson kissed her, 
autographed the sign and posed for a picture with her and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and Clinton also were side by side with Oglala Lakota  
Sioux on a courtyard at the reservation's high school. As Clinton 
finished shaking hands, Jackson was tossing a giggling Aaron Black 
Bull, 2, into the air. He carried Aaron over to Clinton, who kissed 
the boy on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men turned to leave -- until a woman called, ``Jesse, we  
want to shake your hand.'' Jackson went back to the crowd and so 
did Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A blue baseball cap labeled ``Water is Life'' -- which Clinton  
took off and replaced with a black one that read ``Native 
American'' -- somehow found its way onto Jackson's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson attributed the attention he has gotten to the fact that  
he has been out there for at least a year advocating the economic 
investment that Clinton now is touting. Plus, he said, people 
remember when he drummed up votes for Clinton in places like Pine 
Ridge in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a team,'' Jackson said. He likened himself and Clinton  
to Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, who guided the Chicago Bulls 
to six NBA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a chemistry, an undeniable chemistry, with the  
people,'' Jackson said of Clinton. ``He's touching a live nerve 
when he's touching the needs of working poor people and the middle 
class at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton left Pine Ridge in his usual limousine. Jackson climbed  
into a van a few vehicles back in the motorcade. The van was called 
``Special 1.''

<HEADLINE> Kevin Garnett Is Already Old Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The only person who seems to get what he wants more often than  
Howard Stern is David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	And so when the NBA commissioner said recently he might seek a  
minimum-age rule for rookies in upcoming negotiations -- to go along 
with the minimum-wage scale he got in the last round -- you could 
almost hear the ``thud'' as thousands of jaws dropped onto desktops 
at grade schools all over America. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a slight exaggeration -- or else just a matter of time. No  
matter how low the bar is set, some kid or other will limbo 
underneath. Remember: In the NBA world of nouveau-nouveau riche, 
Kevin Garnett is already old money. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Mississippi high school star named Jonathan Bender  
was drafted fifth overall, ahead of established college stars like 
Wally Szczerbiak, Richard Hamilton and Trajan Langdon. And another 
Bender -- 6-foot-9 1/2 Kentucky schoolboy star Brandon; no relation -- 
announced he might skip his senior year of high school to enter the 
2000 draft, prompting Sports Illustrated to feature him as ``This 
Week's Sign That the Apocalypse Is Upon Us.'' It's no wonder Stern 
is jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players union boss Billy Hunter, meanwhile, insists his side  
won't be rushed into any kind of deal. He keeps pointing out how 
un-American the whole thing sounds, forgetting how the players 
swallowed their objections and agreed to the first-ever wage scale 
in pro sports less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hunter was smart enough to begin preparing a response. At  
the union's annual meeting, he named six players to a committee and 
told them to put some recommendations together -- fast. 
</P>
<P>
	The time frame for negotiations isn't set yet, but Hunter hardly  
needed reminding how persuasive Stern can be when he wants 
something. Only Tuesday, the union handed out fact sheets reminding 
its players that marijuana testing -- a bandwagon Stern started 
rolling several years ago -- would be in place at training camps 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment, the players are talking tough.  
</P>
<P>
	``No way will we ever commit to an age limit,'' Brent Barry of  
the Chicago Bulls, a member of the union committee, said over the 
telephone from the Bahamas. ``We're just not going to limit anyone 
in that regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as he spoke, lines were being drawn in the sand.  
</P>
<P>
	In remarks during the NBA Finals, Stern mentioned ``20,  
perhaps'' as his choice for a minimum age and hinted the way to 
keep kids from leaving school earlier is to tie them to the NBA 
teams that draft them for longer periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current labor deal, rookies drafted in the first round  
sign guaranteed three-year deals, with the clubs having an option 
for a fourth year. That was supposed to slow the flood of younger 
players opting for the draft. It had just the opposite effect; more 
kids decided to join the league out of high school or after a year 
or two in college, figuring they'd get the low-paying, 
bench-sitting years out of the way, then be eligible for 
free-agency just about the time they're approaching stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's bottom-line stance is that it cares less about what  
age is established as the minimum, so long as there is an effective 
minimum in place. The league higher-ups are convinced the best way 
to ensure a steady flow of talent each year is to bring in players 
of comparable ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side is talking yet about the added benefits of better  
behavior, but that's what is on everybody's minds. 
</P>
<P>
	After some trying times, several of the Generation-X stars that  
Charles Barkley used to call ``knuckleheads'' are maturing -- if not 
into model citizens, at least into serviceable ones. What both 
sides would like to do now is find a way for that to happen without 
arrests, coach insurrections and other assorted embarrassments 
becoming part of the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The best idea so far is one the players have been kicking  
around. Barry said details haven't been worked out yet, but it 
involves cutting the length of time a rookie is tied to his club 
for each year of school he completes. Or else, paying more to 
draftees who stay in school longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got something for everybody. The kids go to school more,  
get more when they get out and the universities, the NCAA and the 
NBA get seen in a better light,'' Barry said. The teams get more 
mature guys, and the guys who play with them get teammates coming 
in with better fundamentals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he approached NCAA officials about becoming part of any  
deal, Stern described their response this way: ``We understand that 
they formed a committee that assigned it to a subcommittee that 
referred it to a task force. We have not heard back yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However it gets done, count on an effective minimum-age rule to  
be in place by the next draft. Whatever else you can say about 
Stern, he is not the kind of guy who likes to be kept waiting. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imposes Tariffs on Lamb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American consumers will face higher prices for  
lamb chops at the grocery store, but U.S. lamb producers say they 
are happy that President Clinton responded to their pleas for 
import protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration announced Wednesday that it was imposing  
higher tariffs ranging from 9 percent to 40 percent on imported 
lamb in an effort to protect American producers from a flood of 
imports from Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	But Australian officials said they would immediately seek to  
bring a case against the United States before the World Trade 
Organization for violating global trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no justice in the decision,'' said Australian Prime  
Minister John Howard, who is scheduled to visit the United States 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House announced Clinton's action Wednesday in South  
Dakota, where the president had visited an Indian reservation as 
part of a tour promoting his proposals to provide economic 
assistance to distressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's decision, which goes into effect July 22, will impose  
a border tax of 9 percent on the first 31,851 metric tons -- about 
70 million pounds -- of foreign lamb, the amount imported into the 
United States last year. Lamb imports above that level will carry a 
40 percent tariff, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The package of import relief and domestic assistance has been  
carefully crafted to help our lamb industry achieve sustained 
competitiveness while respecting our international trade 
obligations,'' the White House statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. lamb industry is one of a number of farm and  
manufacturing groups that have been hit hard by the global currency 
crisis, which has cut sharply into export sales and led to a flood 
of cheaper imports into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has struggled to balance its support  
for free trade with growing calls in Congress for protectionist 
barriers as the U.S. trade deficit has risen to record levels 
because of the Asian currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the administration's effort has been to push Japan and  
Europe to do more to boost their own growth and provide markets for 
crisis countries. 
</P>
<P>
	New Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers criticized efforts by  
the Japanese government to keep the Japanese currency weak as a way 
to boost exports to the United States and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the focus in Japan has to be on strengthening the  
fundamentals, which goes back to domestic demand-led growth ... not 
seeking to manipulate currencies,'' Summers said in an interview on 
CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said  
Clinton's decision to impose higher tariffs on imported lamb would 
provide badly needed help for U.S. producers, who have seen lamb 
prices fall by as much as 40 percent since 1995 while imports have 
climbed by more than 50 percent. Imported lamb has captured about a 
third of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for lamb producers said the administration's offer of  
$100 million in a package of direct payments to producers and 
market promotion incentives over the next three years would help 
the domestic industry become competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased,'' said Cathy Cummins, an official  
with the American Sheep Industry Association, headquartered in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always want more and want it sooner, but this is a  
critical decision that could make the difference for family 
ranchers and small communities throughout the West,'' said Sen. 
Craig Thomas, R-Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acted after the U.S. International Trade Commission  
ruled earlier this year that U.S. sheep producers were being harmed 
by the import surge in a case brought by the domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In another trade case, the administration reached an agreement  
Wednesday in which Brazil avoided punitive tariffs by agreeing to 
voluntarily reduce its steel shipments to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs on imported lamb will drop to 6 percent in the  
second year and 3 percent in the third and final year. And the 
31,851 metric ton limit will rise by 857 metric tons, or about 1.9 
million pounds, in the second year, plus that amount again in the 
third year, the administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb imports above those levels will face a 40 percent tariff  
the first year, a 32 percent tariff the second year and a 24 
percent tariff the third year. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading sheep-producing states in order of production are  
Texas, California, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Utah, Montana, 
Idaho and Iowa, according to the Agriculture Department. It said 
there are 74,700 sheep producers in the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Hope to South L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton took his campaign to  
promote investment in economically distressed areas to a Los 
Angeles neighborhood still recovering from deadly race riots today 
to highlight the need to invest directly in the people who live in 
impoverished communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The president visited the community of Watts, scarred by riots  
nearly 30 years apart, to make the case today for private firms to 
help disadvantaged young people gain the skills they need for 
high-tech jobs in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can put in place the financial nets. We can create a lot of  
jobs,'' Clinton said. ``But if our young peole don't have the 
opportunity to learn, and continue to learn and continue to train 
for a long time, we'll never be able to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those accompanying Clinton was Magic Johnson, the former  
Los Angeles Lakers star who has revitalized South Central L.A. and 
other inner cities with multiplex movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton toured the transportation technology program at Alain  
Leroy Locke High School, named for the first black Rhodes scholar. 
He watched as Michael Delery, 17, and Jermaine Smith, 18, used 
computers to show how aerodynamics affects the performance of a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Delery positioned two plastic cars in front of a jet stream  
simulator and watched the better-designed car scoot ahead of the 
other. ``This one does better than this one,'' Clinton said as he 
held out the slower, yellow car. ``Even I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Ramirez, 18, a June graduate, said he wants his year and  
a half in the tech program to lead to a career in transportation 
technology -- after a stint in the Army. ``This program really gave 
me an opportunity to expand my horizons. Before, I had no idea hat 
I wanted to do, what I wanted to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, 1,800 students have participated in the academy, and  
90 percent who graduate go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton was going to nearby Anaheim for the annual  
conference of the National Academy Foundation -- where chief 
executives were huddling to discuss ways to connect employers with 
disadvantaged youth, especially those ages 16 to 24. The White 
House estimated that 10 million people in that age group are out of 
school, and 4 million of them lack a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to pay attention to and care about the development  
of the work force,'' said deputy White House chief of staff Maria 
Echaveste. ``They can't be competitive, they can't stay profitable, 
if they don't have a work force that is skilled and that is 
trained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the conference, Clinton was to announce an $8 million  
initiative to help create ``information academies'' within 
inner-city and rural schools. The initiative is a partnership 
between the Department of Labor and companies such as AT&AMP;T, Lucent 
Technologies and Cisco Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement closes out Clinton's tour, but he will remain  
in Los Angeles through Saturday to watch the U.S. women's soccer 
team compete for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's visit to Los Angeles' south side takes Clinton back to  
an area he first canvassed as a presidential candidate in May 1992, 
just days after riots in the wake of police acquittals in the 
beating of motorist Rodney King left 55 people dead and 720 
buildings destroyed or damaged by fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the complaint then -- as it was in 1965, when 34 people  
died in Watts rioting -- was the need for better access to jobs and 
social investment to eliminate the economic isolation of the inner 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will see a changed South L.A. After the 1992  
riots, banks and federal redevelopment programs have made millions 
of dollars in loans and grants to local businesses, and many 
damaged areas have been rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	And while residents welcome the government's help, there is a  
thriving spirit of free-enterprise and self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza mall, boosted by a Magic  
Johnson movie theater and its proximity to affluent black 
neighborhoods, is booming with an occupancy rate of more than 90 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, retailers have opened new stores. Three banks,  
Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo and Hawthorne Savings, partnered 
with Operation Hope to open banking centers where residents can 
apply for loans and take classes on managing their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The president flew to Los Angeles from Phoenix, where he toured  
the facilities of La Canasta, a successful food producer, to 
highlight the needs of the Latino community on that city's south 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	He strolled through the plant with owner Carmen Abril Lopez and  
watched as thousands of tortillas coursed past him on conveyor 
belts. While workers in white shirts and baseball caps removed the 
flawed ones, Clinton took a tortilla in his hands and inspected it, 
marveling at the fact that the plant produces and sells 840,000 
tortillas each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country has been really blessed by these good economic  
times,'' Clinton said. ``But we know, as blessed as America has 
been, not every American has been blessed by this recovery. All you 
have to do is drive down the streets of South Phoenix to see 
that.''

<HEADLINE> UConn and Duke May Play Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Connecticut and Duke, who played for the  
national championship in March, could face each other again next 
season in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools, along with Stanford and Iowa, will participate in  
the tournament at Madison Square Garden. The matchups, announced 
Thursday, have Duke playing Stanford and Connecticut facing Iowa on 
Nov. 11, with the championship and consolation games of the 
tournament the following evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies beat the Blue Devils 77-74 in the championship game  
of the NCAA tournament in St. Petersburg, Fla., on March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about participating in what has become one of  
the premier college basketball tournaments in the country,'' Duke 
coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``This event increases the exposure for 
Coaches vs. Cancer. Not only does it raise money, but it also gives 
us, as coaches, a platform to help find a cure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches vs. Cancer, a partnership between the American Cancer  
Society and the National Association of Basketball Coaches, was 
started in 1993 by then-Missouri coach Norm Stewart after he won 
his fight against cancer. It helps raise money to fund cancer 
research, patient services, advocacy and prevention education.

<HEADLINE> Des Moines Awestruck by Stars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Arnold Palmer walked to the tee  
box, not yet announced. He was warmly cheered anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators laughed when Chi Chi Rodriguez performed his wacky  
swashbuckler routine after his first drive. Hale Irwin popped an 
approach shot at the pin on the ninth hole, prompting a roar from a 
packed gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans who have overrun the Des Moines Golf and Country Club  
all week went full-blown wild on Thursday. Their love affair with 
the big names of the Senior PGA Tour intensified during the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes down to two things,'' said Bernie Pizinger, 51, a  
postmaster in Des Moines. ``First, there are a lot of golfers in 
Des Moines and in Iowa. Second, we're kind of in the sticks and we 
get very excited about an event like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most beloved was the 69-year-old Palmer. He drew a gallery  
of hundreds, a giddy swarm of humanity that at times looked like a 
giant pack of puppies running home for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is Arnie up there?'' a woman asked before Palmer teed off,  
standing on her toes and craning to see through the eight- to 
10-deep gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	All the good vibes couldn't help Palmer. He shot a 9-over 81,  
his highest round in the Senior Open since a third-round 82 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowds were great,'' the dejected Palmer said. ``You can't  
say anything bad about that. They gave me all the inspiration I 
needed to play a little better, but I didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer hit third in his group, after Dewitt Weaver and Joel  
Hirsch. When his introduction finally came, it was followed by a 
15-second standing ovation as he smiled and waved. 
</P>
<P>
	With Palmer hitting, spectators packed the grandstand and lined  
the first fairway virtually to the green. Others seated in adjacent 
grandstands, at the ninth and 18th holes, turned to watch his 
drive. Bodies filled a hillside and faces poked over the clubhouse 
veranda. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the only reason I'm out here,'' Pizinger said. ``Arnold  
Palmer is the greatest living golfer, either him or Jack 
Nicklaus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, there is no Nicklaus. He passed up the Senior Open as  
he continues to recover from hip replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus or not, it didn't deter the 35,000 spectators who came  
out Thursday after practice rounds had attracted crowds of 25,000, 
27,000 and 29,000 earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The galleries are superb,'' said Irwin, the defending champion  
who created a frenzy when his approach to the ninth green plopped 
about three feet from the pin with barely a roll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the locker room is amazed,'' Irwin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, it was hard to tell who was having more fun -- the  
players or the fans. Rodriguez hit his first drive and swung the 
club like a sword, the routine he has made famous over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans responded with another standing ovation for Rodriguez.  
They got excited when Bruce Fleisher walked across the first 
fairway to the putting green. A woman screamed his name, and others 
turned to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, there were favorites.  
</P>
<P>
	After Palmer teed off, the next group included Rodriguez, Dave  
Stockton and Gil Morgan, all welcomed by a packed gallery. Thirty 
minutes later, barely a dozen fans sat in the grandstand for John 
Mahaffey, Tommy Horton and Joe Inman. 
</P>
<P>
	Susie Kimelman, 49, a Des Moines retailer, insisted she came out  
to see all the golfers but it was Palmer that had her attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in a golfing family, so I guess he has a familiar  
name,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mets Farm Out Dotel, Recall Kinkade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets sent right-hander Octavio  
Dotel to Triple-A Norfolk and recalled infielder Mike Kinkade on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dotel, who was 1-1 with a 6.61 ERA in three starts with the  
Mets, is expected to have a short-lived stay in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Octavio is not being optioned to Norfolk as a result of his  
performance on the major league level,'' Mets general manager Steve 
Phillips said. ``With the All-Star break next week, we felt that he 
should make another start instead of having an extended period of 
rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dotel is scheduled to pitch against Richmond on Monday for  
Norfolk, where he was 5-2 with a 3.99 ERA in 12 starts. He will 
start for the Mets at Baltimore July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkade started the season with the Mets and was hitting .196  
with two homers and six RBIs before his demotion to Norfolk May 22.

<HEADLINE> Senior Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Loran Schiltz and his staff of  
volunteers in the merchandise tent are busy, busy, busy. 
</P>
<P>
	With wave after wave of spectators spilling into the Des Moines  
Golf and Country Club all week, the workers who sell caps, polo 
shirts, coffee mugs and other souvenirs can barely keep the shelves 
stocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's moving very, very fast,'' said Schiltz, a tournament  
volunteer who shares the responsibility of running the tent. ``Some 
of the inventory, we can be saved every morning by UPS. Some we 
can't reorder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As hundreds of people milled through the massive tent Thursday,  
workers carried box after box of merchandise onto the floor and 
moved it to the shelves. Schiltz said volunteers from other 
tournament areas, such as ticketing, were brought over to help meet 
the demand. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to disclose sales but characterized them as  
``booming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not much comes cheap. There are several baseball hats but all  
cost $26. Golf shirts sell for $65 or $70, a fanny pack is $10, an 
umbrella is $32 while a souvenir ball marker and greens-repair tool 
goes for $20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nice products, a little pricey,'' said one shopper, Tim Davlin  
of Omaha, Neb. ``I'll probably walk around the hats three times, 
complaining the whole time about the prices. Then I'll buy one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davlin has plenty of other T-shirts from vacations and sports  
events, all gathering dust in the closet at home. He still wanted 
something else for the collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' he said. ``Some of  
these golfers you saw on TV as a kid. We might not ever get another 
event like this in our area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise tent also afforded a relatively easy ticket to  
the tournament for Richard and Cheryl Hood of Runnells, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Each paid $105 to volunteer. In return, they got a tournament  
parking pass and the option of working four-hour shifts at the cash 
registers or being assigned to the security detail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to watch a parking lot all day,'' Richard Hood  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Cheryl Hood: ``We've really enjoyed it. We're in the  
hustle and bustle, where the action is.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FUNNY PUTTER:* Bruce Summerhays found himself in the longer  
grass off the fringe when his approach on the par-4 13th stayed up 
in the wind and stopped below the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, from 40 feet, he used a 4-wood to make a birdie putt.  
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do, you putt the ball,'' he said. ``The wood  
just takes it right out of there and rolls it up to the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summerhays said he'll use his pitching wedge if the grass is  
standing up and the ball is higher. If the ball is more than three 
feet off the fringe, the 4-wood is not advised. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an easy way to hit those little shots when it's down in  
the grass right near the green,'' Summerhays said. ``You can't use 
it too far off because it's got to roll through stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SAD STORIES:* Tickets to the Senior Open are a hot commodity in  
Des Moines. As a result, ticket manager Cory Konrad has heard some 
pretty silly stories from fans who pretended to be panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman claimed her house was burglarized. The only missing  
items were two tickets for Wednesday's practice round. Another tale 
came from a man and woman who went out to dinner but left their 
tickets on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why people would take their Senior Open tickets  
to dinner,'' Konrad said. ``But a dog hasn't eaten a ticket yet and 
a kid hasn't flushed them down the toilet.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MEDICAL ALERT:* Bug bites, headaches, blisters, nausea and  
people who complained about the heat are the most common 
discomforts treated by volunteers in the medical tent. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature dropped Thursday into the low 80s after reaching  
the 90s earlier in the week, and a north wind to 10 mph offered 
some mild relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rick Bratkiewicz said one man was treated for a stroke but  
it was unrelated to the weather. Otherwise, he said all the medical 
complaints during the tournament's first round were minor. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon, 44 people had been treated at one site, 22 at  
another and 24 at a third. Not bad, considering attendance was 
35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics from West Des Moines staffed the medical facilities,  
although several volunteer doctors and nurses were available.

<HEADLINE> Some Nuke Plants Still Need Y2K Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says reports  
from all 103 commercial U.S. nuclear power plants indicate that 
there are no Y2K-related problems directly affecting the 
performance of safety systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., questioned the findings, saying the  
agency should be ready to shut down any plant later this year that 
isn't fully prepared for a possible Year 2000 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not risk a nuclear accident in order to keep these  
plants running,'' said Markey, a persistent NRC critic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem, or millennium bug, may occur in computers and  
microchips programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a 
year; they may malfunction if they misread the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC said Wednesday that 68 plants have indicated that all  
their computer systems that support safe plant operation are ``Y2K 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other 35 plants reported that they have additional work to  
complete on a few non-safety computer systems or devices to be 
fully ready and provided schedules for completing the work, the NRC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 35, about a third have work remaining on systems needed  
for power generation, the NRC said. Other plants need to complete 
work related to plant monitoring and administrative systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the remaining work affects the ability of a plant to  
shut down safely, if needed,'' said a statement released by the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey said almost any plant system that affects the ability of  
operators to monitor and control nuclear plants could affect 
safety, even if it's not directly safety related. 
</P>
<P>
	He said plants could ``be dark on New Year's'' if schedules slip  
or if further testing reveals new problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, claims of Y2K readiness by plants may only indicate that  
utilities know how to keep the plants running, such as by setting 
clocks back, and not necessarily that all computer programs will 
work properly, Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the lawmaker questioned Y2K preparedness at nuclear  
plants after the NRC revealed that both emergency generators at New 
Hampshire's Seabrook plant were technically considered inoperable 
at the same time for about a week, sometime between June 1997 and 
March 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the generators was out for routine maintenance and  
testing. The other was functioning properly but considered 
inoperable because its automatic switches malfunctioned. Operators 
could have hooked up the generator manually, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another NRC report on Y2K readiness, based on on-site visits to  
all nuclear plants over the past three months, is due by the end of 
the month.

<HEADLINE> NASA Unveils Plans for Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA insists it's a coincidence.  
</P>
<P>
	Six years from now, a spacecraft named Deep Impact will fire a  
1,100-pound copper bullet at the nucleus of a comet, with the aim 
of blasting out a crater the size of a football field and as deep 
as a seven-story building. 
</P>
<P>
	The $240 million mission approved Wednesday by NASA  
administrators may sound more like fiction than science, but its 
primary purpose will be to study the makeup of comets. 
</P>
<P>
	It just happens to have the same name as last summer's disaster  
movie ``Deep Impact,'' which was about a comet smacking Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name was selected prior to the movie,'' said James Graf,  
Deep Impact's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena, Calif. ``It wasn't inspired by it. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Impact is scheduled to be launched in January 2004 and will  
arrive at comet Tempel 1 on July 4, 2005. The projectile will 
separate from the spacecraft and hit the comet at 22,300 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after impact, the craft will come within 300 miles of  
the comet surface and send back data and pictures of the debris and 
crater. It will eventually zoom off into space. 
</P>
<P>
	Comets are believed to be remnants from the early days of the  
solar system, and several missions are planned to observe them 
close-up. Deep Impact's projectile, however, will be the first to 
crash into one. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Impact will allow scientists to study the inside of a comet  
by observing the debris ejected from the crater. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can give us an understanding of what the solar system  
looked like during its formation, and what contributions comets may 
have made to our life here on Earth,'' Graf said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact should be visible from Earth -- 83 million miles away  
-- with the aid of a telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission poses no threat to Earth, Graf said. The impact  
crater will be small compared with the overall size of the comet's 
nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's approval of Deep Impact was made less than two weeks  
after the space agency pulled the plug on another mission to the 
same comet. Space Technology 4/Champollion would have landed on 
Tempel 1 and drilled beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA administrators decided to favor Deep Impact because it was  
focused solely on science and fit into existing budget plans, said 
Doug Isbell, a NASA spokesman in Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Northwestern Coach Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Three days before he was gunned down in  
front of two of his children, former Northwestern University 
basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong talked with his minister about 
violence in society. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'I would hate to live in a neighborhood where you'd  
have to worry about being killed,''' Pastor Lyle Q. Foster told 
more than 1,600 mourners who gathered Wednesday to remember 
Byrdsong. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, who was 43, was shot last Friday near his home in  
suburban Skokie. Authorities said he was killed by white 
supremacist Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, whose two-state shooting 
rampage left another man dead and nine wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners -- family, friends, neighbors and others whose lives  
were touched by Byrdsong -- squeezed into the First Presbyterian 
Church sanctuary or sat outside and listened to the service on 
loudspeakers as Byrdsong was remembered as a devoted family man who 
inspired others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our coach, he's gone,'' said Pastor Hamon Cross of Rosedale  
Park Baptist Church in Detroit. ``But the game is not over. Evil 
will not win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Byrdsong's tragic death should inspire others to fight  
hatred and racial intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said they were drawn to the service by outrage over the  
circumstances of Byrdsong's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Evanston resident Kathleen Murphy stood outside the church with  
a sign that read, ``Stop the Violence Please'' in English, Japanese 
and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put a message on the World Wide Web asking for translations  
and within hours I got response from Russia, Israel, California and 
Australia,'' Murphy said. ``This tragedy meant something to people 
all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mourners were several Orthodox Jews, who traveled to  
Evanston by bus. Authorities said Smith began his attacks by 
wounding six Orthodox Jews in the Chicago community of Rogers Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it was important to come,'' said Harlan Loeb, a civil  
rights lawyer with the Anti-Defamation League. ``I'm here, in part, 
become some of the people shot at were my friends. But we all are 
here because we have deep sympathies for Ricky's wife and 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners who came from across the country testified to the fact  
that the former coach's reach far exceeded the boundaries of the 
basketball court, said Pastor Tom Nesbitt from Life Action Ministry 
in Buchanan, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forget the court. Forget the playing field. Ricky, you were an  
impact player in life,'' Nesbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former basketball players, coaches and athletic  
directors -- including Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany, University 
of Arizona basketball coach Lute Olsen and NBA players Steve Kerr 
and B.J. Armstrong -- were in attendance. Kerr and Armstrong also 
were pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Webber, the former Northwestern University president who  
hired Byrdsong, recalled Byrdsong enthusiastically discussing his 
plan to work with youths in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of coaches would say that, but Ricky meant it,'' Webber  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Foster pledged to complete one of Byrdsong's unfinished  
projects, a book titled ``Coaching Your Kids in the Game of Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isaiah McKinnon, a professor at the University of Detroit who  
served on the committee that hired Byrdsong to coach at that school 
in 1988, recalls informing Byrdsong of his father's death after the 
job interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had such dignity and composure at such a terrible time,''  
he said. ``I knew we did the right thing in hiring him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong went from Detroit to Northwestern, where he took the  
Wildcats to only their second postseason basketball appearance in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled an 87-165 overall record as a head coach, including  
34-78 in four seasons at Northwestern. He was fired with seven 
games left in the 1996-97 season, effective at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, who was working for an insurance company, is survived  
by his wife, Sherialyn, and three children. His body will be 
transported to his hometown of Atlanta for services and burial, 
scheduled for Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Shareholders of Gucci Group NV on  
Thursday overwhelmingly approved the Italian fashion house's 
alliance with the French retail group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute SA. 
</P>
<P>
	At Gucci's annual meeting, shareholders gave the alliance their  
blessing by approving the nomination of four new PPR-affiliated 
members to Gucci's board and expanding the board to nine from eight 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	PPR acquired a 42 percent stake in Gucci in March.  
</P>
<P>
	``We see overwhelming support shown by our independent  
shareholders for our strategic alliance'' with PPR, said Gucci 
chief executive Domenico De Sole after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The four new members sponsored by PPR are led by Francois  
Pinault, who controls PPR, and Serge Weinberg, the French 
retailer's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg said he expects ``we're going to move forward'' with  
Gucci and PPR's agreed strategy to turn Gucci into a multi-brand 
luxury goods and fashion group through an aggressive acquisition 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA -- which  
currently owns nearly 20 percent of Gucci's outstanding equity -- 
lambasted the approval of the alliance with PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	James Lieber, an LVMH vice president, called the vote ``a  
transfer of control to PPR, which is not in the interest of 
shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will proceed with our legal actions, which have a real  
chance of success,'' Lieber said, reiterating that LVMH intended to 
keep a stake in Gucci for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
	The first step in the process of turning Gucci from a one-brand  
company into a multi-brand group is expected to be the acquisition 
of Sanofi Beaute, which owns rights to the prestigious Yves Saint 
Laurent brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Pinault's Artemis investment arm acquired Sanofi Beaute  
from drug company Sanofi SA in March. Sanofi has since merged with 
Synthelabo SA to form Sanofi-Synthelabo SA. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, PPR invested $2.9 billion in Gucci in exchange  
for its 42 percent stake. Pinault's plan from the start was for 
Artemis to eventually sell Sanofi Beaute to Gucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci chairman Andrian Bellamy told the shareholders' meeting  
that Gucci was under no obligation to purchase Sanofi Beaute. The 
four PPR-sponsored members on Gucci's board won't have any input in 
that decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	De Sole said Gucci was still auditing Sanofi Beaute's books and  
wouldn't decide whether to buy the company until that process was 
complete, possibly in September.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Rockwell Paintings Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Two Norman Rockwell paintings worth $175,000  
have turned up in Philadelphia more than 21 years after they were 
stolen from a Minneapolis gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings, ``She's My Baby'' and ``Lickin' Good Bath,'' were  
among seven stolen from a Rockwell exhibit in 1978. They were 
recovered early this year after a Brazilian man tried to have the 
paintings appraised and sold at a Philadelphia gallery, the FBI 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged, and the man is not a suspect, the FBI  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A person came from South America to visit relatives here,''  
said Linda Vizi, an FBI spokeswoman. ``He had obtained the 
paintings in lieu of a debt. He brought them into the gallery, 
which ran a check and found them to be stolen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five other stolen paintings turned up in a gallery in Rio De  
Janiero, Brazil, this year. Their total value is more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Lindberg, owner of the Minneapolis gallery where the  
paintings were stolen, recovered two of the paintings and is 
negotiating for the return of the remaining three. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said it is unclear how the paintings turned up in  
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	A private collector owns ``She's My Baby,'' which appeared on  
the cover of the June 4, 1927, issue of The Saturday Evening Post 
and depicts a boy painting a heart on a girl's back. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Bigelow, a St. Paul, Minn.-based company, owns ``Lickin'  
Good Bath,'' which the company once used in a 1954 calendar. It 
shows a dog licking a boy who is bathing.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 60.47 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Thursday as strength in  
Internet and computer stocks helped the technology sector 
outperform the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index rose 28.82 to 2,771.86, a new closing  
high that beat the record of 2,743.04 set on Wednesday. The Nasdaq, 
which is dominated by technology stocks, has achieved a record high 
close in five of the past six trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 60.47 to 11,126.89. The  
blue-chip index fluctuated between negative and positive territory 
for much of the session, rising as much as 28 points from 
Wednesday's record close of 11,187.36 before giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's strength came from a wide array of technology shares.  
Yahoo! rose 2 5/8 to 164 7/16 after reporting late Wednesday its 
second-quarter earnings easily topped Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer maker Apple gained 4 5/8 to 54 1/2 after BancBoston Robertson  
Stephens upgraded its outlook on the stock. An analyst at the 
investment firm cited strong sales of Apple's iMac computer. Dow 
component Hewlett-Packard rose 6 1/2 to 105 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But while technology shares built on their recent gains, the  
broader market struggled to find direction. Alan Skrainka, chief 
market strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said the continued 
strength of the U.S. economy, underscored Thursday by strong 
reports from the nation's biggest retailers, has stunned many 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are wrestling with a tug-of-war between strong  
corporate profits and higher interest rates,'' he said. ``A strong 
economy produces both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, strong second-quarter profit forecasts have propelled  
markets to record levels in recent sessions, but even good news 
failed to prop up many faltering stocks Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric beat analysts' estimates by a penny, but its  
stock, which rose sharply Wednesday in advance of the report, 
slipped 15/16 to 117 Thursday as investors locked in their profits 
from that gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, other companies warned of weakness. Airborne Freight  
said late Wednesday it will miss analysts' expectations by as much 
as 18 cents per share. Its shares fell 1 5/16 Thursday to 25 7/8, 
dragging other package delivery company stocks with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose 3/8 to 38 1/4. Its shares had dropped in late  
trading Wednesday after a Florida jury ruled tobacco makers are 
liable for making a defective product that causes emphysema, lung 
cancer and other illnesses. The verdict, if it stands, is expected 
to cost the tobacco industry billions in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, analysts said the verdict was no real  
surprise. Investors bought Philip Morris stock back on the belief 
that legal wrangling may delay payments to plaintiffs for many 
years. Rival tobacco company stocks fell modestly. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also knocked off kilter by a vacillating bond  
market. Bond prices initially tumbled, with the 30-year Treasury 
bond dropping 1/2 point in price and its yield rising to 6.08 percent 
from 6.04 percent late Wednesday. The rising yield served as a 
reminder to investors that higher interest rates are taking hold in 
the buoyant economy, and could threaten earnings in future 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	But by afternoon, bond prices recovered, due mostly to  
improvement in European bond markets. The yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond slipped back to 5.99 percent by the afternoon, just 
under the 6 percent level that tends to set off selling in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher rates also jolted financial stocks. J.P. Morgan was  
the worst performer among Dow components, losing 4 13/16 to 141 
3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.008 
billion shares, compared with 955.37 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 1.44 to 1,394.42. The NYSE  
composite index fell 2.42 to 654.05, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index rose 6.55 to 808.69. The Russell 2000 
index of smaller companies rose 2.06 to 454.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.05 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 
percent, France's CAC-40 fell 0.7 percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 
ended 0.6 percent lower.

 *New Mexico governor endorses Forbes for president    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Gov. Gary Johnson endorsed Steve Forbes  
for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination Thursday, 
describing him through a spokeswoman as ``the man with the ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor said, however, he will support whoever  
wins the party's nomination, according to his spokeswoman, Diane 
Kinderwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Forbes and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner,  
supported Johnson in his re-election campaign last year. Johnson 
has been Bush's guest at the Governor's Mansion in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should George Bush win the nomination, he will work hard to  
support him for the presidency,'' Kinderwater said. She said 
Johnson wrote to Bush about his decision to endorse Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels strongly about the fact that Steve Forbes takes the  
high road and he talks about the issues,'' Kinderwater said. ``He's 
the man with the ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was not available for comment Thursday, the spokeswoman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcoming the endorsement, Forbes praised the Republican  
governor for promising to halt new tax increases and to streamline 
New Mexico's state government. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes came to Albuquerque last July and was the featured  
speaker at two fund-raising events for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Johnson's campaign spokesman Doug Turner said the  
two were ``like-minded philosophically in that people do better in 
an environment with less-intrusive government.''

<HEADLINE> Computer Programmer on Trial in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A Chinese computer programmer was found  
guilty Thursday of obtaining passwords to an Air Force computer 
that tracks the combat readiness of aircraft and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated for less than an hour before convicting  
Steven Liu, 25, of two counts of intentionally accessing a computer 
without authorization. He faces up to two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu, a Chinese national who was at the time working for a U.S.  
military contractor in Dayton, twice downloaded passwords from the 
computer database near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there was no evidence he used them to get into the  
system, the data of which is not classified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Liu told investigators he downloaded the file  
first out of curiosity and then to ``own'' the system. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense claimed Liu downloaded the passwords in what  
resembled a computer game, with the password file being the prize 
that proved a person had access to the system if they wished. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu pleaded guilty to the charges in December 1997 but then  
withdrew the plea and opted for a trial.

<HEADLINE> Retailers Report Strong June Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's biggest retailers reported  
surprisingly strong sales in June as the robust U.S. economy and 
warm weather sent Americans on a buying bonanza of everything from 
bathing suits to air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The glowing figures on consumer spending were released Thursday  
as the new treasury secretary said the economy appears strong 
enough to provide wage earners with even bigger pay increases 
without reviving inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about where the economy is,'' said Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers on his seventh day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans share his view, and that's helped boost retail  
sales to stunning levels all year. May and June have been 
particularly strong, inspiring many Wall Street analysts to raise 
their forecasts for second-quarter earnings for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the robust economy, consumers are enjoying low  
inflation and unemployment levels and a record-setting stock 
market. Although the Dow Jones industrial average retreated from 
Wednesday's all-time high, the Nasdaq composite index rose to a 
second straight record on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said consumers' earnings power has room to grow even  
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can keep our fundamentals strong and continue the  
terrific productivity improvement, I think we have got room to give 
people wage increases that run ahead of price increases and 
represent really higher standards of living,'' Summers said on 
NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Labor Department reported Thursday that the  
number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits 
fell by 6,000 last week to 294,000, marking the second consecutive 
drop and the lowest level in more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are happy about where the economy is and that's  
encouraging many of them to go on a spending spree,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, president of the newsletter Barnard's Retail Trend Report 
in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``We saw that in June. Stores across the 
board did well and the few that didn't stood out like a sore 
thumb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To finance their spending, many Americans are borrowing money.  
The Federal Reserve reported Thursday that consumers' credit 
outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced at a hefty 10.9 
percent annual rate in May to a seasonally adjusted $1.34 trillion. 
It was the largest increase since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Among retailers, the big winners last month were the discount  
chains, as shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Target and 
Kmart for their wide selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also faring well were specialty clothing chains, such as the  
Limited and the Gap, and the department stores, which lured 
shoppers with seasonal fashions, like capri pants and tank tops. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer electronics retailers, such as Circuit City, reported  
healthy gains as shoppers flocked to their stores to buy cheap 
computers, digital video-disc players, air conditioners and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Memorial Day holiday on May 31 also helped lift sales.  
Many retailers began their bookkeeping month May 29 or 30, which 
meant that much of the buying over the holiday weekend was included 
in June's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	With sales topping estimates in the last few month, retailers  
haven't needed panic markdowns to move out seasonal products and 
clear store shelves. Analysts expect that will result in strong 
second-quarter earnings, which most retailers will report in early 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	``With strong sales in May and June, retailers now move into  
clearance mode in July but they don't have to get rid of too much 
merchandise,'' said Thomas Tashjian, who works at Bank of America 
Securities in San Francisco. ``I think earnings will be very strong 
this quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the retail industry overall did well in June, there were a  
few chains that struggled. The midpriced department stores, such as 
J.C. Penney, continued to lose business to the discount chains. 
Stores that specialize in athletic sportswear and footwear, such as 
Sports Authority, also reported weak sales amid a prolonged 
downturn in demand for such products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 6.3 percent in June. It rose 5.4 percent in May and 6.4 percent 
in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported that sales  
from stores open at least a year rose 6.5 percent from a year 
earlier, while total sales rose 13.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales rose 1.9 percent, total sales down 3.1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 9.2 percent, total sales up 11.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 2.3  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 10.3 percent, 
total sales rose 6.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales rose 6.9 percent, total sales  
up 11.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 8.4 percent, total sales up  
18.5 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 8.4 percent, total  
sales up 12.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 11 percent, total sales were up 11  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 13 percent, total sales up 35 percent.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Pole Researcher To Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An Air Force cargo jet took off Thursday on a  
dangerous mission to drop medicine and other supplies at the South 
Pole for an American woman who discovered a lump in her breast and 
can't be evacuated until October or November. 
</P>
<P>
	Landing at the woman's research station is considered impossible  
now, during the dead of winter, with 24-hour-a-day darkness, 
temperatures as low as 80 degrees below zero and crosswinds of 60 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	So a hand-picked crew of 19 -- including a doctor to treat their  
frostbite -- will attempt an air drop, shoving six pallets of 
supplies out a side door of their C-141 Starlifter. The packages 
will parachute 700 feet to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions they are flying in are pretty bad,'' said 1st  
Lt. Lars Anderson, a spokesman at McChord Air Force Base outside 
Seattle. ``There's danger there. There's danger in every mission, 
but they're trained for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old woman, whose name was not disclosed, works for  
Antarctic Support Services, a company that provides services for 
the National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott South Pole 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
	She is among 10 women and 31 men spending the winter in the one  
of the most isolated spots on Earth. The nearest people are 838 
miles away at another Antarctic research station. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokeswoman Valerie Carroll and others familiar with the  
mission would not give details of the woman's job or say whether 
the lump is cancerous. Ms. Carroll said that the woman had 
undergone a battery of tests, including X-rays and a biopsy, and 
that the results were sent to doctors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the woman had a rigorous physical in November, before  
she left for her yearlong stint at the station, a complex of 
laboratories and living quarters covered by a geodesic dome. Had a 
breast lump been detected, she would not have been permitted to 
join the group, Ms. Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he had not reviewed the woman's case, Dr. Rick  
Clarfeld, a breast surgeon at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center in Seattle, said she could be offered the cancer drug 
tamoxifen or intravenous chemotherapy, both of which can shrink a 
breast tumor or cause it to stop growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarfeld said he occasionally takes similar measures to get IV  
chemotherapy to women in remote Alaska villages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starlifter set out from McChord Air Force Base, bound for  
Hawaii, and will then head for Christchurch, New Zealand. 
Accompanied by a KC-10 aerial tanker from Travis Air Force Base in 
California, it will make the eight-hour flight to the pole sometime 
on Saturday, U.S. time. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to medicine for the woman, the emergency drop -- the  
first at the South Pole in four years -- will also include medical 
gear and mail and fresh food for her comrades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically we have one opportunity to make a drop, so we are  
dropping any kind of medication and diagnostic equipment that might 
come in handy the next few months,'' Ms. Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSF is paying for the mission. The cost was unavailable,  
although Ms. Carroll said it was ``significant, when you consider 
the supplies are being transported halfway around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crew members will be bundled in extreme-cold-weather gear as  
the plane makes two or three passes at 200 mph. They will 
experience almost incomprehensible wind chill factors. A flight 
surgeon is going along just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	The pallets will be marked with chemical lights and strobes, so  
station members can quickly recover them before the supplies 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the brief Antarctic summer, planes that land at the  
South Pole must be equipped with skis. Once they land, they have to 
leave their engines running, so they won't seize up in the cold. 
They can stay only about two hours before the plane's hydraulic 
fluids start to freeze.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped in Bahamas Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT STEWART, Ga. (AP) -- An Army judge dismissed conspiracy and  
dereliction of duty charges on Thursday against a helicopter 
mechanic seriously injured in a helicopter crash in the Bahamas 
that left two women dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. William Westgate cried when Army judge, Col. Kenneth  
Pangburn, dismissed the allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long, hard year,'' Westgate said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Riddell and Chief Warrant Officer  
David Guido were with Westgate on a drug-interdiction mission in 
the Bahamas at the time of the crash. The Black Hawk went down on 
Grand Exuma Island on July 6, 1998, killing Riddell's wife, 
Rebecca, and Guido's wife, Pam. 
</P>
<P>
	Army rules prohibit spouses from boarding military helicopters  
without prior approval from a general officer. The defense claimed 
Westgate was not aware the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Pangburn found Riddell guilty of wrongfully  
appropriating a military aircraft and violating a lawful general 
regulation and sentenced him to a reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido was convicted in June of conspiracy, wrongful  
appropriation of an aircraft and violation of a lawful general 
regulation. He was sentenced to a reprimand as well.

<HEADLINE> Summers: U.S. Economy on Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy is on a course to allow  
workers wage increases that exceed inflation, Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about where the economy is,'' Summers said in his

	``If we can keep our fundamentals strong and continue the  
terrific productivity improvement, I think we have got room to give 
people wage increases that run ahead of price increases and 
represent really higher standards of living,'' Summers said on 
NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Harvard economist said the right course for the  
economy was set during the tenure of his predecessor at the 
Treasury Department, Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our challenge is to carry on,'' Summers said. ``I think we are  
going to be able to do that under President Clinton's leadership, 
to keep paying down that federal debt, to put in place a framework 
for the beginning of the next century, when, I think, our country 
is going to be in a much, much stronger economic position than 
anyone thought likely a few years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the nation can't become overconfident, and markets  
must be opened and exports promoted. His final concern: ``We have 
got to work as the president is this week on America's new markets, 
the less fortunate parts of our country, to make sure we take 
advantage of what is a terrific and very special opportunity for 
our economy to include all Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Posse, Sheriff Split Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The county apparently wasn't big enough for  
the two of them -- the sheriff and his posse. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't involve a showdown at high noon, just a court decree  
filed Wednesday in the Court of Common Pleas. Sheriff Jim Wright 
and what had been known for more than a decade as the Bedford 
County Sheriff's Posse have officially parted ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said it will purge the sheriff's name from its  
organization, but they don't need Wright's permission to do the 
public good in and around Bedford, about 80 miles southeast of 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought he was responsible for us, and he's not,'' said  
Lynford Yokum, vice president of the newly named Bedford County 
Posse. ``He doesn't know what volunteerism stands for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The posse was formed more than a decade ago to aid then-Sheriff  
Max Norris with searches, rescues and other duties. It has also 
patrolled the county fair and staked out a mall to discourage 
looting during a flood a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	All of it was free-of-charge to the county and the sheriff.  
</P>
<P>
	But this spring, Wright told posse members to stop operating  
under the name of his office. He asked them to get rid of the 
badges and uniform patches they used proclaiming themselves part of 
the sheriff's posse. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who took office last year, said his concern was  
liability -- he couldn't have a group he didn't control working 
under his office's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said he won't interfere with the group's lawful  
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I'm not liable for what they do, I don't really  
care,'' Wright said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Yokum acknowledged his group doesn't have the same  
liberties as police, he said volunteerism laws allow the posse to 
provide civic assistance for those who ask for assistance.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- It was the final chance for fans to pay  
tribute to the U.S. Women's World Cup team, and they did it the way 
they might treat a rock star. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd estimated by police at more than 2,000 came to  
Pomona-Pitzer College on Thursday to glimpse America's newest 
sports phenoms. That was a far cry from the 50 or so who were on 
hand on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team bus needed a motorcycle escort into the parking lot,  
and the players were protected by members of the Claremont Police 
Department as they walked onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a blast for us,'' Shannon MacMillan said. ``They were  
cheering and chanting our names the whole time. When the bus pulled 
up, they ran alongside, and when it moved up some more, they ran up 
some more. We had to have the policemen riding motorcycles by us 
just to get us to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to see them share the enthusiasm.''  
</P>
<P>
	While the majority of the crowd was comprised of young girls,  
many wearing Mia Hamm No. 9 jerseys and most of them seeking 
autographs, there was a fair number of adults present. That 
impressed Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell me the little girls are not dragging their  
parents here and dragging them to the games,'' she said. ``The 
parents are seeing how soccer has taken off and they have done well 
in getting the kids out to the games. They feel their daughters 
should see high-quality soccer and they are seeing it in the World 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, few of the fans were able to get autographs as  
officials escorted players out a back way to their bus. The Chinese 
team already was on the field and an organizing committee official 
said they were annoyed that their practice was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before an interview session, however, Brandi Chastain sneaked  
away to sign a few soccer balls and shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristine Lilly, playing in her third World Cup, opened her eyes  
wide as she surveyed the size of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more people here at practice than at our first games  
in the '80s,'' she said. ``That tells you how much interest there 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MOTORCYCLE BRIGADE:* Five officers from the Claremont Police  
Department were on duty for Thursday's practice at Pomona-Pitzer 
College. They surrounded the players as they approached the field 
before the workout, then provided security on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never had to do anything like this before,'' Lt. Gary  
Jenkins said. ``A local newspaper reported when and where practice 
was, and you see what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Jenkins brought his three children to the school  
and his 10-year-old daughter managed to get some autographs. He 
said his children are soccer players and look up to the U.S. 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real positive thing to see people looking to sports  
figures like these women as role models,'' he said. ``They've taken 
that role seriously and done a great job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of practice, the players sat on the motorcycles and  
took pictures with the police. Defender Christie Pearce even took a 
short ride on one of the bikes. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *YOUNG AT HEART:* Not all the 2,000 or so soccer fans for the  
U.S. practice were young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting on rickety bleachers at one end of the field was a  
gray-haired man with a very familiar face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 87,'' Karl Malden said, a certain amount of pride in his  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie and television actor laughed about the bandwagon  
rolling for the American team. ``Of course, I followed everyone 
else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His granddaughter, Emily Doerner, plays soccer on the same  
Pomona-Pitzer College field where the Americans were practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to some of her games,'' he said. ``Just like a lot  
of these young girls, her father started her playing when she was 
about 6, and she's kept going. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great.''  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANOTHER OCTOGENARIAN:* Dorothy Sherrard has been a soccer fan  
for most of her life, and that's quite a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to play intramural soccer at the University of Illinois  
back in the 1930s. I loved to run and I loved to play soccer,'' 
said Sherrard, 86, who was watching the American women practice 
their free kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful sport. I went to the Rose Bowl for the  
(men's) World Cup in 1994. I took my son and had to explain the 
game to him,'' Sherrard said, chuckling.

<HEADLINE> Hate Groups, Crimes Said Rare in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For decades, hate groups have remained a tiny, if lethal, slice  
of America, proselytizing among the mostly young male misfits 
attracted to their messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his shooting spree in the Midwest, Benjamin Smith worked  
his neighborhoods, spreading hate-filled pamphlets and putting up 
racist posters. 
</P>
<P>
	His rampage remains a rarity and doesn't reveal a new degree of  
danger, experts say. But the means of advertising hate has changed, 
and the new brochure is the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be, in order to attract a kid before, somebody  
would have to mail stuff to them, or go to their neighborhood,'' 
said Gail Gans, director of the Civil Rights Information Center at 
the Anti-Defamation League in New York. ``Now a kid can sit at the 
computer and type in `Nazi.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Though new Web sites may give an impression of growing  
membership in hate groups, observers say that's only a reflection 
of a new medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of self-proclaimed hate groups with Web sites range  
from 250 to 400. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, where monitors  
follow links from hate group's Web sites, some 2,000 sites surfaced 
as ``problematic.'' These, for example, offered instructions in 
bomb-making or rock music espousing hatred or youth clubs extolling 
the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Using the Internet) makes perfect sense for all the reasons  
that business, educational institutions, the media are embracing 
the World Wide Web,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of 
the center. ``It's the most incredible medium to mass market and 
advertise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Cooper found no evidence of a huge leap in numbers of  
adherents, he said the risk is real. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time America's children have been exposed 24  
hours a day, seven days a week to this level of racism and bigotry 
and packaged in a way that is, quite frankly, attractive,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other methods of attraction have worked in the past.  
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., estimates  
more than 100,000 followers among the various hate groups, though a 
spokesman concedes that the tally -- from periodicals, news reports 
and police -- is approximate. The center also counts membership in 
such religions as the Christian Identity Movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are absolutely soft,'' said Mark Potok, a Southern  
Poverty Law Center spokesman. ``We are talking about a tiny number 
of Americans who are members of hate groups -- I mean, 
infinitesimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even fewer members of hate groups commit hate crimes. More than  
95 percent of such crimes are committed by those with no hate-group 
ties, said Jack McDevitt, a professor of criminal justice at 
Northeastern University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Internet offers a home for haters, regardless of ties.  
``It allows people to believe that the number of people who share 
their beliefs is much larger,'' McDevitt said of the Internet. 
``You can log on to the Internet and see you're not weird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So who are these few haters?  
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty years ago, there was this paradigm of bad people who  
commit hate crimes, who were extremists and they weren't like us,'' 
said Chip Berlet of Political Research Associates in Somerville, 
Mass. ``Now we know they're our neighbors. They're relatively 
normal except for their biased views, and they act out on their 
beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDevitt offered this overview: Most cohesive hate groups  
consist of 15 to 25 members, predominantly males in their teens and 
20s. The groups appeal to those who feel unwanted by family or 
society. Even if they find a home or a group, they may join for 
only a few months or a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids get into it and realize this is a lifestyle that doesn't  
offer a lot of a future,'' McDevitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	To the experts, Benjamin Smith was an oddity. That's borne out  
by data that the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program began 
collecting in 1990. Of the 8,049 hate crimes reported in 1997, the 
most recent figures available, only eight were killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Smith's deadly spree last weekend evokes memories of other  
loners who shed blood out of hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Joseph Paul Franklin, now on death row in Missouri. A  
self-proclaimed white supremacist, he was believed to have killed 
17 people in the 1970s and '80s -- three interracial couples, seven 
black men and boys, three women and a Jewish man -- though he was 
convicted for fewer deaths. And Patrick Purdy, who opened fire on a 
schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., in 1989, killing five Asian 
children before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most hate crimes are not committed with guns,'' McDevitt said.  
``They're committed with people's hands, or rocks, bricks, bats. 
This most recent incident is particularly frightening because it 
was random violence by guns.''

<HEADLINE> No Change in British Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England left its base lending rate  
unchanged at 5 percent Thursday after a monthly review of the 
country's economic performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's decision to keep the base rate where it is -- at its  
lowest level since 1977 -- followed incremental reductions during 
seven of the previous nine months. The base rate is what the Bank 
of England, Britain's central bank, charges for loans to other 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank announced its decision to keep rates where they are  
after a regular meeting of its monetary committee. It did not 
explain the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading business group, The British Chambers of Commerce, said  
the bank was ``right to hold fire on rates,'' due to signs of 
improvement in the British economy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the BCC urged the bank to monitor the value of  
Britain's currency, the pound, with a view to cutting the base rate 
later in the year if the pound's strength makes British exports 
less competitive. A strong pound makes British goods more expensive 
than exports denominated in other currencies, and exporters have 
long complained that lower interest rates are necessary for the 
pound to become less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trades Union Congress criticized the bank's decision, saying  
a further reduction in the base rate would have been better news 
for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor unions, like many manufacturers, fear that Britain will  
lose jobs and sales to foreign competitors.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Flood Las Vegas Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavy rains poured down on Las Vegas on  
Thursday, creating floods that smashed mobile homes, swallowed 
hundreds of cars and led to at least two deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nightmare,'' said Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Scott  
Flabi. ``It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sections of busy Interstate 15 resembled a lake, bringing  
traffic to a standstill. Most major intersections were under water 
and block walls along a flood channel collapsed. Firefighters 
rescued motorists whose cars were sucked into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as serious as it gets,'' said Clark County Fire  
Department spokesman Steve La-Sky. ``Our emergency dispatch 
switchboard is lit up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said hundreds of cars were trapped in high waters and at  
least four mobile homes had been lost. He didn't know the extent of 
damage to others. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain appeared to have led to the deaths of two people, a man  
whose body was found in a flood channel and a woman who died in a 
traffic accident, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron McQueen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service,  
said the flooding was the worst in Las Vegas in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, parts of Las Vegas Valley had received up to  
3 inches of rain and more was expected, McQueen said. Usually, Las 
Vegas receives only 4.1 inches of rain all year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists sought shelter in the casinos along the famed Strip.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Strip is a lake, up over the curbs, into our fountains,''  
said Phil Cooper, spokesman for Caesars Palace hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilles Bloch, a tourist from France, watched the flooding from  
his room at the Sahara hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking out the window, it looked like a beautiful woman who  
had been crying, and all the makeup was running down her face,'' he 
said. ``That's Las Vegas today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were trying to contain mudslides and boulder slides  
along a highway northwest of the city, Flabi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights at McCarran International Airport were shut down for 45  
minutes, and two planes scheduled to land in Las Vegas had to be 
diverted to Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Continental Flight Hits Turbulence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- A Continental Airlines flight from  
Newark, N.J. to Puerto Rico hit severe turbulence Thursday and 
dropped 500 feet, injuring 16 passengers and forcing it to land in 
Bermuda for medical help, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Bermuda said 16 of the 159 people aboard Continental  
Flight 743 were hospitalized with serious injuries, most to the 
head and neck, and that another 45 passengers suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one minute, I saw people flying. It was like an S-shape in  
the air, up and down. I saw one man flip right over the seat,'' 
passenger Diana Munoz of Newark told a reporter at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of blood... a lot of neck injuries,'' said  
Miguel Vargas, also from Newark. He said one food cart hit the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injuries were minor, nursing supervisor Doreen  
Richardson of King Edward VII Hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental spokeswoman Karla Villalon said the turbulence came  
amid fairly clear skies, causing the plane to drop 500 feet then 
quickly recover. She said she understood most people had only minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston,  
Texas, said the Boeing 737-800 flying from Newark encountered 
turbulence when it was at about 29,000 feet and 180 miles south of 
Bermuda. It said the Boeing 737-800 was carrying 153 passengers and 
a crew of four flight attendants and two pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	All four flight attendants were injured, the airline said, and  
Barnett said two of them were taken to the hospital in neck braces. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight left Newark at 12:20 p.m. and landed in Hamilton at  
about 4 p.m., Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the plane was not damaged and suffered only a  
superficial crack in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers who were not hurt were taken to the Marriott and  
Grotto Bay Hotels and were expected to be flown to Puerto Rico on 
Friday afternoon, Barnett said.

<HEADLINE> Albright's Vacation Not All Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took  
time out from her European vacation to have lunch with Bernard 
Kouchner, newly appointed chief of civilian administration in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to dispel suggestions that the administration was  
unhappy with the choice, State Department spokesman James Foley 
said Albright ``was most impressed with his energy, passion and 
commitment to doing the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kouchner, who was French health minister, was appointed last  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had lunch on Tuesday in Innsbruck, Austria.  
</P>
<P>
	Albright also made phone calls to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy to congratulate them on 
taking their respective offices. 
</P>
<P>
	She also expressed her interest in working with both to advance  
the peace process, Foley said. She delivered the same message in a 
telephone call to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also has had at least two phone conversations with U.N.  
Secretary General Kofi Annan and one with Russian Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if this secretary of state is ever fully on  
vacation,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is due back in Washington over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most of the nation's biggest retailers reported  
today that their June sales jumped to better-than-expected levels 
as the robust U.S. economy encouraged Americans to do lots of 
shopping last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchants also benefited from warmer-than-normal weather through  
much of the country, which sent shoppers into stores for everything 
from bathing suits and sundresses to air conditioners and patio 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong sales in June followed surprisingly big gains in May,  
giving many Wall Street analysts reason to believe that 
second-quarter earnings will top estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very happy consumer who is flush with cash and eager  
to spend,'' said Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst at Bank of 
America Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The raging U.S. economy, combined with low unemployment and  
inflation levels has made consumers confident about their personal 
finances and has raised their willingness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the stock market is again on a record-setting pace.  
The Dow Jones industrial average and other market indexes reached 
new highs on Wednesday, but retreated this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department reported that the number  
of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 
6,000 last week to 294,000, marking the second consecutive drop and 
the lowest level in more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a very favorable environment out there and the  
consumer is still feeling very strong,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, 
managing director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in June were the discount chains, as shoppers  
turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart for their wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also faring well were specialty clothing chains, such as the  
Limited and the Gap, and the department stores, which lured 
shoppers with seasonal fashions, like capri pants and tank tops. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer electronics retailers, such as Circuit City, reported  
healthy gains as shoppers flocked to their stores to buy cheap 
computers, digital video-disc players, air conditioners and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	While the weather and the strong economy were mostly responsible  
for the sales gains, retailers also benefited last month from the 
late Memorial Day holiday, which fell on May 31. Most retailers 
began their fiscal month on May 29 or 30, which meant that much of 
the buying over the holiday weekend was included in June's sales 
figures. Last year, Memorial Day was counted in May. 
</P>
<P>
	With sales in the last few months topping estimates, retailers  
haven't had to slash prices on merchandise to move out seasonal 
products and clear store shelves. Analysts expect that will result 
in strong second-quarter earnings, which most retailers will report 
in early August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second-quarter earnings will reflect the good sales  
performance at full price, and I don't think this party is going to 
end anytime soon,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of the newsletter 
Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``We do not 
foresee a major downturn of any kind for the rest of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the retail industry overall did well in June, there were  
some chains that struggled. The mid-priced department stores, such 
as J.C. Penney, continued to lose business to the discount chains. 
Stores that specialize in athletic sportswear and footwear, such as 
Sports Authority, also reported weak sales amid a prolonged 
downturn in demand for such products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 6.3 percent in June. It rose 5.4 percent in May and 6.4 percent 
in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported that sales  
from stores open at least a year rose 6.5 percent from a year 
earlier, while total sales rose 13.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength.	   Other retailers' reports: 
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales rose 1.9 percent, total sales down 3.1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 9.2 percent, total sales up 11.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 2.3  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 10.3 percent, 
total sales rose 6.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales rose 6.9 percent, total sales  
up 11.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 8.4 percent, total sales up  
18.5 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 8.4 percent, total  
sales up 12.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 11 percent, total sales were up 11  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 13 percent, total sales up 35 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor: Same-store sales up 7.7 percent, total sales up  
18.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Swiss Financier Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- A former Swiss financier extradited  
last year from the Bahamas was given a four-year jail sentence 
Thursday after being found guilty of charges including fraudulent 
bankruptcy and attempted fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner Rey already has spent more than three years in detention  
and that time will be deducted from his sentence, a panel of judges 
said in their ruling after a five-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss government claimed Rey, 55, defrauded European  
investors of more than $1 billion and left $2.8 billion in public 
and private debt when his business empire collapsed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had demanded a 10-year sentence, while the defense  
pleaded for acquittal. Rey was acquitted on one charge of business 
fraud, but is liable for costs totaling some $3.18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides immediately said they plan to appeal the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	Rey, who denied any wrongdoing, made his money in a takeover of  
Bally, a Swiss shoe manufacturer. He used heavily leveraged deals 
in the 1980s to build up his main company, Omni Holding AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Rey and his wife fled Switzerland for the Bahamas in 1991 and  
became permanent residents of the country in 1992. He was arrested 
in March 1996 and was held in a Nassau prison cell while his 
lawyers fought to keep him in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been kept in detention in Bern since his extradition in  
June last year.

<HEADLINE> Irvan To Drive for MB2 Through 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Ernie Irvan's contract to drive for MB2  
Motorsports has been extended through the 2000 Winston Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan joined the team last year and has won three poles and  
posted 16 top-10 finishes. He is 22nd in the 1999 driver standings 
heading into Sunday's event in Loudon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good things are going to keep happening for this race team,''  
Irvan, who has 15 career victories but none since 1997, said 
Thursday. ``I'm not finished winning, and I really believe I can 
get to Victory Lane with this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MB2 Motorsports, owned by Read Morton, Nelson Bowers and Tom  
Beard, became a full-time Winston Cup team in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan was on the verge of giving the team a top-10 finish in  
last year's points standings before late-season injuries in 
Talladega, Ala., sidelined him for the stretch run. He wound up 
19th. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is still relatively young in that we've only been  
together for three years and have seen significant accomplishments 
in that time,'' general manager Jay Frye said. ``Ernie Irvan is one 
of the best drivers in the sport. Right now we have one of the best 
situations in Winston Cup racing.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Marriage Law Weighed in Vermont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- For the last eight months, Peter Harrigan  
and Stan Baker have waited by the phone each Friday, hoping for a 
decision from the state Supreme Court allowing them to marry. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont's high court, which releases its opinions at the end of  
the work week, is the only one in the nation currently facing the 
question of whether same-sex marriage should be legal. And many 
believe Vermont is the most likely state to allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's any place it could stick in the country, I think  
it's Vermont,'' said Vermont Law School professor Greg Johnson, who 
was involved in a similar case in Alaska. ``It strikes some deep 
chords here about the tradition of independence, letting people do 
what they want with their private lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the notion of allowing two men or two women to marry has  
not stuck anywhere else. Courts in Alaska and Hawaii have ruled in 
favor of gay marriage. But they were essentially overturned by 
voters last November, even though there still is legal wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts Vermont at the forefront of one of the biggest  
political debates of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's waiting with bated breath,'' said Jay Sekulow,  
chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice in 
Virginia Beach, Va., which filed a brief opposing gay marriage in 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Because marriages performed in one state are generally  
recognized by other states, Hawaii's 1993 ruling set off some 
furious preemptive legislating around the country. Congress passed 
the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition of 
gay marriage and allowed states to ignore same-sex unions licensed 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a 37-year-old drama professor, and Baker, the  
53-year-old director of outpatient services for a mental health 
agency, say they want to be afforded the same rights as 
heterosexual mates. 
</P>
<P>
	They and two lesbian couples sued in 1997 when their town  
clerks, on the advice of the Vermont attorney general, denied them 
marriage licenses. As in the Hawaii and Alaska cases, the Vermont 
couples argue that marriage is a fundamental right. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal marriage would afford gay and lesbian couples a wide range  
of civil benefits in Vermont, including family leave; bereavement 
leave; retirement and pension benefits; health insurance; 
inheritance; and the right to make medical decisions on behalf of a 
same-sex partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vermont court is most likely to focus on whether denying gay  
marriage is a violation of the state constitution's common benefits 
clause, akin to the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause, 
said Peter Teachout, a Vermont Law School professor. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court rules in favor of same-sex unions, opponents could  
seek to amend the state constitution to thwart the decision -- a 
tough proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two successive legislatures must approve a constitutional  
amendment, and then it has to be adopted by a statewide vote. The 
process generally takes four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates believe hundreds or thousands of couples would marry  
before such an amendment could reach the people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once there is a breakthrough, whether it is in Vermont or  
Hawaii, the fair-minded middle of the public is going to see the 
sky didn't fall,'' said Evan Wolfson, a lawyer for the Lambda Legal 
Defense and Education Fund, a gay rights organization.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Liable in Fla. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Just seven months after agreeing to pay states more  
than $200 billion, the tobacco industry faces another potentially 
massive award -- this time to hundreds of thousands of smokers 
suffering from emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Wednesday held the nation's five largest tobacco  
companies liable for making a defective product in the first 
class-action lawsuit by smokers ever to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found that the industry ``engaged in extreme and  
outrageous conduct ... with the intent to inflict severe emotional 
distress,'' which could support an award of punitive damages in the 
trial's next phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Those damages could exceed even the national settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	``The verdict will almost certainly be regarded as a landmark in  
finally holding the tobacco industry accountable for the damage it 
does in addicting children and in causing tobacco-related 
disease,'' said Bill Novelli, president of the Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1994 on behalf of as many as 500,000  
sick Florida smokers and the heirs of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the jury decides what, if any, damages should be awarded to  
the lawsuit's nine representative class members, then the 
half-million other members will be free to seek recovery. The 
plaintiffs are seeking at least $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Other verdicts against the industry have been reversed, and some  
analysts predict the cigarette companies may be able to dismantle 
the class-action -- have it ``decertified'' on appeal -- in order to 
fight individual claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the industry does not get the case decertified, then this  
would be a stepping stone to a very large number of awards against 
the industry,'' said Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	A class-action typically is created to avoid wasting time  
litigating similar claims by numerous plaintiffs. Cigarette makers 
have argued the technique isn't appropriate in smoker cases because 
there are too many issues unique to each plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adelman, tobacco analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,  
said he expects the class will be decertified and that the case 
``is going to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it is not decertified, it will break down into a  
lawsuit for each and every smoker,'' Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry will be allowed to raise defenses in the next phase  
of the case that it wasn't able to raise in the first phase, such 
as whether the individual smokers assumed the risk of smoking 
knowing it was unhealthy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only five  
times -- three were overturned on appeal and the two others are 
being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the jury heard eight months of testimony and had  
thousands of industry documents garnered over decades of tobacco 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Former surgeons general, ex-tobacco industry scientists and  
doctors testified about the havoc smoking can wreak on the body, 
the difficulty in trying to quit and the manufacturers' refusal to 
cooperate with health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry claimed there is no scientific proof that smoking  
causes any illness and that the public is well aware that smoking 
is risky. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury agreed with the smokers on all counts, including  
their claims that the industry deceived them about the dangers of 
smoking, hid research results, stopped scientific work that 
promised to produce safer cigarettes and advertised to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs and family members openly wept and hugged each other  
as the verdict was read in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye barred lawyers in the case from  
discussing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were the nation's five biggest cigarette makers  
and two industry groups: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett 
Group Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers, but it does not prohibit lawsuits by 
individuals such as this one.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Accomplice charged through an opening  
on the rail turning for home and beat Ora Pro Nobis by 
three-quarters of a length to win Thursday's $52,400 feature at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Corey Nakatani, Australian-bred Accomplice covered 5 1/2  
furlongs on the turf in 1:01 4-5 and paid $2.80, $2.20 and $2.10. 
The 6-year-old gelding won for the second time in three races since 
coming to the United States late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine-bred Ora Pro Nobis returned $3.40 and $2.10, while  
Argentine-bred Crows, making his first U.S. start, was another 4 1/2 
lengths back in third and paid $2.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $31,440, increased Accomplice's career  
earnings to $621,681, with nine wins in 20 races.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players To Face Marijuana Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- NBA players are being warned by their  
union reps: Smoking marijuana in July could lead to a failed drug 
test in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there are guys out there using, and hopefully  
they'll get the message that they have to stop,'' player rep Jim 
McIlvaine of the New Jersey Nets said Wednesday at the union's 
annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	A fact sheet being handed out to player representatives for the  
29 teams states that marijuana can stay in a person's system for 
60-90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	And with marijuana being added to the NBA's list of banned  
substances for the 1999-2000 season, the union wants its 
pot-smoking members to knock it off now so they won't produce a 
dirty urine sample when training camps open. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the testing comes, the proof will be in the pudding,''  
said union director Billy Hunter, who scoffed at a report in 1997 
saying about 70 percent of the league's players either use 
marijuana or are heavy drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players taking part in the union meeting said there are a  
number of marijuana users, although they claim the total is nothing 
close to 70 percent of the player population. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players, including Chris Webber, Mookie Blaylock, Vernon  
Maxwell and J.R. Rider, have been arrested on marijuana-related 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento Kings guard Jason Williams was kicked off his college  
team at Florida for testing positive for marijuana twice. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players who test positive at training camp must undergo a  
mandatory counseling program. A second positive test brings a 
$15,000 fine, and any third or subsequent positive test results in 
a five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	All players will be tested when training camps open in October,  
and rookies will be tested four times per season on a random basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that if guys are using, they got the message  
last year that they'll be tested,'' Tyrone Corbin of the Atlanta 
Hawks said. ``Some guys, just like society in general, don't get 
the message until they're caught. Hopefully, they'll get this 
message and it won't put their careers in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steroids were also added to the league's banned substances list  
during the last collective bargaining negotiations. 
Androstenedione, the testosterone-producing substance taken by 
baseball slugger Mark McGwire and others, is not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA is like any industry, there's going to be people on  
drugs,'' Jim McIlvaine of the New Jersey Nets said. ``As role 
models, people need to know that we don't condone its use. 
</P>
<P>
	A player also can be tested during the regular season if an  
arbitrator decides, after a hearing, there is reasonable cause to 
believe a player has used, possessed or distributed any prohibited 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone testing positive for steroids gets a five-game suspension  
for the first offense, a 10-game suspension for a second offense 
and a 25-game suspension for a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for such illegal narcotics as cocaine, heroin and PCP  
are much more severe. A positive drug test -- or a conviction or 
guilty plea to a crime involving one of those drugs -- can lead to 
disqualification from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a very big problem in the league,'' said  
Corbin, who was at Vancouver's airport in 1997 when Blaylock, his 
Hawks teammate, was found to be carrying marijuana by a 
drug-sniffing dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic said reports of widespread  
usage are overblown. However, he said drug use -- and not just 
marijuana -- was a serious problem when he entered the league in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything going on today is mild compared to 20 years ago,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Indicted on Drug Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A doctor who gained notoriety for distributing  
diet pills over the Internet has been indicted on 34 federal 
charges accusing him of illegally prescribing medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents arrested Pietr Hitzig, 56, on Wednesday at his  
mother's home in Lewisburg, W.Va., The (Baltimore) Sun reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitzig surrendered his medical license in February over  
allegations of improper sexual relations with patients. But his 
World Wide Web site still advertises drug treatments with the 
banner ``Better than Ever.'' Authorities said it was unclear 
whether the Harvard-educated doctor continues to practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Baltimore  
relates to prescriptions for patients between 1996 and 1998, when 
Hitzig was running a Baltimore-based practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of patients around the world obtained drugs like the  
diet combination fen-phen from Hitzig after visiting his Web site 
and sending him requests by e-mail. Doctors in Maryland are 
required to examine patients before prescribing medication. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal affidavit says a patient who met Hitzig through the  
Internet was an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent, 
who posed as an overweight businessman looking to slim down. The 
agent said Hitzig prescribed him drugs to foster weight loss, 
though the two never met in person, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the 34 counts in the indictment carries a maximum  
penalty of three years in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine, the ``fen'' half of the combination, was pulled  
off the market in 1997 amid concerns that it scarred heart valves 
irreversibly and sometimes fatally.

<HEADLINE> McCain Calls for Internet Tax Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain told an audience of conservatives he firmly opposes Internet 
sales taxes, but softened his stance later when addressing 
reporters, saying the issue needs more study. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to distinguish himself from Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
who is still considering the issue, McCain said flatly in a speech 
Wednesday he favors a ban on Internet taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ban must be permanent,'' McCain said. ``Because you can be  
sure that the special interests that yearn to tap the cash cow to 
finance their projects will (gain) a competitive advantage through 
friendly rules and will pay their soft money dues to pursue the 
prize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet asked for the details of his proposal after the speech,  
McCain deferred to the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. 
Congress created the panel last year to study Internet tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to look at the results of this commission  
before I would take a hard position on it,'' McCain, an Arizona 
senator, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I believe that when you look at the jobs and the revenue  
that are created as a result of this industry, this technology, we 
ought to seriously consider not imposing taxes on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year imposed a three-year moratorium on new  
federal, state and local electronic commerce taxes, which expires 
in October 2001. Aides said McCain at the time favored a permanent 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	During a campaign swing here last week, Bush spokeswoman Karen  
Hughes said the Texas governor is still considering whether 
commerce on the Internet should be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spoke in this city six days after Bush did, and he echoed  
Bush on several high-tech issues. But he tailored his stump speech 
on campaign finance reform to the area's high-tech industry and 
traced many of its headaches to the influence of ``special 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain wants to abolish soft money, the unlimited contributions  
made by corporations and interest groups to party committees to 
influence campaigns. He is seeking a Senate vote on a bill he 
co-wrote that would do that. 
</P>
<P>
	He bemoaned a shortage of skilled foreign workers allowed into  
the country, and he denounced the nation's ``out-of-control'' civil 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bush, McCain attacked the Clinton administration for  
dragging its feet on a bill approved last week that would make it 
harder to sue companies for Y2K-related problems. The White House 
repeatedly threatened to veto such bills, but President Clinton 
said last week he will sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bush, McCain called for freer international trade. Silicon  
Valley seeks lower international trade barriers, and McCain 
proclaimed himself ``the most free-trading anti-protectionist you 
will ever see in the United States Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in an implicit challenge to Bush, McCain delivered his  
speech at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank based 
at Stanford University that is home to at least 10 Bush policy 
advisers. At least one was in the audience.

<HEADLINE> Bush Attends Minority Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A day after aides said there was no time in his  
schedule, Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush made 
an impromptu appearance today at a conference of minority 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spent only a few minutes at the Unity '99 conference,  
shaking hands with a crowd that quickly gathered around him. He 
made no formal remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor's initial decision not to attend the  
conference even though he was campaigning in Seattle today had 
drawn criticism from some of the 6,000 journalists attending the 
conference. That controversy was described in an article in today's 
Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Bush changed his mind and decided to attend, Bush  
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, ``We read the L.A. Times story this 
morning and people were saying it was an important signal to send, 
so he decided to make the effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the presidential candidates had been invited to speak at the  
conference, but only the two Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and 
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, accepted at first. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's staff had said in a statement, ``Unfortunately, we are  
not able to schedule everything on this first trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Sen. John McCain's campaign also declined initially,  
citing a scheduling conflict. But he decided to attend after 
reading the Los Angeles Times story, according to his presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	At a campaign breakfast today in Spokane, Bush touched on  
conservative themes of tax cuts and smaller government in a speech 
to about 800 people who paid $20 each for a breakfast of cereal, 
orange juice, bananas and muffins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will swear to uphold the dignity and the honor of the office  
to which I am elected,'' Bush said, drawing the biggest applause in 
his 15-minute speech. ``We can prove that someone who is 
conservative and compassionate can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's conservative to cut taxes. It's compassionate to give  
people their own money back so they can save and earn,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by Republican Reps. Jennifer Dunn, George Nethercutt and  
Doc Hastings, Bush kicked off a daylong swing through Washington 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush planned to attend a fund-raiser later in the day at the  
Seattle-area home of telecommunications tycoon Craig McCaw. That 
event is expected to raise at least $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Wednesday shortly after his arrival in  
Washington Bush said Pacific Coast salmon should be protected, but 
not at the expense of dams on the Snake River. 
</P>
<P>
	An environmental group, American Rivers, has identified the  
Snake River as the most endangered river in the nation, reporting 
that its fish population has dropped by 90 percent since four dams 
were constructed in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important for us to protect the fish, but I  
think we can do so in a way that doesn't cause the dams to have to 
be breached,'' he said. ``I understand how significant the dams 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to complete a study next  
year on whether breaching the dams is the best way to help the 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	While environmentalists say that removing the earthen portions  
of the four dams would allow water and salmon to flow freely past 
them, industry groups say the move would also render the dams 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 53, has collected the endorsements of many top Republican  
leaders during this western swing. On Wednesday, six GOP governors 
-- from Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah -- 
endorsed him in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, he was scheduled to talk to 200 kids about the  
perils of the Internet and then meet with Microsoft executives at 
the software giant's suburban campus before the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has called for freeing Internet sales from  
duties and tariffs. He also supports a permanent federal 
research-and-development tax credit and has pledged not to raise 
federal personal or corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has also proposed intensifying efforts to combat  
intellectual piracy and supports raising the limit on the number of 
highly skilled workers allowed into the country under so-called 
H-1B visas.

<HEADLINE>  Anti-Milosevic Protests Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Increasing protests against Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic show that ordinary Serbs are ``waking 
up'' to the horrors he incited in Kosovo, Britain's defense 
secretary said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of demonstrations by thousands of people this week in  
Serb towns have raised the opposition's hopes for getting rid of 
Milosevic. Another protest was planned for tonight in the southern 
town of Prokuplje. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sizable spontaneous protests that are taking place in  
Serbia show that the man responsible for the violence in this part 
of Europe is now being pinpointed even by his own people,'' 
Britain's George Robertson said on a visit to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message of NATO and the message of these demonstrators is  
very clear: Milosevic is a loser,'' the defense secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition has been trying to turn the protests into a  
united front against Milosevic -- something it has failed to do in 
the past due to internal differences. 
</P>
<P>
	One key opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic  
Party, met with leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church today at a 
monastery outside the Kosovo capital of Pristina today, seeking 
their backing. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a hostile reception from Serbs in the village, however,  
and was shouted down by about 100 people as he tried to speak to 
journalists after the meeting. Some yelled, ``Where were you a 
month ago?'' and ``You're trying to destroy our government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic, who has called for daily demonstrations he hopes will  
build a broad enough base for a general strike, left the area in a 
bus escorted by two NATO tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, one of Milosevic's harshest critics, insisted the  
Yugoslav president and others indicted for alleged war crimes 
sooner or later would face justice at the international tribunal in 
The Hague, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Robertson's first visit to Kosovo since NATO's 78-day  
bombing campaign forced Milosevic to accept a peace plan that 
required him to pull out all his troops and allow deployment of a 
NATO-led force. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Army, meanwhile, identified today a soldier who was  
killed Sunday in a traffic accident in Macedonia as Spc. Anthony W. 
Gilman, 23, of Michael, Ill., the Army said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Gilman was struck by a civilian truck as he set  
up a warning triangle in the roadway after his convoy was stalled 
in a tunnel outside the capital, Skopje. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman is the first American killed during the peacekeeping  
mission. Two U.S. soldiers died in helicopter crashes in Albania 
while training in the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia begun 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 860,000 ethnic Albanians fled or were expelled from  
Kosovo during a crackdown in the province before and during the 
78-day NATO bombing. Milosevic insisted the action was necessary to 
quell a terrorist-led secessionist movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Since peacekeepers began moving in June 12, more than 600,000  
refugees have returned, many to find their homes and farms 
devastated and relatives dead or missing. NATO has been 
hard-pressed to curb revenge attacks against Serbs, at least 60,000 
of whom have fled the province. 
</P>
<P>
	As efforts to rebuild Kosovo get under way, the Red Cross today  
warned governments not to lose sight of humanitarian needs in 
Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics that make up the Yugoslav 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other leaders have pledged not to finance  
reconstruction in Serbia as long as Milosevic is in power, though 
they have said they would back humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must fight the tendency to demonize entire groups of  
people,'' Astrid Heiberg, president of the International Federation 
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said after visiting 
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE>  Runners Trampled in Spain Bull Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) -- Stampeding bulls and fellow runners  
bruised several people today in the second bull run at Spain's 
immensely popular San Fermin Fiesta. No one was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than 2,000 participants chanted a prayer to San  
Fermin for protection, a rocket was fired into the air to signal 
the release of the six fighting bulls and the start of the daily 
run that is the main feature of the eight-day festival that ends 
July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The runs, or 'encierros' as they are known in Spanish, are held  
at 8 a.m. with thousands of people, mostly men, testing their 
bravery and speed by running alongside six fighting bulls and a 
handful of accompanying steers. They are herded from a city corral 
along a 825-yard stretch of cobblestone street to the bullring. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, women were not allowed to run with the bulls. In  
recent years this has ceased to be an issue and nowadays many can 
be seen taking part. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injuries today occurred as people slipped and were  
unable to get back up as the bulls and mass of people charged along 
the main Estafeta street. 
</P>
<P>
	One bull lost balance and for several seconds was wedged beneath  
the special wooden barriers set up along the street. He eventually 
freed himself and continued the journey to the ring. The bulls face 
almost certain death at the hands of professional matadors in 
bullfights later each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The centuries-old festival, which features a nonstop street  
party, became internationally famous following the 1926 publication 
of Ernest Hemingway's novel ``The Sun Also Rises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overcrowding has made the runs extremely dangerous. Since record  
keeping began in 1924, 13 runners have been killed and more than 
200 injured by the bulls. The last fatality was an American in 
1995, the first death since 1980.

<HEADLINE>  India Army Chief Visits Battle Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- Indian troops seized another peak  
today in Kashmir's northern battle zone, a ridge India says is a 
vital supply route for Pakistan-based fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	A field commander said 70 Pakistani soldiers or Islamic  
guerrillas were killed in an overnight battle for the ridge in the 
Muskhoh Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's pledge to  
persuade the forces to withdraw from Indian-held Kashmir, Indian 
commanders on the Himalayan battle front said there was no sign of 
a retreat. Instead, the rebels were attacking positions they lost 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif returned home today from a weekend summit with President  
Clinton, where he agreed to seek the withdrawal of forces fighting 
in Kashmir. Sharif was due to meet with his army chief and cabinet, 
and may address the nation, his aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif has been widely condemned in Pakistan by religious  
parties, guerrilla groups and opposition political parties. The 
right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami party accused him of treason and 
threatened to depose him. 
</P>
<P>
	India says Pakistani troops are leading the fighters in Kashmir.  
Islamabad, however, denies that, saying the fighters are Kashmiri 
insurgents that receive only moral support from Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting remained fierce in the mountains above Kargil, around  
the town of Batalik and in the Mushkoh Valley. ``The enemy is 
giving us stiff resistance,'' said Col. Bikram Singh, the Indian 
military spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian soldiers returning from the battle boasted that they had  
to step over the corpses of Pakistani soldiers or Islamic 
guerrillas strewn across the rocky ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The field commander said India had 18 casualties, but had no  
breakdown of dead and wounded. Front-line officers cannot be 
identified by name. Wounded soldiers hobbled down the treacherous 
path supported by comrades to receive medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the front, five Pakistani artillery shells landed  
in Kargil. One shell hit the office of the state-run All India 
Radio, killing one policeman, a local commander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy Pakistani bombardment continued on Tiger Hill, a strategic  
peak retaken by Indian troops over the weekend. Indian soldiers 
were blowing up tunnels large enough for 40 people that were built 
by the intruders. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. State Department officials expressed confidence Wednesday  
that Sharif remains committed to an early resolution of the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James Foley said a resolution means restoring Line of  
Control, as the 1972 cease-fire line is known, and a resumption of 
direct negotiations on the outstanding issues between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The militant groups said they would rather die than withdraw  
from their fight to separate Muslim-majority Kashmir from 
Hindu-dominated India. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday, India said 542 Pakistani soldiers and more than  
150 Islamic guerrillas have been killed, while 283 Indian soldiers 
have died, 451 were wounded and 10 are missing. The figures cannot 
be independently confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Cipollini Wins 5th Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMIENS, France (AP) -- As befits his nickname, ``The Lion King,''  
Mario Cipollini is clearly inspired by grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Tour de France passing a royal palace one day and three  
stunning cathedrals the next, the Italian has won two straight 
stages of cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	All this when observers had started to grumble about his  
sluggish performance, and Cipollini had joked about soon being 
unemployed because his team, Saeco, was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions have resumed about my future,'' he said Thursday,  
after surging across the finish line just ahead of Belgian Tom 
Steels and winning the fifth stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Estonian Jaan Kirsipuu finished third and retained the yellow  
leader's jersey for the fourth day. Robbie McEwen of Australia was 
fourth and German Erik Zabel fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was one of the longest of the Tour, a 145-mile ride  
through rolling wheat fields and occasional bursts of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	It approached at least three grand cathedrals: the Gothic  
masterpiece at Chartres, with its famed stained-glass windows; a 
graceful one at Beauvais, and France's biggest at Amiens, where the 
stage ended. 
</P>
<P>
	On their way to the Somme region, where the famous World War I  
battle was fought, the riders passed tantalizingly close to Paris, 
only 31 miles away. They might have been tempted to take a short 
cut over to the Champs-Elysees, site of the finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Wednesday, when a favorable tailwind led to a record  
speed for the stage, the riders faced a headwind Thursday and the 
average speed was nearly six mph slower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, Steels moved up to second and  
Australian Stuart O'Grady was third. Lance Armstrong, on the 
comeback from testicular cancer, was fourth, and Cipollini fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was marked by an early breakaway, this time at the  
two-mile mark. A group of 10 riders made the break, instigated by 
Frenchmen Jacky Durand and his Belgian teammate on Lotto-Mobistar, 
Thierry Marechal. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had as much as a 6-minute, 15-second lead, but that  
soon was whittled down by the advancing pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Magnus Backstedt took a brief lead near the end. But he  
was soon overtaken, and the race was set for another furious, 
wide-open sprint. Cipollini's Saeco teammates again moved him into 
position, and he sprinted to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Cipollini chose the former home of French kings to  
win the fastest stage in tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Blois, in view of the imposing royal castle, he  
came off a stone bridge spanning the Loire River to win the fourth 
stage in a photo finish -- and a record speed of 31.290 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the talk at the Tour has been mostly about cycling, not  
drugs, which developed into such a monumental scandal last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, the sport's governing body had to deny a  
published report that a Tour cyclist tested positive for a banned 
drug after the race's prologue. 
</P>
<P>
	The French sports daily L'Equipe said one of four riders tested  
was found to have taken corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs 
that are not classed as steroids but are banned, except when used 
for legitimate medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	That charge was denied by the International Cycling Union.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was not one positive case,'' UCI spokesman Enrico  
Carpani said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Pull Back; Dow Down 78.51 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today amid rising interest  
rates and a mixed batch of second-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 78.51 at 11,108.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were modestly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 6.83 at 1,389.03, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 4.24 at 2,738.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices tumbled today, with the 30-year Treasury bond  
dropping 1/2 point in price, pushing its yield up to 6.08 percent, 
from 6.04 percent late Wednesday. The rising yield served as a 
reminder to investors that higher interest rates are taking hold in 
the buoyant economy, and could threaten earnings in future 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages, seen as most vulnerable to interest rate  
increases, were among the big losers today. J.P. Morgan, a 
component of the Dow, fell 2 to 144. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks had risen to record levels in recent sessions, due  
largely to a strong outlook for second-quarter profits. But mixed 
earnings today helped take stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric confirmed those expectations, beating analysts'  
estimates by a penny. Its stock, which rose sharply Wednesday in 
advance of the report, slipped 1 3/4 to 116 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Airborne Freight said late Wednesday it will miss analysts'  
expectations by as much as 18 cents per share. Its shares slipped 1/8 
to 27 3/16, but other package delivery company stocks fell more 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose 1/4 to 38 1/8. Its shares had dropped in late  
trading Wednesday afternoon after a Florida jury ruled that tobacco 
makers are liable for making a defective product that causes 
emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses. The verdict, if it 
stands, is expected to cost the tobacco industry billions in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 103.2 million shares, 
ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.46 at 653.01, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.15 at 799.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.05 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.3 percent, France's 
CAC-40 was down 0.4 percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 was down just 
a few points.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. legal office, which spends its  
days considering complex matters of international law, has turned 
its attention to the New York city transit pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue concerns an advertisement on the back of the MetroCard

<HEADLINE> Mormon Humor? Get Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A new book of Mormon humor? The very idea  
draws horselaughs from some members of the faith known for its 
seriousness and sobriety. Yet it's true -- and the publisher is The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried hard not to offend anybody,'' said Jack Lyon,  
managing editor of church-owned Deseret Book, which released 
``Best-Loved Humor of the LDS People'' this spring. ``We did select 
things people could use if giving a talk in church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An example:  
</P>
<P>
	``Question: How are bishops chosen?  
</P>
<P>
	``Answer: The stake leaders find the most righteous, spiritual,  
most loved person in the ward -- and then they call her husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, this is not comedy club stuff. But it's heading in the right  
direction, say those who want to show there's fun beneath the 
faith's buttoned-down image. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kirby, considered by many the preeminent Mormon humorist  
today, thought for years that most of his fellow believers were a 
pretty pinched lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I equated Mormons with the way they behaved in church,'' said  
Kirby, a humor columnist for The Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	This was, after all, the church whose canonical Doctrine and  
Covenants states: ``Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, 
from all laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your 
pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby continued: ``I operated on the premise that church was a  
place where humorless people go. I misinterpreted reverence for 
humorlessness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That changed with Kirby's first foray into Mormon humor, a  
satirical column about five types of Mormons, which he wrote for a 
newspaper where he used to work. Though his Mormon publisher hated 
it, the column brought a flood of letters from church members who 
loved it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby felt like a miner cracking his shins on the mother lode.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised that Mormons, particularly -- I know Jewish  
people do it and Catholics to a large extent -- used humor to make 
their lot in life a little more tolerable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the depth of it was even more surprising, because you get  
people who are very staunch members of the church who laugh about 
the inconsistencies or the vagaries in our behavior and the 
mysteries of the gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, they are able to laugh at themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	Psst! begins a joke that has made the rounds, though it isn't in  
the new book: How do you tell the difference between a Mormon 
wedding and a non-Mormon wedding? At the Mormon wedding, the 
bride's mother is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The punch line plays on the traditional Mormon propensity for  
large families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The really funny Mormon stuff is uniquely Mormon. It's  
something that comes from being part of the family,'' said Pat 
Bagley, political cartoonist at the Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Mormons use humor as a decompression device, ``a way to let off  
some of the pressure that builds up'' and to say things that are 
true but which, unadorned with humor, might seem heretical or mean. 
For example, he says, ``It's not politic to say 19-year-old 
missionaries are dumb,'' but it's safe to say the same thing in a 
joke or cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Elouise Bell, a retired Brigham Young University English  
professor and author of a collection of humorous essays titled 
``Only When I Laugh,'' observed: ``The essence of really good humor 
is a kind of surprise. Well, I think culturally Mormons don't like 
surprises in outward things. I mean, look at the architecture. And 
there are very few startling pronouncements made from pulpits week 
to week, year to year, decade to decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irreverent humor can be both unsettling and subversive, and its  
purveyors scorned as impious or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``A humorist is a person who thinks otherwise,'' Bell said.  
``Well, thinking otherwise can get you into trouble in any 
establishment -- in the military, in most churches, in most 
educational institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pitfalls associated with thinking otherwise were very much  
on the minds of three editors who compiled the material for 
``Best-Loved Humor of the LDS People.'' (Kirby likes to call it, 
``The Correlation Committee-Approved Humor of the LDS People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, among the dozens of examples of humor from church leaders  
there is nothing in the book from church President Gordon B. 
Hinckley, known for his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said editor Jay Parry, ``He is delightful and he is very funny.  
But it's the kind of thing that you had to have been there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby credits Hinckley with sensing that Mormonism, in the midst  
of a global expansion, needs to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you assimilate all different types of people into one  
religion?'' It's best done through tolerance and making a human 
connection, he said, ``and humor for me is the best way to do 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Broadway Shows a Go for Dec. 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The show can go on this New Year's eve, despite  
a police department recommendation that theaters stay dark on the 
last night of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to allow the signature entertainment for New York --  
Broadway -- to take place that night,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said 
Wednesday. The mayor said he first learned of the police plan from 
newspapers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department, fearing that overflowing Times Square  
crowds could create problems, said Broadway theaters should shut 
down Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a recommendation that was made to the league of  
directors, because of safety concerns,'' police spokeswoman Marilyn 
Mode said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimate some 2 million people could pack Times Square to  
ring in 2000. The theater crowd could add an additional 40,000. 
Giuliani said a more sensible plan would be to limit the number of 
people allowed into Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the risk of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in  
advance ticket sales, many theater owners said they would follow 
the police suggestion anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very, very, very congested area this  
year,'' said Lee Silver of the Shubert Organization, which operates 
16 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	But one producer, Alexander Cohen of ``Waiting in the Wings,''  
said his show would go on.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Agrees to GOP Nuke Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the most significant fallout yet from the  
controversy over Chinese espionage and lax security, Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson has agreed to a semiautonomous nuclear 
weapons agency within his department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson until this week has strongly opposed a Republican  
proposal for such an agency saying it would weaken the authority of 
future energy secretaries and create ``a new fiefdom in a 
department of fiefdoms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But under pressure from Congress -- and reportedly a strong  
signal from the White House to reach some accommodation on 
department reorganization -- Richardson has accepted creation of the 
new agency, with conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to move on this,'' Richardson told The Washington  
Post, adding that he had directed his staff to ``work with Congress 
on details to craft a bipartisan package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson could not be reached late Wednesday for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	However, an Energy Department official, who spoke on condition  
of anonymity, said Richardson ``has agreed to the notion of a 
semiautonomous nuclear agency'' headed by an undersecretary of 
energy and reporting to the energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship would run the  
department's three nuclear weapons laboratories and other 
facilities that maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of such an agency to oversee the weapons programs was  
first proposed by Republican Sens. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Jon 
Kyl of Arizona, and Frank Murkowski of Alaska as a way to 
strengthen security at the laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said details of the new agency must still be worked  
out in negotiations with Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was persuaded to endorse the concept of a largely  
autonomous agency when assured that the energy secretary would 
continue to have clear authority over nuclear programs, and that 
the new agency would remain accountable to department-wide 
counterintelligence and security offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican senators' proposal called for the agency to be  
largely insulated from the rest of the Energy Department and to 
have its own budget and authority over personnel mattes. Some of 
those issues remained to be worked out in negotiations, the 
department official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Richardson's acceptance of a semiautonomous agency  
represented a major step toward the first major reorganization of 
the Energy Department since it was created in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson and Republican senators have wrangled for weeks over  
how the department should be restructured in response to the 
political uproar over lax security at nuclear weapons labs and the 
alleged theft -- mostly in the 1980s -- of nuclear weapons secrets by 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson until this week had maintained that his proposal to  
strengthen counterintelligence and security, including the naming 
of retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger as ``security czar,'' was 
addressing the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	But a growing number of lawmakers -- both Republicans and  
Democrats -- have expressed concern that the department's nuclear 
weapons program needs to be made more accountable with a clearer 
chain of command under a single agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns were reinforced by the findings of the  
president's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, headed by 
former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire. The panel concluded 
that the Energy Department's ``dysfunctional bureaucracy'' was 
``incapable of reforming itself'' under its present structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, in a report requested by President Clinton, urged  
creation of a largely autonomous nuclear weapons agency within the 
department, or taking the nuclear weapons program out of the 
department altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, although still in  
the department, would consolidate control over the three nuclear 
weapons labs -- Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore -- as well 
as the Nevada nuclear test site and various nuclear material 
production and assembly plants around the country.

<HEADLINE>  Two Rookies Favored in Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Allen Doyle and Bruce Fleisher were  
walking up to the 18th hole on the final day of the Senior Tour 
qualifying school when Fleisher breathed a sign of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been a tough week and it was almost over. Doyle, though,  
saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to him, `You know, there are going to be two or three  
guys out of this tour school that are going to win over a million 
dollars and they are going to have real good years.' He said, `Why 
shouldn't that be us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a year later, Fleisher and Doyle rank 1-2 on the  
Senior Tour money list and, yes, each has made more than $1 
million. Today, they began play in the U.S. Senior Open as two of 
the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has asked me, did I expect to have done what I did?'' Doyle  
said. ``And you know, I said, `Not really.' And he pretty much 
acknowledged that he really hadn't expected to do quite as well as 
he had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither received much professional acclaim before this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, whose unorthodox swing resembles a slap shot in hockey,  
spent most of his career as an amateur before becoming, at the age 
of 47, the oldest rookie ever on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher had a nondescript career as a touring pro and even  
dropped off the tour for a few years in the 1980s to work as a club 
pro so he could make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've found new life on the Senior Tour, where younger is  
definitely better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm finally starting to have some fun this year,'' said  
Fleisher, who became eligible for the Senior Tour when he turned 50 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Hale Irwin is starting to have some fun again  
after struggling early in the year. He entered the Open with 
victories in three of his last five tournaments, including a 
seven-stroke win in the Senior Players Championship at the TPC of 
Michigan two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in 156-man field were Larry Nelson, No. 3 on the money  
list; Vicente Fernandez, last year's runner-up; Graham Marsh, 
winner of The Tradition this year; and Christy O'Connor, coming off 
a victory in the State Farm Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is being played at Des Moines Golf and Country  
Club, a 6,888-yard, par-72 layout that never before had been the 
site of a major tournament. With its undulating greens, the course 
puts a premium on approach shots and putting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be an exciting tournament,'' Fleisher  
said. ``Hopefully, no one will get so hot like Irwin did a couple 
of weeks ago and blow everybody away. He may do it again. Who 
knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't think a low number is going to be the answer this  
week,'' he said. ``I think the greens are too difficult. I don't 
know if anyone knows the greens that well to really excel at this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin said a golfer will have to master those greens to win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a significant test for all of us,'' he said.  
``I think ... a good majority of the test will come around the 
greens -- not terribly unlike the U.S. Open this year where a good 
bit of the test was around the greens. I think we will see much the 
same here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Handling the course also will require patience, Doyle said. With  
72 holes to play, he said there's no reason to get upset over one 
or two mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to handle it properly and realize there is a long way  
to go,'' he said. ``It's not so much the guy who makes the most 
birdies that is going to win, but the guy who makes the fewest 
bogeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for that sour-looking swing, Doyle said he knows it offends  
the purists, but it works for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a kid, the club pro used to tell me, `If you can drive it  
pretty good and you've got a pretty good short game, you will be 
able to score,''' Doyle said. ```So don't ever pay attention to 
anybody that can't beat you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always have kept that to heart.''

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Hire Wittman As New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Randy Wittman has seen the NBA for 16 years as  
a player and an assistant coach, and, frankly, he thinks the league 
needs more zip. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what the Cleveland Cavaliers wanted to hear, so they  
hired the Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Wednesday as their new 
head coach, even though he's never held the top job before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stress the game needs to have more life put into  
it,'' Wittman said as he was introduced at Gund Arena. ``I think we 
need as coaches to look in the mirror a little bit and allow our 
players to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs have been searching for someone who will bring a spark  
and a more open style to their franchise after six seasons under 
former coach Mike Fratello, who was fired June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello's teams were often injury-plagued, and he was credited  
with making the most of bad situations by installing a clock-eating 
offense and tough defense. But fans got tired of watching the 
grind-it-out style, even if it meant a few more wins than losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Average game attendance dropped from 18,011 in 1994-95 to 14,120  
last season and the Cavs' postseason performances have been weak in 
recent years. Cleveland hasn't made it out of the first round of 
the playoffs since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman's plan for bringing fans back is as simple as putting  
together a team that has a good time on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to instill in them what it takes to work hard, the  
dedication to get there. But I want them -- when they cross the 
sideline -- to have fun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you can put a product on the floor that people are  
entertained with, wins and losses will take care of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavs center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, one of a few players who watched  
as Wittman was introduced during a news conference, liked what he 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting to see a new guy with new ideas come in here.  
He's got the whole team behind him,'' Ilgauskas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite never holding a head coaching position, the 39-year-old  
Wittman comes to Cleveland with some strong credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	He played on Indiana's 1981 NCAA championship team and was a  
two-time academic All-American with the Hoosiers. Indiana coach Bob 
Knight on Wednesday called Wittman one of the smartest players he 
ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a player, he had a rare understanding of just what it  
takes to win and how to go about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman was a first-round draft pick of the Washington Bullets,  
but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks before the 1983-84 season and 
played under Fratello there. He also played for Sacramento and 
Indiana and finished his nine-year NBA career averaging 7.4 points 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent the last five years as an assistant coach at  
Minnesota and also had one-year stints in Dallas and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland general manager Jim Paxson, who headed the coaching  
search, said he recommended Wittman to Cavs owner Gordon Gund 
because ``he is the coach who will be most flexible and adaptable 
with respect to both players and the NBA game as it continues to 
evolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Others with head coaching experience might be viewed by some  
as safer choices,'' he said. ``For us, Randy Wittman is the right 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson would not disclose the length of Wittman's contract or  
how much he'll be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs were secretive about their coaching search until  
Wittman was introduced. Despite plans to create some excitement 
surrounding the team, the Cavs refused to reveal the names of any 
potential coaching candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wittman arrived in Cleveland on Wednesday, the Cavs sent a  
limousine to meet his plane, so he avoided reporters and fans at 
the flight gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Cowens, Del Harris and John MacLeod also interviewed for  
the Cavs job. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of Wittman is part of a continuing makeover of the  
Cavaliers organization in which well-known names are being replaced 
by a younger group. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the firing of Fratello, known as the ``Czar of  
Telestrator'' for his television commentary work, newly elected 
Hall of Famer Wayne Embry has stepped aside as general manager in 
favor of Paxson. 
</P>
<P>
	And last week's draft saw the Cavs make two other moves which  
could change their look on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to trade up in the first round to get Miami of Ohio's  
Wally Szczerbiak, Cleveland took Utah point Andre Miller and Duke 
guard Trajan Langdon -- a pair who could potentially challenge 
Brevin Knight and Derek Anderson for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota wound up with Szczerbiak and the two players Wittman  
thought the Timberwolves would get in the first round -- Miller and 
Langdon -- went to the Cavs. Wittman said he's ``ecstatic'' with 
Cleveland's draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson was simultaneously preparing for the draft as he looked  
for a coach. He recommended Wittman to Gund just before the draft, 
and the former assistant met with Gund last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gund said he was impressed with Wittman's straightforward manner  
and potential as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely, positively certain we ended up with the  
best choice,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Two Rookies Favored in Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Allen Doyle and Bruce Fleisher were  
walking up to the 18th hole on the final day of the Senior Tour 
qualifying school when Fleisher breathed a sign of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been a tough week and it was almost over. Doyle, though,  
saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to him, `You know, there are going to be two or three  
guys out of this tour school that are going to win over a million 
dollars and they are going to have real good years.' He said, `Why 
shouldn't that be us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a year later, Fleisher and Doyle rank 1-2 on the  
Senior Tour money list and, yes, each has made more than $1 
million. Today, they began play in the U.S. Senior Open as two of 
the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has asked me, did I expect to have done what I did?'' Doyle  
said. ``And you know, I said, `Not really.' And he pretty much 
acknowledged that he really hadn't expected to do quite as well as 
he had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither received much professional acclaim before this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, whose unorthodox swing resembles a slap shot in hockey,  
spent most of his career as an amateur before becoming, at the age 
of 47, the oldest rookie ever on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher had a nondescript career as a touring pro and even  
dropped off the tour for a few years in the 1980s to work as a club 
pro so he could make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've found new life on the Senior Tour, where younger is  
definitely better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm finally starting to have some fun this year,'' said  
Fleisher, who became eligible for the Senior Tour when he turned 50 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Hale Irwin is starting to have some fun again  
after struggling early in the year. He entered the Open with 
victories in three of his last five tournaments, including a 
seven-stroke win in the Senior Players Championship at the TPC of 
Michigan two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in 156-man field were Larry Nelson, No. 3 on the money  
list; Vicente Fernandez, last year's runner-up; Graham Marsh, 
winner of The Tradition this year; and Christy O'Connor, coming off 
a victory in the State Farm Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is being played at Des Moines Golf and Country  
Club, a 6,888-yard, par-72 layout that never before had been the 
site of a major tournament. With its undulating greens, the course 
puts a premium on approach shots and putting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be an exciting tournament,'' Fleisher  
said. ``Hopefully, no one will get so hot like Irwin did a couple 
of weeks ago and blow everybody away. He may do it again. Who 
knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't think a low number is going to be the answer this  
week,'' he said. ``I think the greens are too difficult. I don't 
know if anyone knows the greens that well to really excel at this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin said a golfer will have to master those greens to win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a significant test for all of us,'' he said.  
``I think ... a good majority of the test will come around the 
greens -- not terribly unlike the U.S. Open this year where a good 
bit of the test was around the greens. I think we will see much the 
same here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Handling the course also will require patience, Doyle said. With  
72 holes to play, he said there's no reason to get upset over one 
or two mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to handle it properly and realize there is a long way  
to go,'' he said. ``It's not so much the guy who makes the most 
birdies that is going to win, but the guy who makes the fewest 
bogeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for that sour-looking swing, Doyle said he knows it offends  
the purists, but it works for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a kid, the club pro used to tell me, `If you can drive it  
pretty good and you've got a pretty good short game, you will be 
able to score,''' Doyle said. ```So don't ever pay attention to 
anybody that can't beat you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always have kept that to heart.''

</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD (AP) -- Iraq has invited foreign companies to exhibit gas  
and oil technology at a trade fair in Baghdad in September, Oil 
Ministry officials said Wednesday. Iraq is bracing itself for a 
possible lifting of U.N. curbs on foreign investment in its oil 
industry. Iraq already has U.N. authorization to spend $300 million 
every six months on oil industry investment. The expenditure is 
allowed under the oil-for-food program which enables Iraq to sell 
limited amounts of oil and spend the proceeds on food and 
humanitarian goods. 

</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq's oil managers are squeezing more  
barrels from existing wells using water injection techniques that 
will ultimately lower total yields, according to a report from U.N. 
oil industry consultants released Wednesday, Dow Jones News 
reports. Production may continue to increase in the near-term 
provided badly needed chemicals and equipment on order by Baghdad 
are approved for export by the U.N., according to the report. But, 
the long-term impact is likely to be lower yields and the premature 
closing of many wells. 

</P>
<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- Kuwait is inviting foreign investors to attend a  
forum early next year on business opportunities, a newspaper 
reported Wednesday. The move is the latest in a series of steps to 
open up the economy in the face of lower oil prices and the 
lingering effects of the 1990-91 Gulf crisis when Kuwait was 
occupied by Iraq. Trade and Commerce Minister Hisham al-Otaibi said 
the forum, Kuwait 2000, would take place Feb. 5-24. ``We have 
plenty of funds,'' the newspaper quoted the minister as saying. 
``All we need from foreign investors is to transfer technologies 
and to train the national work force, in addition to their 
experience in advanced management and marketing.'' 

</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With the price of oil flirting with $20 a barrel  
for the first time in 19 months, energy companies are beginning to 
spend more freely on exploration but are being cautious before 
reversing thousands of layoffs. As prices sank toward $10 a barrel 
late last year, the oil industry tightened its belt in a harsh 
retrenchment that slashed payrolls and cut budgets. In Texas alone, 
14,200 jobs in the industry were eliminated since May 1998, 
according to state labor officials. 

</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Energy companies are greeting the news  
that crude oil futures surged above $20 a barrel for the first time 
in 19 months as a sign they can get back to work in Texas. Prices 
rose Tuesday before settling slightly lower on continuing efforts 
by world oil producers to cut output. ``The situation is looking 
better for oil and gas prices,'' Louis Baldwin, a senior vice 
president for Cross Timbers Oil Co., told the Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram in today's editions. 

</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc. and  
Brazil's Petrobras will jointly search and drill for oil on the 
continental shelf near Rio, the Brazilian company announced today. 
The companies are expected tomrrow to sign two contracts worth a 
reported $1.5 billion for exploration and production in the Campos 
Basin, which now produces more than half of Brazil's petroleum, a 
Petrobras spokeswoman said. Each company will own 42.5 percent of 
the venture, but Texaco will be the operator, the spokeswoman said. 
Japanese group Nissho Iwai Corp. holds a 12.75 percent stake and 
Brazil's Odebrecht has the rest.

<P>
	TORONTO (CP) -- A steep jump in gasoline prices across Canada  
this week may have felt to motorists like a punch from the pumps, 
but the petroleum industry is calling it well-justified relief. It 
took half an hour for gas prices to jump to 60 cents a litre from 
50 cents in the Toronto area Tuesday, with the rest of Ontario 
following overnight. The increases varied across the country, but 
most drivers from Victoria to Halifax are now paying more to fill 
up. 

</P>
<P>
	GRANDE PRAIRIE, Alberta (AP) -- A judge Wednesday ordered the  
leader of a Christian commune and another commune member to stand 
trial in connection with a series of sabotage attacks on oil and 
gas installations in northwestern Alberta. Wiebo Ludwig, a former 
evangelical preacher who moved his extended family from Ontario to 
Alberta 13 years ago, has been the chief suspect for more than a 
year as police investigated some 160 incidents of sabotage and 
vandalism since 1996. 

</P>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Arco Alaska Inc. said Tuesday it has  
discovered a 50-million barrel oil field just north of its Alpine 
field on the North Slope. The Fiord field contains two oil zones 
that appear to be capable of producing at least 2,500 barrels of 
crude a day, Arco said in a news release. The Alpine field is about 
50 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. It contains at least 365 million 
barrels of recoverable oil, and Arco expects it to produce at least 
40,000 barrels a day when it begins operating next year. That 
should increase to 70 thousand barrels a day in 2001. 

</P>
<P>
	NEW CASTLE, Pa. (AP) -- The Amish residents of Mercer and  
northern Lawrence counties are forbidden from using natural gas 
from wells drilled on their property, but they are quietly 
benefitting from them in another way. In a link with modern society 
that has some Amish leaders concerned, landowners have allowed more 
than 200 wells to be drilled over the last decade, banking on 
monthly gas company checks that can top $600 per well. 

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Futures prices for refined oil products rose  
Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid expectations 
that a weekly report would show a drop in U.S. inventories. 
However, crude prices edged lower a day after spiking above $20 a 
gallon for the first time in 19 months. The contract for August 
delivery of light sweet crude oil settled at $19.77 per barrel, 
down 1 cent. But unleaded gasoline for delivery in August settled 
at 59.17 cents a gallon, gaining 0.69 cent, while home heating oil 
for delivery in August settled at 50.08 cents a gallon, up 0.70 
cent. 

</P>
<P>
	ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Saudi Defense Minister  
Prince Sultan arrived here Wednesday as part of a Gulf tour that 
will also take him to Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. The four-day 
regional tour is meant to further consolidate ties between the Gulf 
nations, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Ties between Saudi Arabia 
and the Emirates deteriorated last month over improved relations 
between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Monte Wants Tyson, Who Doesn't? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Heavyweights, good, bad and mediocre, used to hope to get a  
fight against Mike Tyson because it got them attention and their 
biggest paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they want Tyson, not only for the celebrity and the money,  
but because his iron cloak of intimidation turns out to be made of 
cloth. 
</P>
<P>
	One who wants to fight Tyson when the former undisputed champion  
comes back yet again, probably in October, is Monte Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike ought to give me an opportunity, just like someone gave  
him an opportunity,'' Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	It, however, is not going to happen for the 28-year-old New  
Yorker with a 20-0 record and a gift of gab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not now,'' said Shelly Finkel, a Tyson advisor. ``Monte's a  
sweet kid. I know him, but it's too early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it is. Barrett didn't turn pro until he was 25, and he  
could use seasoning against tougher competition than he has yet 
met. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Francois Botha proved Tyson, who turned 33  
June 30, is very vulnerable at this stage of his career. Botha got 
knocked out by a perfect right-hand punch in the fifth round Jan. 
16, but until then he made Tyson look small and slow. 
</P>
<P>
	So it might not be good business at this time to match a hungry  
fighter, who is 6-foot-3 and a good athlete, against Tyson, who 
cannot afford to lose. Nor can the money men behind him afford to 
have him lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Tyson, Barrett also has a promotional deal with America  
Presents. The promoter, of course, has a lot more money tied up in 
Tyson, who also has deals with Showtime and the MGM Grand at Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The affable Barrett, married with three children, took up boxing  
at age 21 and says he'll be out of it by age 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to have more kids and I want to enjoy life,'' Barrett  
said. Once into boxing, however, a lot of guys have had trouble 
getting out. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett competed in basketball, baseball, gymnastics (floor  
exercises) and football at John Adams High School in Queens and was 
a good enough linebacker to be offered scholarships to Grambling, 
East Carolina and Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a Prop 48 and I went Westchester Community College for a  
year,'' Barrett said. ``Then they dropped football and I dropped 
out and went to work full time in construction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day Barrett was lifting weights, he said, ``and this guy was  
hustling guys in the gym, telling them give me $15 a day, I'll 
teach you how to box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett started in amateur boxing under 83-year-old trainer Al  
Davis, who, with Jimmy Glenn, trains him as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	After posting a 37-3 record, with 24 knockouts, Barrett turned  
pro in September 1996 under the management of Joe DeGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he was preparing to become a pro, he was introduced  
to promoter Don King. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said King offered him a $70,000-$80,000 contract, a  
condo and a salary of $900 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the length of the contract, Barrett said, ``Forever.''  
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said that on his wedding day June 7, 1995, King flew him  
to Ohio to meet Tyson at his boxing camp at Orwell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about people we know and about boxing,'' Barrett  
said of the meeting. ``We played basketball. He was putting dents 
in the backboard, but they (the shots) weren't going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shot Monte Barrett wants is one at Tyson in the ring.

<HEADLINE> FAA Proposes Fining Boeing $392,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed  
fining Boeing Co. $392,000 for allegedly failing to report a safety 
problem on 757 jetliners until a year after it was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA says Boeing failed to report the problem within 24  
hours, as required by federal rules. Boeing, however, contends it 
wasn't clear until much later that the problem was serious enough 
to fall under that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In another safety matter, Boeing shut down all overhead cranes  
in part of its Renton assembly plant after an operator found a 
15-inch crack in a rail used to transfer the massive cranes from 
one section of the building to another. 
</P>
<P>
	The crack was spotted Tuesday evening in the plant's 4-20  
building, the same part of the plant where crane operator Dean 
Morris of Des Moines fell to his death June 10. A preliminary 
investigation indicated that Morris' crane ran off the end of its 
track when a mechanism designed to stop it was stuck in the open 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokeswoman Shannon Myers said the latest problem was not  
related to the June accident. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Thursday that Boeing was testing the cranes and they  
would not be returned to production work until the company was sure 
they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem in 757 fuel systems was fixed three years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	If the civil penalty is imposed, it would be the second time  
Boeing was fined over the same manufacturing defect. Last year, the 
company paid a $130,000 fine for failing to properly install 
emergency fuel shutoff valves near 757 engines. 
</P>
<P>
	In a notification sent to the company June 17, the FAA contends  
Boeing discovered the defect in late May 1995, but did not report 
it to the FAA until June 21, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing contends that it wasn't until that later date that it  
determined there was a possible hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we knew we had a potential safety issue, we reported that  
within 24 hours,'' company spokeswoman Yvonne Leach said Wednesday. 
She said the company will seek an informal hearing to dispute the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine concerns the misalignment of emergency fuel-shut-off  
valves for the two engines on 757 airplanes manufactured from 1992 
until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1996, the FAA issued an urgent airworthiness directive  
for operators to inspect and fix the valves on 236 of the planes. 
It cited the potential for a shutoff valve to fail and continue 
sending fuel from the wing tank to an engine in the event of an 
engine fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing traced the problem to a tool in the 757 factory in Renton  
that was used to measure alignment during assembly. The tool was 
replaced and a new alignment test adopted.

<HEADLINE> Navy May Restore Ties to Tailhook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight years after the Tailhook scandal of  
drunken escapades and sexual abuse rocked the Navy and forced 
changes in its treatment of women, Navy leaders are considering 
restoring official recognition to the aviators group that was host 
for the debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehabilitating the Tailhook Association is a remaining piece of  
``unfinished business'' in the Navy's effort to put the scandal 
behind it, Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that the Tailhook episode is an ``emotional  
and sensitive issue,'' Johnson said he is weighing only the 
practical question of whether Tailhook belongs back in the Navy 
fold as an organization meant to foster camaraderie and 
professional enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seriously at work with the leadership of the Tailhook  
Association, working to make sure that we've learned the lessons we 
needed to learn -- which we have -- and that we've institutionalized 
those lessons,'' Johnson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The admiral said he would make a recommendation to Navy  
Secretary Richard Danzig shortly. Other Navy officials, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said the intention is to sanction a modest 
level of official Navy participation in the 1999 Tailhook 
convention, scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Sparks, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonny McClung, a retired Navy captain who has been president of  
the Tailhook Association since 1995, said in an interview Thursday, 
``We think the timing is right'' to get back in the Navy's good 
graces. His organization, named for the hook on an aircraft carrier 
that snags an arresting cable on incoming planes, has about 10,000 
members -- down from its 1991 peak of about 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its annual conventions, which include professional  
seminars, the group sponsors college scholarships for children of 
former naval aviators and publishes a magazine on carrier aviation 
called Hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson attended the September 1991 convention of Tailhook  
members at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel but was never touched by the 
scandal, which triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. 
Lawrence Garrett and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, 
then the chief of naval operations. It also led to lawsuits, 
multiple investigations and a long-lasting black eye for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1991 the Navy ended all support ``in any manner  
whatsoever, direct or indirect'' for Tailhook. For several years 
afterward, the Senate required that it be informed of any Tailhook 
participation by any Navy or Marine Corps officer whose nomination 
for promotion was before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he has great confidence that Tailhook's new leaders  
will set the right course.

	``I'm looking at the organization itself, what their vision is,  
what their commitment is, how they view themselves as we go into 
the 21st century, and what that means for the United States Navy,'' 
Johnson added. If the organization has really changed its ways, 
``then I would be in a position to support it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear how Congress will react, although Sen. John  
Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wrote to 
Danzig on March 31 urging a restoration of official ties to 
Tailhook. He said it would boost morale and help encourage pilots 
to stay in the Navy and Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Duff Campbell, of the National Women's Law Center and an  
expert on issues involving women in the military, said in an 
interview she has mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing for them to say it won't happen again, but are  
they treating women aviators with welcoming arms?'' she said. If 
the organization is sincerely committed to supporting women fliers, 
and not just men, then it probably will be beneficial to restore 
official Navy recognition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any discussion of Tailhook is bound to recall the debauchery of  
the 1991 convention in Las Vegas, for which the Defense Department 
Inspector General implicated 117 officers for sexual assault, 
indecent exposure and other acts, and faulted the Navy's leaders 
for failing to stop the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Navy careers were ruined by the scandal although no one was  
court-martialed.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Special units of the U.S. Army based  
in Panama have helped train Nicaraguan mine-sniffing dogs, a 
Nicaraguan military source said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-week training program cost $500,000 and is the first part  
of a project that includes further canine training at a cost of $2 
million, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The army planted about 135,000 land mines, mostly along  
Nicaragua's northern border with Honduras, during the 1980s civil 
war to try to prevent U.S.-supported Contra rebels from crossing 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the mines have been deactivated during the past five  
years with the assistance of the Organization of American States, 
as well as European and Latin American governments. But experts 
believe about 70,000 mines have not been defused.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Mexico City government and the federal  
government have signed an agreement to put more money toward 
anti-crime programs, local media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, the federal government will provide  
$49 million for new prisons, better police training, a more 
sophisticated computer system and better telecommunications 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-crime efforts in the nation's capital had been stymied  
since opposition Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' landslide election in 
1997, when the federal government reduced funding to cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, a popular television entertainer was killed in  
a gang-style execution, and two members of President Ernesto 
Zedillo's elite presidential guard were gunned down during a street 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico is also putting almost 5,000 military policemen into its  
new civilian federal police force.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru on Thursday passed a law that effectively  
blocks exiled former President Alan Garcia from running for a 
legislative seat in next year's general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	A new law approved by Congress prohibits Peruvians who face  
pending court cases from running for public office. A prior law 
only blocked those convicted of crimes from running. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, 50, governed Peru from 1985 to 1990, leaving the economy  
in shambles with annual inflation topping 7,000 percent and a wave 
of car bombs by leftist rebels that rocked the capital, Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	He was later charged with corruption while in office and fled  
Peru in 1992. He was declared a fugitive from justice by a Peruvian 
court in 1996 and an arrest warrant is still pending in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia lives in Paris. He has said he wants to return to  
Peruvian politics.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Succes Overwhelming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Title IX. The 1996 Olympics. The WNBA.  
</P>
<P>
	And now the Women's World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	All have been major steps in the progression of women's sports  
in the United States. Marla Messing, who has overseen the 
phenomenal success of the soccer tournament that concludes 
Saturday, isn't about to forget that. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither are the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing the impact of Title IX on the field,'' Messing  
said Wednesday. ``Not on the organization of the tournament, but on 
who is playing for the United States. These are Title IX babies. 
They are reaping the benefits of the legislation that has enabled 
them to play soccer their whole lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, when Title IX was passed in 1972, requiring that women  
be allowed to participate in athletics in the same proportion as 
their share of a school's undergraduate student body, exactly half 
of the U.S. team had been born. All of them would prosper from the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Title IX opened up opportunities for girls to play sports  
through college,'' Brandi Chastain said. ``By getting those 
opportunities, we've been able to show young girls that they can do 
what we have done, that the chance to do it is there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The '96 Olympics also contributed to the success of the World  
Cup. The biggest American stars in the Atlanta Games were the 
basketball, soccer and softball players and the gymnasts. The 
Olympics proved there was an audience for women's sports, and this 
tournament cultivated that audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest success story emanating from the achievements in  
Atlanta has been the WNBA, and Messing believes the basketball 
league has aided the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WNBA helped us be successful by showing the way as a  
(professional women's) league,'' she said. ``Hopefully our success 
will help other women's sports be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like a cultural shift, and the way the tournament  
caught fire, we've tipped into something. We think this will be a 
seminal moment, that people will look back in 20 years and say, 
`That event is responsible for the development of women's 
sports.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. But everyone involved in this event, which has sold  
more than 650,000 tickets and grabbed headlines in this nation 
rarely reserved for soccer, realizes the 1999 tournament could be 
an aberration. They don't want to believe it, but they can't ignore 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a hard act to follow, it is an impossible act to  
follow,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``We shouldn't be so 
foolish as to think this will happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the soccer community can build on what Messing and her  
co-workers have accomplished, which is remarkable in itself. 
Unquestionably, this has been the most successful women's sports 
events ever staged. Organizers spent more than $30 million, but 
will make a tidy profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, women's soccer has established itself as a  
coming sport -- perhaps not in countries where cultural and societal 
limitations are placed on what women can achieve, but certainly in 
many of the nations that participated. Led by the United States, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a stupendous tournament,'' Cooper said. ``It's the  
level of enthusiasm, which is partly due to the success of the 
American team and the media reaction. If others are smart, they 
should think this stuff is hot and learn from USA '99 and see how 
the game has gained respectability and popularity.''

<HEADLINE> Police in Calif. To Be Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have opened a sweeping  
civil rights probe of the Riverside Police Department, which is 
already under investigation in the shooting death of a black woman 
who was seemingly dazed, a gun in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Thursday its investigation will  
determine whether the department ``has engaged in a pattern or 
practice of law enforcement misconduct, including using excessive 
force and discriminating in the way it provides police services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant U.S. attorney general, said the  
police department has pledged to cooperate fully. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Jerry Carroll said he believes the review will  
confirm the department ``neither practices nor condones 
unprofessional behavior or racial discrimination in any form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not discuss the specific complaints that led to  
the probe but said they involved incidents in the city 60 miles 
east of Los Angeles before and after the December shooting of 
Tyisha Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating 10 police departments  
nationwide, including those in New York City and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The department can seek court orders requiring police  
departments to address any problems found. 
</P>
<P>
	The new probe is in addition to a federal civil rights  
investigation into the Dec. 28 shooting of Ms. Miller, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found her apparently unconscious in a locked car parked  
at a gas station. Four white officers fired 23 bullets at her, 
hitting her 12 times, when she suddenly reached for the gun after 
an officer broke into her car to remove the weapon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverside County district attorney criticized the officers'  
tactics but decided there was no criminal intent. That decision has 
prompted repeated demonstrations in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have been notified that the police chief intends to  
fire them. Their lawyer claims they are being made scapegoats.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Up; 30-Yr. Yield Under 6 Pct. / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices rose sharply Thursday, nudging  
the yield on the bellwether 30-year bond back below 6 percent, 
after a smaller-than-expected sale of corporate bonds buoyed demand 
for U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32 point, or  
$7.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.99 percent from Wednesday's 6.04 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices headed lower earlier this week as investors braced  
for a slew of corporate bond sales, expecting up to $7.5 billion in 
bonds from Ford Motor Co. and its financing unit. Demand for 
corporate bonds tends to lower demand for government bonds because 
corporate offerings generally have higher yields. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford sold only $6.5 billion in bonds on Thursday, spurring  
some investors to buy U.S. Treasury securities instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping bond prices was a rebound in bonds on the European  
market, which opens before the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term securities  
rose 3/32 point to 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities rose 9/32 
point to 13/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to  
4.65 percent while the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.53 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields rose to 4.71 percent, as the discount rose 0.01  
percentage point to 4.54 percent. One-year yields fell to 4.98 
percent as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.94 percent from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 7/32 point to 118 3/4. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.54 percent from 5.55 percent late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Northwestern Coach Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Three days before he was gunned down in  
front of two of his children, former Northwestern University 
basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong talked with his minister about 
violence in society. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'I would hate to live in a neighborhood where you'd  
have to worry about being killed,''' Pastor Lyle Q. Foster told 
more than 1,600 mourners who gathered Wednesday to remember 
Byrdsong. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, who was 43, was shot last Friday near his home in  
suburban Skokie. Authorities said he was killed by white 
supremacist Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, whose two-state shooting 
rampage left another man dead and nine wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners -- family, friends, neighbors and others whose lives  
were touched by Byrdsong -- squeezed into the First Presbyterian 
Church sanctuary or sat outside and listened to the service on 
loudspeakers as Byrdsong was remembered as a devoted family man who 
inspired others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our coach, he's gone,'' said Pastor Hamon Cross of Rosedale  
Park Baptist Church in Detroit. ``But the game is not over. Evil 
will not win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Byrdsong's tragic death should inspire others to fight  
hatred and racial intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said they were drawn to the service by outrage over the  
circumstances of Byrdsong's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Evanston resident Kathleen Murphy stood outside the church with  
a sign that read, ``Stop the Violence Please'' in English, Japanese 
and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put a message on the World Wide Web asking for translations  
and within hours I got response from Russia, Israel, California and 
Australia,'' Murphy said. ``This tragedy meant something to people 
all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mourners were several Orthodox Jews, who traveled to  
Evanston by bus. Authorities said Smith began his attacks by 
wounding six Orthodox Jews in the Chicago community of Rogers Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it was important to come,'' said Harlan Loeb, a civil  
rights lawyer with the Anti-Defamation League. ``I'm here, in part, 
become some of the people shot at were my friends. But we all are 
here because we have deep sympathies for Ricky's wife and 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners who came from across the country testified to the fact  
that the former coach's reach far exceeded the boundaries of the 
basketball court, said Pastor Tom Nesbitt from Life Action Ministry 
in Buchanan, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forget the court. Forget the playing field. Ricky, you were an  
impact player in life,'' Nesbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former basketball players, coaches and athletic  
directors -- including Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany, University 
of Arizona basketball coach Lute Olsen and NBA players Steve Kerr 
and B.J. Armstrong -- were in attendance. Kerr and Armstrong also 
were pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Webber, the former Northwestern University president who  
hired Byrdsong, recalled Byrdsong enthusiastically discussing his 
plan to work with youths in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of coaches would say that, but Ricky meant it,'' Webber  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Foster pledged to complete one of Byrdsong's unfinished  
projects, a book titled ``Coaching Your Kids in the Game of Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isaiah McKinnon, a professor at the University of Detroit who  
served on the committee that hired Byrdsong to coach at that school 
in 1988, recalls informing Byrdsong of his father's death after the 
job interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had such dignity and composure at such a terrible time,''  
he said. ``I knew we did the right thing in hiring him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong went from Detroit to Northwestern, where he took the  
Wildcats to only their second postseason basketball appearance in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled an 87-165 overall record as a head coach, including  
34-78 in four seasons at Northwestern. He was fired with seven 
games left in the 1996-97 season, effective at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrdsong, who was working for an insurance company, is survived  
by his wife, Sherialyn, and three children. His body will be 
transported to his hometown of Atlanta for services and burial, 
scheduled for Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes On Salmon Issue in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Campaigning in the Northwest, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush says Pacific Coast salmon should be protected, but 
not at the expense of dams on the Snake River. 
</P>
<P>
	An environmental group, American Rivers, has identified the  
Snake River as the most endangered river in the nation, reporting 
that its fish population has dropped by 90 percent since four dams 
were constructed in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	At a brief news conference after his arrival Wednesday night at  
Spokane International Airport, the Republican presidential 
front-runner was asked about the salmon issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important for us to protect the fish, but I  
think we can do so in a way that doesn't cause the dams to have to 
be breached,'' he said. ``I understand how significant the dams 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to complete a study next  
year on whether breaching the dams is the best way to help the 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	While environmentalists say that removing the earthen portions  
of the four dams would allow water and salmon to flow freely past 
them, industry groups say the move would also render the dams 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush planned a breakfast address this morning to about 700  
people who paid $20 each to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not intended to be a fund-raiser,'' Bush press  
secretary Mindy Tucker said. ``It's to let the people in Spokane 
know why he is running, his philosophy of compassionate 
conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fund-raiser was arranged for later in the day, at the  
Seattle-area home of telecommunications tycoon Craig McCaw. That 
event was expected to raise at least $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, on his first swing through Washington, is hoping his  
presidential bid is better received than the campaigns of his 
father in the Evergreen State. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush lost Washington's electoral votes in the  
1988 and 1992 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle visit has created a bit of controversy, since Bush  
declined an invitation to speak before a national conference of 
minority journalists. His office issued a statement saying he was 
too busy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we are not able to schedule everything on this  
first trip,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democratic candidates -- Vice President Al Gore and former  
Sen. Bill Bradley -- both agreed to address the Unity '99 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 53, has collected the endorsements of many top Republican  
leaders during this western swing. On Wednesday, a six-pack of GOP 
governors -- from Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah 
-- endorsed him in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking in Spokane, Bush was to fly to Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to talk to 200 kids about the perils of the  
Internet and then meet with Microsoft executives at the software 
giant's suburban campus before the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has called for freeing Internet sales from  
duties and tariffs. He also supports a permanent federal 
research-and-development tax credit and has pledged not to raise 
federal personal or corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has also proposed intensifying efforts to combat  
intellectual piracy and supports raising the limit on the number of 
highly skilled workers allowed into the country under so-called 
H-1B visas.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Offers Youth High-Tech Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton, ending a four-day tour  
of poverty pockets from Appalachia to Watts, on Thursday called for 
investment in the ``human capital'' living in impoverished areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve a chance to be whatever they're willing to work  
hard to be,'' Clinton said. ``Unless we're prepared to do that, 
even our best efforts to bring new investment to these distressed 
communities will be less than fully successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made the remarks at the annual conference of the  
National Academy Foundation, an organization launched in 1982 by 
Citigroup chief Sanford Weill to help prepare disadvantaged 
high-school youths for careers in finance, tourism and other 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Weill, Lucent Technologies and other companies announced an $8  
million initiative Thursday to create ``Information Technology 
Academies'' to begin training some of the same boys and girls for 
careers in the high-technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4 million people ages 16 to 24 are out of school  
and lack a high school diploma. Clinton argued that the best way to 
ensure continued economic growth was to invest in them and the 
areas where they live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government cannot do this alone, but business cannot be  
expected to go it alone,'' he said. ``We can build one America 
where nobody is left behind when we cross that bridge into a new 
century -- and when we do, we'll all be better off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In visits this week to a Kentucky coal-mining town, the  
Mississippi Delta, East St. Louis, Ill., a South Dakota Indian 
reservation, the Latino community of Phoenix and the riot-scarred 
neighborhoods of South Los Angeles, Clinton called for public and 
private investment in areas that haven't shared in the booming 
econonmy. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the fourth day of a tour he called a ``remarkable ride''  
he focused on investing in the people -- not just the industry and 
infrastructure -- in the nation's impoverished communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is a big issue,'' he said. ``But there's another kind of

<HEADLINE> Japanese Steel Co. Faulte U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's largest steel company today criticized a  
U.S. International Trade Commission ruling that Japanese companies 
have dumped stainless steel products in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Steel Corp., which often acts on behalf of the nation's  
steel industry, called the decision ``extremely regrettable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it had offered its maximum cooperation in the  
ITC's investigation by submitting detailed data, including domestic 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In its final ruling, issued Wednesday, the ITC found that  
stainless steel imports from Japan and seven other nations had 
substantially hurt the U.S. steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and  
Industry said the ministry will fully assess the contents of the 
ruling papers as to whether the ITC's judgment was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's ruling came after the Brazilian and the U.S.  
government struck a deal in a separate case hours before its 
midnight Tuesday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil agreed to reduce shipments of a core steel product by  
nearly a third to avoid punitive tariffs from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the U.S. Commerce Department declared that Japan had  
illegally dumped hot-rolled carbon steel, a common steel product, 
in U.S. markets at up to 68 percent below the fair value. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the U.S. industry won tariffs of as much as 67  
percent on Japanese hot-rolled shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry filed a dumping complaint against  
Japanese competitors after their U.S. sales jumped last year to 2 1/2 
times the 1997 level.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Some past Supreme Court rulings on police work:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Carroll vs. U.S., 1925: Law enforcement officers can search  
cars and other vehicles without court warrants if they reasonably 
believe they will find evidence of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Miranda vs. Arizona, 1966: Police who intend to question  
criminal suspects in custody must first warn them of their rights 
to remain silent and to have a lawyer present, and tell them a 
lawyer will be appointed for them if they can't afford one. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terry vs. Ohio, 1968: Police who don't have ``probable cause''  
to arrest someone but have a ``reasonable suspicion'' of criminal 
conduct may stop and question that person. If an officer fears the 
person may be armed, a frisk search is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pennsylvania vs. Mimms, 1977: Motorists stopped for routine  
traffic violations may be ordered by police to get out of their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>

drivers routine questions and videotape their answers without 
warning them of their rights, and prosecutors may use evidence such 
as slurred responses.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Fall by 6,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week, marking the 
second consecutive drop and the lowest level in more than three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that 294,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 3 -- down by 
6,000 from the previous week. Last week's level was the lowest 
since 289,000 in the week ending March 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts had expected jobless claims to rise.  
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out  
week-to-week volatility, also was down to 299,000, the lowest level 
since April 3, when they were at 296,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless claims applications are remaining at low levels,  
which analysts say reflects an extremely tight labor market, 
something the Federal Reserve is keeping a watchful eye on. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Dexter, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said the downward  
trend in jobless benefits claims is ``suggesting that laid-off 
workers are not having a difficult time finding a new job.'' Dexter 
said ``the job market continues to look healthy'' and that 
``jobless claims are likely to be volatile in the coming weeks 
because of the 4th of July holiday and car factory shutdowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the government reported that unemployment for the  
month of June crept up to 4.3 percent and that the nation's 
businesses added 268,000 new jobs to their payrolls. Despite the 
rise in the unemployment rate, the nation's labor picture remains 
remarkably strong, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, manufacturing has lost 488,000 jobs since March 1998 to  
the global financial crisis, which has cut into exports and 
increased cheap imports into this country. The rest of the U.S. 
economy, however, has continued to steam ahead, propelled by robust 
consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Summers, who is in his first week as treasury  
secretary, said today he feels good about the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can keep our fundamentals strong and continue the  
terrific productivity improvement, I think we have got room to give 
people wage increases that run ahead of price increases and 
represent really higher standards of living,'' Summers said on 
NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said that for the week ending June 26, 29  
states and territories reported declines in jobless claims, while 
24 had increases. The state data lag a week behind the national 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest decline in applications for jobless  
benefits was Pennsylvania, down 3,844, a decrease officials 
attributed to fewer layoffs in the transportation, textile, trade 
and scientific instruments industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with large decreases were: Illinois, down 2,349;  
Wisconsin, down 1,334; Ohio, down 1,242; and Alabama, down 1,232. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in claims for the week  
ending June 26 was New Jersey, up 2,761, an increase officials 
blamed on layoffs in the construction, trade and service 
industries. Other states with big increases were: Massachusetts, up 
2,239; Kentucky, up 1,545; Connecticut, up 1,436; and New York, up 
1,288.

<HEADLINE> Feds Mull 2002 Olympics Indictments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With initial evidence-gathering completed,  
Justice Department officials have begun weighing whether to seek 
indictments in Salt Lake City's successful effort to win the 2002 
Winter Olympics, a law enforcement official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in Salt Lake City and supervisors in the  
fraud section of the criminal division here are going over the 
witness interviews and the documents and records gathered since the 
inquiry got under way early this year to see if there is enough 
evidence to support federal criminal charges, according to the 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision is imminent; the review may take some time, the  
official said. Indeed, superiors here could order the six Justice 
lawyers and FBI agents who work full time on the case in Salt Lake 
City to go back to gather more evidence. Or they could draft a 
prosecution memorandum for top-level approval and ask the federal 
grand jury in Salt Lake City to return indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	It could not be learned how many indictments might be  
considered, although the Salt Lake Tribune today put the number at 
two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have looked for evidence against both alleged  
bribers in Salt Lake City and bribe-takers on the International 
Olympic Committee, which selects the site for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said Salt Lake's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses and entertainment, 
gifts, scholarships for their children and cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four IOC members reportedly were questioned by the FBI  
in May when they attended a Coordination Commission meeting in Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. The 
former two top Salt Lake bid and organizing committee officials 
lost their jobs in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which possible charges  
investigators were focusing on. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and travel in aid of  
racketeering are among the charges that federal investigators 
looked into because they saw the case as one of commercial bribery, 
rather than the more familiar government variety, Justice officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the government usually lets private parties settle  
commercial bribery cases through civil lawsuits, federal charges 
are possible when a federal interest is involved, like the 
integrity of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The racketeering law -- known as ITAR, for interstate travel in  
aid of racketeering -- prohibits interstate and foreign travel to 
further federal or state crimes like bribery and extortion or to 
distribute their illicit proceeds. It could be used against both 
bribe-givers and takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bribe-takers also might face extortion charges, depending on the  
evidence gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have looked at whether the Salt Lake panel  
violated its tax-exempt status or whether recipients failed to pay 
any U.S. taxes due on payments. 
</P>
<P>
	And they looked at possible gun charges over the shipment out of  
the country of some rifles, pistols and other weapons given as 
gifts to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials familiar with the Foreign Corrupt Practices  
Act were involved in the investigation, but that act applies only 
to bribes paid by U.S. citizens to foreign officials to influence 
actions of their government. The International Olympic Committee is 
a private organization, not a government body. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, prosecutors must still weigh whether federal or state  
charges would be the most likely to succeed, would reach the 
largest number of potentially guilty parties, and would provide the 
most appropriate penalties.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Broaden Toxic Air Monitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency will  
broaden its work with state and local governments to monitor 
hazardous chemicals in the air and develop new plans to reduce 
toxic air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative under the 1990 Clean Air Act will focus on  
curtailing toxic air pollution in urban areas and on protecting 
``the millions of people who live in areas where concentrations of 
toxic air pollutants are too high,'' EPA Administrator Carol 
Browner said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA identified 33 toxic air pollutants, including benzene,  
mercury and PCBs, as presenting the greatest threat to public 
health. These pollutants are generally known or suspected to cause 
cancer or other serious health problems such as birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency initiative is aimed at reducing cancer risks from  
toxic chemicals in the air by 75 percent, ``substantially reduce 
noncancer risks, and address areas where low-income and minority 
communities may be disproportionately affected,'' the EPA said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The new strategy will target an additional 13 categories of  
industry for reductions in toxic chemical emissions over the next 
five years. Since 1990, the EPA has ordered reductions in toxic 
releases from refineries, chemical plants, steel mills and a number 
of other industries under separate regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new strategy outlines how EPA will work in partnership  
with state, local and tribal governments to monitor air toxic 
levels and develop plans and actions to reduce toxic air 
pollution,'' the agency said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Offers Youth High-Tech Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton, ending a four-day tour  
of poverty pockets from Appalachia to Watts, on Thursday called for 
investment in the ``human capital'' living in impoverished areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve a chance to be whatever they're willing to work  
hard to be,'' Clinton said. ``Unless we're prepared to do that, 
even our best efforts to bring new investment to these distressed 
communities will be less than fully successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made the remarks at the annual conference of the  
National Academy Foundation, an organization launched in 1982 by 
Citigroup chief Sanford Weill to help prepare disadvantaged 
high-school youths for careers in finance, tourism and other 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Weill, Lucent Technologies and other companies announced an $8  
million initiative Thursday to create ``Information Technology 
Academies'' to begin training some of the same boys and girls for 
careers in the high-technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4 million people ages 16 to 24 are out of school  
and lack a high school diploma. Clinton argued that the best way to 
ensure continued economic growth was to invest in them and the 
areas where they live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government cannot do this alone, but business cannot be  
expected to go it alone,'' he said. ``We can build one America 
where nobody is left behind when we cross that bridge into a new 
century -- and when we do, we'll all be better off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In visits this week to a Kentucky coal-mining town, the  
Mississippi Delta, East St. Louis, Ill., a South Dakota Indian 
reservation, the Latino community of Phoenix and the riot-scarred 
neighborhoods of South Los Angeles, Clinton called for public and 
private investment in areas that haven't shared in the booming 
econonmy. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the fourth day of a tour he called a ``remarkable ride''  
he focused on investing in the people -- not just the industry and 
infrastructure -- in the nation's impoverished communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is a big issue,'' he said. ``But there's another kind of  
capital that in some ways is even more fundamental -- human capital. 
People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton visited the community of Watts, scarred by riots nearly  
30 years apart, to make the case for private firms helping 
disadvantaged young people gain the skills they need for high-tech

<HEADLINE> Broadway Shows a Go for Dec. 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The show can go on this New Year's eve, despite  
a police department recommendation that theaters stay dark on the 
last night of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to allow the signature entertainment for New York --  
Broadway -- to take place that night,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said 
Wednesday. The mayor said he first learned of the police plan from 
newspapers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department, fearing that overflowing Times Square  
crowds could create problems, said Broadway theaters should shut 
down Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a recommendation that was made to the league of  
directors, because of safety concerns,'' police spokeswoman Marilyn 
Mode said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimate some 2 million people could pack Times Square to  
ring in 2000. The theater crowd could add an additional 40,000. 
Giuliani said a more sensible plan would be to limit the number of 
people allowed into Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the risk of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in  
advance ticket sales, many theater owners said they would follow 
the police suggestion anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very, very, very congested area this  
year,'' said Lee Silver of the Shubert Organization, which operates 
16 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	But one producer, Alexander Cohen of ``Waiting in the Wings,''  
said his show would go on.

	``You just drive right up and make your wagers and pay for them  
and off you go,'' Johnsen said. He promised face-to-face service, 
``no Jack in the Box speakers or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One occasional bettor, Del Solis, said he likes the idea and is  
more likely to try his luck at the drive-through. ``Sometimes I 
can't be there when the race starts so this will make it easier,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Cox, executive director of the Texas Council on Problem and  
Compulsive Gambling, said the setup might make it a bit too easy 
for compulsive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to make it an impulse reaction as opposed to  
planned activity,'' she said. ``When it is a simple act to whip in 
and buy a ticket, it takes it out of the recreational category (of) 
capturing the beauty of animals and a real sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gamblers can also cash winning tickets at the windows. For  
security reasons, the most they can collect on a ticket at the 
window is $100. They will get a voucher to pick up the rest of 
their winnings inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely through smart marketing, the 2-year-old Lone Star has  
been Texas' most successful horse track. It was the first to offer 
cash machines for gamblers and has tried to make itself family 
friendly, with a playground and picnic grounds.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Espouses Triangle Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Their confused looks said it all: some  
of the Los Angeles Lakers just don't get Phil Jackson's triangle 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, they've had only three practices under their new  
coach and most of the team is still on vacation. But the four 
Lakers from last season who showed up Thursday for Summer Pro 
League practice were befuddled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much an offense as it's just a philosophy about  
basketball,'' said fourth-year pro Travis Knight, sounding like 
he's picked up the Zenmaster's lingo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a philosophy about how the game is supposed to be played.  
I like it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean Knight understands, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while to adjust to,'' he said. ``I'm  
having a hard time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson isn't completely used to his new team, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Telling onlookers what they could expect this fall, the word  
Chicago slipped out of Jackson's mouth. ``Uh, the Lakers, excuse 
me,'' he said as the crowd laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was the most popular draw on the first day of the summer  
league that will feature entries from 12 NBA teams, including the 
Lakers, Clippers, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Milwaukee Orlando and 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach who guided the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles in  
eight years has been labeled a savior for a Los Angeles team that 
hasn't been in the NBA Finals since 1991 and was swept out of the 
playoffs the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson doesn't quite see himself that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of hopefully being the catalyst that can kind of  
grease the machinery that makes this run smoothly,'' he said. 
``It's just a leadership role I hope I can perform and fill that 
void for these players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Scottie Pippen comes from Houston to rejoin his former  
coach is up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Scottie would be interested in coming here,'' Jackson  
said. ``Houston has expressed no interest and right now we don't 
have a situation that could work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight would welcome Pippen, a veteran of the triangle offense.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would help a lot,'' Knight said. ``There's a lot of times  
when the coach can't see and tell everybody what to do. If you 
don't know what's going on, somebody can say, `Hey get over 
there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Knight, Tyronn Lue, Reuben Patterson and Sam Jacobson  
are also giving up part of their summer vacations to learn 
Jackson's system. Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice won't 
get a taste of the triangle until training camp in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have to open their minds,'' Knight said.  
``It's difficult to learn the whole concept. There's no stops, it's 
all kind of moving, moving, moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Celestand of Villanova, the Lakers' second-round draft pick  
and 30th overall, admitted he didn't have a clue about the 
triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mystery and only Phil knows,'' he said. ``There's no  
set plays. You have to read your teammates and feed off them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offense may be a puzzle, but one thing is clear: the  
individual play that defined the Lakers last season won't be 
tolerated anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get across to the players how much awareness  
it takes all the time to be part of this team,'' Jackson said. 
``You've got to constantly be aware of what you're doing, you don't 
just go through the motions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While acquiring Pippen hasn't been ruled out, don't expect  
Dennis Rodman to reappear in a Lakers uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless it's absolutely necessary for us to fill a position  
that this team has a weakness in, Dennis Rodman will not be our 
first choice,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been one reunion between Jackson and a Chicago cohort.  
Jim Cleamons, who won four NBA titles as a Bulls assistant, is 
already on board and will oversee the Lakers' summer league team. 
Jackson may still hire his other two Chicago assistants, Jimmy 
Rodgers and Tex Winter.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped Against NYC Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A police officer who shot an unarmed man trying  
to wash his windshield for a handout has been found innocent of all 
charges, including assault and reckless endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Meyer, 29, who was off-duty during last year's shooting,  
could have faced 25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Collins ruled Thursday that prosecutors failed to  
disprove Meyer's claim that he used his gun because he feared for 
his life. The victim, Antoine Reid, was shot once in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I acted appropriately,'' Meyer said. ``It was a horrible  
situation but justice prevailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who is suing the city for $100 million, said he was  
outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to do this to somebody else,'' Reid said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meyer had just left a New York Yankees game with his girlfriend  
and her young son when Reid tried to wash his car's windshield with 
a squeegee for a few coins. Meyer testified he and Reid began 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that this guy was going to do some serious damage to  
me, that he was going to kill me,'' Meyer testified. 
</P>
<P>
	But several eyewitness said Meyer was the aggressor in the  
confrontation -- that he walked forward as Reid backed away and 
shoved him across several lanes of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer still faces a police department hearing, and the police  
commissioner will decide whether Meyer stays on the force or is 
fired.

<HEADLINE> CBS Buys 35 Percent of Medscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is acquiring a 35 percent stake in  
Medscape Inc., an online provider of medical information for health 
care professionals, in exchange for $150 million worth of promotion 
over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday was the latest by CBS to expand its  
online business by exchanging ad time on its television, radio and 
outdoor advertising holdings in exchange for stakes in small 
Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the strategy has paid off handsomely as CBS partners like  
financial news provider MarketWatch.com have made successful stock 
offerings. CBS also has stakes in SportsLine USA Inc., StoreRunner 
Inc., Office.com Inc. and hollywood.com. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Medscape deal, CBS will work with the company to create a  
new health care site aimed at consumers. Currently the site is 
geared toward medical professionals, providing articles from 
medical journals, news on conferences and other information for 
doctors, nurses and other members of the health care profession. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the CBS-Medscape deal came just two days after America  
Online Inc. signed a four-year marketing alliance with a leading 
medical information site drkoop.com, which is run by former Surgeon 
General Dr. C. Everett Koop. 
</P>
<P>
	Medscape's top editor is Dr. George Lundberg, who was fired as  
editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association for 
publishing a survey of college students' sexual attitudes that 
coincided with President Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Medscape filed papers with the Securities and Exchange  
Commission to sell shares to the public, but no timetable has been 
set for an offering.

	SHARON, Mass. (AP) -- Graduation for one small group of  
eighth-graders in this suburb south of Boston has a bit of extra 
anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven girls leaving the Islamic Academy of New England are  
about to be thrust into unknown territory: public school. They are 
sure to stand out because of their traditional garb, including the 
hijab, the Muslim woman's head covering. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon the girls who chat and laugh together in Arabic and English  
will mingle with hundreds of other kids of varied races and 
religious backgrounds. And, as evidenced by a burst of embarrassed 
giggles when the subject is mentioned, they will sit side by side 
with teen-age boys. 
</P>
<P>
	They all acknowledged being fearful of the change, especially of  
being taunted for their headdress, a symbol of female modesty and 
allegiance to Islamic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of their dress, said Khoala, 14, of Braintree, ``girls  
are much easier to spot. The boys, nobody knows who they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adaweya Ead, a Jordanian-born math teacher at the academy who  
dresses traditionally, had counseled the girls about the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ead said she could empathize with the girls' anxiety, recalling  
how locals screamed epithets at her several years ago as she pumped 
gas into her car near her home in Johnston, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people scream, `Go back to your own country,' they should  
know many of us who wear the hijab are Americans,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, which opened in 1996, is one of 400 Muslim schools  
across the United States, offering religious education and a unique 
perspective on mainstream American society. 
</P>
<P>
	The founders, mostly emigrants from the Middle East and Africa,  
were tired of taunts, like those Ead received, directed at their 
children. They were also weary of misunderstandings about Islamic 
customs, such as fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, said Principal Nouredine Zettili, they were worried  
about the drugs, violence and sex they feel pervade the culture of 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``In public school, they don't teach children how to respect  
their parents and other children,'' said Zettili, an Algerian-born, 
MIT-educated physicist. ``This is very important to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with a state-mandated general curriculum, academy students  
study Arabic and the Koran. They pray daily in the direction of 
Mecca. This year's graduating class happens to be all girls, though 
there are boys in lower grades in classes with girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers use stories on the lives of Islamic prophets to present  
role models and help pupils feel connected to the more than 1 
billion Muslims worldwide, including 6 million in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon, a predominantly Jewish community near the Rhode Island  
line, has been welcoming since Muslims established a mosque here 
after an arson fire in 1990 destroyed a Quincy mosque. Plans to 
rebuild that mosque with an elementary school in Milton, which is 
near Quincy, ran into local opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the school enrolls 150 pupils in grades K-8. Their  
artwork decorates walls. Beside the front door is a display of 
``student of the month'' reports, praising academic prowess, 
neatness, attendance, kindness and ``good Islamic manners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But during a recent visit, there was no ``student of the month''  
for sixth grade. Where a child's smiling photo would have hung, 
there was a note, saying no sixth-grader had met the award's high 
standards and adding: ``We encourage all students in the sixth 
grade to strive as individuals as well as collectively to qualify 
for this award in coming months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school's annual operating budget of $500,000 comes from  
tuition, $3,000 per student, and donations from the nearby Islamic 
Center of New England, Zettili said. The academy still lacks 
computer and science labs, a gymnasium and a high school. 
</P>
<P>
	And so the eighth-graders graduate with some trepidation. Only  
two are headed to the same high school. The rest will go to their 
hometown high schools in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	They all agreed freshman year will take some getting used to,  
especially since many have had limited exposure to non-Muslims. But 
the teen-agers also pointed to several similarities between 
themselves and their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	They devour typical eighth-grade English class fare like ``The  
Diary of Anne Frank'' and the modern-day ``Zlata's Diary,'' about a 
Bosnian girl living in wartime Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
	Most enjoy shopping at the mall, reading Stephen King novels and  
seeing the movie ``Titanic.'' One even confessed to a crush on 
``X-Files'' star David Duchovny. 
</P>
<P>
	None said they expected to attend school dances or proms, a  
common restriction in observant Muslim households. 
</P>
<P>
	But in most other ways, the girls said, they hoped things would  
be normal at school. One, too shy to give her name, said she might 
try out for the freshman basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls are prepared for the adjustment, Ead said. ``What they  
have learned about themselves comes from the inside.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women held 46.6 percent of the  
professional-level staff positions in Catholic dioceses in 1998, up 
from 44.5 percent in 1995, according to a survey. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure is comparable to percentages for the overall job  
market. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says women filled 44.4 
percent of executive, administrative and managerial positions as of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, commissioned by the U.S. bishops' Committee on Women  
in Society and the Church, found that women held 26 percent of 
top-rank positions, mostly department heads reporting directly to a 
bishop, up from 23.5 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Catholic church does not ordain women, the committee  
has urged dioceses to consider appointing more women to the church 
staff leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Larger dioceses, of 350,000 members or more, consistently  
employed fewer women executives than smaller dioceses, the report 
said.

 *Methabapterians? Say what?    	
</P>
<P>
	BENTON, Ala. (AP) -- Every Sunday, a couple of Methodist altos, a  
Baptist choir director and a Presbyterian pianist join in song. 
They call themselves the Methabapterians. 
</P>
<P>
	Their churches, Benton Baptist, Benton Methodist and Good Hope  
Presbyterian, should be called miracle workers. For all have 
sanctuaries in or near this town of 48 souls. But with so few 
worshippers, they have shared Sunday services, and choirs, for 
nearly 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Benton, about 30 miles west of Montgomery, was a thriving  
Alabama River town in the 19th century. But as nearby Montgomery 
and Selma grew, Benton, which had a tendency to flood, did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Donny Cooper, 51, joined Good Hope 28 years ago and easily  
adapted to sharing services. ``There's so much more that we agree 
on,'' he said. ``Our differences we tend to overlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Spivey, 54, said she had never set foot inside a  
Presbyterian church until she married into Benton Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you realize that church is more about support than  
individual doctrines, at least it has for me,'' she said. ``God is 
God is God.'' 
</P>
<P>

 *Church rocks, neighbors riled    	
</P>
<P>
	DAPHNE, Ala. (AP) -- The noise at Bay Community Church got a  
little too joyful. 
</P>
<P>
	After several verbal warnings, the church was handed a $166  
ticket for violating the city's noise code. Now, church supporters 
say the ordinance is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	During a June 23 church service, a Daphne police officer  
measured the noise with a digital decibel meter and wrote a ticket. 
The noise registered 83 decibels, 13 over the limit for that time 
of day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart J. Roth, chairman of the American Center for Law and  
Justice of Alabama, says the year-old ordinance violates free 
speech and religious rights of church members because it exempts 
noise made by educational, recreational and construction 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	City Attorney Manley Cummins defended the ordinance.  
</P>
<P>
	Responding to neighbors' complaints, the 200-member congregation  
has toned down its music, which at the youth services include 
Christian rock. Taylor said they also are soundproofing the rented 
brick and metal building. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving the ticket, pastor Jerry Taylor promised to ``do  
what we have to do to make it right.'' He said he contacted Roth 
because ``I wanted to make sure the way it was handled and the 
ordinance itself was on the up-and-up and fair.'' 
</P>
<P>

 *Repenting slavery    	
</P>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- In 1636, an area now known as Rhode  
Island became a place of refuge for the religiously oppressed. But 
in the 18th century, its ports accommodated slave trading. No 
colony in New England had such a high proportion of slaves as Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	In an act of repentence, the United Church of Christ dedicated  
an 80-pound cast iron ``bell of freedom.'' The bell is in Abbott 
Park, next to the Beneficent Congregational Church, which was part 
of the Underground Railroad that helped slaves in their escape to 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony took place on the fifth day of the national  
convention of the United Church of Christ, a liberal-minded church 
with an antislavery heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1760, Rhode Island had 184 vessels running between New  
England and the West Indies on the triangular trade route. The 
first leg was made by merchants selling rum to West Africa in 
exchange for slaves to be sold in the Caribbean. Then molasses and 
sugar from the Caribbean would be brought to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans were only minor players in the whole slave trade,  
but Rhode Islanders were the principal American slave traders,'' 
said Stanley Lemons, a history professor at Rhode Island College.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NIH Director To Head Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Bernadine Healy was named Thursday to head  
the American Red Cross, filling the position Elizabeth Dole quit to 
pursue presidential aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy, a heart specialist who will be the first physician to  
head the 118-year-old organization, also has harbored political 
hopes, trying in 1994 to win the Republican Party's Senate 
nomination in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	A former head of the National Institutes of Health, she is now  
dean of the Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Norman Augustine, chairman of the Red Cross Board  
of Governors, praised her record in government and academia and as 
a fund-raiser at Ohio State -- valuable experience for an 
organization that spends $2 billion a year and relies on 
contributions for more than 30 percent of its operating revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	She will take over the Red Cross full-time in September.  
</P>
<P>
	At a brief news conference on the grounds of Red Cross  
headquarters, Healy said she was entering the job as ``a humble 
steward'' of ``one of the most effective public health institutions 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a sharp change from her introduction as head of the  
National Institutes of Health, a position she took in 1991. The NIH 
needed structure, unlike the Red Cross, which already runs well and 
has effective mission plans, she said. ``My role is to make sure 
that we see those plans executed,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Her future staff applauded.  
</P>
<P>
	Healy, 54, looked relaxed and fit, showing no sign of the brain  
surgery she underwent in February to remove a cancerous tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a controversial figure at NIH, where her tenure was  
marked by internal struggles and battles with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., accused Healy of  
interfering with investigations of two NIH scientists accused of 
research fraud, and she countered with complaints about the 
investigators' lack of due process. An NIH investigator quit during 
that period, complaining of pressure from Healy -- an allegation she 
said was ``baloney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other fights with Congress involved Bush administration policy,  
notably a ban on using aborted fetuses for tissue transplantation 
research and a decision to test a powerful drug with potentially 
dangerous side effects on thousands of healthy women. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prominent Democrats in Congress favored fetal tissue  
research and opposed the clinical trial of tamoxifen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the latter subject, Healy expressed a sense of vindication  
Thursday. ``Millions of American women are benefiting as a result 
of that trial,'' she said. Tamoxifen was approved last year as a 
way for women at very high risk to lower their chances of getting 
breast cancer later in life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always try not to be strident but I do try to be forceful  
about things that are right,'' Healy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy's record at NIH also included the beginning of a $625  
million women's health initiative, a 14-year study of diseases in 
women as they age that involved a major shift of attention and 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New York City, Healy earned her bachelor's degree from  
Vassar College in 1965 and medical degree from the Harvard School 
of Medicine in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	She completed postgraduate work at the Johns Hopkins University  
School of Medicine and was a member of the Hopkins faculty from 
1976 to 1984. She worked in the Reagan White House and headed the 
Cleveland Clinic Foundation's research institute before running NIH 
for the Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy is the mother of two daughters. Her husband, Dr. Floyd  
Loop, is chief executive officer of the Cleveland Clinic.

<HEADLINE> Plan: No Fed Contracts to Violators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strong evidence that companies aren't  
complying with labor, tax, environmental or consumer protection 
laws could be enough to bar them from doing business with the 
federal government under a long-awaited Clinton administration 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Government contractors also could not charge taxpayers for the  
cost of activities intended to influence whether workers join labor 
unions or for some legal costs under the proposed regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules would clarify ``the existing principle that the  
federal government should not enter into contracts with contractors 
who do not comply with the law,'' according to a copy the 
administration proposal obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules were expected to appear in Friday's Federal  
Register, opening a period of public comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, business groups were already condemning the new  
rules as politically motivated ``blacklisting'' designed to please 
labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	``By seeking to politicize federal procurement, the  
administration is putting the political agenda of the unions ahead 
of the interests of the nation,'' said Thomas J. Donohue, the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce's president and CEO. ``The chamber is dedicated 
to defeating blacklisting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration denied having political motivations.  
</P>
<P>
	``The overarching principle behind this proposal is that it  
makes good sense for the American government to do business with 
good citizens who comply with the law,'' replied Linda Ricci, 
spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials offered praise.  
</P>
<P>
	``These strike us as good and sensible reforms,'' said Lynn  
Rhinehart, associate general council for the AFL-CIO. ``They seem 
to be reinforcing the notion that the government isn't going to be 
doing business with chronic lawbreakers and that seems like perfect 
common sense to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore first promised the new government  
contracting rules to labor leaders in February 1997 in a speech at 
an AFL-CIO meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to do business with the federal government you had  
better maintain a safe workplace and respect civil, human and union 
rights,'' Gore said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But little on the subject has been heard from the administration  
since the spring of 1997, when Republican senators, including 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., threatened to hold up 
confirmation of Labor Secretary Alexis Herman because of their 
objections to the proposed contracting standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration proposal has resurfaced as Gore is trying to  
woo labor unions to support his bid for the Democratic Party's 2000 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the administration documents, the proposal the  
White House ultimately settled on would go beyond the scope of 
federal contractors' compliance with labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the new rules would elaborate more generally on  
existing regulations that simply require federal contractors to 
have ``a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to labor laws, that standard would explicitly apply  
to a companies' record of compliance with employment discrimination 
laws, tax laws, environmental laws, antitrust laws and consumer 
protections laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules would allow the government to take into  
account not only confirmed wrongdoing by a company, such as court 
convictions, but also ``persuasive evidence of substantial 
noncompliance with a law or regulation,'' when awarding contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such evidence could not be ``isolated or trivial'' but would  
have to show ``repeated and substantial violations establishing a 
pattern or practice by a prospective contractor,'' in order to 
affect the companies chances of winning contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal contractors also could no longer bill the government for  
any expenses associated with activities intended to influence 
workers' decisions to unionize, such as hiring legal consultants or 
printing pamphlets. Expenses associated with maintaining good labor 
relations, such as hiring shop stewards or printing employee 
newsletters would be allowed, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, contractors could not charge the government for their  
legal fees in cases in which federal regulatory agencies, such as 
the National Labor Relations Board or the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, find wrongdoing -- even if there is no 
punishment associated with the finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, companies can get their legal fees reimbursed by the  
government unless they have faced punishment such as a criminal 
court sentence or civil fine.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most of the nation's biggest retailers reported  
today that their June sales jumped to better-than-expected levels 
as the robust U.S. economy encouraged Americans to do lots of 
shopping last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchants also benefited from warmer-than-normal weather through  
much of the country, which sent shoppers into stores for everything 
from bathing suits and sundresses to air conditioners and patio 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong sales in June followed surprisingly big gains in May,  
giving many Wall Street analysts reason to believe that 
second-quarter earnings will top estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very happy consumer who is flush with cash and eager  
to spend,'' said Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst at Bank of 
America Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The raging U.S. economy, combined with low unemployment and  
inflation levels has made consumers confident about their personal 
finances and has raised their willingness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the stock market is again on a record-setting pace.  
The Dow Jones industrial average and other market indexes reached 
new highs on Wednesday, but retreated this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department reported that the number  
of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 
6,000 last week to 294,000, marking the second consecutive drop and 
the lowest level in more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a very favorable environment out there and the  
consumer is still feeling very strong,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, 
managing director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in June were the discount chains, as shoppers  
turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart for their wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also faring well were specialty clothing chains, such as the  
Limited and the Gap, and the department stores, which lured 
shoppers with seasonal fashions, like capri pants and tank tops. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer electronics retailers, such as Circuit City, reported  
healthy gains as shoppers flocked to their stores to buy cheap 
computers, digital video-disc players, air conditioners and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	While the weather and the strong economy were mostly responsible  
for the sales gains, retailers also benefited last month from the 
late Memorial Day holiday, which fell on May 31. Most retailers 
began their fiscal month on May 29 or 30, which meant that much of 
the buying over the holiday weekend was included in June's sales 
figures. Last year, Memorial Day was counted in May. 
</P>
<P>
	With sales in the last few months topping estimates, retailers  
haven't had to slash prices on merchandise to move out seasonal 
products and clear store shelves. Analysts expect that will result 
in strong second-quarter earnings, which most retailers will report 
in early August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second-quarter earnings will reflect the good sales  
performance at full price, and I don't think this party is going to 
end anytime soon,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of the newsletter 
Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``We do not 
foresee a major downturn of any kind for the rest of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the retail industry overall did well in June, there were  
some chains that struggled. The mid-priced department stores, such 
as J.C. Penney, continued to lose business to the discount chains. 
Stores that specialize in athletic sportswear and footwear, such as 
Sports Authority, also reported weak sales amid a prolonged 
downturn in demand for such products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 6.3 percent in June. It rose 5.4 percent in May and 6.4 percent 
in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported that sales  
from stores open at least a year rose 6.5 percent from a year 
earlier, while total sales rose 13.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength.	   Other retailers' reports: 
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales rose 1.9 percent, total sales down 3.1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 9.2 percent, total sales up 11.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 2.3  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 10.3 percent, 
total sales rose 6.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales rose 6.9 percent, total sales  
up 11.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 8.4 percent, total sales up  
18.5 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 8.4 percent, total  
sales up 12.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 11 percent, total sales were up 11  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 13 percent, total sales up 35 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor: Same-store sales up 7.7 percent, total sales up  
18.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kings' Webber Awarded $2.61 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- An arbitration panel has awarded $2.61 million  
to Sacramento Kings forward Chris Webber, ruling that Fila U.S.A. 
wrongfully terminated his endorsement contract after a series of 
legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	The sporting goods company severed Webber's shoe deal in August  
after the NBA star was stopped during a Fila promotional trip in 
San Juan's international airport with a carry-on bag containing 11 
grams of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months earlier, Webber was arrested on his way to a  
Washington Wizards practice and charged with a variety of offenses, 
including assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and 
possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Fila terminated the contract under a good-conduct clause, a  
decision that Webber's representatives strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision rendered late last month and announced this week,  
a three-member panel of the American Arbitration Association ruled 
in favor of Webber, saying he ``did not violate the terms of his 
contract'' and that ``Fila prematurely terminated the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fila spokesman Andrea Nacmias said the company would have no  
comment on the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber's attorney, Fallasha Erwin, said Thursday that his  
preference would have been that both sides smooth over their 
differences instead of taking the case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision is vindication for Chris, but we would have liked  
to have seen the relationship stay intact,'' Erwin said. ``It was 
Chris' preference that the contract go forward. There was a chance 
for the parties to get together before arbitration, but that 
obviously did not happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webber has steadfastly insisted that the carry-on bag belonged  
to a female companion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other incident, a jury found him guilty of willfully  
disobeying a police officer and two minor traffic violations. But 
he was acquitted of charges of possession of marijuana, driving 
under the influence of the drug, resisting arrest and second-degree 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy the arbitrators fully and fairly considered all of  
the evidence presented by my attorneys ... and ruled in my favor,'' 
Webber said in a statement. ``I would like to put the matter behind 
me and move forward with my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webber's publicist, Yvette Watson, said Thursday, ``Our camp is  
very excited, very pleased. It was the right decision.''

<HEADLINE> John Hockenberry Show Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Hockenberry is 0-for-2 when it comes to  
MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable television network has canceled his second show in as  
many years. Hockenberry announced on the air Wednesday that his 
next show would be his last. One of his final discussion topics, he 
told viewers, might be why cable TV ``sucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he used his last minutes of air time Thursday to thank  
a litany of staffers and show snapshots of his children. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC spokesman Cory Shields confirmed the cancellation but had  
no further comment. Hockenberry will return to work as a reporter 
for ``Dateline NBC.'' His weekend newsmagazine, ``Edgewise,'' was 
canceled by MSNBC two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, which is struggling in prime-time against Fox News  
Channel, is expected to announce a new schedule soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It is expected to include a new hourlong biography series  
anchored by Matt Lauer, ``Headliners and Legends.'' CNBC's 
``Hardball,'' with Chris Matthews as host, may also soon shift to 
MSNBC.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Hire Wittman As New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Randy Wittman has seen the NBA for 16 years as  
a player and an assistant coach, and, frankly, he thinks the league 
needs more zip. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what the Cleveland Cavaliers wanted to hear, so they  
hired the Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Wednesday as their new 
head coach, even though he's never held the top job before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stress the game needs to have more life put into  
it,'' Wittman said as he was introduced at Gund Arena. ``I think we 
need as coaches to look in the mirror a little bit and allow our 
players to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs have been searching for someone who will bring a spark  
and a more open style to their franchise after six seasons under 
former coach Mike Fratello, who was fired June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello's teams were often injury-plagued, and he was credited  
with making the most of bad situations by installing a clock-eating 
offense and tough defense. But fans got tired of watching the 
grind-it-out style, even if it meant a few more wins than losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Average game attendance dropped from 18,011 in 1994-95 to 14,120  
last season and the Cavs' postseason performances have been weak in 
recent years. Cleveland hasn't made it out of the first round of 
the playoffs since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman's plan for bringing fans back is as simple as putting  
together a team that has a good time on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to instill in them what it takes to work hard, the  
dedication to get there. But I want them -- when they cross the 
sideline -- to have fun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you can put a product on the floor that people are  
entertained with, wins and losses will take care of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavs center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, one of a few players who watched  
as Wittman was introduced during a news conference, liked what he 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting to see a new guy with new ideas come in here.  
He's got the whole team behind him,'' Ilgauskas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite never holding a head coaching position, the 39-year-old  
Wittman comes to Cleveland with some strong credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	He played on Indiana's 1981 NCAA championship team and was a  
two-time academic All-American with the Hoosiers. Indiana coach Bob 
Knight on Wednesday called Wittman one of the smartest players he 
ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a player, he had a rare understanding of just what it  
takes to win and how to go about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman was a first-round draft pick of the Washington Bullets,  
but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks before the 1983-84 season and 
played under Fratello there. He also played for Sacramento and 
Indiana and finished his nine-year NBA career averaging 7.4 points 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent the last five years as an assistant coach at  
Minnesota and also had one-year stints in Dallas and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland general manager Jim Paxson, who headed the coaching  
search, said he recommended Wittman to Cavs owner Gordon Gund 
because ``he is the coach who will be most flexible and adaptable 
with respect to both players and the NBA game as it continues to 
evolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Others with head coaching experience might be viewed by some  
as safer choices,'' he said. ``For us, Randy Wittman is the right 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson would not disclose the length of Wittman's contract or  
how much he'll be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs were secretive about their coaching search until  
Wittman was introduced. Despite plans to create some excitement 
surrounding the team, the Cavs refused to reveal the names of any 
potential coaching candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wittman arrived in Cleveland on Wednesday, the Cavs sent a  
limousine to meet his plane, so he avoided reporters and fans at 
the flight gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Cowens, Del Harris and John MacLeod also interviewed for  
the Cavs job. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of Wittman is part of a continuing makeover of the  
Cavaliers organization in which well-known names are being replaced 
by a younger group. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the firing of Fratello, known as the ``Czar of  
Telestrator'' for his television commentary work, newly elected 
Hall of Famer Wayne Embry has stepped aside as general manager in 
favor of Paxson. 
</P>
<P>
	And last week's draft saw the Cavs make two other moves which  
could change their look on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to trade up in the first round to get Miami of Ohio's  
Wally Szczerbiak, Cleveland took Utah point Andre Miller and Duke 
guard Trajan Langdon -- a pair who could potentially challenge 
Brevin Knight and Derek Anderson for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota wound up with Szczerbiak and the two players Wittman  
thought the Timberwolves would get in the first round -- Miller and 
Langdon -- went to the Cavs. Wittman said he's ``ecstatic'' with 
Cleveland's draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson was simultaneously preparing for the draft as he looked  
for a coach. He recommended Wittman to Gund just before the draft, 
and the former assistant met with Gund last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gund said he was impressed with Wittman's straightforward manner  
and potential as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely, positively certain we ended up with the  
best choice,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Relies on Former Warsaw Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- When NATO decided to stop Russia from  
reinforcing its peacekeepers in Kosovo last weekend, it turned to 
former Warsaw Pact foes Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria to block the 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest irony of the post-Cold War world, the Western  
alliance is relying on the cooperation of former East European 
adversaries to help shore up its defenses against Balkan unrest in 
the wake of the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months, nearly 100,000 NATO troops will be based in  
former Communist-ruled territory in Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, and 
Albania, supporting peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	After training for decades to stop a Soviet invasion of Western  
Europe, NATO faced an identity crisis after the Iron Curtain came 
down in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fundamental redefinition of its role, NATO has adopted a  
more flexible stance, cooperating with its former adversaries to 
try to quell ethnic uprisings and bloodbaths in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it is NATO that is deploying to the east and absorbing its  
former enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary is a new member of NATO, having been officially admitted  
in April with Poland and the Czech Republic. Bulgaria and Romania 
are eager to join the alliance, along with Slovenia, when 
membership is reopened in 2001 or 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Russia has a voice in NATO, through the Permanent Joint  
Council set up to liaise with Moscow on European security matters. 
But friction remains along the old East-West divide. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, Moscow is insisting the 3,600 peacekeeping troops it  
will send must be under Russian command, coordinated through the 
Permanent Joint Council. 
</P>
<P>
	In a throwback to Cold War tactics, Russia tried to create  
``facts on the ground'' in June when it sent 200 paratroopers from 
the Bosnian peacekeeping force to seize the airport at Kosovo's 
capital, Pristina, ahead of NATO troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian move stunned NATO, which was mobilizing its own  
troops to enter Kosovo in the wake of a peace accord with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic -- who agreed after an 11-week NATO 
bombing campaign to withdraw his forces from the southern Serbian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	But after having played a key negotiating role in assuring the  
withdrawal of Serb forces, Moscow wanted to be sure it was deeply 
involved in the peacekeeping force, partly to reassure the Serbs, 
who are Slavs like the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions heightened last week when Russia sent two Soviet-era  
Tupelov-95 Bear bombers on a flight toward Iceland. NATO planes 
escorted them out of Iceland's airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The feint seemed intended to underline Russian ambitions to show  
it is still a near-superpower. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow also expelled an American military attache from the U.S.  
Embassy last week, implying he was a spy. 
</P>
<P>
	It was against this background of confrontational behavior that  
NATO had to decide what to do when Russia decided it was going to 
fly hundreds more paratroopers to Pristina airport over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between NATO and Russian officers last week in Mons,  
Belgium, had failed to resolve outstanding questions on who would 
command the Russians and exactly where they would be stationed. The 
Russians sought to expand into the Italian-patrolled sector of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO decided to ground the Russian flights by asking Hungary,  
Romania and Bulgaria to deny Moscow the right to cross their 
airspace to get to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgent new talks in Moscow on Monday resolved the differences  
over Russia's Kosovo deployment, and the flights to Pristina 
resumed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliance on the former East European foes is just the latest  
elaboration of the southern and eastern strategic thrust of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Another example was apparent during the bombing phase of the  
Kosovo crisis. Advance NATO units were deployed in Albania and 
Macedonia as a forward staging area for the current peacekeeping 
mission.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West has told  
the White House he plans to resign in the face of criticism from

<HEADLINE> Consumer Borrowing Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' rate of borrowing rose sharply in  
May -- the largest increase since January -- reflecting strong demand 
for loans for everything from autos, boats and mobile homes, to 
education and vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced  
at a hefty 10.9 percent annual rate in May to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.34 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in May's rate follows much smaller gains in April  
and March and marked the largest increase since January, when 
consumer credit climbed at an annualized rate of 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, total credit outstanding rose at an annual rate of  
just 0.4 percent, much less than the Fed previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	May's increase was led by demand for nonrevolving loans, a  
category that does not include credit cards, which rose at an 
annual rate of 15.7 percent. That category includes loans for 
autos, mobile homes, boats, trailers, education and vacations. It 
was the biggest increase for nonrevolving credit since January, 
when it rose at an annual rate of 17.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an incredible year for car sales even the industry  
has been kind of surprised by this. That's really what is driving 
consumer credit,'' said analyst Sandra Shaber with the WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Revolving credit -- primarily credit cards -- also went up in May  
to an annual rate of 4.4 percent. That follows a bigger gain of 5.9 
percent rate in April. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, consumers' borrowed $12.1 billion more in May than  
during the month before, well above many analysts' expectations. 
That, too, was the biggest dollar jump since January, when the 
level of consumer borrowing rose $15.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' robust borrowing is a reflection of a healthy  
economy. The nation's economic growth is being powered by consumer 
spending. At the same time inflation and unemployment are low, 
consumer confidence is high and the stock market is continuing to 
post record gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some would wring their hands'' over the upswing in consumer  
credit ``but if you look at consumer borrowing particularly 
relative to the increases in household wealth and in income growth, 
I think that consumers by and large are not acting irresponsible, 
they are responding to really terrific conditions,'' Shaber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's consumer credit report is the first one in which the  
Fed stopped breaking out automobile loans as a separate category. 
It's also the first report without a separate catchall category 
that lumped loans for things including education, vacations, mobile 
homes and boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, these two categories are now folded into one called  
nonrevolving credit. The Fed explained that it was going to a 
larger category because it didn't trust the month-by-month 
reliability of the previous smaller breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, most of the nation's largest retailers  
said Thursday that their June sales rose to better-than-expected 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Discount chains, such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, reported  
the biggest gains. Specialty clothing stores including the Limited 
and the Gap also fared well as did department stores, which lured 
shoppers with seasonal fashions such as capri pants and tank tops.

<HEADLINE> Missing Financier Was Persuasive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The financier in jeans and a polo shirt was a  
cross between Woody Allen and David Letterman -- gangly and 
neurotic. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also persuasive, offering an impressive biography and  
fantastic returns on safe investments. 
</P>
<P>
	To many investors, Martin Frankel looked like the Bill Gates of  
finance. Investing their money, he told them, was a ``sacred 
trust,'' like a doctor-patient relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Only with Frankel's disappearance, investors say, was it clear  
they had been duped. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a very disarming manner,'' said Jeffrey Creamer, a  
Toledo lawyer who represented three investors in a successful 
arbitration action against Frankel in the late 1980s. ``If you ever 
thought you were going to find this great financial genius who was 
going to do all these wonderful things, he would probably look like 
Marty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That image was shattered in May, when Frankel left behind  
burning files in his Greenwich, Conn., mansion and disappeared with 
what authorities say could be anywhere from $215 million to $3 
billion in other people's money. The money belongs to small 
insurance companies and what investigators say was a bogus charity 
Frankel set up in the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say it was largely through sheer personality that  
Frankel persuaded investors to entrust their money to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found his tone and presentation to be immature, sort of  
childlike,'' said another Toledo lawyer, Stephen Rothschild, who 
later sued Frankel on behalf of an investor. ``He came across as an 
overly bright child prodigy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Creamer said that impression may have helped Frankel.  
</P>
<P>
	``The combination of what seemed to be a very strong dedication  
to the financial markets, coupled with this disarming, kind of 
goofy personality, is what made him a very, very effective fraud,'' 
Creamer said. ``Had he been a sophisticated, suave, debonair kind 
of guy, he probably would not have gotten off the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel accompanied his frenetic but soft-spoken demeanor with  
biographical materials and figures purporting to show astronomical 
returns on conservative government securities. It was a talent that 
Frankel had even before John Schulte fired him from the Dominick &AMP; 
Dominick brokerage in Toledo during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Schulte, he used to say back in those formative years,  
Marty Frankel was the best paper trader he'd ever heard of -- just 
analyzing paper and turning figures into hundreds of thousands of 
dollars.'' recalled Ted Bitter, a Toledo tool-and-die maker who 
invested with Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel told investors he was able to make money through a  
special day trading system that involved staying up all night 
trolling news wires. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had made thousands of dollars for his clients --  
that his system was virtually foolproof,'' Creamer said. 
</P>
<P>
	John and Shirley Herlihy, of Toledo, called Frankel after seeing  
his ad in the Yellow Pages. They wound up giving him about 
$230,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he looked upon this as a sacred trust, like a doctor  
or a lawyer; that his handling of their money was a great 
privilege; that he would always treat it as this sacred trust,'' 
Creamer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also included personal revelations in his pitch,  
describing himself to the Herlihys as a genius who had had 
difficulty in school because of test anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a decade ago, the Herlihys and Bitter sued Frankel after  
they began to suspect that the statements of their investments were 
bogus. At the time, Frankel was running his own investment service, 
the Frankel Fund, out of his parents' home in Toledo. The investors 
won a combined arbitration award of $950,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At about the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission  
filed an enforcement action against Frankel. His mother delivered 
him by car to make a statement to SEC officials. In settling, 
Frankel gave up his trading license. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Frankel would use the Virgin Islands-based charity he  
created, the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, to gain listeners' 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was this great guy who wanted to help the poor, help the  
homeless,'' said John Yednock, a Chicago insurance consultant hired 
to work with the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	He mixed fabrications with truth, sometimes gratuitously. He  
told the SEC that one of his investors was ``the deposed queen of 
Romania, and that she lived downstairs in his apartment in Palm 
Beach,'' Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel could remain cool under pressure, recalled James  
Maloney, a zoning officer in Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney met Frankel when neighbors hired an investigator and  
complained in 1992 that he was running a business out of his home. 
Maloney asked why he had a wall of TV sets and high-tech trading 
equipment at home. Frankel claimed he was investing his own money 
and wanted to keep up with the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney recalled how Frankel described his work: watching TV  
monitors all night for stock and quotes, playing the money markets 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The financier was also capable of exploding into what Yednock  
described as ``schizophrenic'' moods. Rothschild confronted Frankel 
in court with apparently false biographical documents and other 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got very paranoid,'' Rothschild said. ```Where did you get  
these? You must have stolen them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's pitch also worked on women.  
</P>
<P>
	Although he rarely left his Greenwich mansion, Frankel  
nevertheless drew young women through personal advertisements. His 
money may have helped. When police investigated an unrelated 
matter, he told them: ``I give them money as they need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was more, Frankel said: ``Some of these girls think  
that they might be my girlfriend some day.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Mull 2002 Olympics Indictments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With initial evidence-gathering completed,  
Justice Department officials have begun weighing whether to seek 
indictments in Salt Lake City's successful effort to win the 2002 
Winter Olympics, a law enforcement official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in Salt Lake City and supervisors in the  
fraud section of the criminal division here are going over the 
witness interviews and the documents and records gathered since the 
inquiry got under way early this year to see if there is enough 
evidence to support federal criminal charges, according to the 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision is imminent; the review may take some time, the  
official said. Indeed, superiors here could order the six Justice 
lawyers and FBI agents who work full time on the case in Salt Lake 
City to go back to gather more evidence. Or they could draft a 
prosecution memorandum for top-level approval and ask the federal 
grand jury in Salt Lake City to return indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	It could not be learned how many indictments might be  
considered, although the Salt Lake Tribune today put the number at 
two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have looked for evidence against both alleged  
bribers in Salt Lake City and bribe-takers on the International 
Olympic Committee, which selects the site for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said Salt Lake's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses and entertainment, 
gifts, scholarships for their children and cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four IOC members reportedly were questioned by the FBI  
in May when they attended a Coordination Commission meeting in Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. The 
former two top Salt Lake bid and organizing committee officials 
lost their jobs in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which possible charges  
investigators were focusing on. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and travel in aid of  
racketeering are among the charges that federal investigators 
looked into because they saw the case as one of commercial bribery, 
rather than the more familiar government variety, Justice officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the government usually lets private parties settle  
commercial bribery cases through civil lawsuits, federal charges 
are possible when a federal interest is involved, like the 
integrity of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The racketeering law -- known as ITAR, for interstate travel in  
aid of racketeering -- prohibits interstate and foreign travel to 
further federal or state crimes like bribery and extortion or to 
distribute their illicit proceeds. It could be used against both 
bribe-givers and takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bribe-takers also might face extortion charges, depending on the  
evidence gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have looked at whether the Salt Lake panel  
violated its tax-exempt status or whether recipients failed to pay 
any U.S. taxes due on payments. 
</P>
<P>
	And they looked at possible gun charges over the shipment out of  
the country of some rifles, pistols and other weapons given as 
gifts to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials familiar with the Foreign Corrupt Practices  
Act were involved in the investigation, but that act applies only 
to bribes paid by U.S. citizens to foreign officials to influence 
actions of their government. The International Olympic Committee is 
a private organization, not a government body. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, prosecutors must still weigh whether federal or state  
charges would be the most likely to succeed, would reach the 
largest number of potentially guilty parties, and would provide the 
most appropriate penalties.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Concerned Over Hearst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Amid growing concern about Garrison  
Hearst's chance of returning from a serious ankle injury, the San 
Francisco 49ers met with three free agent running backs Thursday -- 
but saved their strongest praise for controversial tailback 
Lawrence Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, who rushed for a team-record 1,570 yards last season,  
fractured his ankle on the first play of the 49ers' playoff loss to 
the Atlanta Falcons. The 49ers had expected him to return for the 
start of this season, but that now is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a bone in his ankle that isn't getting the right blood  
supply. And that bone is slowly, but surely, dying,'' 49ers general 
manager Bill Walsh said. ``You can't put a man on the field in that 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, signed as a free agent in 1997, was third in the NFL in  
rushing last season and scored seven touchdowns. He set a team 
rushing record of 198 yards against the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said the 49ers won't know the prognosis on Hearst until  
the running back gets additional tests and is examined by other 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it treatable? I don't know,'' Walsh said. ``The doctors  
will have to determine that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hearst cannot play, the 49ers might focus on Phillips, who  
has been dropped by the St. Louis Rams and Miami Dolphins and whose 
off-field problems have included domestic violence and drunken 
driving. Phillips met with the 49ers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips spent the past few months with the Barcelona Dragons.  
He was NFL Europe's offensive player of the year after becoming the 
first player in the developmental league to rush for 1,000 yards 
and scored 14 touchdowns in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the 49ers also are looking at free agents Terry Allen,  
Charlie Garner and Harvey Williams, Walsh said Phillips -- who is 
expected to talk with several other clubs -- could best step in as a 
starter in place of Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh acknowledged he was very critical of the Rams for drafting  
Phillips sixth overall in 1996, but said the troubled tailback has 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to be a possibility, though I've been highly critical  
of his behavior in the past,'' Walsh said. ``We know lurking there 
has been some violence and that is not pleasant. We have to decide 
whether to take on that risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, who said Phillips has a ``disarming, pleasant  
personality,'' said the 49ers have spoken with Rams coach Dick 
Vermeil, other former Phillips coaches and NFL officials about the 
running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did very well in Europe, not only on the field but off the  
field,'' Walsh said. ``His behavior and his demeanor have been 
excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner and Williams worked out for the 49ers, while Allen talked  
with team officials at the club's Santa Clara headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, released by Washington in April, set a Redskins'  
single-season rushing record of 1,353 yards in 1996 but has been 
limited by injuries since. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who also has visited the Kansas City Chiefs and plans to  
talk with New England, said there was no reason to work out for the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I go out and blow an ankle here and have to work out for  
someone else, what good does that do me?'' Allen said. ``Anyone can 
look good running through cones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams ran for 1,114 yards for the Oakland Raiders in 1995 but  
has been shifted to tight end and fullback in the past two seasons. 
He plans to work out for New England Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, who spent the past five seasons with the Philadelphia  
Eagles, also expects to speak with Tennessee and Oakland.

	Retail Sales Up; Jobless Claims Off  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's biggest retailers reported  
surprisingly strong sales in June as the robust U.S. economy and 
warm weather sent Americans on a buying bonanza of everything from 
bathing suits to air conditioners. The glowing figures on consumer 
spending were released today as the new treasury secretary said the 
economy appears strong enough to provide wage earners with even 
bigger pay increases without reviving inflation. ``I feel good 
about where the economy is,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers. Most Americans share his view, and that's helped boost 
retail sales to stunning levels all year. Separately, the Labor 
Department reported today that the number of Americans filing new 
claims for unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 last week to 
294,000, marking the second consecutive drop.

	Consumer Borrowing Rises Sharply  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' rate of borrowing rose sharply in  
May -- the largest increase since January -- reflecting strong demand 
for loans for everything from autos, boats and mobile homes, to 
education and vacations. Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding 
mortgage debt, advanced at a hefty 10.9 percent annual rate in May 
to a seasonally adjusted $1.34 trillion, the Federal Reserve said 
today. The increase in May's rate was the largest since January, 
when consumer credit climbed at an annualized rate of 14 percent.

<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- General Electric reported its  
second-quarter profits rose 15 percent, led by strong performances 
in its aircraft engines, power systems and financial services 
units. The nation's fifth-biggest corporation said today it earned 
$2.82 billion, or 85 cents per share, compared with $2.45 billion, 
or 74 cents per share, in the same period last year. Revenues 
increased 9 percent to $27.41 billion, reflecting growth from 
globalization and product services. GE's results slightly above 
analysts' expectations. GE shares ended at 117 1/16, down 7/8.

exercising warrants to purchase about $175 million worth of stock 
in the direct marketer. The two companies, both divisions of 
General Electric, already owned a 19.9 percent stake in 
ValueVision. The purchase, announced today, ``is a huge credibility 
boost for ValueVision,'' said Bob Evans, an analyst with 
Craig-Hallum Capital Group in Minneapolis. ValueVision shares were

companies that will make up its roster for the coming year, 
knocking out 375 companies that had grown too large over the past 
12 months. Gone are Ameritrade, E-Trade Group, CMGI, Doubleclick, 
Lycos, RealNetworks and many other sexy Internet companies that 
help drive the Russell 2000's 7.28 percent return in 1999. In their 
place are companies such as 24/7 Media, BarnesandNoble.com, and

	Oakland Dock Workers End Walkout

<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Dock workers returned to their jobs today  
after shutting down the Oakland port for two days in the middle of 
contract negotiations. The walkout by 1,400 workers forced 
cargo-laden vessels to slow down across the Pacific Ocean or wait 
at anchor in San Francisco Bay just outside the port, which handles 
12 percent of West Coast shipping. Steve Stallone, a spokesman for 
the International Longshore and Warehouse Union local representing 
the stevedores at Oakland, said talks would resume tomorrow in San

that the resignation of Jan Gesmar-Larsen, 39, was due to personal 
reasons. Europe is a critical market for the personal-computer 
maker, and first-quarter sales fell short of company expectations. 
Dell's European revenues grew by 29 percent in the first quarter,

ravine,'' in many cases even after accounting for differences in 
income, a new government report said today. The Commerce 
Department's latest survey showed dramatic gains in the number of 
Americans who own computers and use the Internet. But it also cited 
money, education and whether a person lives in an urban area as key 
factors affecting whether they use technology.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's largest steel company today criticized a  
U.S. International Trade Commission ruling that Japanese companies 
have dumped stainless steel products in the United States. Nippon 
Steel Corp., which often acts on behalf of the nation's steel 
industry, called the decision ``extremely regrettable.'' In its 
final ruling, issued today, the ITC found that stainless steel 
imports from Japan and seven other nations had substantially hurt 
the U.S. steel industry. An official of Japan's Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry said the ministry will fully 
assess the contents of the ruling papers as to whether the ITC's 
judgment was appropriate.

<HEADLINE>  Hundreds Rescued From Burning Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- The smell of acrid smoke and the sound  
of fire alarms woke passengers on an overnight ferry from Germany 
to Norway today, when a fire below decks forced a pre-dawn 
evacuation of hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	No serious injuries were reported among the 1,167 passengers and  
172 crew members aboard the Prinsesse Ragnhild. Hospital officials 
in Goteborg, where the ship was towed, said three passengers were 
treated for smoke injuries and one for a heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A distress call went out at 2:13 a.m., within moments of the  
fire's detection, and the decision was quickly made to abandon the 
ferry, owned by the Norway-based Color Line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I noticed the smell of smoke in the cabin ... and then the  
alarm sounded ... and then it was just a matter of getting dressed 
as fast as you could and take your most important things with 
you,'' Knut Gran of Norway told Norway state radio NRK. 
</P>
<P>
	While passengers filed into lifeboats, a ferry from the Stena  
line pulled alongside within a half hour. It and a smaller boat 
shuttled more than 500 passengers from the stricken ship, a 
670-foot-long ferry capable of carrying 1,875 passengers and 770 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	More ships, along with helicopters, also appeared, and favorable  
weather conditions helped the evacuation. It was relatively 
windless and clear in the pre-dawn light and seas were calm. 
</P>
<P>
	Within about four hours, the fire was under control and  
virtually all passengers -- most of them Norwegian tourists -- were 
taken off and brought to Goteborg. Most of the crew and at least 
one passenger stayed on board while the ship was towed to the 
Swedish port city. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any panic,'' 70-year-old Marit  
Stakvik-Joergensen of Oslo told TT. ``Some probably thought at 
first that it was just a drill, but when they put the life jackets 
on and felt the smoke, then they understood it was serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne-Lise Gaustad, an elderly Norwegian, said families with  
children went into the lifeboats first. She and others were given 
wet towels to breathe through because of smoke. ``I still have a 
headache,'' she said. ``We're pretty shaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened 11 miles off the west coast of Sweden,  
near the town of Vinga in the Goteborg archipelago. The Prinsesse 
Ragnhild was en route from Kiel, Germany, to Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine room seems badly damaged and ``looks like an  
ashtray,'' long-haul truck driver Arne Slorafoss of Norway told 
NRK. He volunteered to stay aboard and help with salvage efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	There were conflicting reports whether the fire began in the  
engine or machine room. 
</P>
<P>
	The close call chilled Scandinavians who recalled two ferry  
disasters in the region this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 7, 1990, the Scandinavian Star passenger ferry caught  
fire on an overnight run from Denmark to Norway, killing 159 people 
in the same waters off western Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1994, 852 people died when the Estonia ferry went  
down in the Baltic Sea en route to Stockholm from the Estonian 
capital Tallinn. Heavy seas tore off the boat's visor-like bow door 
and water surged into the vehicle deck. Only 137 people survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Konrad Havig of Norway's Maritime Directorate said the earlier  
disasters brought about safety improvements, including improved 
signs and markings for evacuation and smoke detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation of the Prinsesse Ragnhild ``is a textbook example  
of how something like this should be handled. It seems that way, at 
least,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rothschild Collection Could Fetch $40 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Their fortune destroyed by the Nazis during World  
War II, the Austrian arm of the Rothschild clan has placed a 
spectacular collection of art and furnishings on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few names as big as Rothschild,'' said Alex  
Hope, who organized today's sale for Christie's. ``There will be 
very few collections that will rival this in importance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 250 paintings, pieces of furniture and decorative objects  
evoke another era -- a time when barons Nathaniel and Albert von 
Rothschild, scions of the Austrian arm of the 250-year-old banking 
dynasty, were the foremost collectors in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The fabulous collection they amassed is expected to fetch more  
than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Their descendants are selling the treasures because they no  
longer have opulent homes in which to display the pieces. While the 
Nazis protected the family's art collection, they ruined the 
Rothschilds financially, destroying their factories and 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Photographs of Nathaniel Rothschild's home in Vienna, included  
in the auction catalog, demonstrate the dramatic change in the 
family's fortunes since the first half of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	One photo, of the drawing room, shows a painting by the Dutch  
master Franz Hals, ``Portrait of Tieleman Roosterman,'' valued by 
Christie's at $4 million to $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just one of many precious objects in the room, competing  
for attention with lavish furniture and Oriental carpets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Nazis seized the Rothschilds' property in 1938, the  
art remained hidden, mostly in salt mines, until it was recovered 
by American soldiers after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection then was turned over to the Austrian government,  
which put it on display in the country's museums and libraries. It 
finally agreed to return it to the Rothschild family in February, 
to right what it called an ``immoral'' wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope said only the collection of the Rothschilds' brother,  
Ferdinand -- who worked in the London branch of the family's 
financial houses -- rivals the items on sale at Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the three inspired the term ``le gout Rothschild,'' a  
reference to their predilection for works of surpassing quality, 
frequently with a royal connection. 
</P>
<P>
	A wooden commode, or cabinet, that was commissioned by Louis XVI  
and later furnished his private library at Versailles exemplifies 
the Rothschilds' collecting style. It is expected to sell for $2.4 
million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other notable items on sale is a Book of Hours made in  
Flanders in the early 16th century. Its red velvet cover is clean 
and soft, and the colors of the 67 full-page illuminations remain 
brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, expected to fetch $3.3 million to $4.9 million, was  
kept in the National Library of Vienna and rarely displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of Ferdinand's collection is on public view at  
Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, 50 miles northwest of London, 
but the auction could be the last chance for the public to view the 
Austrian treasures. 
</P>
<P>
	Although museums from around the world have shown interest in  
the sale, private buyers are likely to outbid museums for most of 
the pieces, Christie's said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Group Criticizes IMF Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The World Gold Council came to the United  
Nations on Thursday to criticize the International Monetary Fund's 
plan to sell part of its gold holdings to help reduce poor 
countries' debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana's mission to the United Nations co-sponsored a press  
conference with the industry trade association to warn that the 
sale would actually hurt the countries it is seeking to help, as 
well as the gold industry in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana is the largest gold producing nation on the IMF's list of  
``Heavily Indebted Poor Countries'' seeking debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the world's main industrial nations meeting in June  
in Cologne, Germany, gave the go-ahead for the IMF to sell 10 
million ounces of its $27 billion in gold reserves to help finance 
the IMF portion of debt relief for poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Congressional approval is required, and already two  
Republican lawmakers have moved to block the sale on the grounds 
that it would hurt many gold-producing nations and the U.S. 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF should consider alternative ways of raising money for  
debt relief, such as seeking additional contributions from IMF 
members, said George Milling-Stanley, a gold market analyst at the 
World Gold Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based group has been outspoken in its opposition to  
the plan and to recent gold sales by central banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Milling-Stanley called on IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus  
to ``bring all his considerable powers of persuasion to bear in 
generating contributions rather than settling for perhaps what 
seemed like an easy answer at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus has acknowledged gold producers and the industry have  
legitimate concerns about the sale but has said the IMF would only 
sell its gold at reasonable prices so as to not drive down the 
market any further. 
</P>
<P>
	International gold prices fell to a 20-year lows in June  
following endorsements of the IMF plan from the United States, 
France and Britain and plans by several central banks to sell the 
precious metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Milling-Stanley said nothing short of a policy reversal by the  
IMF will calm the gold markets and stabilize prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selling is what pushes prices down in any market, but negative  
market attitude -- the feeling that the gold price can never rise 
again, which some people in the market have fallen prey to -- is 
what opens the door for speculators to sell short,'' 
Milling-Stanley said. ``That is really what is damaging the 
price.''

<HEADLINE> Eastern U.S. Finally Cools Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's finally cooled off across the East, but the  
debate is heating up in New York after 200,000 people endured a 
19-hour blackout during a deadly heat wave that smothered the 
region for three days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem to me that over the years they would develop  
more of a fail-safe system,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday 
of Consolidated Edison, which cut power throughout upper Manhattan 
one night earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered outages continued to plague thousands of people  
Wednesday in mid-Atlantic states and the Northeast. But 
temperatures finally sank below the baking, humid level that 
contributed to at least 25 deaths since last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of the 69,000 customers who lost power in Manhattan  
above 155th Street had their electricity back today, and subway 
service was fully restored in time for this morning's rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Giuliani voiced the frustrations of residents and merchants  
who had slept outside to escape overheated apartments and guard 
their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 police officers were deployed in a move designed to  
prevent the widespread looting that happened during a 25-hour 
blackout in 1977. There were nine arrests and only a few stores 
were robbed, though some witnesses described groups of youths 
prowling the neighborhood armed with baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed didn't have the capability to divert power from any other  
section of the city, and the situation was made worse by 
heat-damaged cables, spokeswoman Toni Yuille said. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility offered partial reimbursement for lost perishables,  
but Giuliani has threatened to sue Con Ed for losses to residents 
and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lose all the meat,'' said Reso Infante, manager  
of La Mundial specialty meat market in upper Manhattan. The stench 
of spoiled meat wafted from the open freezer door up the rickety 
wooden stairs to the sidewalk. Infante estimated the loss at 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Colon threw out about $70 worth of groceries from his  
refrigerator and sent his mother and grandmother to stay with an 
aunt across town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a tight budget as it is, and we didn't need this,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat wave started Sunday, bringing temperatures over 100  
degrees and intense humidity to many areas across the Midwest and 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also suffered big losses.  
</P>
<P>
	Allen Family Foods Inc. in Delaware lost 33,000 chickens from  
Saturday through Monday, said Tom David, director of live 
operations. The company has more than 20 million birds in the field 
at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland-based Perdue Farms Inc., which bills itself as the  
nation's third-largest poultry producer, said it had not tallied 
its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the area's growers produced more than 600 million birds  
last year and it would take a loss of millions of birds to affect 
the price of poultry, said Bill Satterfield of Delmarva Poultry 
Industry Inc. in Georgetown, Del.

<HEADLINE> Part II of NY Subway Series on Deck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After winning the first leg of the Subway  
Series, the New York Yankees would just as well go on with the rest 
of their season. The New York Mets are relishing the opportunity to 
get even. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big three-game set against the Yankees,'' Mets manager  
Bobby Valentine said. ``I think we'd like to get a second shot at 
them in our park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, who took two out of three against the Mets last  
month, will take the short drive over the Triborough Bridge on 
Friday to begin a three-game series at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out if this is too much of a good thing,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said Thursday from Detroit. ``Both owners want to 
win because it's New York. We want to win because it's a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have taken two of three in all three series with the  
Mets, starting in 1997. This is the first time the teams will place 
twice in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been as much hype about this series as the first  
one,'' Torre said. ``Today's the first day I've had to answer 
questions about it. Last time the questions started 10 games before 
it happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second series starts the way the first one ended, with Al  
Leiter (7-6) taking the mound against Roger Clemens (8-2). The Mets 
came into that game with an eight-game losing streak and having 
just fired three of their coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter's struggles before that start -- he was 2-5 after signing  
a $32 million, four-year contract in the offseason -- helped lead GM 
Steve Phillips to fire pitching coach Bob Apodaca. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter allowed one run and four hits in seven innings and the  
Mets pounded Clemens for seven runs in 2 2-3 innings, handing 
Clemens his first loss in more than one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember that last outing too,'' Leiter said. ``And I'll  
just try to duplicate it. So hopefully, if I do my job and we score 
some runs, we'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, who were 27-28 with the 11th-best record in the NL  
before that game, turned their season around after leaving the 
Bronx. They are 21-10 since then and now have the fifth-best record 
in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that there's a good time or a bad time to play a  
team,'' John Olerud said. ``I think we'd like to have everyone 
healthy and playing well, and we'd like to have some momentum. But 
you don't always have your way in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets will be short-handed this weekend. Closer John Franco  
is out 3-10 weeks with a partially torn tendon on the middle finger 
of his left hand and third baseman Robin Ventura with a bruised 
left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he (Ventura) plays at all this weekend,'' Valentine said.  
``I'd be very surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Mets' Rick Reed (6-3) will face Andy Pettite (5-7)  
Saturday and the Yankees' Hideki Irabu (5-3) opposes Orel Hershiser 
(9-5) in the finale on Sunday. ... Leiter is 2-4 with a 3.30 ERA in 
11 lifetime appearances against the Yankees.

<HEADLINE>  DeCicco Honored To Coach US Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Tony DiCicco is the man behind the  
women. 
</P>
<P>
	As perhaps 2,000 fans at Thursday's practice session screamed  
for Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and the rest of the U.S. soccer squad 
that has taken the nation by storm, DiCicco exited the bus and 
calmly strode, almost unnoticed, toward the field at Pomona-Pitzer 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	When the workout ended, 150 or so media members scrambled to  
surround the players as they sat in different areas of the field. 
Television cameramen jostled for position near Julie Foudy and 
Brandi Chastain. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco sat nearby, far from the madding crowd, a handful of  
reporters informally chatting with him. That, generally, is 
DiCicco's way: He stays out of the way, except when his team needs 
some instruction or a dressing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a privilege to coach this team,'' DiCicco said as  
the Americans prepared for Saturday's final with China. ``It's been 
a wonderful opportunity for all of us. This team has grown together 
and is so close to achieving what it set out to do, and they all 
are outstanding women, too. I can't think of a better job to 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When DiCicco took over the job in August 1994 from Anson  
Dorrance -- who guided the Americans to the first Women's World Cup 
title in 1991 and is the mastermind of the University of North 
Carolina soccer dynasty -- he sought guidance from some of his 
players. Hamm told him to ``coach us like men, treat us like 
women.'' He has never forgotten that advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know much about this team,'' said DiCicco, 50, who  
joined the squad as a goalkeepers' coach in '91. ``I had been 
working with U.S. Soccer and boys youth national teams. This team 
had developed a reputation for good play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I experienced this team and saw their passion for the  
game and the goals they set for themselves, it was fun to be around 
them. And it became a dream come true to end up their head coach.''

<P>
	Since taking charge, DiCicco has a 96-8-7 record, including this  
World Cup. He's led the Americans to third place at the '95 World 
Cup, gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics and last year's Goodwill 
Games, and now to the finals of the biggest women's sporting event 
ever. Not bad for someone who claims he didn't consider holding the 
job before he got it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching a national team? I don't know if I ever thought about  
being the women's national coach'' he said. ``But certainly playing 
and coaching at a high level was a dream of mind. I sought to coach 
a team that is motivated, talented and has a chance of winning, and 
that I would be proud to be associated with. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those goals have been answered by this team.''  
</P>
<P>
	As a male among these superb female athletes, DiCicco remains a  
bit of an outsider. That gives him a unique perspective about this 
team that, right now, carries the aura of the biggest rock stars. 
He had to chuckle when someone mentioned the hundreds of yelping 
youngsters who surrounded the team bus as it pulled onto the 
college grounds before practice.

<P>

Martin experiences at concerts? 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that sets this team apart is that they don't  
want to all be the homecoming queen and do the popular thing,'' he 
said. ``They just want to go out and win games and win 
championships and Olympic gold medals. That's an awesome challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The genuine pursuit of their dreams and goals is what is so  
enticing for people. Its kind of snowballed and has turned into a 
wonderful phenomena. They are finally getting their due.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is he.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tony understands us,'' veteran Joy Fawcett said. ``He  
understands we have a different approach to the game and to the 
relationships we build than the men do. He allows us to be 
ourselves, and that's been a very important part of our success.''

<HEADLINE>  DeCicco Honored To Coach US Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Tony DiCicco is the man behind the  
women. 
</P>
<P>
	As perhaps 2,000 fans at Thursday's practice session screamed  
for Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and the rest of the U.S. soccer squad 
that has taken the nation by storm, DiCicco exited the bus and 
calmly strode, almost unnoticed, toward the field at Pomona-Pitzer 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	When the workout ended, 150 or so media members scrambled to  
surround the players as they sat in different areas of the field. 
Television cameramen jostled for position near Julie Foudy and 
Brandi Chastain. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco sat nearby, far from the madding crowd, a handful of  
reporters informally chatting with him. That, generally, is 
DiCicco's way: He stays out of the way, except when his team needs 
some instruction or a dressing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a privilege to coach this team,'' DiCicco said as  
the Americans prepared for Saturday's final with China. ``It's been 
a wonderful opportunity for all of us. This team has grown together 
and is so close to achieving what it set out to do, and they all 
are outstanding women, too. I can't think of a better job to 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When DiCicco took over the job in August 1994 from Anson  
Dorrance -- who guided the Americans to the first Women's World Cup 
title in 1991 and is the mastermind of the University of North 
Carolina soccer dynasty -- he sought guidance from some of his 
players. Hamm told him to ``coach us like men, treat us like 
women.'' He has never forgotten that advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know much about this team,'' said DiCicco, 50, who  
joined the squad as a goalkeepers' coach in '91. ``I had been 
working with U.S. Soccer and boys youth national teams. This team 
had developed a reputation for good play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I experienced this team and saw their passion for the  
game and the goals they set for themselves, it was fun to be around 
them. And it became a dream come true to end up their head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking charge, DiCicco has a 96-8-7 record, including this  
World Cup. He's led the Americans to third place at the '95 World 
Cup, gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics and last year's Goodwill 
Games, and now to the finals of the biggest women's sporting event 
ever. Not bad for someone who claims he didn't consider holding the 
job before he got it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching a national team? I don't know if I ever thought about  
being the women's national coach'' he said. ``But certainly playing 
and coaching at a high level was a dream of mind. I sought to coach 
a team that is motivated, talented and has a chance of winning, and 
that I would be proud to be associated with. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 27.22; Nasdaq Up 21.57 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as strength in Internet  
and computer stocks helped the technology sector outperform the 
broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 27.22 at 11,160.14. The blue-chip index fluctuated between 
negative and positive territory for much of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 1.39 at 1,394.47, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 21.57 at 2,764.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's relative strength came from a wide array of technology  
shares. Yahoo! rose 11/16 to 167 3/4 after reporting earnings that 
topped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer maker Apple rose 4 3/4 to 54 5/8 after a Wall Street  
investment firm upgraded its outlook on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But the broader market struggled to find direction as companies  
released some mixed reports on their second-quarter profits. Strong 
profit forecasts have propelled markets to record levels in recent 
sessions, but even good news today failed to jolt stocks out of a 
tight range. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric beat analysts' estimates by a penny. Its stock,  
which rose sharply Wednesday in advance of the report, slipped 1 
1/16 to 116 7/8 as investors locked in their profits from that gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, other companies continued to warn of weakness.  
Airborne Freight said late Wednesday it will miss analysts' 
expectations by as much as 18 cents per share. Its shares fell 1 
5/16 to 25 7/8, and other package delivery company stocks fell along 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose 3/4 to 38 5/8. Its shares had dropped in late  
trading Wednesday after a Florida jury ruled that tobacco makers 
are liable for making a defective product that causes emphysema, 
lung cancer and other illnesses. The verdict, if it stands, is 
expected to cost the tobacco industry billions in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, analysts said the verdict was no real surprise.  
Investors bought the stock back on the belief that legal wrangling 
may delay payments to plaintiffs for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival tobacco companies were modestly lower.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also knocked off kilter today by a vacillating bond  
market. Bond prices initially tumbled today, with the 30-year 
Treasury bond dropping 1/2 point in price and its yield rising to 
6.08 percent from 6.04 percent late Wednesday. The rising yield 
served as a reminder to investors that higher interest rates are 
taking hold in the buoyant economy, and could threaten earnings in 
future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	But by afternoon, bond prices were recovering, due mostly to a  
recovery in European bond markets. The yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond slipped back to 5.99 by the afternoon, beneath the 
highly sensitive 6 percent level. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 657.4 million shares, 
ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.06 at 655.41, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 3.52 at 805.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which measures the performance of small  
companies, rose 0.98 to 453.67.

<HEADLINE> Rains Cause Las Vegas Flood; 2 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavy rains pounded the Las Vegas Valley  
Thursday, turning streets into rivers, stranding motorists on top 
of their cars and exhausting the city's emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst flood in Las Vegas since at least 1984,''  
said Ron McQueen, a meteorologist with the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Two deaths were blamed on the weather. A man's body was  
recovered from a wash area Thursday afternoon, and a woman was 
killed in a traffic accident, police and fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, parts of the valley had received up to 3  
inches of rain and more was expected throughout the day, McQueen 
said. The average annual rainfall in the Las Vegas Valley is 4.1 
inches. A flash flood warning was issued for the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists were plucked from flooded vehicles by roaming fire  
trucks and, in at least one case, a police helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	The severe flooding turned sections of busy Interstate 15 into a  
lake, bringing traffic to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists seeking shelter from the rains poured into the Strip  
casinos. No casinos reported any major damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Strip is a lake, up over the curbs, into our fountains,''  
said Phil Cooper, spokesman for Caesars Palace hotel-casino. ``I've 
been here 10 years and it's the worst I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caesars was forced to close part of its casino and the Forum  
Shops because of the flooding, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights at McCarran International Airport were shut down for 45  
minutes, airport spokeswoman Cynthia Markson said. Two planes 
scheduled to land in Las Vegas had to be diverted to Los Angeles, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intersections across town were closed as the rising waters  
swallowed vehicles. Several motorists were stranded on top of their 
cars and had to be rescued by firefighters as their trucks made 
their way along the flooded streets, picking up stranded motorists 
one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as serious as it gets,'' said Clark County Fire  
Department spokesman Steve La-Sky. ``Our emergency dispatch 
switchboard is lit up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy rains caused a ceiling to cave in at a Lucky's grocery  
store on the city's southwest side and numerous businesses and 
homes had leaky roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest hit areas were in the southwest and west parts of  
the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were trying to contain mudslides and boulder slides  
along the Summerlin Parkway in the northwest part of the valley, 
Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Scott Flabi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nightmare. It's one of the worst things I've ever  
seen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mobile homes were in danger of being washed downstream  
as the waters pushed through the southeast part of the city. A 
storage shed at the mobile home park was swept away, and residents 
watched as their homes dangled in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	McQueen said the flooding was caused by a rich moisture flow out  
of northern Mexico and the gulf of California. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain was expected to continue throughout the day.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 60.47 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today as strength in  
Internet and computer stocks helped the technology sector 
outperform the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 60.47 at 11,126.89. The blue-chip index fluctuated 
between negative and positive territory for much of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index  
rose to a new record, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's strength came from a wide array of technology shares.  
Yahoo! rose after reporting late Wednesday its second-quarter 
earnings easily topped Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer maker Apple rose after BancBoston Robertson Stephens  
upgraded its outlook on the stock. An analyst at the firm cited 
strong sales of Apple's iMac computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader market struggled to find direction. Alan Skrainka,  
chief market strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said the 
continued strength of the U.S. economy, underscored today by strong 
reports from the nation's biggest retailers, has stunned many 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are wrestling with a tug-of-war between strong  
corporate profits and higher interest rates,'' he said. ``A strong 
economy produces both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, strong second-quarter profit forecasts have propelled  
markets to record levels in recent sessions, but even good news 
today failed to jolt stocks out of a tight range. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric beat analysts' estimates by a penny. Its stock,  
which rose sharply Wednesday in advance of the report, slipped 
today as investors locked in their profits from that gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, other companies continued to warn of weakness.  
Airborne Freight said late Wednesday it will miss analysts' 
expectations by as much as 18 cents per share. Its shares fell, 
dragging other package delivery company stocks with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose modestly. Its shares had dropped in late  
trading Wednesday after a Florida jury ruled that tobacco makers 
are liable for making a defective product that causes emphysema, 
lung cancer and other illnesses. The verdict, if it stands, is 
expected to cost the tobacco industry billions in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, analysts said the verdict was no real surprise.  
Investors bought Philip Morris stock back on the belief that legal 
wrangling may delay payments to plaintiffs for many years. Rival 
tobacco company stocks fell modestly. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also knocked off kilter by a vacillating bond  
market. Bond prices initially tumbled today, with the 30-year 
Treasury bond dropping 1/2 point in price and its yield rising to 
6.08 percent from 6.04 percent late Wednesday. The rising yield 
served as a reminder to investors that higher interest rates are 
taking hold in the buoyant economy, and could threaten earnings in 
future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	But by afternoon, bond prices were recovering, due mostly to a  
recovery in European bond markets. The yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond slipped back to 5.99 by the afternoon, just under the 
6 percent level that tends to set off selling in stocks.
