Sydney denies any Olympic wrongdoing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Olympic organizers Sunday
denied allegations by a senior International Olympic Committee
(IOC) official that IOC members were bribed during Sydney's
successful bid for the 2000 Games.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior Swiss member of the IOC's executive board,
said in Lausanne that Games organizers in Sydney and at least three
other host cities paid for the votes of IOC members during the
bidding process.
	   Australian IOC member Phil Coles demanded an apology from
Hodler.
	   ``It's an extraordinary outburst and I don't know what's got
into him,'' Coles told ABC radio.
	   ``''There was absolutely nothing untoward (about Sydney's bid)
at all.''
	   Hodler's explosive allegations of corruption are not the first
leveled against the Olympic movement, but never before have such
claims been made by such a senior IOC official.
	   Hodler alleged malpractices in the campaigns conducted by
Atlanta for the 1996 Games, Nagano for 1998, Sydney for 2000 and in
Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 winter Games.
	   He said agents had demanded up to 1 million US dlrs to deliver
votes in the selection of host cities, and that he believed five to
seven percent of IOC members had solicited bribes. There are
currently 115 IOC members.
	   Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member,
had been involved in promising votes for payment, although he
declined to identify them.
	   Asked whether Sydney's election for the 2000 Games was clean,
Hodler said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened but I
don't want to disclose it.''
	   ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he
said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   Coles, speaking from Lausanne, said Hodler's allegations were
outrageous and disappointing. ``It's rather strange behavior.''
	   He said the only agents used in the Sydney bid were Australian
ambassadors.
	   ``He (Hodler) is totally off-track. We made no approaches to
anyone other than the normal, legitimate process. Our bid was run
on very legitimate grounds.
	   ``I have demanded an apology for Sydney and Australia.''
	   The allegations follow former New South Wales Olympic minister
Bruce Baird's revelation that he was asked to offer bribes in
exchange for votes for Sydney's bid, but refused.
	   Baird was also adamant no bribes were paid by Sydney's bid
committee. (djp)

International team wins Presidents Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Nobody wanted another War on the
Shore. Nobody expected a Massacre in Melbourne.
	   A hungry and relentless International team made short work of
the United States on a rainy Sunday at Royal Melbourne Golf Club,
winning the first two singles matches to clinch its first
Presidents Cup and the first one played outside the U.S.
	   Craig Parry, who pulled off one of several stunning shots that
carried the International team to a 14 1-2 to 5 1-2 lead after two
days, steamrolled past Justin Leonard for a 5 and 3 victory. Thirty
minutes later, Nick Price polished off David Duval 2 and 1, and the
celebration was on.
	   The Americans were leading six of the other 10 matches still on
the course when the loudest roar of the week rang out across Royal
Melbourne.
	   No matter. Barring a late charge _ something they haven't had
all week _ the Americans were headed for their worst loss ever in a
cup.
	   International captain Peter Thomson described the U.S. team as
the ``greatest collection of golfers in the world'' during the
opening ceremonies. Not this week. And particularly not at Royal
Melbourne.
	   ``After the 1996 matches, the International team wanted to show
that they're as good a group of players as any in the world,'' said
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. ``I think they demonstrated
that.''
	   The featured match of the day _ Greg Norman versus Tiger Woods _
was on the 10th holes when the cup was clinched. At the time, Woods
was 1-up.
	   The Presidents Cup was born in 1994 to give foreign players born
outside Europe a chance to compete in matches styled after the
Ryder Cup, and the Americans won the first two played at the Robert
Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia.
	   Norman and the International team campaigned hard for the
matches to
	   leave the United States, and now they Americans know why.
	   ``What a great feeling for us, especially after the last two
times,'' Price said after Duval conceded him a par on the 17th
hole.
	   Despite the move to Australia, both sides said these matches
would not take on the war-like mentality of the Ryder Cup since
Europe started winning in 1985.
	   No worries.
	   The United States barely managed to put up a fight, despite
having the top four players in the world rankings and eight of the
top 15 on their side.
	   ``I'm so proud of our guys,'' Price said. ``They played their
tails off this week, from No. 1 right down to No. 12.''
	   Indeed, from the time Frank Nobilo sank a 40-foot birdie putt on
the 18th
	   to give the International team its first point of the matches on
Friday, the
	   Americans were never in the game. (djp)

Rockets slam into Kabul killing at least 16 people
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket barrage shattered a northern
neighborhood of Kabul on Sunday killing at least 15 people and
wounding scores more, said eyewitnesses and hospital officials.
	   As many as 70 people were injured when two rockets blasted Kalai
Patula, a congested neighborhood where at dawn on Sunday three
rockets had landed killing a 15-year-old boy and wounding his
father.
	   Some of the worst damage was caused by one rocket that landed on
the road in front of a moving bus packed with people, said
eyewitnesses.
	   Taxi drivers in the area grabbed the dead and wounded and rushed
them to nearby hospitals. On the cold road dozens of people lay
wounded, bleeding and pleading for help.
	   Taliban soldiers in pickup trucks picked up the wounded and took
them to the city's hospitals.
	   But at the hospitals doctors and nurses struggled to treat the
worst with only a small amount of medicine. In some hospitals there
was no anesthetic and painkilling drugs had to be bought from the
market.
	   The International Red Cross ambulances screamed into the
neighborhood and hurried wounded to the two hospitals that it
supplies with medicines.
	   In one taxi, 7-year-old Zarmeen wailed and clung to her mother.
The little girl's leg was broken. Her mother cried and scolded her
daughter saying ``why did you go outside. I told you stay in the
house.''
	   No one took responsibility for the early morning rocket barrage,
but the rockets came from north of the city where anti-Taliban
fighters loyal to ousted military chief Ahmed Shah Massood are
deployed.
	   Earlier Sunday as people slept three rockets slammed into the
same area killing a 15-year-old named Zabiullah.
	   Dozens of relatives gathered at the shattered home in Kalai
Patula. They wrapped the Zabiullah's body in a white shroud and
placed him in the center of the rubble, while they sat around him
wailing and crying.
	   Zabiullah's father was in a nearby hospital, neighbors said. His
mother and sisters had been visiting a relative when the rocket
hit, they said.
	   Another rocket landed nearby destroying a home, but no one was
injured, said eyewitnesses in the area. The third rocket did not
cause any damage.
	   In recent days there have been several bouts of heavy fighting
between Massood's troops and Taliban soldiers at the front line
barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kabul.
	   The Taliban, which espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law, rule
roughly 90 percent of the country while their opponents the
remaining 10 percent.

 &UR; Skalbania out of jail &LR; 
	   VANCOUVER (CP) _ After spending just one night in jail,
businessman Nelson Skalbania has reportedly been outfitted with an
electronic ankle monitor and sent home.
	   Skalbania was jailed Thursday after the B.C. Court of Appeal
refused to overturn his one-year sentence for theft. Late Friday,
he was sent home to serve the rest of his sentence in the
community.
	   Though Skalbania's lawyer Leonard Doust would not confirm the
change, his client will reportedly be allowed to work. Because he
has no office, Skalbania will probably spend most of the next year
at home.
	   The well-known professional-sports team owner got into trouble
in 1991 when he misused $100,000 given to him by Gordon Gooch for a
real-estate deal.
	   The money was supposed to stay in a trust fund until the deal
came together. Instead, it was moved to cover a $50,000 overdraft,
the remainder going to another Skalbania firm and to himself, his
daughter and various creditors. He later repaid Gooch $100,000 plus
$4,000 for interest and inconvenience.
	   The man who once owned hockey great Wayne Gretzky, the Edmonton
Oilers, the Calgary Flames, the Montreal Alouettes and was a
part-owner of the B.C. Lions was originally acquitted of theft in
B.C. Supreme Court by Justice H.A.D Oliver, who ruled Skalbania
never had a criminal intent to steal the money.
	   The Crown appealed the acquittal, which was overturned by a
three-judge panel of the B.C. Court of Appeal, which sent it back
to B.C. Supreme Court for sentencing.
	   During sentencing last year, Justice Jon Sigurdson rejected the
argument of defence lawyer Peter Leask, who argued for a
conditional discharge.
	   Leask said the $100,000 theft was actually a technical breach _
``marginal criminality'' _ because Skalbania never intended to keep
the money but Sigurdson ruled Skalbania knew what he was doing was
wrong.
	   He sentenced Skalbania to a year in jail, a sentence upheld
Thursday by the Appeal Court which ruled the sentence was not
``clearly or manifestly excessive.'' 
	   Skalbania gave Gooch the run-around for three months but
eventually returned the money with $4,000 interest.
	   Skalbania, who was raised on Vancouver's working class east
side, made millions in real estate in the 1970s.
	   But in 1982, Skalbania's highly leveraged business world
collapsed. He claimed he was $40 million in debt.
	   To avoid bankruptcy, he struck a deal with his creditors,
agreeing to a five-year restructuring plan that allowed him to pay
them half of every dollar he made each year _ after the first
$90,000.
	   After five years, however, Skalbania had failed to provide any
money or even a proper accounting to his creditors. It wasn't until
1990, after he had paid only $800,000 on total debts of $8 million,
that he was discharged. (Vancouver Province)

EDs: Updates with Robinson-Gatti fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Vargas wrests title from Campas, Robinson beats Gatti &QL; 
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ When Fernando Vargas said the
more experienced Yory Boy Campas was made to order for him, he
wasn't being just a wisecracking 21-year-old.
	   ``A lot of people felt I couldn't do it,'' Vargas said after
winning the IBF junior middleweight championship Saturday night at
the Trump Taj Mahal. ``I proved them wrong.''
	   Vargas, fighting as a pro for the 15th time, pounded Campas into
submission after seven rounds of his 75th fight.
	   Vargas maintained before the fight that Campas would be easy to
hit.
	   ``Campas is like an old car,'' Vargas said. ``It looks good from
the outside but inside it's got a million miles on it.''
	   According to a CompuBox punch count, Vargas landed 202 of 403
punches while Campas connected on 76 of 259.
	   One judge had Vargas ahead by six points and the other two had
him ahead by four.
	   Vargas pounded Campas around the ring in the seventh round and,
at the end, the 27-year-old champion from Mexico, blood pouring
from a broken nose and badly cut upper lip, told his corner he had
had enough.
	   The fight preceded a 10-round lightweight war between Ivan
Robinson and Arturo Gatti, which Robinson won by a unanimous
decision.
	   ``I thought the first fight was better,'' said Robinson, who had
beaten Gatti on a split decision on Aug. 22. It's hard to imagine
how that fight could have been better than Saturday night's brawl.
	   For instance, in the seventh round, Gatti landed an incredible
41 of 75 punches. But in those same three minutes, Robinson
connected on 77 of 117.
	   Vargas had much the best of the first three rounds, landing
several sharp rights and some good left jabs.
	   Campas then tried to turn the flow but he really never gained
control. He looked slow and older than his 27 years.
	   In the seventh round, Vargas hurt Campas badly with an
eight-punch barrage at midround. Then he landed three or four other
combinations, twice knocking out Campas' mouthpiece.
	   At the end of the round, Campas knew his title was gone after
just his third loss against 72 victories. He had scored 62
knockouts.
	   Vargas, 15-0, all by knockout, earned dlrs 180,000 and put
himself into position for much bigger paydays. Campas earned about
dlrs 450,000.
	   Both fighters weighed 151 pounds.
	   The Robinson-Gatti fight was marked by toe-to-toe exchanges.
There were no knockdowns but both fighters were hurt on several
occasions and Gatti was cut above and below the left eye.
	   Gatti was staggered all over the ring by head punches in the
third round and he had Robinson badly hurt from body punches in the
ninth.
	   Gatti, however, lost a point in the ninth for low blows.
	   A crowd of 4,396 screamed encouragement throughout and some
booed the decision.
	   Two judges each favored Robinson by a point and the third had
Robinson ahead by five.
	   Robinson, of Philadelphia, was credited with landing 440 of 844
punches. Gatti connected on 342 of 742.
	   The contract weight limit for the fight was 136 pounds and Gatti
(29-4, 24 knockouts) weighed in officially at 135. Robinson
(20-7-2, 10 knockouts) weighed 133 3/4. At fight time, however,
Gatti weighed 150 and Robinson 145.

said, ``I will fight again.''

Maruyama makes name for himself at Presidents Cup

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with Maruyama's result &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ After winning all five of his
matches in the Presidents Cup, Shigeki Maruyama couldn't help but
smile. The Americans couldn't help but wonder: just who is this
guy?
	   One of the least-known players on an International team loaded
with stars
	   like Greg Norman, Steve Elkington, Vijay Singh and Ernie Els,
Maruyama stole the show at Royal Melbourne Golf Club.
	   The International won the Presidents Cup on Sunday, and Maruyama
was a big reason why.
	   Five matches, five victories and some pretty impressive scalps.
	   Maruyama, whose six professional victories have all come in
Japan, gave the International team its biggest lift Saturday in an
alternate-match with Craig Parry when he sank a 35-foot birdie putt
on the 17th hole to even the match against Fred Couples and Tiger
Woods.
	   Parry won it a hole later with a 50-foot chip-in for birdie.
	   In the afternoon, Maruyama teamed with countryman Joe Ozaki and
dusted off David Duval and Phil Mickelson in a best-ball match.
After Mickelson squared the match with a 30-foot putter, Maruyama
proved ended the match it a hurry with three straight birdies for a
3 and 2 victory.
	   Events like the Presidents Cup or Ryder Cup are a perfect place
for an unknown star to emerge, and this year the label fits nicely
on the 5-foot-6 Japanese dynamo.
	   ``It certainly has brought the recognition of players into focus
_ other than the United States players and Australian players who
we all know about,'' said U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus. ``From a
television standpoint, I think it's wonderful.''
	   Maruyama is regarded in Japan as the next Jumbo Ozaki, who has
won over 100 tournaments and is ranked No. 13 in the world. But the
knock on Ozaki is that he can never win outside Japan.
	   Maruyama already is a little more traveled.
	   Not only was he among the early leaders in the 1996 British Open
and this
	   year's PGA Championship at Sahalee, the long-hitting Maruyama
finished 11th in the World Series of Golf in August, which was won
by Duval.
	   ``Outside of Japan, a lot of people don't think of Japanese golf
at this level,'' Maruyama said through an interpreter. ``We wanted
to do our best and
	   to represent Japan to everyone around the world.
	   ``We don't go out of Japan very much, but when we do, we like to
play well.''
	   Going into Sunday's matches, only two players had unblemished
records through two days and 20 matches at Royal Melbourne _
Maruyama and Joe Ozaki, added to the team when his brother Jumbo
decided he didn't want to make the trip. But Joe Ozaki lost his
singles match Sunday to Scott Hoch 4 and 3.
	   Ozaki's two wins came in the best-ball matches when he was
teamed with Maruyama. And Maruyama has been the difference-maker.
	   In their 4 and 3 victory over Mark Calcavecchia and John Huston,
Maruyama
	   made three straight birdies on the front side for a 3-up lead
than they never relinquished. On Saturday, he once again gave the
Japanese team the early lead with birdie putts, then turned it on
right when it looked like Mickelson and Duval were ready to make a
run.
	   In the alternate-shot matches, Maruyama took advantage of
Parry's knowledge of Royal Melbourne _ they whipped U.S. Open
champion Lee Janzen and
	   Hoch 3 and 2 on Friday, then added the 1-up victory over Woods
and Couples on Saturday.
	   ``I hit where Mr. Parry told me to hit,'' Maruyama said.
	   On Sunday, Maruyama beat John Huston 3 and 2 to continue his
amazing run and tie the record held by Mark O'Meara in 1996.
Maruyama was never down in his match with Huston and won the match
on the 16th hole when he and his opponent halved the hole.
	   Maruyama will never be confused for O'Meara, the Masters and
British Open
	   champion, but he's certainly making a name for himself.
	   ``Maruyama hasn't played much in the States, but when he plays,
he usually plays pretty well,'' said Nicklaus, who has watched him
at his own Memorial Tournament on the PGA Tour. ``He's a pretty
darn good player.''
	   The Americans found that out in a hurry. (df/rs/djp)

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After a nine-month stalemate, the Mexican
House of Representatives passed a bill Saturday approving a
controversial dlrs 67-billion bailout plan of private banks by a
325-159 vote.
	   After a nearly five-hour debate, the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, joined a proposal made by the
right-center National Action Party which makes only minor
modifications to the plan submitted in March by President Ernesto
Zedillo.
	   The agreement, which makes taxpayers pay for most of the
bailout, was bitterly opposed by the left-center Democratic
Revolution Party, or PRD, and the smaller Green and Labor parties.
	   Zedillo's bailout incensed the opposition because it was
implemented over several years without prior congressional
approval, as required by the Constitution.
	   Its cost was estimated at dlrs 55 billion when it was presented
to congress last spring, but Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria
acknowledged during a congressional hearing last month that it had
ballooned to some dlrs 67 billion due to accrued interest.
	   The cost of the bailout ``will be borne by at least two
generations of Mexicans, thus limiting our ability to become a
developed nation,'' said Rep. Veronica Velasco of the Green Party.
	   Zedillo has defended the bailout saying it was necessary to
prevent a collapse of the financial system and a wider economic
crisis.
	   But most Mexicans see the bailout as benefiting wealthy bankers
with government ties, some of which donated millions of dollars to
Zedillo's 1994 campaign. Three former bankers have been charged
with fraud by the attorney general's office.
	   National Action Rep. Santiago Creel said his party's proposal
``ensures that taxpayers won't be made to pay for a single peso of
campaign finance contributions that led to bankruptcies and might
have been absorbed'' by the bailout fund.
	   The revised bill creates a new government institute to
substitute the much-maligned Bank Savings Protection Fund, or
Fobaproa, which absorbed billions of dollars in bad loans following
the 1994-95 economic meltdown that sent interest rates soaring.
	   That institute would assume most of the overdue loans held by
Fobaproa, but apparently would exclude loans found to be illegal in
an audit that is under way and is expected to last more than six
months.
	   ``The new institute is a forceful break with the past,'' Creel
said.
	   But PRD Rep. Pablo Gomez poured scorn on Creel's remarks, saying
the new institute is ``a thinly-disguised Fobaproa.''
	   As part of its compromise with the government, National Action
backed down on demands that Zedillo request the resignation of
central bank Gov. Guillermo Ortiz, who as finance minister in the
mid-90's oversaw the bailout process.
	   PRD legislators chanted ``Betrayal! Betrayal!'' at National
Action legislators who just a few days ago had publicly promised
they would vote against their own party's initiative if Ortiz did
not resign.
	   Ortiz is likely to remain in his post in the near future, but
will be barred from the board of the new Savings Protection
Institute and must fight impeachment proceedings initiated by
National Action and the PRD.
	   The new bailout bill also led to protests by a militant debtors
group that stormed Saturday's session and pelted lawmakers with
flour _ forcing an hour-long recess _ leading Mexico City police in
riot gear to block the main entrance to Congress.
	   Congress will be in session through Tuesday, the deadline for
approving the 1999 federal budget.

Hosts caught in boycott row

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian countries, including co-hosts
Japan and South Korea, might boycott the 2002 World Cup in protest
over FIFA's qualification rules, a leading official said Sunday.
	   Olympic Council of Asia president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah said the
two nations would be expected to boycott their own World Cup if
action was taken.
	   FIFA has decided to cut the number of Asian teams that can gain
2002 World Cup places from qualifying rounds to two, from the 1998
total of three places plus a playoff chance. With Japan and South
Korea getting automatic qualification as hosts, the Asian
contingent would be the same as at the France World Cup this year,
where Iran joined the top three qualifiers from the Asian zone.
	   ``We will boycott the World Cup unless FIFA changes their
mind,'' Sheikh Al-Sabah, also the president of the Kuwait soccer
federation, told The Associated Press on Sunday. ``We think it's
not fair. We had three and a half chances at the last World Cup and
now they're offering two. We have 50 percent of the World Cup
sponsors from our region.''
	   The FIFA decision would leave two places to be contested among
43 countries.
	   There would seem to be little prospect of Japan and South Korea
giving up the chance to play in their own World Cup and Sheikh
Al-Sabah admitted they would be confronted with a difficult
decision.
	   ``I don't know if Japan and South Korea would follow, it's their
own decision. Maybe they would be happy taking part, but they
should realize they are part of the Asian confederation and still
will be after the World Cup.''
	   The Asian Football Confederation's 17-member executive committee
will hold a meeting on the issue in Bangkok on Tuesday.
	   Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia went through to France 98
after filling the top three spots in regional qualifying play while
Iran beat Oceania leader Australia in a playoff to get another
place.

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ Tricia Byrnes of New Canaan,
Conn., outbattled continual snow Saturday to win a World Cup
halfpipe competition at Whistler Mountain.
	   In the men's halfpipe contest, defending World Cup champion
Fredrik Sterner of Sweden and Olympic bronze medalist Ross Powers
of the United States, tied with 44.0 points apiece. However,
Sterner won on technical merit scores.
	   Zach Horwitz of the United States, was fourth (32.6).
	   ``Everyone rode well in difficult conditions,'' said Powers, who
leads the World Cup points after three snowboard contests. ``Any
time you get on the podium (top three), it feels good.''
	   Byrnes, who collected about dlrs 6,500 (9,000 Swiss francs) for
her second victory of the season, received 37.9 points to 34.7 for
French rider Doriane Vidal. Kim Stacey of the United States, was
third (33.8) and Michele Taggart of the United States, fourth
(33.2) on the third day of the meet.
	   ``The snow conditions were more a nuisance than anything but
they didn't slow me down that much,'' Byrnes said. ``The crew did a
very good job maintaining the 'pipe so it stayed in good shape.''

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A hungry and relentless
International team made short work of the United States on a rainy
Sunday at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, winning the first two singles
matches to clinch its first Presidents Cup.
	   Craig Parry, who pulled off one of several stunning shots that
carried the International team to a 14 1-2 to 5 1-2 lead after two
days, steamrolled past Justin Leonard for a 5 and 3 victory. Thirty
minutes later, Nick Price polished off David Duval 2 and 1, and the
celebration was on.
	   With 32 points up for grabs over three days, 16 1-2 was the
total the International squad was looking for.
	   The Americans were leading six of the other 10 matches still on
the course when the loudest roar of the week rang out across Royal
Melbourne.
	   No matter. Barring a late charge _ something they haven't had
all week _ the Americans were headed for their worst loss ever in a
cup.
	   International captain Peter Thomson described the U.S. team as
the ``greatest collection of golfers in the world'' during the
opening ceremonies. Not this week. And particularly not at Royal
Melbourne.
	   ``After the 1996 matches, the International team wanted to show
that they're as good a group of players as any in the world,'' said
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. ``I think they demonstrated
that.''
	   The featured match of the day _ Greg Norman versus Tiger Woods _
was on the 10th holes when the cup was clinched. At the time, Woods
was 1-up.
	   The Presidents Cup was born in 1994 to give foreign players born
outside Europe a chance to compete in matches styled after the
Ryder Cup, and the Americans won the first two played at the Robert
Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia.
	   Norman and the International team campaigned hard for the
matches to leave the United States, and now they Americans know
why.
	   ``What a great feeling for us, especially after the last two
times,'' Price said after Duval conceded him a par on the 17th
hole.
	   Despite the move to Australia, both sides said these matches
would not take on the war-like mentality of the Ryder Cup since
Europe started winning in 1985.
	   But the United States barely managed to put up a fight, despite
having the top four players in the world rankings and eight of the
top 15 on their side.
	   ``I'm so proud of our guys,'' Price said. ``They played their
tails off this week, from No. 1 right down to No. 12.''
	   Indeed, from the time Frank Nobilo sank a 40-foot birdie putt on
the 18th to give the International team its first point of the
matches on Friday, the Americans were never in the game.
	   The Americans needed a miracle on Sunday and instead got the
same old story: putts breaking away from the cup at the last
minute, the International
	   putts falling right in the heart.
	   Parry, who grew up in Melbourne and has played the course under
every imaginable condition, never trailed in his match against
Leonard and took control in typical fashion. After Leonard hit a
wedge to three feet on the fifth hole, Parry dunked a 20-footer,
and all Leonard could manage was to halve the hole.
	   Parry made another 20-foot birdie hole on the sixth, then went
3-up on the next hole when Leonard three-putted from about 30 feet.
	   Right behind, Duval was tasting a similar fate.
	   He had a 4-foot birdie putt on the fifth to square his match
with Price, but it somehow slid by on the left. Price went 2-up on
the seventh with a 25-foot birdie putt and never looked back.
	   Duval made only two birdies, both on par-5s, and conceded the
match when yet another 20-footer was off line.
	   Price gave a high-five to his caddie, threw his ball into the
crowd and hugged assistant captain Wayne Grady before shaking hands
with Jack Nicklaus, a losing captain once again.
	   Nicklaus was in charge of the U.S. team when it became the first
to lose a Ryder Cup on American soil. These matches were played on
Thomson's home turf, and the five-time British Open champion was
beaming.
	   ``This was the greatest thing I've ever done,'' said Thomson.

Survivors blame pilot for crash of Thai Airways jet liner

<TEXT>
	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ As police and soldiers in Thailand
on Sunday wrapped up a search for the last of 101 victims from the
crash of a Thai Airways jetliner, witnesses and some of the 45
survivors blamed the pilot for the tragic accident.
	   After finding parts of the last body which had been unaccounted
for, police officials said they would reduce their search team from
320 to 50 and continue sifting through debris for belongings of
those who had been on board.
	   The Airbus A310-200 plane crashed into a flooded rubber
plantation during a heavy rainstorm Friday evening as it made a
third attempt to land at Surat Thani, a port and fishing village
that serves as a gateway to several resort islands popular with
foreign tourists.
	   ``It was a mistake to try and land a third time,'' said a
sobbing Supakit Saejiew, whose friend Tawatchai Klaiwatanamath
perished in the crash of Flight TG261.
	   ``He tried to land two times and couldn't. I didn't think he
would try again. Then I saw the crash and the fire,'' said Supakit,
who had been waiting to pick up the friend at the airport in Surat
Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Others questioned the pilot's action as well.
	   ``I prayed for the captain to take the plane back because I was
really afraid. Why didn't he?'' Vinai Uamnabtue, who survived, but
lost his seven-year-old son, was quoted as saying by the Bangkok
Post.
	   But Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, who
lost his sister in the crash, told The Nation newspaper he objected
to anyone blaming the pilot, who also died in the crash, before the
facts become known.
	   Thai Airways President Thamanoon Wanglee said Saturday it was
too soon to know exactly what caused the crash, but that the
plane's black box had been recovered and an investigation was
underway.
	   Thai Airways officials said a foreign insurance company would
participate in an autopsy on captain Pinit Vechasilp to determine
if he might have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
	   Airbus officials were also on their way to Thailand from France
to participate in the probe.
	   At least 25 foreigners were on board. Twelve survived: three
Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one
Briton.
	   The United States embassy in Bangkok said two Americans, Ken
Houseman of Montana, and Helen Gromme from Wyoming, were among
those who died. Their hometowns were not available.
	   Many of the bodies already recovered have been burned beyond
recognition, police and doctors said, making identification
difficult.
	   Meanwhile, weather forecasters on ITV, an independent television
station, said Sunday severe storms were about to hit the southern
coast of Thailand and advised anyone on resort islands in the area
to leave as soon as possible.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with arrival details and security incident;
 &UR; Cambodian prime minister arrives in Hanoi
 &UR; Precede PHNOM PENH
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Hun Sen's arrival in Vietnam for a state
visit caused a media stir Sunday that ended with a security guard
knocking over a lamp which hit the Cambodian prime minister on the
back of the neck.
	   Hun Sen did not appear to be injured in the incident at the
Sofitel Metropole hotel, where he is staying while having meetings
over the next two days on the sidelines of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations summit.
	   He still hopes Cambodia will be admitted in time for him to join
the region's other nine leaders at their formal talks Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   Hun Sen made no comments when he left Phnom Penh early Sunday or
after his plane landed at Hanoi's Noibai Airport a short while
later. Dozens of reporters and cameramen awaited his arrival at the
hotel's entrance.
	   Security guards began shoving members of the press to create a
path into the hotel for Hun Sen, who declined to respond to
questions shouted at him.
	   The media followed Hun Sen inside, and the guards again created
a path to an elevator. As he began to enter an elevator car, a
nearby security guard bumped a head-high pedestal, and a lamp came
tumbling down.
	   It hit Hun Sun, and the Cambodian leader looked shocked as he
grabbed his neck before continuing into the elevator.
	   Cambodia's admission has been a hot topic at pre-summit
meetings. ASEAN foreign ministers said after discussing the issue
over dinner Friday that they could not reach a consensus and would
leave it up to their leaders to decide.
	   Before leaving Phnom Penh, Cambodian Foreign Affairs Secretary
of State Ouch Kim An said it would be disheartening and potentially
damaging for Cambodia to have its membership application put on
hold for the second time in as many years.
	   ``We will be disappointed if we will not be admitted because we
have been prepared for more than a year to enter ASEAN,'' he said.
``It is economically important for us to be a part of ASEAN. We
cannot be isolated.''
	   Cambodia was originally scheduled to join the grouping in July
1997 along with Laos and Myanmar, but its admission was delayed
after Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
in a violent coup.
	   Following a close election this July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
settled their differences last month and formed a coalition
government. Hun Sen was made sole prime minister in the deal and
the prince was named president of the National Assembly.
	   Host nation Vietnam had spearheaded the effort to get its
neighbor accepted this time, reportedly even putting together a
schedule for an admission ceremony at the summit.
	   However, several foreign ministers apparently stuck to their
views that Hun Sen's coalition with his former enemy must prove
stable first, saying loose ends remain, including a controversial
plan to form an upper house of Parliament in Cambodia.

Japan nationalizes ailing bank for second time in postwar era
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government decided Sunday to take over
operations of a major bank hobbled by bad loans, overriding
objections from bank executives who insisted Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. was not insolvent.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marks only the
second time since World War II that a major bank has come under
state control, following the takeover of the Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan Ltd. in October.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made the decision after financial
authorities declared Nippon Credit insolvent with at least 3.2
trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) in unrecoverable or high-risk loans
and massive stock valuation losses, said a spokesman for the Prime
Minister's Office.
	   Nippon Credit, with 2,000 employees, was among the world's top
50 banks in 1997, according to Fortune magazine, with assets
totaling 12.3 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion).
	   The widely expected move to nationalize the bank was the latest
act in a drama which began early last week when Japan's Chuo Trust
and Banking Co. denied reports it was considering a buyout of
Nippon Trust.
	   By Friday, the Financial Supervisory Agency had determined that
the bank could not restructure on its own and moved to pull the
plug. But Nippon Credit executives balked at a government request
on Saturday that they voluntarily apply for nationalization.
	   Following an extraordinary board meeting, Nippon Trust submitted
a petition to the government early Sunday contesting the Financial
Supervisory Agency's assessment of its balance sheet, Kyodo News
reported.
	   But the last minute appeal failed.
	   Bank executives who oppose the nationalization have argued that
the agency's standards for judging loan risks were too strict. But
they may also have feared a government takeover because the law
requires top managers of nationalized banks to resign.
	   Many of the problem loans which hurt Nippon Credit were made by
subsidiaries which extended easy credit to real estate developers
during a speculative land price boom in the late 1980s. These debts
quickly soured at the outset of this decade with the collapse of
Japan's so-called ``bubble'' economy.
	   Nippon Credit, one of Japan's three so-called long-term credit
banks, was also fatally wounded by its inability to successfully
branch out from a traditional role as a supplier of low-cost loans
to industry.
	   Recent deregulation has reduced the demand for such loans by
allowing companies to raise money more cheaply by issuing bonds and
selling equity.
	   The government was expected to announce plans shortly for buying
all outstanding shares of Nippon Credit. But because the bank has
been declared insolvent, current shareholders are unlikely to
receive much, if any, compensation.
	   That would result in big losses for major shareholders such as
Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Nippon Life Insurance Co.
Another loser would be Bankers Trust Corp., the New York-based
investment bank acquired last month by Deutsche Bank AG.
	   In September of 1997, Bankers Trust said it bought dlrs 10
million worth of Nippon Credit stock to cement a tie-up with the
Japanese bank. It had planned to gradually raise its equity stake
in Nippon Credit to about 4 percent within three years.
	   But Japan's leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai, reported
Sunday that NCB will dissolve the strategic alliance with Bankers
Trust following its nationalization.

Singapore minister: Indonesia trouble threatens sea lanes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The safety of vital shipping lanes in Asian
could be threatened if economic and social turmoil in Indonesia
triggers a flood of refugees, Singapore's defense minister said in
an interview published Sunday.
	   ``If there is instability and lawlessness in Indonesia, this
could lead to, for example, a greater outflow of illegal immigrants
as well as threaten the safety of passage of ships in the Straits
of Malacca and the South China Sea,'' Tony Tan, who also serves as
deputy prime minister, was quoted as saying by The Sunday Times.
	   ``This would be of very great concern to a trading nation like
Japan, as well as to Singapore and other countries,'' he said.
	   Tan added that Japanese Cabinet ministers with whom he met
during a trip to Tokyo last week had expressed great concern about
Indonesia, fearing a resumption of rioting.
	   He also said Japan and Singapore had agreed to increase
exchanges between their armies and navies, and to have more
officers to participate in joint training courses.
	   Indonesia faces its worst economic crisis in decades. The
Southeast Asian country is beset by mass unemployment, food
shortages and sporadic riots and looting.

ASEAN ministers gather to discuss Asian crisis

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A day after meeting separately to discuss
a regional economic crisis, Southeast Asian foreign and economic
ministers held joint talks Sunday to finalize a plan of action for
endorsement by their leaders later this week.
	   They spoke of ``bold measures,'' some of which would take effect
almost immediately, in an effort to shore up investor confidence
and show the world they are willing to impose tough steps instead
of just talking about them.
	   Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said the officials
approved three documents in the morning _ including a final
declaration and a plan of action _ for endorsement at the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   A new, separate document on the ``bold measures'' was almost
complete except for a schedule on speeding up tariff cuts as part
of an ASEAN Free Trade Area, he said.
	   The original plan called for some tariffs to be cut to zero to 5
percent by 2000 and zero by 2003. The latter date already has been
moved up to 2002 for developed countries, but Thailand and other
nations want it sped up to 2000, Cam said.
	   The 2003 deadline would remain in effect for developing
countries.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the economic
ministers understand now is the best time for liberalizing reforms
and integration within ASEAN, despite protectionist pressure from
domestic industries that want tariff increases.
	   ``During good times, everyone wants to protect their profit
margins,'' Siazon said. ``During a crisis, they really know they
have to consolidate because there is not enough capital in one
small country.
	   ``We know that unless we consolidate our economic integration,
we cannot really compete later on in global markets.''
	   The economic ministers spent more than eight hours Saturday
crafting the economic measures, then sought approval from home
after considering the impact of incentives for foreign investors
and tariff cuts.
	   There also were proposals for making capital equipment duty-free
in ASEAN's nine member countries and moving up the establishment of
an ASEAN Investment Area by several years.
	   Siazon said the group was considering steps to speed up the
establishment of an ASEAN-centered bond market as well. That plan
is currently envisaged for 2010.
	   The measures were developed after the economic ministers told
their senior officials, who had worked out the joint declaration
and plan of action earlier in the week, to bolster their proposals
with more reforms.
	   However, Cam said there was general agreement that
more-developed countries will have a faster deadline for
implementation that their underdeveloped neighbors.
	   One goal was to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group of less-developed and rapidly
industrializing nations. But the region's economies already range
from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said deputy finance
ministers and central bank governors from Southeast Asian nations
will hold regular ``ad hoc'' meetings with their counterparts from
China,
	   ``There is a need for consultation as we move into the 21st
century,'' he said.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sun arrived Sunday for a state
visit and hoped to stay on for the summit, although it was
uncertain if it would be as an observer or as a full-fledged
member.
	   Whether or not to admit Cambodia has been a sticky issue for
ASEAN. It had been scheduled to join in July 1997, but its
membership was put on hold due to domestic political turmoil.
Agreement on a coalition government was reached late last month.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

	   In San Jose, California, Jeff Friesen broke out of a slump by
scoring twice on the power play and the San Jose Sharks beat the
Washington Capitals, ending their six-game winless streak.
	   Friesen, who had gone without a goal in his 10 previous games,
put together his 16th career two-goal game in the second period,
when San Jose outshot the Capitals 17-3.

Survivors blame pilot for crash of Thai Airways jet liner

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ As police and soldiers in Thailand
on Sunday wrapped up a search for the last of 101 victims from the
crash of a Thai Airways jetliner, witnesses and some of the 45
survivors blamed the pilot for the tragic accident.
	   After finding parts of the last body which had been unaccounted
for, police officials said they would reduce their search team from
320 to 50 and continue sifting through debris for belongings of
those who had been on board.
	   The Airbus A310-200 plane crashed into a flooded rubber
plantation during a heavy rainstorm Friday evening as it made a
third attempt to land at Surat Thani, a port and fishing village
that serves as a gateway to several resort islands popular with
foreign tourists.
	   ``It was a mistake to try and land a third time,'' said a
sobbing Supakit Saejiew, whose friend Tawatchai Klaiwatanamath
perished in the crash of Flight TG261.
	   ``He tried to land two times and couldn't. I didn't think he
would try again. Then I saw the crash and the fire,'' said Supakit,
who had been waiting to pick up the friend at the airport in Surat
Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Others questioned the pilot's action as well.
	   ``I prayed for the captain to take the plane back because I was
really afraid. Why didn't he?'' Vinai Uamnabtue, who survived, but
lost his seven-year-old son, was quoted as saying by the Bangkok
Post.
	   But Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, who
lost his sister in the crash, told The Nation newspaper he objected
to anyone blaming the pilot, who also died in the crash, before the
facts become known.
	   Thai Airways President Thamanoon Wanglee said Saturday it was
too soon to know exactly what caused the crash, but that the
plane's black box had been recovered and an investigation was
underway.
	   The decision to attempt a third landing during a rainstorm
appeared to contradict the air carrier's standing policy.
	   In June, when the airline announced it was phasing out the use
of foreign pilots in favor of Thais, Chamlong Poompuang, deputy
vice president of flight operations, said cockpit crews had been
instructed to exercise great caution.
	   Pilots were told to divert planes to other airports when weather
conditions deteriorate and were explicitly forbidden from
attempting landings during storms, he said.
	   Thai Airways officials said a foreign insurance company would
participate in an autopsy on captain Pinit Vechasilp to determine
if he might have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
	   Airbus officials were also on their way to Thailand from France
to participate in the probe.
	   At least 25 foreigners were on board. Twelve survived: three
Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one
Briton.
	   The United States embassy in Bangkok said two Americans, Ken
Houseman of Montana, and Helen Gromme from Wyoming, were among
those who died. Their hometowns were not available.
	   Many of the bodies already recovered have been burned beyond
recognition, police and doctors said, making identification
difficult.
	   Meanwhile, weather forecasters on ITV, an independent television
station, said Sunday severe storms were about to hit the southern
coast of Thailand and advised anyone on resort islands in the area
to leave as soon as possible.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A day after meeting separately to discuss
a regional economic crisis, Southeast Asian foreign and economic
ministers held joint talks Sunday to finalize a plan of action for
endorsement by their leaders later this week.
	   They spoke of ``bold measures,'' some of which would take effect
almost immediately, in an effort to shore up investor confidence
and show the world they are willing to impose tough steps instead
of just talking about them.
	   Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said the officials
approved three documents in the morning _ including a final
declaration and a plan of action _ for endorsement at the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   A new, separate document on the ``bold measures'' was almost
complete except for a schedule on speeding up tariff cuts as part
of an ASEAN Free Trade Area, he said.
	   The original plan called for some tariffs to be cut to zero to 5
percent by 2000 and zero by 2003. The latter date already has been
moved up to 2002 for developed countries, but Thailand and other
nations want it sped up to 2000, Cam said.
	   The 2003 deadline would remain in effect for developing
countries.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the economic
ministers understand now is the best time for liberalizing reforms
and integration within ASEAN, despite protectionist pressure from
domestic industries that want tariff increases.
	   ``During good times, everyone wants to protect their profit
margins,'' Siazon said. ``During a crisis, they really know they
have to consolidate because there is not enough capital in one
small country.
	   ``We know that unless we consolidate our economic integration,
we cannot really compete later on in global markets.''
	   The economic ministers spent more than eight hours Saturday
crafting the economic measures, then sought approval from home
after considering the impact of incentives for foreign investors
and tariff cuts.
	   There also were proposals for making capital equipment duty-free
in ASEAN's nine member countries and moving up the establishment of
an ASEAN Investment Area by several years.
	   Siazon said the group was considering steps to speed up the
establishment of an ASEAN-centered bond market as well. That plan
is currently envisaged for 2010.
	   The measures were developed after the economic ministers told
their senior officials, who had worked out the joint declaration
and plan of action earlier in the week, to bolster their proposals
with more reforms.
	   However, Cam said there was general agreement that
more-developed countries will have a faster deadline for
implementation that their underdeveloped neighbors.
	   One goal was to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group of less-developed and rapidly
industrializing nations. But the region's economies already range
from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said deputy finance
ministers and central bank governors from Southeast Asian nations
will hold regular ``ad hoc'' meetings with their counterparts from
China,
	   ``There is a need for consultation as we move into the 21st
century,'' he said.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sun arrived Sunday for a state
visit and hoped to stay on for the summit, although it was
uncertain if it would be as an observer or as a full-fledged
member.
	   Whether or not to admit Cambodia has been a sticky issue for
ASEAN. It had been scheduled to join in July 1997, but its
membership was put on hold due to domestic political turmoil.
Agreement on a coalition government was reached late last month.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

India beats Pakistan in kabaddi opener

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India, raiding aggressively, beat
traditional rival Pakistan 17-9 Sunday in the first match of the
seven-nation Asian Games kabaddi competition.
	   At the break after 20 minutes of play, the defending champion
Indians were leading 10-6 in the South Asian sport, a kind of team
tag.
	   ``We played aggressive kabaddi and got the dividend,'' said
Indian captain Biswajit Palit.
	   ``Indeed, we were tense because we were playing Pakistan,'' said
Palit, a clerk for the Indian Railways in the eastern city of
Calcutta.
	   India and Pakistan, neighbors on the Asian subcontinent, have
fought three wars and come close to another. Their political
tensions often spill over into sporting arenas.
	   But Sunday's match proceeded without incident on the newly laid
kabaddi court at the University of Ongkharak, about 60 kilometers
(36 miles) from Bangkok.
	   Before the match, the Pakistani team, led by captain Mohammed
Sarwar, gave a battle cry, ``Allah ho-Akbar'' (God is great).
	   The Indians looked back, but there was no reaction.
	   The Indians entered the arena and touched the ground with folded
hands - a sign of respect to mother earth.
	   India went into the lead in the first two minutes but Pakistan,
playing a defensive game, managed to snatch one point. It later
leveled the score at 4-4.
	   But then the Indians went flat out and raided Pakistan's zone
successfully. For India, B.C. Ramesh scored five points, all by
raiding.
	   ``The Indians were lucky, so they won,'' said Pakistani captain
Sarwar, 34. ``We will come back.''
	   The sport, requiring strategy and breath control, draws its name
from the rule requiring raiders to continually say ``kabaddi''
while in enemy territory. Opponents try to pin down the raiders
until they run out of breath and can't keep up the chant.
	   India won the gold medal at the last Asian Games in 1994,
besting Pakistan and Nepal.
	   Those teams are back for these games, along with Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Japan and host Thailand.

operations of a major bank hobbled by bad loans, overriding
objections from bank executives who insisted Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. was not insolvent.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marks only the
second time since World War II that a major bank has come under
state control, following the takeover of the Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan Ltd. in October.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made the decision after financial
authorities declared Nippon Credit insolvent with at least 3.2
trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) in unrecoverable or high-risk loans
and massive stock valuation losses, said a spokesman for the Prime
Minister's Office.
	   Nippon Credit, with 2,000 employees, was among the world's top
50 banks in 1997, according to Fortune magazine, with assets
totaling 12.3 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion).
	   The widely expected move to nationalize the bank was the latest
act in a drama which began early last week when Japan's Chuo Trust
and Banking Co. denied reports it was considering a buyout of
Nippon Trust.
	   Prime Minister Obuchi said the action was taken to safeguard
depositors and shore up confidence in the Japanese financial
system.
	   ``The government will continue to take all possible measures to
protect depositors to maintain order in the financial system and to
stabilize financial markets both in Japan and abroad,'' he was
quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency.
	   On Friday, the Financial Supervisory Agency had determined that
the bank could not restructure on its own and moved to pull the
plug. But Nippon Credit executives balked at a government request
on Saturday that they voluntarily apply for nationalization.
	   Following an extraordinary board meeting, Nippon Trust submitted
a petition to the government early Sunday contesting the Financial
Supervisory Agency's assessment of its balance sheet, Kyodo News
reported.
	   But the last minute appeal failed.
	   Bank executives who oppose the nationalization have argued that
the agency's standards for judging loan risks were too strict. But
they may also have feared a government takeover because the law
requires top managers of nationalized banks to resign.
	   Many of the problem loans which hurt Nippon Credit were made by
subsidiaries which extended easy credit to real estate developers
during a speculative land price boom in the late 1980s. These debts
quickly soured at the outset of this decade with the collapse of
Japan's so-called ``bubble'' economy.
	   Nippon Credit, one of Japan's three so-called long-term credit
banks, was also fatally wounded by its inability to successfully
branch out from a traditional role as a supplier of low-cost loans
to industry.
	   Recent deregulation has reduced the demand for such loans by
allowing companies to raise money more cheaply by issuing bonds and
selling equity.
	   The government was expected to announce plans shortly for buying
all outstanding shares of Nippon Credit. But because the bank has
been declared insolvent, current shareholders are unlikely to
receive much, if any, compensation.
	   That would result in big losses for major shareholders such as
Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Nippon Life Insurance Co.
Another loser would be Bankers Trust Corp., the New York-based
investment bank acquired last month by Deutsche Bank AG.
	   In September of 1997, Bankers Trust said it bought dlrs 10
million worth of Nippon Credit stock to cement a tie-up with the
Japanese bank. It had planned to gradually raise its equity stake
in Nippon Credit to about 4 percent within three years.
	   But Japan's leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai, reported
Sunday that NCB will dissolve the strategic alliance with Bankers
Trust following its nationalization.

Teen gangs clash with police in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to stress police stations attacked; ADDS military
comment; AMENDS overline

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stone-throwing teenage gangs clashed
with security personnel and damaged police stations in the city of
Solo on Sunday, the military said.
	   Privately-owned SCTV said at least 10 people were injured.
	   The military said 39 people had been arrested after several
police stations were pelted with stones.
	   SCTV said fighting among the gangs and police broke out at about
2 a.m. local time and raged for five hours.
	   It quoted witnesses as saying the local police chief's house was
attacked by a mob in the city of about 2 million people, 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   A small market was burned along with two cars.
	   SCTV quoted police spokesman Col. Zainal Abidin as saying
security forces brought the situation under control by 7 a.m.
	   The trigger for Sunday's riot was not immediately clear.
However, residents said tensions have been running high among
police and local youths for some time.
	   Solo, the ancient capital of what once had been an important
royal dynasty in the center of the island of Java, has been plagued
repeatedly by civil unrest.
	   The latest violence follows a brawl among rival villagers on the
tourist island of Bali on Friday when at least three people were
killed and two others were reported missing.
	   Bali is located about 945 kilometers (590 miles) east of the
capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
	   Social turmoil has increased in Indonesia since the Southeast
Asian country was hit hard by a regional financial crisis last
year. Tensions have mounted amid mass unemployment, food shortages
and fears of political instability.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May during riots that helped
force longtime authoritarian President Suharto to quit.
	   Solo was badly hit by that wave of violence with many house and
other buildings ransacked or burned.

Indonesian President asks Muslims to protect Christian churches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Worried by a rise in religious
violence, Indonesia's Islamic president called on fellow Muslims
Sunday to help the Christian minority protect churches against
attack.
	   Twenty-two churches were burned or ransacked on Nov. 22 after
tensions erupted between Indonesia's Muslim majority and Christian
minority in the capital, Jakarta.
	   Fourteen people were killed and the violence sparked revenge
attacks on mosques in other places.
	   Speaking to 10,000 Muslim worshippers at dawn prayers, Habibie
said fighting among religions was against the tenets of Islam,
which first came to Indonesia in the 7th century.
	   ``Muslims should respect houses of God that belong to other
religions,'' he said at Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in
Southeast Asia.
	   ``We even have an obligation to protect them if certain groups
want to destroy these houses of God,'' he said.
	   Habibie has repeatedly condemned violence based on religious
grounds and on Sunday he called on Christians to also respect
Islam.
	   Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic crisis in three
decades.
	   Soaring inflation, mass unemployment and widespread poverty
helped lead to the ouster of Habibie's predecessor, former
President Suharto in May.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people follow Islam,
making it the world's largest Muslim country. Others are mainly
Christian, Buddhist or Hindu.
	   Religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy,
Pancasila as well as the constitution.

International team wins Presidents Cup

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Relentless from the start,
determined to the end, the International team won its first
Presidents Cup on a rainy Sunday at Royal Melbourne Golf Club that
the Americans couldn't leave soon enough.
	   Not even Tiger Woods' 1-up victory over Greg Norman could keep
the United States from its worst loss in the history of match play:
International 20 1-2, United States 11 1-2.
	   ``We creamed them,'' Steve Elkington said.
	   Craig Parry, who pulled off one of several stunning shots that
carried the
	   International team to a 14 1-2 to 5 1-2 lead after two days,
steamrolled past Justin Leonard for a 5 and 3 victory. Thirty
minutes later, Nick Price polished off David Duval 2 and 1, and the
celebration was on.
	   ``We had a sour taste in our mouths from last time,'' Parry
said. ``We wanted to have champagne in our mouths tonight.''
	   Pour the biggest drink for Shigeki Maruyama, the might mite from
Japan who won the hearts of the Australian gallery and carried the
International team by winning all five of his matches. Only Mark
O'Meara in 1996 has gone 5-0 in the Presidents Cup.
	   ``It wasn't a question of beating America,'' Price said. ``It
was a question of winning that Cup. We want that trophy.''
	   Some of the best matches of the day didn't even matter _ Woods
holding off a late charge by Norman, Fred Couples and Vijay Singh
playing to a draw and Mark O'Meara winning 1-up over Stuart
Appleby.
	   International captain Peter Thomson described the U.S. team as
the ``greatest collection of golfers in the world'' during the
opening ceremonies.
	   Not this week. And particularly not at Royal Melbourne.
	   Until Sunday, the worst loss in U.S. history was 16 1-2 to 11
1-2 to Europe in the 1985 Ryder Cup at The Belfry, which turned out
to be the start of European domination in those matches. Could the
Presidents Cup be headed down the same path?
	   ``We came in here as underdogs and came out showing the force of
International golf,'' Norman said.
	   It was vindication for an International team that had lost the
first two Presidents Cup, and proof that moving outside the United
States does make a difference.
	   ``What a great feeling for us, especially after the last two
times,'' Price said after Duval conceded his par on the 17th hole.
	   Despite the move to Australia, both sides said these matches
would not take on the war-like mentality of the Ryder Cup, such as
America's ``War on the Shore'' win in 1991 at Kiawah Island, S.C.
	   No worries.
	   The United States barely managed to put up a fight, despite
having the top four players in the world rankings and eight of the
top 15 on their side.
	   ``It's never fun to lose,'' said Mark Calcavecchia, who cried
after the 1991 Ryder Cup. ``But if you're going to lose to anybody,
I'd rather lose to these guys rather than the Europeans.''
	   And lose they did, in a way few would have imagine.
	   From the time Frank Nobilo sank a 40-foot birdie putt on the
18th to give
	   the International team its first point of the matches on Friday,
the Americans were never in the game.
	   They needed a miracle on Sunday and instead got the same old
story: putts
	   breaking away from the cup at the last minute, the International
putts falling right in the heart.
	   Parry, who grew up in Melbourne and has played the course under
every imaginable condition, never trailed in his match against
Leonard and took control in typical fashion. After Leonard hit a
wedge to three feet on the fifth hole, Parry dunked a 20-footer,
and all Leonard could manage was to halve the hole.
	   Parry made another 20-foot birdie hole on the sixth, then went
3-up on the next hole when Leonard three-putted from about 30 feet.
	   Right behind, Duval was tasting a similar fate. He made only two
birdies, both on par-5s, and conceded the match when yet another
20-footer was off line.
	   Price gave a high-five to his caddie, threw his ball into the
crowd and hugged assistant captain Wayne Grady before shaking hands
with Jack Nicklaus, a losing captain once again.
	   Nicklaus was in charge of the U.S. team when it became the first
to lose a Ryder Cup on American soil. These matches were played on
Thomson's home turf, and he was beaming.
	   ``This is the greatest thing I've ever done,'' said Thomson, who
has five British Open crowns to his credit.
	   Thomson melded together a team that came from all over the
world, from Japan to Fiji to Paraguay, and six players from Down
Under.
	   It may have started two years ago in a cabin at the Robert Trent
Jones course, where the International team had an emotional meeting
and vowed that next time the Presidents Cup would be different.
	   And it was _ different country, different outcome. (djp)

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government took over the operations of
a major bank hobbled by bad loans on Sunday, overriding objections
from bank executives who insisted Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. was not
insolvent.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marks only the
second time since World War II that a top lender has come under
state control. In October, the government took over the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. when a huge burden of bad loans
threatened to sink it.
	   ``I have decided to place the bank under special public
management from today,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi announced in
statement.
	   The government took control of Nippon Credit after financial
authorities declared the bank insolvent with at least 3.2 trillion
yen (dlrs 27 billion) in unrecoverable or high-risk loans and
massive stock valuation losses.
	   Nippon Credit, with 2,000 employees, was among the world's top
50 banks in 1997, according to Fortune magazine, with assets
totaling 12.3 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion).
	   The widely expected move to nationalize the bank was the latest
act in a drama which began early last week when Japan's Chuo Trust
and Banking Co. denied reports it was considering a buyout of
Nippon Credit.
	   Prime Minister Obuchi said the action was taken to safeguard
depositors and shore up confidence in the Japanese financial
system.
	   ``The government will continue to do whatever is needed to
protect depositors and credit markets, and ensure the stability of
financial markets at home and abroad,'' Obuchi said.
	   On Friday, the Financial Supervisory Agency had determined that
the bank could not restructure on its own and moved to pull the
plug. But Nippon Credit executives balked at a government request
on Saturday that they voluntarily apply for nationalization.
	   Following an extraordinary board meeting, Nippon Credit
submitted a petition to the government early Sunday contesting the
Financial Supervisory Agency's assessment of its balance sheet.
	   But the last minute appeal failed.
	   Bank executives who oppose the nationalization have argued that
the agency's standards for judging loan risks were too strict. They
may also have feared a government takeover because the law requires
top managers of nationalized banks to resign.
	   Many of the problem loans which hurt Nippon Credit were made by
subsidiaries which extended easy credit to real estate developers
during a speculative land price boom in the late 1980s. These debts
quickly soured at the outset of this decade with the collapse of
Japan's so-called ``bubble'' economy.
	   Nippon Credit, one of Japan's three so-called long-term credit
banks, was also fatally wounded by its inability to evolve from a
traditional role as a supplier of long-term loans to industry.
	   Deregulation and development of Japan's financial markets has
allowed companies to raise money more cheaply by issuing bonds and
selling equity, thus reducing demand for bank loans.
	   The government was expected to announce plans shortly for buying
all outstanding shares of Nippon Credit. But because the bank has
been declared insolvent, current shareholders are unlikely to
receive much, if any, compensation.
	   That would result in big losses for major shareholders such as
Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Nippon Life Insurance Co.
Another loser would be Bankers Trust Corp., the New York-based
investment bank acquired last month by Deutsche Bank AG.
	   In September of 1997, Bankers Trust said it bought dlrs 10
million worth of Nippon Credit stock to cement a tie-up with the
Japanese bank. It had planned to gradually raise its equity stake
in Nippon Credit to about 4 percent within three years.
	   But Japan's leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai, reported
Sunday that NCB will dissolve the strategic alliance with Bankers
Trust following its nationalization.

China urges athletes to `Say No To Drugs'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For China's swimming coach, persistent
questions about his team's drug-tainted past are unfair and akin to
calling all English cows mad.
	   ``Only a small number used drugs. Don't lump us all together,''
Zhang Xiong said in an interview. ``Think about the logic of it:
England has mad cow disease, so therefore all English cows are mad.
Is that fair?''
	   After years of drug scandals and accusations, Chinese coaches
and officials say enough is enough. China is cleaning up its act,
they say, and it's time for the world to cut them some slack.
	   In a new step, Chinese sports authorities have issued a book,
``Say No to Drugs,'' to all their athletes, including the nearly
600 Chinese competing at the Asian Games, a senior sports official
said Sunday.
	   ``Everybody was told to read it,'' said He Huixian, a
spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation. Some athletes were even
tested to see how much they know, she said.
	   The 204-page volume was published in September and includes
essays about the dangers of drugs, lists banned drugs and
anti-doping regulations, and is illustrated with cartoons. One
shows a runner swigging drugs from a bottle during a 100-meter
dash. By the time the runner reaches the tape, he has turned into a
skeleton. Another shows a Great Wall of China keeping drugs at bay.
One also shows medal winners on a podium with people in the
foreground saying, ``They've all taken drugs.''
	   He said the book was part of anti-doping measures that were
stepped up after the last Asian Games in 1994, when 11 Chinese
athletes, including seven swimmers, tested positive for steroids
and were stripped of their medals.
	   One of the disgraced swimmers, Xiong Guoming, was back in
medal-winning form at these games, having served out a two-year
ban. Sporting an earring and the air of someone enjoying a new
lease on life, Xiong said he grew flowers, visited the ballet and
listened to music during his ban while his teammates continued to
compete.
	   ``Those two years really were very boring,'' the 25-year-old
said Saturday after winning gold in the 200-meter medley. Now,
``through a urine test, I can show I'm clean,'' he said.
	   He, the spokeswoman, said the Hiroshima scandal made sports
officials realize they needed to do more to educate athletes about
doping. The financial rewards for winning, which can include cash
and houses, had prompted some Chinese athletes ``to take risks''
with drugs, she said.
	   ``We were very surprised. It made us realize that we didn't
known enough about what was going on at the grass roots,'' she said
of the 1994 scandal. ``Since Hiroshima, we've been getting tougher
every year.''
	   This year, in the strictest measure adopted by any country,
China announced that swimmers caught using steroids would be banned
for life. The punishment came after another uproar over four
Chinese swimmers who failed doping tests at the World Championships
in Australia in January. A Chinese swimmer and coach also were
caught with vials of banned human growth hormone in their luggage.
	   To avoid any more scandals, China carried out more than 500 drug
tests in the month before these games. Still, Chinese sports
officials say they are not getting enough credit for their
stepped-up efforts.
	   ``I don't like it that people always seize on this problem and
won't let it go,'' said Zhang, the swim coach. ``Americans invented
doping, Westerners, not Chinese.''
	   ``There's still not enough understanding,'' added He, the
spokeswoman.
	   Unlike at Hiroshima, when Chinese swimmers whitewashed Japan,
this time China came out second best to its Asian swimming rival,
winning 13 golds to 15 for Japan.
	   But Zhang angrily rejected the notion that its performance
showed China can't beat Japan without drugs.
	   ``It's not fair: if we get a result, it's drugs. No result, not
drugs,'' he said. ``Give the Chinese a way out.''

Malaysian leader warns disunity will lead to ``recolonization''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad warned Sunday that disunity in the governing party could
threaten the integrity of the Southeast Asian nation he has ruled
for 17 years and make it vulnerable to ``recolonization.''
	   Mahathir's comments to nearly 2,000 delegates came at the
opening of the party's first national convention since a political
storm erupted over his sacking of Anwar Ibrahim, formerly his
deputy prime minister and the No. 2-ranked official in the United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) party.
	   ``The party is important, not the individual. Individuals come
and go,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``Foreigners chose a credible puppet and tried to use him to
conquer the country,'' Mahathir said in an obvious reference to
Anwar.
	   Party leaders have often accused Anwar of being too close to
Western leaders and too willing to accept economic prescriptions
dictated by the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Special privileges were given to the puppet and his cronies,
but when this puppet lost his power, open support was given to
destroy the country,'' the premier said.
	   Mahathir, 72, faces the toughest challenge in his political
career. Anwar's removal from office in September and subsequent
arrest led to a wave of protests and rallies demanding the prime
minister's resignation.
	   As dissent has spread within the ruling party, Malaysian police
have jailed many influential leaders for backing Anwar's call for
political reforms.
	   But Sunday's convention was unlikely to trigger stormy debate or
any other form of open opposition to Mahathir because the party's
current leadership does not tolerate criticism in public.
	   ``Today, the only agenda for the meeting is to amend the party
constitution and to make sure democracy in the party will not be
abused and leaders will not use their democratic powers to destroy
the party,'' Mahathir said.
	   Ahead of the meeting, party leaders called on younger cadres to
demonstrate their support for Mahathir.
	   ``UMNO youth should never ever go against the party
leadership,'' party vice president Najib Tun Razak said in a speech
given on Saturday.
	   Delegates appeared more concerned with damaging Anwar's
reputation than working to repair their party's image. Officials
distributed books containing details of sexual misconduct and abuse
of power allegations lodged against Anwar in an ongoing court case.
	   The former deputy premier has denied the charges, saying they
were drawn up as part of a political vendetta against him by his
former mentor, Mahathir.
	   Delegates also handed out stickers saying ``No'' to political
reform featuring a portrait of Anwar superimposed over an American
flag.
	   The party assembly adopted a resolution condemning U.S. Vice
President Al Gore's remarks last month in support of Anwar's
campaign. Gore was in Kuala Lumpur to stand in for President
Clinton at a summit of Pacific Rim nations.
	   And the prime minister warned darkly of foreign plots.
	   ``When there are riots and civil unrest, they (foreigners) will
not only supply arms to certain quarters but are prepared to be
mercenaries to the parties fighting for power,'' Mahathir said.
	   On the sidelines of the convention, party leaders were expected
to discuss the question of choosing Mahathir's successor. An
election for top party posts is scheduled next year, but many
people expect Mahathir to announce a deputy sooner.
	   Sunday's New Straits Times newspaper narrowed the field of
contenders to three politicians _ Education Minister Najib Tun
Razak, Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi and Tengku Razaleigh
Hamzah, a former finance minister who left the party in 1987 over
differences with Mahathir and then later rejoined.
	   The party has not had a deputy leader since Anwar was thrown out
of the deputy prime minister's office on Sept. 2 and expelled by
the party the next day. The absence of a successor to Mahathir, who
has been in poor health in recent weeks, has added to the
uncertainty caused by Malaysia's economic problems.
	   ``You could say we are not used to not having a number two,''
Abdul Aziz Sheikh Fadzir, a party delegate, was quoted as saying by
the News Straits Times.
	   The last general assembly meeting in July showcased a clear rift
between Mahathir and Anwar. An ally of the ex-deputy prime
minister, Zahid Hamidi, angered Mahathir by accusing the party's
leadership of practicing cronyism and nepotism.
	   Zahid was jailed for several weeks soon after Anwar was sacked
and arrested.

Survivors blame pilot for crash of Thai Airways jet liner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDs account of landing attempts from Australian survivor,
grafs 8,9,10

<TEXT>
	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ As police and soldiers in Thailand
on Sunday wrapped up a search for the last of 101 victims from the
crash of a Thai Airways jetliner, witnesses and some of the 45
survivors blamed the pilot for the tragic accident.
	   After finding parts of the last body which had been unaccounted
for, police officials said they would reduce their search team from
320 to 50 and continue sifting through debris for belongings of
those who had been on board.
	   The Airbus A310-200 plane crashed into a flooded rubber
plantation during a heavy rainstorm Friday evening as it made a
third attempt to land at Surat Thani, a port and fishing village
that serves as a gateway to several resort islands popular with
foreign tourists.
	   ``It was a mistake to try and land a third time,'' said a
sobbing Supakit Saejiew, whose friend Tawatchai Klaiwatanamath died
in the crash of Flight TG261.
	   ``He tried to land two times and couldn't. I didn't think he
would try again. Then I saw the crash and the fire,'' said Supakit,
who had been waiting to pick up the friend at the airport in Surat
Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Others questioned the pilot's action as well.
	   ``I prayed for the captain to take the plane back because I was
really afraid. Why didn't he?'' Vinai Uamnabtue, who survived, but
lost his seven-year-old son, was quoted as saying by the Bangkok
Post.
	   Andrew Sharrock, an Australian survivor who suffered gashes,
bruises and a broken nose, also blamed pilot error for the crash.
	   ``I was worried after the first landing attempt when the pilot
pulled back hard and we went almost straight up,'' he said from his
bed at Bandon Hospital in Surat Thani.
	   ``He did the same thing again on the second attempt. On the
third attempt he just went too far, we were almost vertical.''
	   But Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, who
lost his sister in the crash, told The Nation newspaper he objected
to anyone blaming the pilot, who also died in the crash, before the
facts become known.
	   Thai Airways President Thamanoon Wanglee said Saturday it was
too soon to know exactly what caused the crash, but that the
plane's black box had been recovered and an investigation was
underway.
	   The decision to attempt a third landing during a rainstorm
appeared to contradict the air carrier's standing policy.
	   In June, when the airline announced it was phasing out the use
of foreign pilots in favor of Thais, Chamlong Poompuang, deputy
vice president of flight operations, said cockpit crews had been
instructed to exercise great caution.
	   ``Pilots have been told to divert to other airports if they have
even the slightest hesitation over weather conditions at any
airport, in Thailand or abroad. This means no landing in stormy
weather. They've been told to be passive and conservative. It's
better to be safe than sorry,'' Chamlong said.
	   Thai Airways officials said a foreign insurance company would
participate in an autopsy on captain Pinit Vechasilp to determine
if he might have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
	   Airbus officials were also on their way to Thailand from France
to participate in the probe.
	   At least 25 foreigners were on board. Twelve survived: three
Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one
Briton.
	   The United States embassy in Bangkok said two Americans, Ken
Houseman of Montana, and Helen Gromme from Wyoming, were among
those who died. Their hometowns were not available.
	   Many of the bodies already recovered have been burned beyond
recognition, police and doctors said, making identification
difficult.
	   Meanwhile, weather forecasters on ITV, an independent television
station, said Sunday severe storms were about to hit the southern
coast of Thailand and advised anyone on resort islands in the area
to leave as soon as possible.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian foreign and economic
ministers said they had largely finished work Sunday on a plan of
action to tackle their financial crisis and draw investors back to
the region.
	   They then told lower-level officials to work out details as they
awaited approval from home of a batch of ``bold measures'' that
would cut into tax revenues in exchange for creating jobs.
	   The ministers said the measures would not be released until
their leaders meet at the annual Association of Southeast Asian
Nations summit that starts with a dinner Monday night, followed by
formal talks Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   But they apparently would include tariff cuts, investor
incentives, duty-free status for capital equipment, relaxed rules
on foreign ownership of land on a ``best-effort'' basis, and
speeded-up implementation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area, an ASEAN
Investment Area and an ASEAN bond market.
	   Some of the measures would be put on a dual-track scenario that
would allow developing countries more time and leeway.
	   Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said officials passed
three documents in the morning _ including a final declaration and
a plan of action _ for endorsement by the ASEAN leaders.
	   But the centerpiece was the separate list of ``bold measures.''
Some would take effect almost immediately in an effort to shore up
investor confidence and show the world the region is willing to
take tough action instead of just talking about it.
	   ``I feel it will put us back on the investment map again,''
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said. ``It will be too
difficult for investors in the West to refuse to take a hard look
at the opportunities that are here.''
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the economic
ministers understand this is the best time for liberal reforms and
integration within ASEAN, despite protectionist pressure from
domestic industries that want tariff increases.
	   ``During good times, everyone wants to protect their profit
margins,'' Siazon said. ``During a crisis, they really know they
have to consolidate because there is not enough capital in one
small country.
	   ``We know that unless we consolidate our economic integration,
we cannot really compete later on in global markets.''
	   The land issue is sticky. The Philippines, for instance, has
constitutional restrictions on foreign ownership, while Vietnam
bans private ownership of land.
	   The measures were developed after the economic ministers told
senior officials, who had worked out the joint declaration and plan
of action earlier in the week, to bolster their proposals.
	   One goal is to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group of less-developed and rapidly
industrializing nations. But the region's economies already range
from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said deputy finance
ministers and central bank governors from Southeast Asian nations
will hold regular ``ad hoc'' meetings with their counterparts from
China.
	   ``There is a need for consultation as we move into the 21st
century,'' he said.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sun arrived Sunday for a state
visit and hoped to stay on for the summit, although it was
uncertain if it would be as an observer or as a full-fledged

Clashes, stabbing in West Bank; prisoners suspend hunger strike

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite Palestinian efforts to lower tensions
during the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian stone
throwers clashed Sunday with Israeli troops and an Israeli high
school student was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   There have been daily clashes in the West Bank in recent days,
fueled by the dispute between Israel and the Palestinian Authority
over the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
	   In a nod to Clinton, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will
suspend their weeklong hunger strike, starting Monday, to lower
tensions, Hisham Abdel Razek, a Palestinian Cabinet minister for
prisoner affairs, told The Associated Press.
	   The suspension was requested by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Abdel Razek said.
	   The Palestinian Authority has already canceled a commercial
strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that had been planned for
Monday to draw Clinton's attention to the prisoner problem. Instead
of the strike, church bells will ring in the biblical town of
Bethlehem, one of the stops on Clinton's itinerary.
	   Abdel Razek said he would meet with Clinton on Monday, along
with several children of prisoners. He said he would hand the
president a petition with more than 1 million signatures demanding
the release of the prisoners.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, Israel promised to release
750 prisoners by the end of January. Last month, Israel freed 250,
but most of them were criminals. The Palestinians said they were
given to understand that those released would be so-called security
prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities, but Israel has denied
making such a promise.
	   U.S. officials have said Israel has not violated its commitments
concerning the prisoners, but Palestinian negotiators said Clinton
promised to intercede and try to resolve the dispute.
	   In new violence in the West Bank, about 200 Palestinian
high-school students hurled stones at motorists along the main
north-south highway after Israeli undercover troops arrested two
Palestinians in the town of Ram just north of Jerusalem,
	   Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the
crowd.
	   Outside the Jewish West Bank settlement of Shavei Shomron, a
Palestinian girl walked up to a group of girls from the settlement
and stabbed one of them, 18-year-old Tamar Klein, in the back, said
the head of the settlement, Mordechai Fogel.
	   The Palestinian girl from the nearby village of Sebastya was
arrested by one of the settlers. Israel radio quoted the assailant
as saying she carried out the attack to protest the Clinton visit.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After a warm welcome tempered by words of
defiance from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President
Clinton is trying to get the troubled Wye River peace accord back
on track.
	   At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu
said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to true
peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of
ignoring commitments in peace accords.
	   Clinton opens talks with Netanyahu on Sunday and with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. About
two hours before Air Force One landed Saturday night, the House
Judiciary Committee approved a fourth article of impeachment
against Clinton. The full House will vote on the impeachment
articles next week.
	   ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking in Hebrew, ``The
truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians again
constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to
forgo fulfillment of those commitments.''
	   Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil in his hard-line
coalition government, said he could not accept ``a phony peace on
paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.''
	   Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in
October, the land-for-security agreement he helped broker at Wye
River, Maryland, has hit one snag after another. Israel froze
implementation of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of
violating the deal and inciting violent street protests.
	   Clinton said peacemaking has opened historic opportunities to
Israel. The president said the United States shares Israel's
concerns about security.
	   ``Peace is not simply an option among many but the only choice
that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and
sorrow,'' he said. ``That is why I'm here.'' He said ``both sides
now must face the challenge of implementing Wye.''
	   Accompanied by his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, the
president flew from the airport on Marine One to Jerusalem where
they will stay during the three-day trip to Israel and Palestinian
territories.
	   Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The
Israeli leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament
prepares for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition
began to weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum
Oct. 23 agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to
be met by Palestinian security measures.
	   Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals
until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the
Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over procedures for
revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's
destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish
state.
	   On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza
Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit.
Clinton's visit to Gaza is seen by some as a boost for dreams of
Palestinian statehood.
	   ``I see it as a very important visit. It implies de facto
recognition of a Palestinian state,'' Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of
the Palestinian legislative council, said in an interview on
Sunday.
	   The president will address the Palestinian National Council and
other organizations after their affirmation of a decision to revoke
the anti-Israeli provisions of the Palestinian charter.
	   On Tuesday, Clinton is to visit Manger Square in Bethlehem, the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank town where tradition says Jesus
was born. The first family will tour the Church of the Nativity and
the president will light a Christmas tree.
	   His last stop will be at Masada, a hilltop fortress that is a
powerful symbol of Jewish resolve. Under siege by an army of 15,000
Romans, a small group of Jews chose mass suicide rather than
surrender.

Three Communist guerrillas killed in clash

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Army troops clashed with a group
of suspected communist rebels they caught soliciting money and food
in a remote southern Philippine town, killing at least three of the
guerrillas, the military said Sunday.
	   A military spokesman said army soldiers captured three of the
New People's Army rebels during the firefight in Las Nieves town in
Agusan del Norte Province Saturday.
	   The army soldiers were routinely patrolling the outskirts of Las
Nieves, about 770 kilometers (477 miles) south of Manila, when they
encountered the rebels, who opened fire and broke into smaller
groups while withdrawing into a forest, said military spokesman
Horacio Lapinid.
	   The army soldiers retrieved five land mines and three rifles
left by the rebels in the battle scene in the town, where many
farmers have complained of rebels extorting money, food and crops,
Lapinid said.
	   The NPA, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines and a breakaway group, the Revolutionary Proletarian
Army-Alex Boncayao Brigade, have a presence in some areas of
southern Mindanao region, where Muslim rebels have also been waging
a war to establish a separate Islamic state.
	   The main communist rebel group has been holding sporadic peace
negotiations with the Philippine government but continues to wage
one of Asia's longest running Marxist insurgencies.

Body of missing Iranian writer found, daughter says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian writer missing since last week
has been found dead, the latest victim in a spate of mysterious
killings of government critics, his daughter said Sunday.
	   Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old writer and translator,
had been missing since last Wednesday. His family said they
identified his body late Saturday after getting a call from the
police.
	   His daughter, 17-year-old Nazanin Pouyandeh, said her father had
apparently been strangled to death.
	   ``None of his belongings had been taken. He still had his watch
on,'' she said.
	   Pouyandeh's body was found Thursday, indicating he may have been
killed shortly after he went missing Wednesday, Ms. Pouyandeh said.
	   ``I have lost all hope. I don't know who will die next, but I
hope that my father was the last victim of these slayings,'' she
told The Associated Press.
	   In addition to Pouyandeh, four other government critics,
including two writers, have been found dead in the past four weeks.
	   Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, was quoted as
saying Sunday that the killings were meant to tarnish the image of
Iran's moderate president, Mohammad Khatami.
	   He said a special committee had been set up to investigate the
killings, and that a number of arrests had been made, the daily
Akhbar reported. ``We have found some clues,'' he said, without
elaborating.
	   ``Whatever their ill-omened motive and intention may be, the
short-term target (of the perpetrators) is Mr. Khatami's
administration,'' Tajzadeh told a group of Tehran University
students.
	   ``When such incidents occur one after the other, and that too
through medieval methods, there remains no doubt that some people
are conspiring to make things bitter for the people, at a time that
the system is moving toward political development,'' the paper
quoted Tajzadeh as saying.
	   Khatami ordered Saturday the police and intelligence services to
step up investigation into the killings and disappearances.
	   On Dec. 9, the body of Mohammad Mokhtari, a writer who had been
missing for a week, was found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said marks on Mokhtari's
head and neck indicated that he had been killed, possibly by
strangulation.
	   Last month, Majid Sharif, another writer, disappeared and was
later found dead, but his family said he may have died of a heart
attack.
	   Also last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were stabbed to death in
their home.
	   Khatami's promise of more political freedoms has angered
powerful hard-line rivals who control nearly all key institutions,
including the judiciary, the security forces, the intelligence
network and the office of the supreme leader, who has the last say
on all matters.
	   Over the past year, the hard-liners have resorted to more and
more violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Vigilantes have
attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist
Cabinet minister.
	   Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks, leading to
suspicions that the campaign is being backed by powerful persons in
the ruling hierarchy.

Australia take stranglehold of the third test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score; ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia has stranglehold in the
third Ashes cricket test after another poor batting performance by
England on a turning pitch at Adelaide Oval on Sunday.
	   After skittling out England for a 227 at lunch, Australia
extended a 164-run lead to a commanding 314 at stumps on the third
day with a second innings effort of 150 for one.
	   Skipper Mark Taylor was dismissed for 29 after a 54-run stand.
Opener Michael Slater and Justin Langer then combined for an
unbroken 96-run stand.
	   Slater's unbeaten 74 included five fours and a towering six,
while Langer followed up his unbeaten 179 in Australia's first
innings with 34 not out.
	   Australia scored 391 runs in the first innings.
	   The carnage wrought on England's batting, taking just longer
than four hours, has left the visitors with almost no hope of a
series win.
	   Australia now stands on the brink of retaining the Ashes for a
record-equalling sixth time since winning it in 1989 under
then-captain Allan Border.
	   With the ball ripping off a crumbling pitch and leg spinner
Stuart MacGill looking potent, Australia looks set to take a 2-0
lead with two more test matches to play, in Sydney and Melbourne.
	   To add insult to injury, England on Sunday twice dropped
Australia's No. 3 Langer, taking its tally of dropped catches to 16
in six Australian innings.
	   Until fast bowler Glenn McGrath was called into the attack in
the 69th over, Nasser Hussain and Mark Ramprakash looked in control
after coming together with England in trouble at 84 for three.
	   But a disconcertingly bounced delivery ended the 103-run
fightback and started England's fifth collapse in as many innings.
	   From 187 for three, England lost 7-40 in 84 balls, leaving
Hussain unbeaten on 89 after 263 minutes at the crease. He hit
eight fours.
	   Ramprakash faced 120 deliveries to reach 61 and hit two sixes
and six other boundaries.
	   After McGrath (2-48) gave the home side the much-needed
breakthrough with his fifth delivery of the day, MacGill took 3-8
in eight balls to finish with 4-53.
	   The scalps he claimed include Graeme Hick for eight and, next
ball, new batsmen Dean Headley.
	   Hick, whose only scoring shots had been two boundaries, fell
attempting to drive a sharply-spinning leg-break to give Taylor a
regulation catch at slip.
	   Next ball, Headley padded up and MacGill successfully appealed
for leg before wicket.
	   Darren Gough arrived at the crease with MacGill sensing his
first test hat-trick, but sensibly played a forward defensive
stroke to thwart the Australian's hopes.
	   Swing bowler Damien Fleming (2-34) swiftly dislodged the tail,
dismissing Alan Mullally and Peter Such with successive balls.
	   England was saved in the first test in Brisbane by thunderstorms
which rained out the match, which was drawn. England was 6-50 in
the first innings and 5-65 in the second.
	   In the second test in Perth, England was handed a seven-wicket
drubbing inside three days when the visitors scored 7-50 and 5-33.
	   In damning evidence of the fragility of its lower order, England
has averaged just nine runs per wicket in the last nine tests
against South Africa, Sri Lanka and Australia, collapsing 13 times.

peace, that it's because of Clinton, to mark his visit.''

Teen gangs clash with police in Indonesia

 &UR; Eds: RAISES number of killed in Bali to four and one missing, graf

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stone-throwing teenage gangs clashed
with security personnel and damaged police stations in the city of
Solo on Sunday, the military said.
	   Privately-owned television network, SCTV, said at least 10
people were injured.
	   The military said 39 people had been arrested after several
police stations were pelted with stones.
	   SCTV said fighting among the gangs and police broke out at about
2 a.m. local time and raged for five hours.
	   It quoted witnesses as saying the local police chief's house was
attacked by a mob in the city of about 2 million people, 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   A small market was burned along with two cars.
	   SCTV quoted police spokesman Col. Zainal Abidin as saying
security forces brought the situation under control by 7 a.m.
	   The trigger for Sunday's riot was not immediately clear.
However, residents said tensions have been running high among
police and local youths for some time.
	   Solo, the ancient capital of what once had been an important
royal dynasty in the center of the island of Java, has been plagued
repeatedly by civil unrest.
	   The latest violence follows a brawl among rival villagers on the
tourist island of Bali on Friday. The military said Sunday that
four people were killed and one was reported missing.
	   Four houses were burned and several others were damaged in the
fighting in Buleleng district, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
north of the main city of Dempasar, and away from resort areas.
	   Bali is located about 945 kilometers (590 miles) east of the
capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
	   Social turmoil has increased in Indonesia since the Southeast
Asian country was hit hard by a regional financial crisis last
year. Tensions have mounted amid mass unemployment, food shortages
and fears of political instability.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May during riots that helped
force longtime authoritarian President Suharto to quit.
	   Solo was badly hit by that wave of violence with many house and
other buildings ransacked or burned.

Tiger and Norman don't disappoint
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Never mind that the champagne corks
were half-popped and the Presidents Cup was won by the
Internationals before they made the turn after nine holes. It was
the match everybody was waiting for.
	   Greg Norman and Tiger Woods walked down the second fairway in
steady rain, the two biggest drawcards in the game. Norman was
doing the honors, holding the umbrella as he and Woods strode
together towards their second shots.
	   Woods later won the see-saw match 1-up when Norman's 25-foot
birdie putt fell short on 18. Woods tidied up with a testing
four-foot putt for par, and the first official match-play singles
encounter between the two was over.
	   On one side was Norman, only six weeks back playing after an
eight-month layoff due to shoulder surgery. On the other, Woods,
who won lost the Sun City tournament last week in a playoff to Nick
Price.
	   ``It was nice going head to head with Greg,'' Woods said. ``We
both played well and it was a fun match.''
	   Norman agreed, saying the match ``was great for golf, and great
for us.''
	   ``We had about 10 birdies between us, and I came up just one
short,'' said Norman. ``You can't get much closer than that. It was
a great day.''
	   It was also vintage golf, the way everyone thought it would be.
Thousands behind the gallery ropes and many inside _ including
ex-President George Bush and former Australian prime minister Bob
Hawke _ followed their shots.
	   Moments after Woods left the shelter of Norman's umbrella to hit
his second shot on the second hole, he drilled a four-iron to
within 30 feet of the pin. Two putts later he was in for birdie
while Norman, who had found the left-side bunker, had to settle for
par.
	   Woods 1-up.
	   After halving the next three holes, Woods birdied the sixth,
hitting his approach shot to within 10 feet of the pin. Woods 2-up,
the biggest advantage he would have all day.
	   Norman bit back, draining a 40-footer for birdie after Woods'
shot into the par-3 eighth was just off the back of the green. On
the next par-3 _ the 11th _ Norman hit his tee shot to about four
feet, but never had to putt when Woods, making one of his rare
mistakes on the day, fluffed his wedge from off the green and
conceded the hole to Norman.
	   All square.
	   The two halved the next two holes, Woods went 1-up with a birdie
on 14 and 2-up when Norman bogeyed the 16th. Norman could not win
the match from that point, but he wasn't finished.
	   Woods teed off on 17 and sent a screamer down the center of 17.
Norman walked up and knocked it 25 meters past him, then put his
approach to five feet, where he made birdie to send it to the 18th.
	   Norman put his tee shot on 18 in the center, while Woods pushed
it into the gallery and nearly behind a marquee tent. But with a
clear shot to the green, Woods had no problem getting it to within
35 feet and a hopeful two-putt for par and halve the hole.
	   Norman's birdie attempt failed.
	   With the match over, Norman and Woods walked towards each other,
meeting near the flag.
	   They both put their arms up and grabbed each other by the
shoulders, then shook hands and came close to a hug. Not this time,
but maybe next. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After a warm welcome tempered by words of
defiance from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President
Bill Clinton is trying to get the troubled Wye River peace accord
back on track.
	   At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu
said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to true
peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of
ignoring commitments in peace accords.
	   Clinton had breakfast Sunday with Netanyahu in the president's
ninth floor hotel suite. They were holding formal talks later in
Netanyahu's office. Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who had breakfast with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright separately from the leaders'
meal, told reporters during a picture-taking session that Israel
``has not left'' the Wye River agreement.
	   ``We will not give up'' on the land-for-security accord, Sharon
said. But, he added, ``it should be based on mutual reciprocity.''

Primakov promises wage payments, even if it means a weakening

ruble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending the Russian government's plans to print
more money in 1999, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said paying
workers on time is more important than propping up the ruble, a
news report said Sunday.
	   ``It is unbelievable sometimes when I hear that the most
important thing now is to strengthen the ruble, even by delaying
pensions and wages in the budget sector,'' Primakov said in an
interview with the ORT television station on Saturday, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov was defending the government's draft budget for 1999,
which calls for printing an additional dlrs 1.7 billion worth of
rubles to cover part of a deficit equivalent to around dlrs 5
billion. Some economists believe the government will print far
more.
	   Before Russia's economic crisis hit in August, the ruble was
trading at six to the dollar. It now stands at around 20 to the
dollar, and is expected to continue falling. Russia faces mounting
debts and falling expenditures next year, and many government
officials say the only way out is to print more cash.
	   Russia's money supply has gone from about 160 billion rubles
(dlrs 8 billion) when the crisis struck to more 190 billion rubles
(dlrs 9.5 billion) Friday, according to government figures.

`Iron man's' son wins hammer throw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with later events &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ His father was dubbed Asia's ``iron
man'' after winning the hammer throw at five consecutive Asian
Games. Now Koji Murofushi has taken over the family business.
	   Murofushi won gold Sunday with a throw of 78.57 meters, beating
the 77.14 of Uzbekistan's Andrey Abduvaliev, who holds the Asian
record at 83.36. Kyrgyzstan's Nikolay Davydor took bronze with
68.10.
	   Thus the gold is back in the family after a 12-year break. The
winner's father, Shigenobu Murofushi, who was here watching, won in
1970, 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986.
	   In other early track and field action, China's Yu Guohui won the
men's 20-kilometer walk. Yu finished in 1 hour, 20 minutes, 25
seconds, a games record, beating the 1:23:52 of Kazakstan's Valeriy
Borissov.
	   It was China's 71st gold of the games, to 27 for Japan and 26
for South Korea after Sunday's early events.
	   South Korea gained one by beating Japan 3-1 in the final of
women's team soft tennis, and another in shooting.
	   Taiwan had 13 after Lu Hsiao-chuan shot with an even-par 288
total and led a 1-2-3 finish for her nation in women's golf. That
gave Taiwan the team title as well, with 575 to South Korea's 585.
Lu shot 72 Sunday.
	   In shooting, North and South Korea split the golds in men's
center-fire pistol competition.
	   South Korea's Park Byung-taek won the individual title in a
tie-breaker after he, India's Jaspal Rana and Kazakstan's Vladimir
Vokhmyanin all shot 589s. Rana took the silver.
	   North Korea also needed a tie-break formula to take the gold
after it tied with the South Koreans at 1,749 in the team event.
India took bronze with 1,747.
	   In synchronized swimming, Japan's Miya Tachibana took a lead of
97.067 to 95.200 over South Korea's Choi Yoo-jin after the
technical portion of solo synchronized swimming. Medals will be
awarded after Monday's free routines.
	   Competition began in the South Asian sport of kabaddi, a sort of
team tag, with defending champion India beating Pakistan 17-9 in a
preliminary round game.

IOC official alleges widespread bribery in Olympic selection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and REWRITES throughout, UPDATES with reax from U.S.
delegate. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Whispers and rumors about
corruption within the International Olympic Committee have existed
for years.
	   On Saturday, one of the IOC's own senior leaders came forward
with startling bribery allegations that shook the agency to the
core and could have widespread repercussions on the entire Olympics
movement.
	   Switzerland's Marc Hodler _ a longtime member of the
organization's ruling inner circle _ detailed what he described as
the systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games.
	   ``To my knowledge, there has always, always, been a certain part
of the vote given to corruption,'' he said, in setting off the
biggest ethics scandal in the history of the 104-year-old
organization.
	   Hodler specifically cited a pattern of bribery and other ethical
malpractice in the bidding and selection of at least four Olympic
host cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia; and Salt
Lake City.
	   He also cited bribes of up to dlrs 1 million and payoffs of up
to dlrs 5 million.
	   In addition, Hodler alleged that the head of the family behind
the Fiat car company handed out free vans to secure votes to bring
the 1997 skiing World Championships to an Italian Alpine resort.
	   Hodler said Gianni Agnelli gave cars to 19 small nations during
the campaign, which led to the selection of the Italian resort of
Sestriere.
	   Fiat issued a statement rejecting Hodler's allegations as
``completely false.''
	   Howard Peterson, former president and CEO of the U.S. Ski Team,
said he personally was approached by two executives of Fiat in
spring 1992 before delegates voted on which city would host the
championships.
	   Peterson, who was the senior U.S. delegate during that vote as a
member of the International Ski Federation, said Saturday that he
kept the executives' business cards and identified them as Fiat
president and CEO Vittorio C. Vellano and external relations
manager Angelica DiSilvestri.
	   Peterson said the executives offered him two vehicles for his
vote. He was told one of the cars would be given to him for his
personal use in the United States, and the other would be kept in
Europe.
	   ``I told them that I was going to vote for the city in
Switzerland that they were competing with because (that city) had
done a lot for youth and athletes, and secondly (that) I didn't
sell my vote,'' Peterson said in a telephone interview from his
home in Francis, Utah, near Park City.
	   Peterson said he was not surprised by the offer itself but was
taken aback by its magnitude.
	   ``That was in the spring of 1992 and this was in a period of
time when I had been offered a number of significant gifts _ as a
euphemism that is what they had been called. They were really
bribes,'' he said. ``The other gifts were thousands of dollars.''
	   Peterson declined to name the other companies and individuals
who approached him.
	   The Fiat executives could not be reached through telephone
numbers listed on the business cards Peterson kept, although a call
to one of the numbers reached a Fiat USA answering machine.
	   The IOC quickly ``disassociated'' itself from Hodler's
allegations, saying he was voicing his personal opinions. However,
it did not deny his charges.
	   Those charges came not from a maverick or discredited official,
but from one of the IOC's elder statesmen and close confidant of
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who recently turned 80, has been on the
IOC since 1963, making him and Brazil's Joao Havelange the
organization's longest-serving members. Earlier this year, Hodler
stepped down after 47 years as president of the International Ski
Federation.
	   Hodler said he chose to go public with his corruption
allegations because he hopes they lead to a radical reform of the
Olympic selection process.
	   His allegations came as the IOC investigated alleged financial
misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the
2002 games.
	   Hodler used the word ``bribe'' to describe the dlrs 500,000
scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake that benefited the relatives
of six IOC members. A high-level IOC panel is investigating the
charges.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.''
	   However, John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S.
Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's assertion.
	   ``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this
point,'' Krimsky said. ``All these issues should be put to the IOC
review commission.''
	   Billy Payne, head of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games, said: ``No payments, direct or indirect. No scholarships,
direct or indirect. ... I have never heard of that and will state
positively, unequivocally Atlanta did not do that.''
	   Sydney Olympic organizers denied Hodler's allegations and
Australian IOC member Phil Coles demanded an apology.
	   ``It's an extraordinary outburst and I don't know what's got
into him,'' Coles said. ``There was absolutely nothing untoward
(about Sydney's bid) at all.''
	   ``He (Hodler) is totally off-track. We made no approaches to
anyone other than the normal, legitimate process. Our bid was run
on very legitimate grounds,'' Coles said. ``I have demanded an
apology for Sydney and Australia.''
	   Hodler said Olympic cities should be selected by a small group,
including members of the IOC executive board, rather than the full
IOC membership in order to remove the possibilities of vote buying.
	   He said members _ whose principal role is to vote for Olympic
cities _ should have no problems agreeing to the change.
	   ``If he doesn't sign, he admits he's a crook,'' Hodler said.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland: Hodler said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   In an extraordinary scene at the IOC headquarters, where the
agency was conducting a routine, yearend executive board meeting,
Hodler repeated one bombshell accusation after another. Groups of
reporters huddled around him in the lobby while Olympic officials
listened and looked on in stunned amazement.
	   Hodler said he believed 5 to 7 percent of IOC members _
currently numbering 115 _ have solicited bribes from cities bidding
to host the games.
	   Hodler's principal allegation was that a network of four
``agents'' _ including one IOC member _ have been seeking bribes to
secure votes for Olympic bids. He gave no names.
	   Hodler said he believed the agents had been buying and selling
votes for the past 10 years.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' Hodler
said. ``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do
the following: They say, `I can offer this or that number of
votes.' The price would be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million
for a number of votes, a bloc.''
	   Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the
bid ``something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 million.''
	   Hodler said there is one agent who boasts ``that no city has
ever won the Olympic Games without his help.''
	   ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said. ``It could be
possible.''
	   Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, ``I
know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the
case.''
	   Hodler said losing cities have told him there is a list of IOC
members who can be bought.
	   Hodler said he hasn't seen the list, but ``what I got is the
number of people that clearly, regularly asked for financial
support.''
	   Samaranch, who has been IOC president since 1980, has always
denied allegations of corruption in the organization, saying he
trusts his members ``100 percent.''

Local takes the crown in New Zealand Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Completing a golfing fairytale by
making his first professional win in his home country, Matthew Lane
shot an 8-under-par 64 in the final round of the New Zealand Open
Sunday.
	   The 30-year-old had lost his U.S. Nike Tour status after earning
only U.S. dlrs 15,800 from 20 starts this year and would not have
played if his father hadn't paid the airfare to New Zealand from
his Los Angeles home.
	   Lane battled through qualifying rounds to ultimately claim the
win by three strokes from Australia's Rod Pampling with a 9-under
total of 279 on the tough Formosa Auckland Country Club course. He
scored 72, 69 and 74 in the earlier rounds.
	   An emotional Lane broke into tears several times, along with his
parents, during the presentation ceremony.
	   ``Basically I've got no money, a wife and two kids and had no
tour to play next year,'' said Lane, whose win earned him a
two-season exemption onto the Australasian tour where he is likely
to play.
	   Lane's flawless final round in the fourth day of strong winds
included six birdies and an eagle. It was the best of the
tournament and came on a course Lane earlier criticized as too
tough to enjoy.
	   Pampling shot 3-under 69 and still finished three short, his
progress slowed by a three-putt bogey on the 14th.
	   ``There is not much you can do about a 64 in those conditions,
that is just awesome golf,'' Pampling said.
	   ``I'm not disappointed. I don't mind finishing second to that.''
	   New Zealanders Phil Tataurangi (66) and Grant Moorhead (68) tied
for third, one shot behind Pampling with Australians Peter Lonard
(69) and Lucas Parsons (68) tied with Kiwi Elliot Boult (72) a
further shot back. (rs/djp)

Body of missing Iranian writer found, daughter says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian writer missing since last week
has been found dead, the latest victim in a spate of mysterious
killings of government critics, his daughter said Sunday.
	   Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old writer and translator,
had been missing since last Wednesday. His family said they
identified his body late Saturday after getting a call from the
police.
	   His daughter, 17-year-old Nazanin Pouyandeh, said her father had
apparently been strangled to death.
	   ``None of his belongings had been taken. He still had his watch
on,'' she said.
	   Pouyandeh's body was found Thursday, indicating he may have been
killed shortly after he went missing Wednesday, Ms. Pouyandeh said.
	   ``I have lost all hope. I don't know who will die next, but I
hope that my father was the last victim of these slayings,'' she
told The Associated Press.
	   In addition to Pouyandeh, four other government critics,
including two writers, have been found dead in the past four weeks.
	   Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, was quoted as
saying Sunday that the killings were meant to tarnish the image of
Iran's moderate president, Mohammad Khatami.
	   He said a special committee had been set up to investigate the
killings, and that a number of arrests had been made, the daily
Akhbar reported. ``We have found some clues,'' he said, without
elaborating.
	   ``Whatever their ill-omened motive and intention may be, the
short-term target (of the perpetrators) is Mr. Khatami's
administration,'' Tajzadeh told a group of Tehran University
students.
	   ``When such incidents occur one after the other, and that too
through medieval methods, there remains no doubt that some people
are conspiring to make things bitter for the people, at a time that
the system is moving toward political development,'' the paper
quoted Tajzadeh as saying.
	   Khatami ordered the police and intelligence services Saturday to
step up investigation into the killings and disappearances.
	   On Dec. 9, the body of Mohammad Mokhtari, a writer who had been
missing for a week, was found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said marks on Mokhtari's
head and neck indicated that he had been killed, possibly by
strangulation.
	   Last month, Majid Sharif, another writer, disappeared and was
later found dead, but his family said he may have died of a heart
attack.
	   Also last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were stabbed to death in
their home.
	   Khatami's promise of more political freedoms has angered
powerful hard-line rivals who control nearly all key institutions,
including the judiciary, the security forces, the intelligence
network and the office of the supreme leader, who has the last say
on all matters.
	   Over the past year, the hard-liners have resorted to more and
more violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Vigilantes have
attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist
Cabinet minister.
	   Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks, leading to
suspicions that the campaign is being backed by powerful persons in
the ruling hierarchy.

Youhanna hits half century as Pakitan leads by 70 runs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY RIZWAN ALI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Fog delayed the start of the fourth
day's play by 75 minutes as Pakistan stretched its first innings
lead to 70 runs against Zimbabwe in the second test on Sunday.
	   Yousuaf Youhanna completed his half century and was batting on
76, but not before Henry Olonga claimed three wickets for 11 runs
as Pakistan went for lunch at 253 for eight. Zimbabwe made 183 in
its first innings on the first day.
	   Pakistan after resuming at the overnight total of 211, lost
three wickets to Olonga who removed Moin Khan (25), Wasim Akram (2)
and then uprooted Saqlain Mushtaq's (0) off stump in a fiery
six-over spell.
	   Youhanna, 46 overnight, batted with lot of authority and
hammered a dozen boundaries in his innings during his 235 minutes
of stay at the wicket. Together with him was Shoaib Akhtar, batting
on seven.
	   Pakistan lost three wickets for four runs and struggled at 215
for eight. However, Shoaib denied Zimbabwe further success as
Youhanna looked for his second century in test cricket.

Demanding back wages, protesters in Volgograd block ambulances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Some 200 wives of ambulance drivers blocked a road
to a garage Sunday in a protest over unpaid wages, almost bringing
emergency medical services in the area to a halt.
	   The women taking part in the protest in Volzhsky say their
husbands have not been paid since June, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   According to a radio dispatcher in Volzhsky, medics were unable
to respond to 30 calls for emergency help in the first two hours
the women were blocking the road, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The protesters ignored pleas by officials to leave the road.
They did, however, allow four ambulances out to respond to calls
connected with children and heart trouble.
	   Volzhsky is about 900 kilometers (550 miles) southeast of
Moscow.
	   The Russian government owes millions of rubles (dollars) in back
wages to state workers across the country. Some workers have taken
their bosses hostage, blocked roads, threatened to blow up
buildings and even killed themselves to protest of their condition.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Koji Murofushi proved he was forged
from the same stuff as the ``Iron Man of Asia'' when he joined
famous father Shigenobu as an Asian Games hammer champion Sunday.
	   But Koji has to win four more titles over the next 16 years to
match Shigenobu, who earned his ``Iron Man'' nickname by winning
the event from Bangkok in 1970 to Seoul in 1986.
	   Koji broke his own national record Sunday with 78.57 meters to
beat Uzbekistan's world class thrower Andrey Abduvaliev, who was
well off his best with 77.14 and fouled on his final three
attempts.
	   ``What I did today was more than I had expected. I didn't
imagine the competition would turn out this way,'' said Koji, who
led the whole way and improved his record for the fifth time this
year.
	   Abduvaliev has a best distance of 82.66 meters and Murofushi
apologized to him after the event. ``I said `I'm sorry that I won,'
and he replied `Well done,''' Koji said.
	   Shigenobu was ecstatic about his son's victory but had some
sobering, if obvious, advice.
	   ``Winning five straight times takes a long time. The most
important thing for him to keep improving his record is to steadily
improve his techniques and to control his mental condition,'' the
Shigenobu said.
	   India's veteran sprinter P.T. Usha, making her swan song at the
Asian Games, scrambled through to the women's 400-meter final as
the track program got under way Sunday.
	   Usha, 33, retired for eight years before her surprise return at
the Asian championships in July, where she grabbed a bronze medal.
	   In 1984, she became India's best performer at an Olympic track
meet, missing out on the 400 bronze by just .01 seconds.
	   Asian champion Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka won Usha's
semifinal comfortably, finishing in 52.48 seconds. Usha, tucked in
Lane 1, struggled in blustery conditions and was fourth in 54.63
but qualified seventh fastest into Monday's final. Second fastest
was Kazakstan's Svetlana Bodritskaya.
	   ``I could have done better but it's a fast track and I don't
like running on fast tracks,'' said Usha, who had suffered a
hamstring injury last month.
	   Usha said she would contest the 200 as well as the 400 here.
	   Yu Guohui claimed China's first track and field gold medal at
these games with a comfortable victory in the men's 20-kilometer
walk.
	   Yu took more than two minutes off his previous best time in
recording 1 hour, 20 minutes, 25 seconds, a games record.
	   ``It's no surprise for me to win this race,'' Yu said. ``If the
wind was slower, I could have had a better time.''
	   Valeriy Borissov of Kazakstan was second in 1:23:52 while Asian
championship winner Li Zewen of China was third in 1:24:41, well
off his best of 1:18:32 set in the World Cup walking competition
last year.
	   Japan's Yoko Ota claimed the gold medal in the women's high jump
while her compatriot Miki Imai, the Asian champion, lagged in
fourth.
	   In a tight competition, Ota jumped 1.88 meters to beat China's
Jin Ling on a countback. Imai was one of four, including bronze
medalist Anna Chertrova of Kyrgyzstan, to end at 1.84.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The number of people living in poverty
in crisis-ridden Indonesia has soared from 20 million less than two
years ago to an estimated 100 million, almost half its population,
a news report said Sunday.

	   Indonesia, with a population of 202 million people, is currently

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Homesick Indian sprint star P.T. Usha,
missing her 6-year-old son, qualified for the Asian Games 400-meter
final Sunday and said she would run faster in the gold medal race.
	   ``I can do better and I am sure I will do better,'' Usha said
after she finished in 54.63 seconds in her favorite 400 meters.
Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka finished fastest in qualifying, in
52.48.
	   ``This was my first race after the hamstring injury. So I think
it is OK,'' Usha said of her time. Her best is 51.61, at a meet in
Canberra in 1985.
	   Usha said she is missing her son Ujjal.
	   ``I am missing them all,'' she said. ``I know everyone wants me
to win a medal and I will try.''
	   Usha, now 33, came on the Indian athletic scene 20 years ago as
a shy, 13-year-old in pigtails.
	   She won gold in the 100, 80-meter hurdles, 4x100m relay and long
jump, and wanted to compete in more, but officials at the under-14
Indian National Athletics Championships told her to give others a
chance.
	   She remained a dominant figure in track until the 1990 Beijing
Asian Games, where she failed to win a single medal and retired.
	   Taking everyone by surprise, Usha came out of her eight years of
mostly retirement to enter the Asian Track Championships meet in
Fukuoka, Japan, in July.
	   Usha was third in 23.46 seconds in the 200 meters, and on the
same day anchored India's victorious 4 x 100-meter relay. Usha also
anchored India's silver medal team in the 4 x 400, which finished
.16 seconds behind China.
	   In these games, Usha also will anchor India's two relay teams.
	   Usha's track victories have made her a standout in India, a
country of 980 million people. The question has been whether India
is a ``sleeping giant'' of sports, or there is something basically
that keeps it from producing many athletes of international
standard. No Indian has won a medal in track and field at the
Olympics.
	   Usha has come closest, missing bronze by 0.01 seconds at the
1984 games.
	   Her reputation began growing at the 1982 New Delhi Asian Games
when she won silver at 100 and 200 meters. One year later, she won
gold in the 400 in the Asian championships in Kuwait, and silver at
200 meters.
	   Usha's last hurrah before retirement came at the Asian
championships in New Delhi, where she won gold in the 200, 400,
400-meter hurdles and 4 x 400 hurdles. Her 23.27 seconds at 200
meters is still India's national record.
	   One year after retiring in 1991, she married Sreenivasan, an
athlete in the South Asian sport of kabaddi.
	   It was her husband who told her to get back to the track and
became her coach. She returned to international competition briefly
in 1994 and finished fourth at 200 meters at the Hiroshima Asian
Games.

India beats Pakistan in kabaddi opener

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India, raiding aggressively, beat
traditional rival Pakistan 17-9 Sunday in the first match of the
seven-nation Asian Games kabaddi competition.
	   At the break after 20 minutes of play, the defending champion
Indians were leading 10-6 in the South Asian sport, a kind of team
tag.
	   ``We played aggressive kabaddi and got the dividend,'' said
Indian captain Biswajit Palit.
	   ``Indeed, we were tense because we were playing Pakistan,'' said
Palit, a clerk for the Indian Railways in the eastern city of
Calcutta.
	   India and Pakistan, neighbors on the Asian subcontinent, have
fought three wars and come close to another. Their political
tensions often spill over into sporting arenas.
	   But Sunday's match proceeded without incident on the newly laid
kabaddi court at the University of Ongkharak, about 60 kilometers
(36 miles) from Bangkok.
	   Before the match, the Pakistani team, led by captain Mohammed
Sarwar, gave a battle cry, ``Allah ho-Akbar'' (God is great).
	   The Indians looked back, but there was no reaction.
	   The Indians entered the arena and touched the ground with folded
hands - a sign of respect to mother earth.
	   India went into the lead in the first two minutes but Pakistan,
playing a defensive game, managed to snatch one point. It later
leveled the score at 4-4.
	   But then the Indians went flat out and raided Pakistan's zone
successfully. For India, B.C. Ramesh scored five points, all by
raiding.
	   ``The Indians were lucky, so they won,'' said Pakistani captain
Sarwar, 34. ``We will come back.''
	   The sport, requiring strategy and breath control, draws its name
from the rule requiring raiders to continually say ``kabaddi''
while in enemy territory. Opponents try to pin down the raiders
until they run out of breath and can't keep up the chant.
	   India won the gold medal at the last Asian Games in 1994,
besting Pakistan and Nepal.
	   Those teams are back for these games, along with Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Japan and host Thailand.
	   In later games Sunday, India beat Bangladesh 36-10, Sri Lanka
beat Nepal 17-6 and Thailand 41-28, Bangladesh beat Japan 25-8, and
Japan beat Nepal 52-13.

Clinton opens Mideast visit by meeting Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton meeting with Netanyahu, minor editing to
conform, tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace
accord back on track, President Bill Clinton met Sunday with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an atmosphere of
political tension.
	   After getting together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite,
the two leaders met at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to
reporters later.
	   At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu
said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to true
peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of
ignoring commitments in peace accords.
	   Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday in the Gaza Strip.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who had breakfast Sunday
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright separately from the
leaders' meal, told reporters during a picture-taking session that
Israel ``has not left'' the Wye River agreement.
	   ``We will not give up'' on the land-for-security accord, Sharon
said. But, he added, ``it should be based on mutual reciprocity.''
	   About two hours before Air Force One landed Saturday night, the
House Judiciary Committee approved a fourth article of impeachment
against Clinton. The full House will vote on the impeachment
articles next week.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel was asked Sunday if the
success of Clinton's visit would turn on the question of revoking
the Palestinian Liberation Organization's founding charter.
	   ``President Clinton played a very important role in the Wye
Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going to be very,
very important that this visit show us at least a readiness on the
part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace,'' Fogel
said.
	   There was no letup in violence Sunday, despite Palestinian
efforts to lower tensions. Palestinian stone throwers clashed with
Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student was stabbed and
wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   In his remarks at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night,
Netanyahu said the peace process is in danger.
	   ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking in Hebrew, ``The
truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians again
constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to
forgo fulfillment of those commitments.''
	   Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil in his hard-line
coalition government, said he could not accept ``a phony peace on
paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.''
	   Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in
October, the land-for-security agreement he helped broker at Wye
River, Maryland, has hit one snag after another. Israel froze
implementation of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of
violating the deal and inciting violent street protests.
	   Clinton said the United States shares Israel's concerns about
security.
	   ``Peace is not simply an option among many but the only choice
that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and
sorrow,'' he said. ``That is why I'm here.'' He said ``both sides
now must face the challenge of implementing Wye.''
	   Accompanied by his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, the
president flew from the airport on Marine One to Jerusalem where
they will stay during the three-day trip to Israel and Palestinian
territories.
	   Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The
Israeli leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament
prepares for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition
began to weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum
Oct. 23 agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to
be met by Palestinian security measures.
	   Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals
until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the
Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over procedures for
revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's
destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish
state.
	   On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza
Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit.
Clinton's visit to Gaza is seen by some as a boost for dreams of
Palestinian statehood.
	   ``I see it as a very important visit. It implies de facto
recognition of a Palestinian state,'' Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of
the Palestinian legislative council, said in an interview on
Sunday.
	   The president will address the Palestinian National Council and
other organizations after their affirmation of a decision to revoke
the anti-Israeli provisions of the Palestinian charter.
	   On Tuesday, Clinton is to visit Manger Square in Bethlehem, the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank town. The first family will tour
the Church of the Nativity and the president will light a Christmas
tree.
	   His last stop will be at Masada, a hilltop fortress that is a
powerful symbol of Jewish resolve. Under siege by an army of 15,000
Romans, a small group of Jews chose mass suicide rather than
surrender.

Remaining U.N. teams carry on last day of surprise inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors went out on their last day
of mission Sunday in search of Iraq's illegal weapons.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the United Nations Special
Commission, said most of the visiting 40 inspectors, who must be
out of Iraq by Tuesday, left the country on Sunday and the rest
will leave Monday.
	   The up to 140 resident monitors will, however, remain in Iraq to
continue their work.
	   ``All the remaining inspectors have gone to carry on their work
in a normal way on Sunday,'' she said.
	   ``We hope that the report on Iraq's cooperation with the
Commission will be introduced before the end of this week,'' Cross
told The Associated Press.
	   She refused to say where or what type of inspections was to take
place Sunday. Visiting inspectors pay surprise visits to weapons
sites.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles
before U.N. sanctions can be lifted. The U.N. Security Council
imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   This week's searches, which are expected to end Monday, have
been the most intensive since Iraq allowed UNSCOM to resume work
last month after putting a halt in August.
	   Iraq backed down only hours before the United States had planned
to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam Hussein's
government also pledged full cooperation to the inspectors, and the
latest searches are seen as a test of that.
	   Meanwhile, Iraqi papers on Sunday accused chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler of prolonging the inspections and the
sanctions.
	   Butler's ``aggressive policy toward Iraq'' is aimed at
undermining Iraq's independence, said al-Thawra daily, a government
newspaper.
	   ``The continuation of the Commission's work means the
continuation of sanctions and plotting against Iraq,'' said the
pro-government al-Qadissiya daily in an editorial.

Crowd problems feared as Thailand-Korea kick off quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian Games organizers are opening more
ticket venues and wheeling in a large-screen television to defuse
potential unrest among Thai soccer supporters expected to mob the
stadium Monday to see their underdog team face South Korea in a
quarterfinal.
	   Thousands of helmeted, club-wielding riot police will be on hand
at the Rajamangala Stadium, where King Bhumibol Adulyadej opened
the continent's greatest sports event Dec. 6, to ensure there is no
repeat of Saturday's troubles. Thousands of angry fans unable to
get tickets to the qualifying group decider with Qatar stormed the
venue.
	   They were appeased only when organizers promised to bring in a
truck-mounted television donated by Samsung, one of the official
sponsors, to show the match live outside the stadium to people who
couldn't obtain tickets.
	   Oragnizers are hoping the crowds will simply appreciate the
soccer Monday.
	   ``We won't see such an opportunity for a South Korea-Thailand
soccer match for 10 years,'' said Sakchye Tupsuwan, chairman of the
Asian Games technical committee.
	   Inside or outside the stadium, the match will probably be the
last where such measures are needed. Only Thailand's matches have
drawn more than a few thousand spectators, but the Thais got to the
quarterfinals thanks largely to coming through two weak qualifying
groups. Better sides like Oman and Japan in tougher groups have
been sent home.
	   South Korea is expected to end the host nation's advance. With
an offense powered by Army striker Choi Yong-soo, who has enhanced
his international stature with seven goals in five matches, the
Koreans are one of the favorites to take the gold medal.
	   The two others, Iran and China, clashed Saturday in what has
become a continental grudge series. The Iranians shook off a
surprise defeat to upstart Oman earlier in the week and sliced
through the Chinese defenses to win 2-1.
	   The defeat was China's first in 11 matches. China's English
coach, Bobby Houghton, insisted that his largely new squad has no
complex against the Iranians, who kept China out of the World Cup,
and that he was looking forward to meeting them again in the
semifinals.
	   To get there, Iran first needs to finish off defending champion
Uzbekistan, while China must eliminate Turkmenistan in Monday's
quarterfinals.
	   After a sluggish start in the games, World Cup veteran Ali Daei
has found his form for Iran and scored four times in the past three
matches. For China, Li Jinyu has found the back of the net three
times.
	   But the swarming Chinese offense needs to take better control of
the midfield to increase its chances against Daei and company.
	   The last quarterfinal pits Qatar _ notable at the games
primarily for a brawl with the Thais during a preliminary friendly
_ against Gulf rival Kuwait. The winner will face the victor of the
South Korea-Thailand match.
	   Kuwait is fielding the top two Asian Games strikers, Jasem
al-Huwaidi and Farj Laheeb, with eight goals apiece. But they have
been held to just one between them in their last two matches as
fatigue from a punishing tournament schedule has set in.
	   Come Monday, though, the Kuwaitis will have had one more day to
rest than the Qataris, which could help al-Huwaidi and Laheeb find
their mark again.

Suspected Muslim rebels open fire on jeep, two killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) _ Suspected Muslim rebels fired on a
jeep carrying farmers and their produce to a southern Philippine
town on Sunday, killing two and injuring 16, police said.
	   Police said the attackers, armed with rifles and pistols, did
not rob the passengers and fled after firing on the overloaded jeep
in a remote mountain village in Pigcawayan town in North Cotabato
province.
	   The rebels fired from positions on a hill as the jeep travelled
on a dirt road, said police investigator Jose Cagadas. Many of
those injured were sitting atop the vehicle, he said.
	   Pigcawayan is located next to a town in Maguindanao Province,
where robbers opened fire on a car last week, killing a bank
manager and an aide. The robbers took a large amount of money from
the bank executive.
	   Pigcawayan, about 890 kilometers (552 miles) south of Manila,
lies near hinterland areas with a heavy presence of Muslim
separatist guerrillas.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors went out on their last day
of mission Sunday in search of Iraq's illegal weapons.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the United Nations Special
Commission, said most of the visiting 40 inspectors, who must be
out of Iraq by Tuesday, left the country on Sunday and the rest
will leave Monday.
	   The up to 140 resident monitors will, however, remain in Iraq to
continue their work.
	   ``All the remaining inspectors have gone to carry on their work
in a normal way on Sunday,'' she said.
	   ``We hope that the report on Iraq's cooperation with the
Commission will be introduced before the end of this we`ek,'' Cross
told The Associated Press.
	   She refused to say where or what type of inspections was to take
place Sunday. Visiting inspectors pay surprise visits to weapons
sites.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles
before U.N. sanctions can be lifted. The U.N. Security Council
imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   This week's searches, which are expected to end Monday, have
been the most intensive since Iraq allowed UNSCOM to resume work
last month after putting a halt in August.
	   Iraq backed down only hours before the United States had planned
to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam Hussein's
government also pledged full cooperation to the inspectors, and the
latest searches are seen as a test of that.
	   Meanwhile, Iraqi papers on Sunday accused chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler of prolonging the inspections and the
sanctions.
	   Butler's ``aggressive policy toward Iraq'' is aimed at
undermining Iraq's independence, said al-Thawra daily, a government
newspaper.
	   ``The continuation of the Commission's work means the
continuation of sanctions and plotting against Iraq,'' said the
pro-government al-Qadissiya daily in an editorial.

EU recommits to expansion but for 11 candidates picture stays fuzzy

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - For Cyprus and 10 East European nations
hoping to join the European Union, the picture can get fuzzy: If
the EU has a road map for its largest expansion ever, why is this
ride so bumpy?
	   Nine years after the Berlin Wall fell, the East Europeans still
get lofty declarations about a new Europe but no sense when they'll
be part of it.
	   The 15 EU leaders ended a two-day summit Saturday, again
declaring their eastward expansion _ membership talks began this
fall _ remains on track but still setting no entry dates.
	   First, they said, the EU leaders must end by March a fight over
how to finance enlargement and slash farm spending which consumes
half the EU budget and has escaped even minor cost-cutting since
1957.
	   Then the EU must reform its housekeeping rules that promise
decision-making gridlock when Cyprus and 10 East European nations
join. These reforms have been fruitlessly debated for years.
	   ``European integration is a marathon, not a sprint,'' Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu said after he and other eastern
leaders met with their EU colleagues.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder remained confident the EU
can settle its internal problems by March. His country, France, the
Netherlands, Austria and Denmark seek a spending freeze, keeping
outlays at 85 billion European currency units (about dlrs 100
billion) in the 2000-2006 period.
	   Spain and other southerners _ seeing EU funds going east at
their expense _ push for budget growth in line with economic
growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said that showed
rich-poor solidarity.
	   Retorted Schroeder: ``Germany has no unlimited resources (and)
expects the curve of its financial contribution to rise no more but
to start pointing downward.''
	   Germany and some of its neighbors pay more into the EU than they
get back. They want overpayments _ 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year in Germany's case _ capped somehow.
	   The EU is no stranger to 11th hour haggling over money and other
issues. The resulting image is often one of an outfit that makes
things up as it goes along.
	   After years of preparing for a single currency, the EU leaders
argued for 12 hours at a summit in Brussels last May over who
should be the European Central Bank chief.
	   After years of disagreements, the EU will craft a common defense
independent from Washington but within NATO. This is supposed to
shore up a shaky EU foreign policy, coordinated by someone whose
name was not announced here because the EU leaders must yet agree
on who it should be.
	   In 1991, the EU ended duty-free sales by 1999, declaring them
incompatible with a single market Europe. Here, the leaders agreed
to review and possibly reverse that decision.
	   The EU wants to enlarge but must still figure out how to finance
that. Schroeder spoke of a March deal on farm and budget reforms.
French President Jacques Chirac spoke of a deal by June.
	   The EU wants to enlarge but sets no entry dates saying that will
make candidates stop working on economic reforms to get ready for
membership. Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek complained the
West Europeans want candidates to be ready for membership fast yet
sets no finish line. ``This should be done in a parallel way,'' he
complained.
	   ``We haven't heard anything about a timetable (for joining),''
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said. ``In the future it will be
necessary.''
	   The EU stance upsets Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia the most.
These three are in a slow track to membership but have been
scurrying to meet conditions for joining. Despite a recommendation
from the EU head office, the EU leaders declined to advance them to
the fast negotiating track.

Chechen vice president accuses rebel warlord of murdering
</HEADLINE>
foreigners &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya has accused a renegade warlord in the
breakaway republic of kidnapping and brutally murdering four
foreigners whose heads were found by a roadside last week, a news
report said on Sunday.
	   Appearing on state television, Deputy Prime Minister Turpal
Atgeriyev claimed Saturday that rebel warlord Arbi Barayev
masterminded the kidnapping and killing of three Britons and a New
Zealander who were in Chechnya to install a cellular phone system,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were captured Oct. 3.
Their decapitated heads were found at a roadside on Tuesday, and
officials speculate they were killed after a botched rescue
attempt.
	   Chechen police have suggested before that Barayev, the head of a
group called the Islamic Regiment, is connected with a wave of
kidnappings that has washed over Chechnya since the end of its
1994-96 independence war with Russia. The claims have never been
proven.
	   Atgeriyev also said Barayev had kidnapped Chechnya's general
prosecutor, Mansur Tagirov, on Thursday. Tagirov, who was
investigating the deaths of the four foreigners, was released
Saturday.
	   Atgeriyev's claims came at the same time as Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov ordered a partial call-up of army reserves on
Saturday night in an effort to fight crime in the region.
	   Also Saturday, Russian security forces freed a kidnapped
Frenchman working for the U.N. refugee agency in neighboring
Ingushetia after more than 10 months in captivity.
	   Since Chechnya's independence war with Russia ended, the
Caucasus region has been hit by violence as feuding gangs wage
bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped, mostly
for ransom.

U.N. inspectors go out on last day of surprise visits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Visiting U.N. inspectors began the last day
of this round of inspections Sunday in the ongoing search for
Iraq's illegal weapons.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the United Nations Special
Commission, said most of the visiting 40 inspectors, who must be
out of Iraq by Tuesday, left the country on Sunday and the rest
will leave Monday.
	   Up to 140 resident monitors will, however, remain in Iraq to
continue their work.
	   ``All the remaining inspectors have gone to carry on their work
in a normal way on Sunday,'' she said.
	   ``We hope that the report on Iraq's cooperation with the
Commission will be introduced before the end of this week,'' Cross
told The Associated Press.
	   She refused to say where or what type of inspections were to
take place Sunday. Visiting inspectors pay surprise visits to
weapons sites.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles
before U.N. sanctions can be lifted. The U.N. Security Council
imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   This week's searches, which are expected to end Monday, have
been the most intensive since Iraq allowed UNSCOM to resume work
last month after putting a halt in August.
	   Iraq backed down only hours before the United States had planned
to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam Hussein's
government also pledged full cooperation to the inspectors, and the
latest searches are seen as a test of that.
	   Meanwhile, Iraqi papers on Sunday accused chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler of prolonging the inspections and the
sanctions.
	   Butler's ``aggressive policy toward Iraq'' is aimed at
undermining Iraq's independence, said al-Thawra daily, a government
newspaper.
	   ``The continuation of the Commission's work means the
continuation of sanctions and plotting against Iraq,'' said the
pro-government al-Qadissiya daily in an editorial.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ World sprint silver medalist Susantika
Jayasinghe, under investigation on a drugs charge, said she pulled
a muscle in qualifying Sunday and was in doubt for the final of the
Asian Games 100-meter event.
	   ``I pulled a hamstring in the race and I'm having a severe
headache,'' Jayasinghe said before charging away from reporters.
``I'm going to see a doctor and I'm hoping for the best.''
	   There were no obvious signs of something as serious as a
hamstring injury as Jayasinghe, the 200 silver medalist at last
year's Athens world championships, crossed the line in 11.30
seconds. She had been expected to win the sprint double comfortably
here.
	   Meanwhile, Japan's Koji Ito went into raptures when he broke the
Asian record in the semifinals of the men's 100, finishing in
10.00.
	   Jayasinghe tested positive for a steroid in March and is
competing while the International Amateur Athletic Federation waits
to hold an arbitration meeting to decide her fate.
	   The charge had been dismisssed by the Sri Lankan federation
after she maintained she took the drug, Nandralone-19, to control
her menstrual cycle.
	   If the IAAF rules against her, Jayasinghe would lose any medals
won here.
	   Ito, who held the 100 record jointly with fellow Japanese
Noburharu Asahara at 10.08, got a break when the wind dropped
slightly and gave him a tailwind just under the maximum allowable
limit.
	   Earlier, he had clocked 10.03 in the heats, only to have a
record denied because of the strong winds at the main stadium.
	   Ito, 28, leaped in the air several times after crossing the
line. He then moved toward the stands, raised his arms and puffed
out his chest to take the applause.
	   Ito's teammate Koji Murofushi proved he was forged from the same
stuff as the ``Iron Man of Asia'' when he joined famous father
Shigenobu as an Asian Games hammer champion.
	   But Koji has to win four more titles over the next 16 years to
match Shigenobu, who earned his ``Iron Man'' nickname by winning
the event from Bangkok in 1970 to Seoul in 1986.
	   Koji broke his own national record Sunday with 78.57 meters to
beat Uzbekistan's world class thrower Andrey Abduvaliev, who was
well off his best with 77.14 and fouled on his final three
attempts.
	   ``What I did today was more than I had expected. I didn't
imagine the competition would turn out this way,'' said Koji, who
led the whole way and improved his record for the fifth time this
year.
	   Abduvaliev has a best distance of 82.66 meters and Murofushi
apologized to him after the event. ``I said `I'm sorry that I won,'
and he replied `Well done,''' Koji said.
	   India's veteran sprinter P.T. Usha, making her swan song at the
Asian Games, scrambled through to the women's 400-meter final.
Usha, 33, retired for eight years before her surprise return at the
Asian championships in July, where she grabbed a bronze medal.
	   In 1984, she became India's best performer at an Olympic track
meet, missing out on the 400 bronze by just .01 seconds.
	   Asian champion Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka won Usha's
semifinal comfortably, finishing in 52.48 seconds. Usha, tucked in
Lane 1, struggled in blustery conditions and was fourth in 54.63
but qualified seventh fastest into Monday's final. Second fastest
was Kazakstan's Svetlana Bodritskaya.
	   ``I could have done better but it's a fast track and I don't
like running on fast tracks,'' said Usha, who had suffered a
hamstring injury last month.
	   Usha said she would contest the 200 as well as the 400 here.
	   Japan's Yoko Ota claimed the gold medal in the women's high jump
while her compatriot Miki Imai, the Asian champion, lagged in
fourth.
	   In a tight competition, Ota jumped 1.88 meters to beat China's
Jin Ling on a countback. Imai was one of four, including bronze
medalist Anna Chertrova of Kyrgyzstan, to end at 1.84.
	   Yu Guohui claimed China's first track and field gold medal at
these games with a comfortable victory in the men's 20-kilometer
walk.
	   Yu took more than two minutes off his previous best time in
recording 1 hour, 20 minutes, 25 seconds, a games record.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ONNASON, Japan (AP) _ Hidemichi Tanaka shot a four-under-par 67
Sunday to win the season-ending Okinawa Open by three strokes.
	   It was the 27-year-old Tanaka's third victory this season and
fifth in his career.
	   Tanaka, who started Sunday's final round two strokes behind
leader Akihito Yokoyama of Japan, carded five birdies and one bogey
on the 6,359-yard, par-71 Daikyo Country Club course in Okinawa.
	   He finished the 80 million-yen (dlrs 680,000) tournament with a
11-under-par 273 total.
	   Yokoyama shot a 72 with four birdies and three bogeys and a
double bogey on the 335-yard, par-four 16th hole and placed second
with a 276 total.
	   Tanaka received the first prize money of 14.4 million yen (dlrs
123,000) and Yokoyama collected 7.2 million yen (dlrs 62,000) for
second place.
	   With the victory, Tanaka collected a total of 103.94 million yen
(dlrs 888,388) this season, second only to Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki
who topped the list of Japan PGA money earners with 179.63 million
yen (dlrs 1,535,277).
	   Jumbo Ozaki sat out the tournament.
	   American David Ishii from Hawaii, seeking his first victory in
four years, shot 70 and placed third with a 277 total.
	   Tied for fourth place at 278 were Eduardo Herrera of Colombia
and two Japanese _ Mamoru Osanai and Toru Suzuki. Herrera shot 68,
Osanai the day's best score of 66 and Suzuki carded a 69.
	   Richard Backwell of Australia shot a 69 and shared seventh with
Hsieh Chin-sheng of Taiwan and two Japanese _ Masayuki Kawamura and
Nobumitsu Yuhara at 279. Hsieh and Kawamura shot 70s and Yuhara had
72 Sunday.

Clinton's daughter prays at Western Wall on eve of Hannukah
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Chelsea Clinton visited Jerusalem's Old Walled
City on Sunday and prayed at Judaism's holiest site on the eve of
Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights.
	   In keeping with Jewish custom, she placed a note in the Western
Wall, last remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by the
Romans in A.D. 70.
	   Before placing the note, she sat on a chair in front of the
Western Wall and then knelt in prayer. During her visit, a shofar _
or ram's horn _ sounded a wailing note.
	   Hannukah commemorates the eight-day rededication of the Jewish
Temple by the Maccabees after their victory over the Syrians.
	   The president's daughter, dressed in dark pants and jacket,
prayed in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which marks a
traditional site of the tomb from which Jesus was resurrected after
the Crucifixion. Officials said a special room was opened for her
to pray.
	   Emerging from the church, a smiling Chelsea Clinton shook hands
with a Greek Orthodox priest. Earlier, she shook hands with a group
of visiting U.S. Marines.
	   A swarm of Israeli police and photographers followed her through
the narrow byways of the Old City.
	   She strolled along the Cardo, a reconstructed Roman-era walkway
lined with modern-day shops and ancient ruins, and walked through
the crowded ``suq,'' or market that is crowded with shops selling
clothes, aromatic spices, rugs and souvenirs. Tourists, a group of
Israeli soldiers and shoppers stopped to watch and wave.
	   During her tour, she also bought and drank some pomegranate
juice in the Muslim Quarter.

Maier returns to top of podium

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier
returned to the top of the podium for the first time since the
season began, winning a men's World Cup super-G on Sunday.
	   After being shutout in North America then finishing a dismal
36th in Saturday's downhill, ``The Herminator'' finally displayed
the form which led led him to the World Cup overall, super-G and
giant slalom titles last season.
	   Maier's victory was convincing, the 26-year-old Austrian
finishing over a second faster than his closest rival, teammate
Stephan Eberharter.
	   Maier charged down the wet, foggy Oreiller Killy course in 1
minute, 18.73 seconds, an impressive 1.18 seconds faster than
runnerup Eberharter, who clocked 1:19.91.
	   The winner of Saturday's downhill, Lasse Kjus of Norway returned
to the podium for the second time this weekend, finishing third in
1:20.10.
	   While Kjus's victory on Saturday ended a two-year winning
drought, Maier's super-G win marked the Austrian's return to the
top of the podium for the first time since winning the season
opening giant slalom in Soelden, Austria, in October.
	   Since then Maier, who dominated the circuit last season when he
won 11 races on way to becoming the overall World Cup champion, had
only a second place to show.
	   At this point last season, his rookie year on the World Cup
circuit, Maier had already collected a pair of victories and three
other podium finishes in five races.
	   After failing to place any skiers among the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill, Austria's one-two finish on Sunday helped restore the
nation's dented pride.

EU recommits to expansion but for 11 candidates picture stays
</HEADLINE>
fuzzy &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ For Cyprus and 10 East European nations
hoping to join the European Union, the picture can get fuzzy: If
the EU has a road map for its largest expansion ever, why is this
ride so bumpy?
	   Nine years after the Berlin Wall fell, the East Europeans still
get lofty declarations about a new Europe but no sense when they'll
be part of it.
	   The 15 EU leaders ended a two-day summit Saturday, again
declaring their eastward expansion _ membership talks began this
fall _ remains on track but still setting no entry dates.
	   First, they said, the EU leaders must end by March a fight over
how to finance enlargement and slash farm spending which consumes
half the EU budget and has escaped even minor cost-cutting since
1957.
	   Then the EU must reform its housekeeping rules that promise
decision-making gridlock when Cyprus and 10 East European nations
join. These reforms have been fruitlessly debated for years.
	   ``European integration is a marathon, not a sprint,'' Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu said after he and other eastern
leaders met with their EU colleagues.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder remained confident the EU
can settle its internal problems by March. His country, France, the
Netherlands, Austria and Denmark seek a spending freeze, keeping
outlays at 85 billion European currency units (about dlrs 100
billion) in the 2000-2006 period.
	   Spain and other southerners _ seeing EU funds going east at
their expense _ push for budget growth in line with economic
growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said that showed
rich-poor solidarity.
	   Retorted Schroeder: ``Germany has no unlimited resources (and)
expects the curve of its financial contribution to rise no more but
to start pointing downward.''
	   Germany and some of its neighbors pay more into the EU than they
get back. They want overpayments _ 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year in Germany's case _ capped somehow.
	   The EU is no stranger to 11th hour haggling over money and other
issues. The resulting image is often one of an outfit that makes
things up as it goes along.
	   After years of preparing for a single currency, the EU leaders
argued for 12 hours at a summit in Brussels last May over who
should be the European Central Bank chief.
	   After years of disagreements, the EU will craft a common defense
independent from Washington but within NATO. This is supposed to
shore up a shaky EU foreign policy, coordinated by someone whose
name was not announced here because the EU leaders must yet agree
on who it should be.
	   In 1991, the EU ended duty-free sales by 1999, declaring them
incompatible with a single market Europe. Here, the leaders agreed
to review and possibly reverse that decision.
	   The EU wants to enlarge but must still figure out how to finance
that. Schroeder spoke of a March deal on farm and budget reforms.
French President Jacques Chirac spoke of a deal by June.
	   The EU wants to enlarge but sets no entry dates saying that will
make candidates stop working on economic reforms to get ready for
membership. Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek complained the
West Europeans want candidates to be ready for membership fast yet
sets no finish line. ``This should be done in a parallel way,'' he
complained.
	   ``We haven't heard anything about a timetable (for joining),''
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said. ``In the future it will be
necessary.''
	   The EU stance upsets Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia the most.
These three are in a slow track to membership but have been
scurrying to meet conditions for joining. Despite a recommendation
from the EU head office, the EU leaders declined to advance them to
the fast negotiating track.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S.
President Clinton met Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace accord back
on track.
	   After getting together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite,
the two leaders met at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to
reporters later. The president was sure to be asked about the
impeachment drama unfolding in Washington.
	   At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu
said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to true
peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of
ignoring commitments in peace accords.
	   Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday in the Gaza Strip.
	   Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the
Clinton visit. At the hotel where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen
were posted to guard the president and his 600-member delegation.
	   Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, set out on
their own schedule. Mrs. Clinton toured a school in a cooperative
village of Jews and Palestinians, while Chelsea visited Jerusalem's
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters during a
picture-taking session with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
that Israel ``has not left'' the Wye River agreement.
	   ``We will not give up'' on the land-for-security accord, Sharon
said. But, he added, ``it should be based on mutual reciprocity.''
	   About two hours before Air Force One landed Saturday night, the
House Judiciary Committee approved a fourth article of impeachment
against Clinton. The full House will vote on the impeachment
articles next week.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel was asked Sunday if the
success of Clinton's visit would turn on the question of revoking
the Palestinian Liberation Organization's founding charter.
	   ``President Clinton played a very important role in the Wye
Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going to be very,
very important that this visit show us at least a readiness on the
part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace,'' Fogel
said.
	   There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school
student was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   In his remarks at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night,
Netanyahu said the peace process is in danger.
	   ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking in Hebrew, ``The
truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians again
constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to
forgo fulfillment of those commitments.''
	   Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil in his hard-line
coalition government, said he could not accept ``a phony peace on
paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.''
	   Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in
October, the land-for-security agreement has hit one snag after
another. Israel froze implementation of the accord altogether,
accusing Arafat of violating the deal and inciting violent street
protests.
	   Clinton said the United States shares Israel's concerns about
security.
	   ``Peace is not simply an option among many but the only choice
that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and
sorrow,'' he said. ``That is why I'm here.'' He said ``both sides
now must face the challenge of implementing Wye.''
	   Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The
Israeli leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament
prepares for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition
began to weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum
Oct. 23 agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to
be met by Palestinian security measures.
	   Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals
until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the
Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over procedures for
revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's
destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish
state.
	   On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza
Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit.
Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National
Council is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian
statehood.
	   ``It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state,''
Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council,
said in an interview Sunday.

Maier returns to top of podium

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier
returned to the top of the podium for the first time since the
season began, winning a men's World Cup super-G on Sunday.
	   After being shutout in North America then finishing a dismal
36th in Saturday's downhill, ``The Herminator'' finally displayed
the form which led him to the World Cup overall, super-G and giant
slalom titles last season.
	   Maier's victory was convincing, the 26-year-old Austrian
finishing over a second faster than his closest rival, teammate
Stephan Eberharter.
	   Maier charged down the wet, foggy Oreiller Killy course in 1
minute, 18.73 seconds, an impressive 1.18 seconds faster than
runnerup Eberharter, who clocked 1:19.91.
	   The winner of Saturday's downhill, Lasse Kjus of Norway returned
to the podium for the second time this weekend, finishing third in
1:20.10.
	   While Kjus's victory on Saturday ended a two-year winning
drought, Maier's super-G win marked the Austrian's return to the
top of the podium for the first time since winning the season
opening giant slalom in Soelden, Austria, in October.
	   Since then Maier, who dominated the circuit last season when he
won 11 races on way to becoming the overall World Cup champion, had
only a second place to show.
	   At this point last season, his rookie year on the World Cup
circuit, Maier had already collected a pair of victories and three
other podium finishes in five races.
	   After failing to place any skiers among the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill, Austria's one-two finish on Sunday helped restore the
nation's dented pride.

Japanese, Taiwanese take golf golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Lu Hsiao-chuan shot an even-par 72
Sunday for a 288 total, leading a Taiwanese sweep of the top three
places in Asian Games golf.
	   Japan's Tomohiro Kondo also finished with 72 for a 4-under total
of 284 and the men's golf gold. He finished one shot ahead of the
Philippines' Gerald Rosales.
	   Taiwan also won the women's team gold, and Japan was the men's
team champion.
	   Despite the Taiwanese sweep of the top women's places, South
Korea's Jang Jeong took the bronze with a 291 total after a 73
Sunday because Asian Games rules limit medal to two per country in
any event.
	   Lu gained her one-shot victory with a birdie on the par-4 16th
and a last-hole bogey by teammate Wei Jun-jye, who shot 73-289 for
the silver. Taiwan's Lin Yu-ping, who bogeyed the par-5 17th,
missed out on an individual medal despite her 72-290.
	   Lin still shared in the team gold, which Taiwan won with 575 to
585 for South Korea and 596 for the Philippines.
	   Kondo's victory came after Rosales bogeyed the par-5 14th hole
and Kondo birdied the par-3 15th.
	   Japan's Hidemasa Hoshino took the bronze with a 286, one shot
behind Rosales, after a final-round 70.
	   Japan won the team gold with 862 to 866 for the Philippines and
872 for Taiwan, whose Hong Chai-yuh shot 69 Sunday, leaving him two
shots out of the individual medals at 288.

Canada, Netherlands win most golds in World Cup speedskating

	   NAGANO, Japan (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Catriona LeMay Doan
looked set to sweep the women's sprints, but after a minor mishap
in the final race Sunday, had to settle for three of four possible
golds at the Nagano World Cup speedskating championship.
	   Competing in the 1,000 meters after winning the 500 in the
second round of the two-day event, the 27-year-old Canadian had to
slow down, missing a few strokes, to let Eriko Sanmiya of Japan
switch into the outside lane.
	   Sanmiya admitted she was at fault.
	   ``It happened either because I was too slow as the starter on
the inside lane or Catriona was too fast and almost caught me up at
the switching point,'' said Sanmiya.
	   ``I feel very sorry that it might have cost her a medal,'' she
added.
	   The two were attempting their fourth 1-2 finish in the same
twosome, with Sanmiya seeking her fourth silver in two days.
	   After the setback, LeMay Doan finished fifth in 1 minute, 18.88
seconds, 0.97 second off the pace. Sanmiya was 16th with an
unimpressive time of 1:19.94.
	   On Saturday, the Canadian star skated 1:18.07 for the gold and
the Japanese skater 1:19.49 for the silver. LeMay Doan also took
the gold in the 500 on Saturday.
	   No complaint was filed by the Canadians with the organizers.
	   ``When I apologized to Catriona after the race, she told me not
to worry. ``Don't worry. No problem,'' she said apparently trying
to comfort me,'' Sanmiya said.
	   Tonny de Jong, a 5,000-meter specialist from the Netherlands,
set her personal best of 1:17.91 for the gold in her first ever
competition in a World Cup 1,000 meters.
	   But the Canadians won the team's fourth overall gold anyway.
	   Canada's Jeremy Wotherspoon took the men's 500 meters after
Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu fell
while negotiating a corner.
	   Shimizu, winner of the event Saturday, had the day's fastest lap
time of 9.64 seconds for the first 100 meters before he fell and
slammed into the protective wall. Shimizu suffered minor contusion
on the elbow and the thigh, his staff said.
	   His race partner in the final twosome, Wotherspoon, sped alone
to victory in 35.85 seconds. The Canadian was the silver medalist
Friday.
	   Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos gave the Netherlands the day's
fourth gold with a victory in the men's 1,000 meters. He also won
the event on Saturday.
	   Bos said the Netherlands, long a powerhouse in long-distance
races, is now putting as much emphasis on shorter races under the
influence and program of Peter Mueller, an American coach the
country hired one and a half years ago.
	   ``From the beginning it started well and he has a really good
program,'' said the 22-year-old Bos. ``He has built a team of
harmony and good atmosphere _ we have a lot of fun together _ and
we train very hard.''
	   With Mueller at the helm, the Dutch excelled in both the
500-meter and 1,000-meter events at the Olympics at Nagano.
	   The two-day event was the first of five short-race World Cups
for the 1998-1999 season. Two rounds of 500- and 1,000-meter
competition were staged both for women and men.

Jayasinghe hurt, Ito flies

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ World sprint silver medalist Susantika
Jayasinghe, under investigation on a drugs charge, said she pulled
a muscle in qualifying Sunday and was in doubt for the final of the
Asian Games 100-meter event.
	   ``I pulled a hamstring in the race and I'm having a severe
headache,'' Jayasinghe said before charging away from reporters.
``I'm going to see a doctor and I'm hoping for the best.''
	   There were no obvious signs of something as serious as a
hamstring injury as Jayasinghe, the 200 silver medalist at last
year's Athens world championships, crossed the line in 11.30
seconds. She had been expected to win the sprint double comfortably
here and the 100 final is Monday evening.
	   Meanwhile, Japan's Koji Ito went into raptures when he smashed
the Asian record in the semifinals of the men's 100, clocking
10.00.
	   He leaped around, threw his arms in the air and puffed out his
chest as if he had already won the gold medal.
	   Ito's Japanese colleague Kenji Takao was just as excited after
winning the 10,000-meter race by outsprinting Qatar's Ahmed Hashim
down the last 50 meters. The 23-year-old from Kyoto won the last of
five track and field finals decided Sunday.
	   Jayasinghe tested positive for a steroid in March and is
competing while the International Amateur Athletic Federation waits
to hold an arbitration meeting to decide her fate.
	   The Sri Lankan federation dismissed the charge after she
maintained she took the drug, Nandralone-19, to control her
menstrual cycle.
	   If the IAAF rules against her, Jayasinghe would lose any medals
won here.
	   Ito, who held the 100 record jointly with fellow Japanese
Noburharu Asahara at 10.08, got a break when the wind dropped
slightly and gave him a tailwind just under the maximum allowable
limit. Earlier he clocked 10.03 in the heats, only to have a record
denied because of the strong winds at the main stadium.
	   ``I didn't think I would run these times today but I felt very
relaxed,'' Ito said.
	   Ito's teammate Koji Murofushi proved he was forged from the same
stuff as the ``Iron Man of Asia'' when he joined famous father
Shigenobu as an Asian Games hammer champion.
	   But Koji has to win four more titles over the next 16 years to
match Shigenobu, who earned his ``Iron Man'' nickname by winning
the event from Bangkok in 1970 to Seoul in 1986.
	   Koji broke his own national record Sunday with 78.57 meters to
beat Uzbekistan's Andrey Abduvaliev, who was well off his best with
77.14 and fouled on his final three attempts.
	   ``What I did today was more than I had expected. I didn't
imagine the competition would turn out this way,'' said Koji, who
led the whole way and improved his record for the fifth time this
year.
	   Abduvaliev has a best distance of 82.66 meters and Murofushi
apologized to him after the event. ``I said `I'm sorry that I won,'
and he replied `Well done,''' Koji said.
	   Japan's Yoko Ota claimed the gold medal in the women's high jump
while her compatriot Miki Imai, the Asian champion, lagged in
fourth.
	   In a tight competition, Ota jumped 1.88 meters to beat China's
Jin Ling on a countback. Imai was one of four, including bronze
medalist Anna Chertrova of Kyrgyzstan, to end at 1.84.
	   Yu Guohui claimed China's first track and field gold medal at
these games with a comfortable victory in the men's 20-kilometer
walk.
	   Yu took more than two minutes off his previous best time in
recording 1 hour, 20 minutes, 25 seconds, a games record.
	   Luan Zhili added a gold for China in the women's discus. Her
best throw of 63.43 put the world championship finalist well clear
of compatriot Liu Fengyin (59.34) and India's Neelam J. Singh
(55.09).
	   India's veteran sprinter P.T. Usha, making her swan song at the
Asian Games, scrambled through to the women's 400-meter final.
Usha, 33, retired for eight years before her surprise return at the
Asian championships in July, where she grabbed a bronze medal.
	   In 1984, she became India's best performer at an Olympic track
meet, missing out on the 400 bronze by just .01 seconds.
	   Asian champion Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka won Usha's
semifinal comfortably, finishing in 52.48 seconds. Usha, tucked in
Lane 1, struggled in blustery conditions and was fourth in 54.63
but qualified seventh fastest into Monday's final. Second fastest
was Kazakstan's Svetlana Bodritskaya.
	   ``I could have done better but it's a fast track and I don't
like running on fast tracks,'' said Usha, who had suffered a
hamstring injury last month.
	   Usha said she would contest the 200 as well as the 400 here.

Standoff over Kosovo ghost town scares refugees, threatens truce

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A heavy silence pervades the dead
zone at the center of Kosovo's suspended war, where only packs of
wild dogs and fear thrive.
	   Suddenly a lone figure in a black beret appears in the rubble of
the decimated ghost town, tracked intently by a gunman in blue on a
distant rooftop.
	   The ethnic Albanian refugee feels the Serb sniper's gaze but
averts his eyes as he trudges through a nightmarish landscape of
charred, smashed buildings.
	   ``Even if they kill me, I had to see my hometown again,''
72-year-old Adem Mazreku says, gesturing to the police base where a
tank barrel aims menacingly at the town. ``But as long as they are
here, we won't come back.''
	   Malisevo, located in the Drenica region that is the heartland of
separatist rebels, has become a focal point of unsuccessful
diplomacy to settle the conflict in the Serbian province.
	   The U.N. refugee agency says it is a ``symbol of fear'' among
tens of thousands of displaced people _ a stark reminder that all
is not well in Kosovo despite the absence of combat.
	   Despite a two-month-old truce, a Serb-Albanian standoff over the
eerie town remains unresolved. Many fear it will provide the spark
to ignite new fighting across Kosovo by spring.
	   Diplomats and humanitarian officials have pressed Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw police from their Malisevo
fortress, in order to facilitate the Kosovo Albanians' return to
their homes.
	   But he has refused. The daily patrols of Serb armored vehicles
and truckloads of gun-toting Malisevo policemen through area
villages send children scurrying and have raised fears of a new
showdown.
	   The potential for explosive incidents is so high that
international monitors have begun accompanying the police on their
rounds, producing the unlikely sight of U.S. armored cars leading
Serb convoys.
	   Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of the capital
Pristina, was the main stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army
when Serbian police overran it in July, sending its 3,000 residents
fleeing ahead of a scorched-earth offensive.
	   The Serbs maintain the police contingent is necessary to prevent
the KLA from reclaiming the key town. They reject the rebels'
demand that they withdraw from Malisevo _ and international
diplomats acknowledge that their presence there does not violate
the October agreement on pullouts as the guerrillas claim.
	   ``Police will remain stationed in Malisevo regardless of the
KLA's request,'' said a senior police official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Nowhere in the world should police
withdraw on terrorists' demand.''
	   Barely three kilometers (two miles) away, KLA fighters walk
around openly in the adjacent village of Dragobilje. Several guard
the entrance to a low-slung compound where rows of black combat
boots line the doorway _ a rebel command post.
	   ``These activities must stop,'' says Daja Cet, a stern-faced
local KLA commander. ``Only Albanians live in this area. Their
patrols are a provocation.''
	   The Americans' decision to escort Serb convoys, after two Serb
policemen were killed while delivering supplies to Malisevo, raised
eyebrows among some European diplomats.
	   But a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is taking over monitoring duties in
the area, says the idea is to avoid further abuses by the Serbs,
not assist them.
	   ``They're there to verify that the police patrol behaves in a
manner that's in line with the cease-fire agreement, and not
harassment of the local population,'' Duncan Bullivant said.
	   A team of British verifiers hopes to further discourage violence
by moving into a house in abandoned Malisevo.
	   In the meantime, few dare linger in the town.
	   Neighboring villages, packed with Malisevo's displaced, were
buzzing with alarm in recent days after reports that a Serb sniper
fired from the police station at two people who were trying to move
out of their damaged homes.
	   Still, a small handful of people make their way cautiously every
day through the wreckage of broken glass, chunks of bricks, and
splintered wood to visit their former homes.
	   For many, it is a matter not of curiosity but desperation.
	   Sevdije Mazreku, 22, a neighbor of Adem but no relation, passes
him on her way into town and inquires about the danger. Eight
months' pregnant with her fourth child, she has made the long walk
from another village in order to fetch belongings left behind in
panic last summer.
	   ``I'm very afraid, but I had to come back,'' she says. ``I have
no other way to get clothes for my children.''
	   Timidly escorting visitors to her still-intact house, which she
visited earlier this fall, she surveys the damage sadly. Family
photos of smiling children from another time remain on the wall,
but clothes are heaped in a pile, mattresses are rotting, and
furniture, TV, VCR and jewelry are missing.
	   She and six other people, including her children, now subsist in
the damp basement of a house _ miserable conditions, but safer than
Malisevo.
	   At mention of her coming baby, she puts a hand on her belly and
smiles plaintively.
	   ``Who can be happy giving birth to a baby in the middle of a
war,'' she says, ``without even basic necessities?''

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A heavy silence pervades the dead
zone at the center of Kosovo's suspended war, where only packs of
wild dogs and fear thrive.
	   Suddenly a lone figure in a black beret appears in the rubble of
the decimated ghost town, tracked intently by a gunman in blue on a
distant rooftop.
	   The ethnic Albanian refugee feels the Serb sniper's gaze but
averts his eyes as he trudges through a nightmarish landscape of
charred, smashed buildings.
	   ``Even if they kill me, I had to see my hometown again,''
72-year-old Adem Mazreku says, gesturing to the police base where a
tank barrel aims menacingly at the town. ``But as long as they are
here, we won't come back.''
	   Malisevo, located in the Drenica region that is the heartland of
separatist rebels, has become a focal point of unsuccessful
diplomacy to settle the conflict in the Serbian province.
	   The U.N. refugee agency says it is a ``symbol of fear'' among
tens of thousands of displaced people _ a stark reminder that all
is not well in Kosovo despite the absence of combat.
	   Despite a two-month-old truce, a Serb-Albanian standoff over the
eerie town remains unresolved. Many fear it will provide the spark
to ignite new fighting across Kosovo by spring.

Officials look to lessen crowd pressure at Thai games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian Games officials announced
Saturday that they are opening up more ticket booths to help meet
the demand for tickets after disturbances at Thailand's soccer
matches.
	   ``We must reduce the pressure outside the stadium,'' said Dr.
Sakchye Tupsuwan, chairman of the Asian Games Technical Committee.
	   Thailand plays South Korea Monday in a quarterfinal match in the
Asian Games soccer tournament.
	   Officials were responding to Saturday's near riot as 20,000
ticketless fans stormed the stadium and threw bottles, cans and
shoes after tickets sold out in an hour.
	   Four new outlets downtown and Rajamangala National Stadium were
given more tickets to sell in advance for Thailand's game against
South Korea, one of the best teams in the tournament.
	   Organizers say they are dealing with the situation in the most
appropriate manner.
	   ``We are trying to solve this problem, but it is difficult,
particularly with football,'' said Kanis Isadul, a member of the
ticketing subcommittee.
	   Isadul added that there would be a limit of five tickets per
person. The limit was set to cut down on the number of scalpers
outside the stadium.
	   For those still unable to get tickets, the Sports Authority is
installing a large mobile television screen outside the stadium.
	   ``It is probably the only one in Thailand. If we find any ore,
we will get them,'' Sakchye said.
	   However, with Monday's game expected to be another sell-out,
officials continued to urge people to stay home and watch the
soccer on their own televisions.
	   ``What could be better,'' said Sakchye, `` than to stay home and
sip some whiskey or tea?''

 &UR; Dismissed Cobar miners threaten to riot

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Dismissed copper miners have threatened
to riot and occupy a Cobar mine if Swiss company Glencore fails to
sign off on a deal to buy the mine on Tuesday.
	   Glencore and the Mount Lyell Mining Co. agreed in principle in
September to buy the western New South Wales mine, which had closed
in February resulting in the loss of 270 jobs.
	   Mount Lyell and Glencore agreed to buy the mine after the
government offered relief from taxes and deferred royalty payments.
	   Also, last week, it was announced that the miners were set to
receive a cash payout of more than 5 million Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 3.1 million) by Dec. 25, ending a 10-month battle for
entitlements owed by the former mine owner, Ashanti Goldfields Co,
of Ghana.
	   A creditors' meeting scheduled for Tuesday was expected to seal
the deal.
	   Shearers' and Rural Workers' Union general secretary Stephen
Roach said Glencore was refusing to sign the agreement until it
negotiated a better deal on the supply of water with Cobar Shire
Council.
	   ``We thought the deal was all stitched up but now Glencore is
not going to sign off until this water deal is cleared up _ three
months ago that didn't matter,'' Roach said.
	   ``They picked up the mine for next to nothing, they've been
promised 4 million dollars in concessions by the New South Wales
government _ now they want more,'' he said.
	   If Glencore did not sign off on the deal at the creditors'
meeting on Tuesday, Roach said the retrenched miners would ``occupy
and run the mine ourselves.''
	   ``Or we're going to have a riot,'' Roach said. ``Someone even
talked about driving a ute (pickup truck) down the mine shaft and
stuffing up the whole operation.''
	   Many of the former miners would be in ``big, big'' financial
trouble if they weren't paid before Dec. 25, Roach said.
	   ``Many of these people are in so much debt that the money
they'll get will only clear their debts,'' he said.

Iran's press is battleground for the country's future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Waving old copies of the banned liberal
newspaper Tous, Iranian youths at a pro-democracy rally shouted as
if they were fans at a soccer match: ``Give us back the freedom
paper.''
	   ``Freedom, forever,'' they yelled, their voices getting louder
and angrier.
	   ``Yazdi, resign, resign,'' they chanted, referring to Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, who as the head of the powerful judiciary is behind
the closure of about half a dozen newspapers and the arrests of
several journalists.
	   The reason behind the anger is that Iran's newspapers are at the
center of the battle over the country's future between President
Mohammad Khatami and the hard-line clerics who oppose his efforts
to liberalize government and society.
	   The newspapers do not just cover the news, they are the news.
	   Since Iran has no formal political parties, most of Tehran's 37
papers have become stand-in parties _ each with its own platform _
in what has become the liveliest democratic debate the country has
ever seen.
	   The moderates claim about a dozen newspapers _ the most popular
being Salam, Hamshahri, Zan, Jahan-e Eslam, Asr-e Ma and Arya.
	   The hard-line papers include Kayhan, Resalat, Jomhuri Eslami,
Shalamcheh and Abrar. Shalamcheh reflects the extremist views of
the Ansar-e Hezbollah, a vigilante group that regularly breaks up
pro-democracy rallies and attacks dissidents.
	   The outspoken Tous, closed down in September, has become a
symbol in the struggle for a free press. Its editor, Mashallah
Shamsolvaezin, says the liberal papers started after Khatami's
election are being attacked by hard-liners to undermine the
president.
	   ``They were unable to fight him directly, so they attacked his
achievements to weaken him,'' said Shamsolvaezin.
	   ``I believe that Mr. Khatami's program of free expression has
suffered a serious stroke and it is now in intensive care,'' said
Shamsolvaezin, whose paper had a circulation of 300,000, the second
largest in Iran.
	   Shamsolvaezin, who was jailed along with three other senior
colleagues, said 30 vigilantes stormed his newspaper in September
``by jumping over the wall,'' blindfolding them and making them
stand against the wall.
	   ``It was very uncivilized,'' he said at his Tehran home shortly
after his release.
	   Tous' struggle to survive is typical of how the battle between
moderates and hard-liners over Iran's future is being fought.
	   The paper began publishing with the name Jameah after Khatami
became president in August 1997. A court order, alleging libel and
fabrication of stories, closed it down last June.
	   It then reappeared under two other names _ Tous and Aftab-e
Emrouz _ after being given new licenses to publish by the Ministry
of Culture and Guidance, which is under Khatami's control.
	   Each time it was shut down by the judiciary, which is run by the
hard-liners.
	   The paper was first closed after it reported that the commander
of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, Gen. Rahim Safavi, told his
troops in private meeting to ``cut out the throats and tongues'' of
the liberal press.
	   But Tous had a stormy relationship with the hard-liners from the
start, partly because it questioned the absolute powers of Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   The paper was closed for good June 16, a day after Khamenei
ordered the judiciary to get tough with newspapers that he claimed
had abused press freedom. Several other publications, including the
lively Rah-e Now, also were closed.
	   Shamsolvaezin won't apologize for questioning the leader's
absolute powers and demands to know the legal reason his paper was
shut down.
	   ``The constitution stipulates that the leader is like any other
citizen before the law,'' he said. ``What did we do wrong? What did
we violate? Give us a constitutional reason why and where we acted
against the law.''
	   But even some moderates say Tous went too far in attacking the
right-wing clerics.
	   ``Tous marched ahead with a sharp object and plunged it right
into their stomach,'' said Abbas Abdi, editor of the liberal daily
Salam.
	   Some journalists also say Tous miffed Khamenei because it
ignored an unspoken rule of Iranian newspapers _ dedicating the top
of the front page and a few inside columns to news about the leader
and senior clergymen.
	   But Ali Movahedi Savoji, a hard-line member of Parliament, says
the judiciary acted totally under the law in banning Tous.
	   ``Over the past year, we gave them 114 warnings that they were
violating the law. The press is free, but at the same time laws
have to be obeyed,'' said Savoji.
	   Shamsolvaezin has a different view about so-called freedom in
Iran following his jailing.
	   ``We have freedom of expression in Iran,'' he said. ``But the
problem is freedom after expression.''

Israeli jets break the sound barrier over Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over Beirut Sunday, rattling windows of apartment buildings.
	   No damage was reported from the 10:55 a.m. (0855 GMT)
overflights which were the first over the Lebanese capital since
last Thursday when Israeli jets flew low over Beirut and its
suburbs, causing widespread panic.
	   Sunday's flights came a few hours after Lebanese guerrillas
exchanged artillery and rocket fire with Israeli forces in the
Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrilla group said its fighters
hit an Israeli Merkava tank with rockets in Iqlim al-Tuffah
province, some 15 kilometers (9 miles) southeast of the southern
city of Sidon.
	   It gave no casualty figures. There was no Israeli confirmation
of the report.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is trying to oust the 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army from
the 1,100-square-kilometer (440-square-mile) occupation strip along
the Lebanese-Israeli border.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP)_ Middle-order batsman Yousaf Youhanna hit
his maiden Test century Sunday but poor light and fog may rob
Pakistan of a victory in the second Test against Zimbabwe and level
the series.
	   When poor light brought yet another early stumps on the fourth
day, Zimbabwe was 48 without loss in its second innings after
conceding a big 142-run first innings lead earlier in the day.
Zimbabwe was bundled out for 183 in its first innings on the first
day.
	   Umpires Darrell Hair and Mian Aslam called off day's play after
light faded at tea with Gavin Rennie unbeaten on 16 and Grant
Flower not out on 17. A total of 171 minutes play was lost on day
four. Dense fog allowed only 13 overs to be bowled on Saturday and
now Zimbabwe looks to keeping its 1-0 lead intact in the
three-match series unless it suffers a collapse.
	   Earlier, Pakistan captain Moin Khan declared the first innings
an hour before tea at 325 for nine with Youhanna remaining unbeaten
on 120 and Waqar Younis hitting a quickfire unbeaten 24 with the
help of four fours.
	   Youhanna, 24, playing in his seventh Test, and Younis put on
best ever 10th wicket partnership against Zimbabwe when they made
run-a-minute 50 runs for the unbroken stand.
	   ``I'm quite happy with my performance. But unfortunately the
weather is playing a cruel role in our aim of squaring the
series,'' Youhanna said.
	   Pakistan lost the first Test at Peshawar by seven wickets and is
desperately looking to level the series at Lahore. ``We can't do
anything. The weather here has unfortunately disrupted our plans
badly,'' Pakistan captain Khan, who is leading the team in the
absence of Aamir Sohail, said.
	   Early morning fog delayed the start of the day by 75 minutes and
Pakistan lost three quick wickets in space of four runs. After
resuming at the overnight total of 211 for five, medium paceman
Henry Olonga claimed three wickets in a fiery six-over spell which
cost him 11 runs.
	   Olonga trapped Khan leg before in his first over of the day
after the batsman had added a run to his overnight 24. Olonga then
had Wasim Akram (2) caught by Neil Johnson at second slip and then
uprooted Saqlain Mushtaq's (0) off stump.
	   However, Youhanna, who was yet to complete his half century at
the fall of eighth wicket at the total of 215, found able
assistance from Shoaib Akhtar (11) and Younis. Youhanna put on 50
runs with Akhtar and in all hammered 15 fours and a six off Adam
Huckle in making unbeaten 120 before Khan declared the innings.
	   Olonga snapped up three wickets for 63 while Johnson (2-71) and
Huckle (2-40) were the other main Zimbabwean wicket-takers.

Hillary Clinton asks Arabs and Jews to overcome stereotypes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWE SHALOM, Israel (AP) _ Hillary Clinton on Sunday lit a
Hanukkah candle, a Christmas tree and a Ramadan lantern in a
village where 36 Arab and Jewish families live together and held up
the community as an example for others to follow.
	   ``If all children could have this experience, we would be that
much closer to peace,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a speech Newe Shalom
school children sitting five-deep on the school house steps.
	   Newe Shalom, known in Arabic is Wahat as-Salam, or ``Oasis of
Peace,'' was founded 22 years ago by a Dominican monk who wanted to
show that Arabs and Jews could live in the same community.
	   However, the idea has not caught on and Arabs and Jews still
largely live in separate towns, villages and neighborhoods.
	   On her first stop in Newe Shalom, nestled on a hill west of
Jerusalem, Mrs. Clinton visited the kindergarten where youngsters
sat around three low tables and colored balloons were strung across
the room.
	   Kids at each table worked on drawings and cuttings for one of
the three holidays starting this month _ the Jewish Festival of
Lights, or Hanukkah, Christmas and the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan. Mrs. Clinton moved from table to table, smiling and
occasionally bending down to talk to one of the children.
	   On a fourth table, a Ramadan lantern, a small Christmas tree and
a Menorah, the eight-armed Hanukkah candelabra, were set up, with a
child standing behind each religious object.
	   Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by Sarah Netanyahu, the wife of the
Israeli prime minister, moved behind the children and was handed a
plain white candle. With the flame of Mrs. Clinton's candle, the
children lit the Menorah, the tree and the lantern as the others
clapped and sang holiday songs, including ``Jingle Bells'' in
Arabic.
	   Addressing the older children on the schoolhouse steps, Mrs.
Clinton, said she grew up in an all-white neighborhood and only as
a teen-ager began meeting blacks and Hispanics. Only then, she
said, did she understand that ``we had so much in common that I had
never understood before.''
	   Referring to the fragile Wye River peace agreement her husband
helped negotiate and is now trying to rescue, Mrs. Clinton said
that ``the strong belief that peace will prevail must once again be
reinforced.''
	   She said that for peace to be real, it was not enough to sign
agreements. ``Peace actually begins in our homes, in communities
like this, and in our hearts and it has to be nurtured within and
among human beings and then passed on to our children and that is
precisely what you are doing here,'' she said.
	   Later Sunday, Mrs. Clinton was to visit a mother-child center at
Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem and an Israeli preschool enrichment
program she helped bring to Arkansas. On Monday, in the Gaza Strip,
she will tour the Shati refugee camp and, in the company of
Arafat's wife, Soha, visit a center for handicapped children.

Newsweek: Milosevic says NATO operation in Kosovo would be
</HEADLINE>
aggression &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - Any attempt by NATO's quick reaction
force in Macedonia to move into Kosovo would be considered an act
of aggression, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is quoted as
telling Newsweek magazine.
	   NATO is setting up a French-led force in Macedonia to rescue
international personnel monitoring the October peace accord in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia.
	   But in an interview with Newsweek, Milosevic said ``if they come
into our territory, we will consider it an act of aggression.''
	   Asked whether the Yugoslav army would fight back, Milosevic
replied: ``That is the duty of our army, not to allow any foreign
troops to get into our territory.''
	   The NATO extraction force was created in the wake of U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the fighting
in Kosovo without the Western alliance resorting to airstrikes.
	   Milosevic denied he had ever agreed to allow ``any foreign
military on the territory of Yugoslavia.''
	   ``If they want to have their forces in another country, we
cannot prohibit that,'' he added.
	   In the interview, Milosevic claimed the diplomatic deadlock in
resolving the Kosovo crisis was caused by ``groups of Albanian
politicians who are Nazis.''
	   ``Their publicly declared aim is an ethnically pure state,'' he
said. Milosevic said the latest American plan, which both ethnic
Albanian and Serbs have rejected, ``favors the Albanians'' and
``has to be developed.''
	   ``Kosovo was always a region of Serbia and will always be part
of Serbia,'' he said. ``That region is populated by many different
national communities: Serbs, Montenegrin Albanians and others. The
approach of the Serbian government is that the national communities
living there have to be equal.''

Kuwait takes final two shooting golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Fehaid Al-Deehani won gold in men's
individual trap shooting and led Kuwait to the team championship
Sunday at the Asian Games.
	   North and South Korea split the individual and team golds in an
extremely close men's center fire pistol competition that required
tie-breaking systems to decide the medals.
	   The events concluded a 34-event, seven-day shooting tournament
at the games. China won the most golds _ 18 _ but could gain only
one bronze Sunday.
	   Kuwait finished 1-2 in the men's individual trap shooting, with
Al-Deehani winning with 140 and Fahad Al-Deehani taking silver with
137. North Korea's Pae Won Guk won the bronze with 135.
	   The Kuwaits shot down a total of 346 targets for the team gold.
India had 329 and China 323.
	   In the men's center fire pistol event, North Korea's Park
Byung-taek, India's Jaspal Rana and Kazakstan's Vladimir Vokhmyanin
all shot 589. Tie-breaking formulas had to be used after Park and
Rana then both shot 149 and Vokhmyanin had 146 in an extra round.
	   They were used again in the team event, giving North Korea the
gold and South Korea the silver after both shot 1,749. India took
bronze with 1,747.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Caskets containing 40 of the 101
victims of a Thai Airways jetliner crash were loaded on a C-130
transport plane Sunday for the grim voyage back to Bangkok as
questions arose about the safety of Surat Thani airport.
	   Later in the day, 15 of the 45 injured survivors boarded another
plane to the capital to seek medical treatment.
	   Many of the survivors blamed the pilot of the A310-200 for the
crash which killed 101 people on board, but an official
investigation into the tragedy has just begun and government
officials cautioned against rushing to judgment.
	   Flight TG261 slammed into a flooded rubber plantation during a
heavy rainstorm Friday evening as it made a third attempt to land
at Surat Thani, a port and fishing village that serves as a gateway
to several resort islands popular with foreign tourists.
	   Control tower personnel insisted all their systems had been
functioning at the time of the disaster and said it was solely the
pilot's decision to attempt another landing.
	   But a Thai Airways official in Surat Thani, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the airport's Instrument Landing
System, normally used to guide aircraft in, had been removed during
a runway expansion several months ago.
	   That meant the pilot would have had to land only with use of
radio navigation and visibility, which was almost nonexistent at
the time.
	   Air traffic controllers contacted by The Associated Press said
they had been instructed by their superiors to neither confirm nor
deny the absence of the ILS system.
	   ``It was a mistake to try and land a third time,'' said a
sobbing Supakit Saejiew, whose friend Tawatchai Klaiwatanamath died
amid the burning wreckage of the purple and white jetliner.
	   ``He tried to land two times and couldn't. I didn't think he
would try again. Then I saw the crash and the fire,'' said Supakit,
who had been waiting to pick up the friend at the airport in Surat
Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Andrew Sharrock, an Australian survivor who suffered gashes,
bruises and a broken nose, also blamed pilot error for the crash.
	   ``I was worried after the first landing attempt when the pilot
pulled back hard and we went almost straight up,'' he said from his
bed at Bandon Hospital in Surat Thani.
	   ``He did the same thing again on the second attempt. On the
third attempt he just went too far, we were almost vertical.''
	   But Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, who
lost his sister in the crash, told The Nation newspaper he objected
to anyone blaming the pilot, who also died, before the facts become
known.
	   Thai Airways President Thamnoon Wanglee said Saturday it was too
soon to know exactly what caused the accident, but that the plane's
black box had been recovered and an investigation was underway.
	   The decision to attempt a third landing during a rainstorm
appeared to contradict the air carrier's standing policy.
	   In June, when the airline announced it was phasing out the use
of foreign pilots in favor of Thais, Chamlong Poompuang, deputy
vice president of flight operations, said cockpit crews had been
instructed to exercise great caution.
	   ``Pilots have been told to divert to other airports if they have
even the slightest hesitation over weather conditions at any
airport, in Thailand or abroad. This means no landing in stormy
weather. They've been told to be passive and conservative. It's
better to be safe than sorry,'' Chamlong said.
	   Thai Airways has cut back on a number of services because of the
country's economic crisis. Chamlong also said that pilots were
being instructed to take measures to save fuel, perhaps setting up
conflicting signals as far as safety and economy were concerned.
	   ``Safety is our highest priority,'' Thamnoon said Sunday when
asked about Chamlong's statements. ``What our policy is and what
happened are two different things.''
	   Thai Airways officials said a foreign insurance company would
participate in an autopsy on captain Pinit Vechasilp to determine
if he might have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
	   Airbus officials were also on their way to Thailand from France
to participate in the accident probe.
	   Thamnoon said families of the victims would receive dlrs 100,000
in compensation, while the injured would have their medical bills

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Caskets containing 40 of the 101
victims of a Thai Airways jetliner crash were loaded on a C-130
transport plane Sunday for the grim voyage back to Bangkok as
questions arose about the safety of Surat Thani airport.
	   Later in the day, 15 of the 45 injured survivors boarded another
plane to the capital to seek medical treatment.
	   Many of the survivors blamed the pilot of the A310-200 for the
crash which killed 101 people on board, but an official
investigation into the tragedy has just begun and government
officials cautioned against rushing to judgment.
	   Flight TG261 slammed into a flooded rubber plantation during a
heavy rainstorm Friday evening as it made a third attempt to land
at Surat Thani, a port and fishing village that serves as a gateway
to several resort islands popular with foreign tourists.
	   Control tower personnel insisted all their systems had been
functioning at the time of the disaster and said it was solely the
pilot's decision to attempt another landing.
	   But a Thai Airways official in Surat Thani, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the airport's Instrument Landing
System, normally used to guide aircraft in, had been removed during
a runway expansion several months ago.
	   That meant the pilot would have had to land only with use of
radio navigation and visibility, which was almost nonexistent at
the time.
	   Air traffic controllers contacted by The Associated Press said
they had been instructed by their superiors to neither confirm nor
deny the absence of the ILS system.
	   ``It was a mistake to try and land a third time,'' said a
sobbing Supakit Saejiew, whose friend Tawatchai Klaiwatanamath died
amid the burning wreckage of the purple and white jetliner.
	   ``He tried to land two times and couldn't. I didn't think he
would try again. Then I saw the crash and the fire,'' said Supakit,
who had been waiting to pick up the friend at the airport in Surat
Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Andrew Sharrock, an Australian survivor who suffered gashes,
bruises and a broken nose, also blamed pilot error for the crash.
	   ``I was worried after the first landing attempt when the pilot
pulled back hard and we went almost straight up,'' he said from his
bed at Bandon Hospital in Surat Thani.
	   ``He did the same thing again on the second attempt. On the
third attempt he just went too far, we were almost vertical.''
	   But Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, who
lost his sister in the crash, told The Nation newspaper he objected
to anyone blaming the pilot, who also died, before the facts become
known.
	   Thai Airways President Thamnoon Wanglee said Saturday it was too
soon to know exactly what caused the accident, but that the plane's
black box had been recovered and an investigation was underway.
	   The decision to attempt a third landing during a rainstorm
appeared to contradict the air carrier's standing policy.
	   In June, when the airline announced it was phasing out the use
of foreign pilots in favor of Thais, Chamlong Poompuang, deputy
vice president of flight operations, said cockpit crews had been
instructed to exercise great caution.
	   ``Pilots have been told to divert to other airports if they have
even the slightest hesitation over weather conditions at any
airport, in Thailand or abroad. This means no landing in stormy
weather. They've been told to be passive and conservative. It's
better to be safe than sorry,'' Chamlong said.
	   Thai Airways has cut back on a number of services because of the
country's economic crisis. Chamlong also said that pilots were
being instructed to take measures to save fuel, perhaps setting up
conflicting signals as far as safety and economy were concerned.
	   ``Safety is our highest priority,'' Thamnoon said Sunday when
asked about Chamlong's statements. ``What our policy is and what
happened are two different things.''
	   Thai Airways officials said a foreign insurance company would
participate in an autopsy on captain Pinit Vechasilp to determine
if he might have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
	   Airbus officials were also on their way to Thailand from France
to participate in the accident probe.
	   Thamnoon said families of the victims would receive dlrs 100,000
in compensation, while the injured would have their medical bills
paid for by Thai Airways and would receive 200,000 baht (dlrs
5,555) in expense money.
	   At least 25 foreigners were on board. Twelve survived: three
Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one
Briton.
	   The United States embassy in Bangkok said two Americans, Ken
Houseman of Montana, and Helen Gromme from Wyoming, were among
those who died. Their hometowns were not available.
	   Many of the bodies already recovered have been burned beyond
recognition or were in pieces, police and doctors said, making
identification difficult.
	   Meanwhile, weather forecasters on ITV, an independent television

coast of Thailand and advised anyone on resort islands in the area
to leave as soon as possible.

Maier returns to top of podium

	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier
returned to the top of the podium for the first time since the
start of the season, winning a men's World Cup super-G on Sunday.
	   Maier, who was in an early season slump after winning the
inaugural giant slalom in October, rebounded from a dismal 36th
place in Saturday's downhill to claim his 13th career World Cup
victory.
	   It was another dominating performance from ``The Herminator,''
who charged down the drizzly, fog-shrouded Oreiller Killy course in
1 minute, 18.73 seconds, more than a Y,Kclear of his nearest rival
and teammate Stephan Eberharter, runnerup in 1:19.91.
	   Lasse Kjus, the winner of Saturday's downhill of the same
course, kept up a productive weekend, finishing third in 1:20.10,
ahead of compatriot Kjetil Andre Aamodt, fourth in 1:20.39.
	   If Kjus's victory on Saturday ended a two-year winning drought,
Maier's super-G win marked the Austrian's return to the top of the
podium for the first time since winning the season opener in
Soelden, Austria, two months ago.
	   Since then Maier _ who dominated the circuit last season winning
11 races on way to becoming the overall, super-G and giant slalom
World Cup champion _ had only a second place to show.
	   At this point last season, his rookie year on the World Cup
circuit, Maier had already collected a pair of victories and three
other podium finishes in five races.
	   The victory moved Maier up the World Cup overall rankings to
fourth from fifth with 280 points.
	   Eberharter's second-place finish allowed him to take the lead
from teammate Christian Mayer in the overall. Eberharter leads with
368 points, while Mayer drops to second, 66 points behind.
	   Kjus remains in third, a single point ahead of Maier.
	   After failing to place any skiers among the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill, Austria's one-two finish on Sunday helped restore the
nation's dented pride.
	   This time, five Austrians placed in the top-10, with World Cup
downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finishing fifth in 1:20.40,
Hans Knauss sixth in 1:20.59 and Werner Franz crossing ninth, 2.44
adrift.
	   Italy's Peter Runggaldier had the seventh-fastest time, clocking
1:20.97, ahead of Fredrik Nyberg of Sweden, 2.23 back.

Presidents Cup a personal victory for Appleby
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Not for the first time this year,
tears welled in Stuart Appleby's eyes when mention was made of his
late wife Renay.
	   But after Sunday's victory in the Presidents Cup as a member of
the International team, the blond, spikey-haired 27-year-old
Australian felt he had done her proud.
	   ``It was her dream,'' said Appleby, who capped the
Internationals effort in the last singles match against 1998
Masters and British Open winner Mark O'Meara.
	   ``I know she was proud of me and proud of the friends that have
helped me.''
	   He lost 1-down to O'Meara in the singles, but finished with one
win and one draw in the foursomes and a win in his only fourball
match to assist the
	   Internationals to its historic nine-point win.
	   Renay Appleby, 25, was killed July 23 in a freak road accident
in London as the couple were about to board a train for Paris on a
second honeymoon. The pair were constant companions on and off the
course, Renay often caddying for and advising the two-time U.S. PGA
Tour winner.
	   The Presidents Cup is Appleby's first victory since Renay's
death, after he missed the cut in his return to U.S. PGA Tour, came
third then fifth in two Australasian tour starts and was then just
beaten in last week's Australian Open by countryman Greg Chalmers.
	   Appleby said during that tournament that life was getting better
since the loss of his wife, but he was getting used to it.
	   ``I'm just glad to end the year on a good note,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BENEFICIARIES: The Renay Appleby Memorial Fund will be one of
almost 40 charities which will benefit from the proceeds of the
Presidents Cup.
	   A unique aspect of the Presidents Cup is that the competitors
don't receive prize money based on performance. Instead, the net
proceeds are divided into equal shares for players and captains and
donated to charities chosen by them.
	   The take from the 1998 tournament is expected to exceed U.S.
dlrs 1.5 million. The Presidents Cup in 1994 contributed U.S. dlrs
750,000 to charity,
	   which was topped in 1996 when U.S. dlrs 800,000 was raised.
	   Charities nominated by players and captains are:
	   International
	   Stuart Appleby _ The Renay Appleby Memorial Fund, Cystic
Fibrosis Australia Inc.; Steve Elkington _ Harris County Constable
Dept.; Ernie Els _ Child Welfare of Suthern Africa, The Cancer
Association of South Africa, Emmaus; Carlos Franco _ Fundacion
Makel, Fundacion Dequeni; Wayne Grady _ Downs Syndrome Association

	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE GARDEN: Notwithstanding conditions ranging from
temperatures of more than 40C (100-plusF) one day to pouring rain
the next, the course at Royal Melbourne Golf Club was soundly
praised all week by both the International and U.S. teams.
	   Greenskeeper Jim Porter got his moment of glory when victorious
captain Peter Thomson, a Melbourne native who has played the course
hundreds if not thousands of times, called him to the stage during
Sunday's closing ceremony to thank him personally.
	   ``You were in winner in your own right,'' Thomson said, his arm
around the somewhat startled Porter.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WINNING PUTTER: Not even the prototype putter which 1998 Masters
and British Open winner Mark O'Meara used to win the Skins game
last month could save him at the Presidents cup.
	   O'Meara used a Taylor Made Nubbins putter to seal the U.S. dlrs
430,000 Skins win in California.
	   The U.S team was devastated on the greens, leveled by
consistently devastating putting by the Internationals, including
New Zealander Frank Nobilo's 40-footer to win the first match of
the first round, a precursor to the rest of the tournament.
	   ``They were going in from everywhere,'' a frustrated O'Meara
said.
	   He said he started the week with his lucky-Skins putter, but
couldn't come up with the goods.
	   ``I had been using a prototype putter at the start of the Skins
game and this week,'' he said.
	   ``But I went back to my old putter today. I changed putters
specifically to play here, and putted better too.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   KISS OFF: Fred Couples was being comforted in defeat by a hug
from new wife Thais. John Huston held the umbrella, shielding the
couple from the drizzling rain and from a a throng of photographers
as Mark O'Meara holed a short putt on the 18th Sunday evening, the
last shot of the last game in the tournament.
	   O'Meara won, the team didn't.
	   When the umbrella was lifted, Thais gave Couples one last kiss
on the cheek.
	   Approaching stage right, and with camera shutters all-aflutter,
O'Meara approached the other cheek, all puckered-up.
	   Couples turned to requite, but then shied away.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HE MEANT WELL: Greg Norman, the spiritual heart of the
International team, may have been relating to U.S. team captain
Jack Nicklaus' remark a few days earlier that his charges were like
his sons.
	   But Norman got a little muddled _ presumably _ when he tried to
describe the role that that International team captain and
five-times British Open winner Peter Thomson had played.
	   ``He has been the matriarch, the backbone of all of us,'' Norman
tried.
	   ``Patriarch,'' Thomson interrupted.
	   ``Did I say matriarch? You are an old woman, you told us to have
iced tea
	   on the bus, not beer.''

Indonesia's military chief defends militia plan as protests

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's armed forces chief on
Sunday defended a controversial plan to establish a civilian
militia, saying it was needed to safeguard law and order while the
Southeast Asian nation struggles with political change.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto said about 40,000 young people
would be recruited beginning January. They would receive
three-month basic military training and would be equipped with
sticks, riot shields and handcuffs.
	   Like police, they would have the power of arrest, he said. Other
officials said as many 200,000 might eventually be recruited.
	   In recent weeks thousands of students demanding greater
democracy have staged a series of anti-government protests in the
capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere.
	   Most of the protests have been peaceful, but several have ended
in violence and bloodshed. Thousands of troops have been deployed
throughout the capital and many roads have been blocked by armored
vehicles to stop street marches.
	   On Nov. 13 nine people were killed when security personnel
opened fire on students who tried to march on Parliament.
	   Last Thursday much of Jakarta was paralyzed when an estimated
10,000 protesters choked its streets.
	   Student protests and riots helped oust former authoritarian
President Suharto, 77, in May.
	   His successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie, has
proposed democratic reforms. However, students complain his agenda
for change is too slow and too conservative.
	   They also demand that Suharto, who was questioned by state
prosecutors last week, be put on trial immediately for corruption
during his 32 years in power.
	   Habibie has said that protests will be tolerated only if they
are staged within the law.
	   Many now fear that civil unrest and protests will worsen as
Indonesia prepares to hold a parliamentary election on June 7.
	   In response, the military and the government have announced a
plan to recruit and train unemployed young people for the militia
to help police and troops maintain order.
	   Wiranto said weeks of protest had stretched the resources of the
500,000-member military and police force and more personnel were
needed.
	   ``The level of disturbances has reached a level that's beyond
tolerance,'' Wiranto said.
	   He said Indonesia could only achieve a ``healthy democracy'' if
the rule of law is upheld.
	   ``I don't reckon mass gatherings that disregard the existing law
will promote democracy,'' he said of the almost daily protests.
	   ``We can no longer tolerate negative tendencies which create
anxieties, weaken confidence, and disturb the reform agenda. A
state that fails to uphold law and order would weaken...lose its
spirit and head toward a disaster,'' Wiranto said.
	   The plan to set up a militia has been widely criticized.
	   ``An armed militia would only create conflict among the
people,'' The Jakarta Post quoted former military commander,
retired army Gen. Edi Sudradjat, as saying.
	   Since Suharto's resignation, sporadic rioting and looting have
increased in many parts of the world's fourth most populous nation
as it grapples with the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Inflation and unemployment rates have soared. The government
says that almost half of its 202 million people now live in
poverty.
	   Critics of the military say many Indonesians now do not respect
the armed forces as details emerge of widespread human rights
abuses and corruption during the Suharto era.

South Korea knocks out Japan, enters volleyball final against
</HEADLINE>
China &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China blew Taiwan off the court in
straight sets Sunday to reach the finals of the Asian Games men's
volleyball, while South Korea's superior blocking overcame Japan
for the other spot.
	   The Chinese women, who finished second in the World Volleyball
Championships in Japan last month, were later undertaking a similar
demolition of host Thailand, whose young team battled bravely
against opponents on average a full head taller than they were.
	   In the men's matches, Japan's Hideyuke Otake and ace server
Norihiko Miyazaki were instrumental in holding South Korea close in
the first two sets. Japan lost the first, 11-15, and won the
second, 15-13.
	   But then Lee Kyung-soo, Kim Kyoung-hoon and Bang Sin-bong
erected a blocking wall up front that Japan was unable to
penetrate. The Korean trio punched holes in the Japanese defenses
with well-placed, blistering spikes to gain the final sets 15-3,
15-6.
	   The Thai women's squad managed to break China's semifinal
service a score of times in the first set and even took an early
2-0 lead. But the Chinese soon brought their height to bear and the
points started piling up.
	   The addition of a libero _ a specialized defensive player _ did
little to shore up the Thai back row and the Thais became equally
unable to compete at the net.
	   The Japanese and South Korean women's teams were to square off
in the second semifinal.
	   Asian sides once dominated the sport but have been slipping in
recent years. Italy defeated Yugoslavia for the men's world
champion title last month. The top Asian finisher, South Korea,
came in 13th.
	   The Chinese women, who lost in the world championship final to
Cuba, were joined in the top eight by only one other Asian side,
Japan, finishing eighth.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Terrorized residents scrambled for
cover as successive rocket assaults shook the war-ravaged capital
on Sunday killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 80
others, said eyewitnesses and officials.
	   The worst barrage shattered a northern neighborhood of Kabul
killing at least 15 people and wounding about 70 others, they said.
	   The first attack of the day, also in the same neighborhood,
occurred at dawn killing a 15 year-old-boy and wounding his father.
	   The latest assault in early afternoon hit a residential area
near the combined military and civilian airport. A child was killed
and 11 people, including eight women were hurt when 11 rockets
rained down on their homes.
	   No one took responsibility for the rocket attacks, but they all
came from north of the city where anti-Taliban fighters loyal to
ousted military chief Ahmed Shah Massood are deployed.
	   ``We don't know how many more Afghans will be killed by Afghans
... for how many years can this war will drag on?'' said Ghulam
Sakhi, a shopkeeper who was hiding in a basement of a six-story
apartment building along with about 12 other people.
	   Some of the worst damage in the relentless rocket attack _ one
of the worst in recent months _ was caused by one rocket that
landed on the road in front of a moving bus packed with people,
said eyewitnesses.
	   Taxi drivers in the area grabbed the dead and wounded and rushed
them to nearby hospitals. On the cold road dozens of people lay
wounded, bleeding and pleading for help.
	   Taliban soldiers in pickup trucks picked up the wounded and took
them to the city's hospitals.
	   But at the hospitals, doctors and nurses struggled to treat the
worst with only a small amount of medicine. In some hospitals there
was no anesthetic and painkilling drugs had to be bought from the
market.
	   The International Red Cross ambulances screamed into the
neighborhood and hurried wounded to the two hospitals that it
supplies with medicines.
	   In one taxi, 7-year-old Zarmeen wailed and clung to her mother.
The little girl's leg was broken. Her mother cried and scolded her
daughter saying ``why did you go outside. I told you stay in the
house.''
	   After one attack dozens of relatives gathered at the shattered
home of 15-year-old Zabiullah in Kalai Patula neighborhood to mourn
his death. They wrapped the boy's body in a white shroud and placed
him in the center of the rubble, while they sat around him wailing
and crying.
	   Zabiullah's father was in a nearby hospital, neighbors said. His
mother and sisters had been visiting a relative when the rocket
hit, they said.
	   In recent days there have been several bouts of heavy fighting
between Massood's troops and Taliban soldiers at the front line
barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kabul.
	   The Taliban, which espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law, rule
roughly 90 percent of the country while their opponents the
remaining 10 percent.

	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier
returned to the top of the podium for the first time since the
start of the season, winning a men's World Cup super-G on Sunday.
	   Maier, who was in an early season slump after winning the
inaugural giant slalom in October, rebounded from a dismal 36th
place in Saturday's downhill to claim his 13th career World Cup
victory.
	   It was another dominating performance from ``The Herminator,''
who charged down the drizzly, fog-shrouded Oreiller Killy course in
1 minute, 18.73 seconds, more than a second ahead of his nearest
rival and teammate Stephan Eberharter, runner-up in 1:19.91.
	   Lasse Kjus, the winner of Saturday's downhill of the same
course, kept up a productive weekend, finishing third in 1:20.10,
ahead of compatriot Kjetil Andre Aamodt, fourth in 1:20.39.
	   If Kjus's victory on Saturday ended a two-year winning drought,
Maier's super-G win marked the Austrian's return to the top of the
podium for the first time since winning the season opener in
Soelden, Austria, two months ago.
	   Since then Maier _ who dominated the circuit last season winning
11 races on way to becoming the overall, super-G and giant slalom
World Cup champion _ had only a second place to show.
	   At this point last season, his rookie year on the World Cup
circuit, Maier had already collected a pair of victories and three
other podium finishes in five races.
	   The victory moved Maier up the World Cup overall rankings to
fourth from fifth with 280 points.
	   Eberharter's second-place finish allowed him to take the lead
from teammate Christian Mayer in the overall. Eberharter leads with
368 points, while Mayer drops to second, 66 points behind.
	   Kjus remains in third, a single point ahead of Maier.
	   After failing to place any skiers among the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill, Austria's one-two finish on Sunday helped restore the
nation's dented pride.
	   This time, five Austrians placed in the top-10, with World Cup
downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finishing fifth in 1:20.40,
Hans Knauss sixth in 1:20.59 and Werner Franz crossing ninth, 2.44
adrift.
	   Italy's Peter Runggaldier had the seventh-fastest time, clocking
1:20.97, ahead of Fredrik Nyberg of Sweden, 2.23 back.

Malaysian leader warns disunity will lead to ``recolonization''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with party reaffirming its support for Mahathir. ADDS

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad warned Sunday that disunity in the governing party could
threaten the integrity of the Southeast Asian nation he has ruled
for 17 years and make it vulnerable to ``recolonization.''
	   Mahathir's comments to nearly 2,000 delegates came at the
party's first national convention since a political storm erupted
over his sacking of Anwar Ibrahim, formerly his deputy prime
minister and the No. 2-ranked official in the United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) party.
	   ``The party is important, not the individual. Individuals come
and go,'' Mahathir said. At the end of the meeting, delegates
cheered Mahathir to reaffirm their support for his leadership.
	   ``Foreigners chose a credible puppet and tried to use him to
conquer the country,'' Mahathir said in a reference to Anwar.
	   Party leaders have often accused Anwar of being too close to
Western leaders and too willing to accept economic prescriptions
dictated by the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Special privileges were given to the puppet and his cronies,
but when this puppet lost his power, open support was given to
destroy the country,'' the premier said.
	   Mahathir, 72, faces the toughest challenge in his political
career. Anwar's removal from office in September and subsequent
arrest led to a wave of protests and rallies demanding the prime
minister's resignation.
	   As dissent has spread within the ruling party, Malaysian police
have jailed many influential leaders for backing Anwar's call for
political reforms.
	   But Sunday's convention ended without debate or any other form
of open opposition to Mahathir. The party's current leadership does
not tolerate criticism in public.
	   ``Today, the only agenda for the meeting is to amend the party
constitution and to make sure democracy in the party will not be
abused and leaders will not use their democratic powers to destroy
the party,'' Mahathir said.
	   Delegates appeared more concerned with condemning Anwar than
working to repair their party's image. Officials distributed books
containing details of sexual misconduct and abuse of power
allegations lodged against Anwar in an ongoing court case.
	   The former deputy premier has denied the charges, saying they
were drawn up as part of a political vendetta against him by his
former mentor, Mahathir.
	   Delegates also handed out stickers saying ``No'' to political
reform featuring a portrait of Anwar inset in an American flag.
	   The assembly also condemned U.S. Vice President Al Gore's
remarks last month in support of Anwar's campaign. Gore was in
Kuala Lumpur to stand in for President Clinton at a summit of
Pacific Rim nations.
	   ``Today is an important day, we have been able to express our
anger,'' Mahathir said.
	   He warned darkly of foreign plots.
	   ``When there are riots and civil unrest, they (foreigners) will
not only supply arms to certain quarters but are prepared to be
mercenaries to the parties fighting for power,'' Mahathir said.
	   Party leaders did not formally discuss the question of choosing
Mahathir's successor. An election for top party posts is scheduled
next year, but many people expect Mahathir to announce a deputy
sooner who would be the favorite for the post of the party's No. 2.
	   Sunday's New Straits Times newspaper narrowed the field of
contenders to three politicians _ Education Minister Najib Tun
Razak, Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi and Tengku Razaleigh
Hamzah, a former finance minister who left the party in 1987 over
differences with Mahathir and then later rejoined.
	   The party has not had a deputy leader since Anwar was thrown out
in early September. The absence of a successor to Mahathir, who has
been in poor health in recent weeks, has added to the uncertainty
caused by Malaysia's economic problems.

Mahathir: No decision on Anwar's replacement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Sunday he had not chosen a replacement for his sacked deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``I've not made a decision relating to the matter yet although
some of the people who came to see me had asked me to do so,''
Mahathir told reporters after a day long national convention of his
United Malays National Organization party.
	   He said any deputy he appoints would have to continue his
policies.
	   ``This is to give confidence to investors,'' he said. ``There
should be no 180-degree turn.''
	   Many analysts had speculated that at Sunday's meeting Mahathir
would announce a deputy, who would most likely be his automatic
successor.
	   For years, Mahathir, 72, groomed Anwar as his successor. But he
fired Anwar on Sept.2 , saying the former protege was too immoral
to rule.
	   Anwar was subsequently arrested and is facing trial on 10 counts
of corruption and illegal sex acts. He denies all the charges,
saying they were fabricated to end the political challenge he posed
to Mahathir's 17-year-rule.

Vietnamese hope ASEAN measures will help them
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN-Ministers Meet

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnamese have watched their country
slowly open to the world in recent years. Now part of the world is
coming to them.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations was formed 31 years
ago as a counterbalance to Vietnamese communism. But the country
began free-market reforms a decade ago, joined ASEAN in 1995 and is
hosting the group's annual summit for the first time.
	   Even though many residents struggle to make ends meet, ASEAN has
been a hot topic on the streets of the capital.
	   Nguyen Thi Thuy, 32, gets by with a small tea shop on the
sidewalk of a major street. But she and others said they were
following the pre-summit meetings every night on local television.
	   ``The summit is very important since any major decisions made
would affect our economy and people's lives,'' said Tran Ba Tien,
73, a retired army officer.
	   Some hope the decisions which emerge from the meeting will help
Vietnam overcome the fallout of the Asian economic crisis. Others
fear that free-trade proposals will cost jobs in one of the world's
poorest countries.
	   Pham Quoc Khanh, 74, a retired state employee, said ASEAN
members can complement one another to hopefully overcome the
crisis.
	   He was optimistic that an ASEAN Free Trade Area, under which
some tariffs would be lowered to zero to 5 percent, would force
local businesses to try harder.
	   But Nguyen Trung Thang, 37 owner of an electrical appliance
shop, was concerned that it would force many local industries out
of business and cost many workers their jobs.
	   ``My business will be hurt if so many workers are laid off. I
would have fewer clients,'' he said.
	   Vietnam has not been hit as hard by the economic crisis as other
countries in the region, but it still has seen economic growth drop
by one-third as foreign investment has slid.
	   One benefit of the summit is that Hanoi has been undergoing a
facelift in advance of the leaders' arrival Monday. Workers have
put in new sidewalks on some streets and painted worn buildings.
Authorities have told residents to keep the pavement clean.
	   Hanoi is generally a safe city and more traffic police have been
deployed to keep order as official delegations cruise the streets,
but Tien expressed concern for security.
	   ``There would be no problem on our part, but I am concerned that
some extremists in troubled countries like Indonesia or Cambodia
could do some bad things here.'' he said.

Presidents of Egypt and Congo discuss ways of ending civil war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak and his Congolese
counterpart Laurent Kabila discussed Sunday ways of ending the
four-month civil war in Congo.
	   The two leaders explored the possibility of Egypt, a member of
the Organization of African Unity, mediating an end to the conflict
in the central African country, said government source.
	   The sources, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, gave
no details.
	   Kabila refuses to negotiate peace directly with a coalition of
Congolese rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Kabila, who is supported by Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia,
insists on negotiating only with Rwanda and Uganda and not the
rebels who are made up of ethnic Tutsis.
	   The rebels are disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition
politicians who accuse Kabila of corruption and ethnic favoritism.
	   Kabila arrived here Saturday and is scheduled to leave Egypt
Monday.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an atmopshere of political tension, U.S.
President Clinton called Sunday on Israel and the Palestinians to
use ``honest discussion,'' not violence, in dealing with their
differences over the Wye land-for-peace deal.
	   Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton
echoed Israel's concerns over violence and said he would ask
Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion in special assistance to help carry
out the accord and security measures connected to it.
	   Netanyahu, in a warm tribute to Clinton, who is in political
difficulty at home, said no other leader has shown more
perserverance in seeking peace. But the prime minister made clear
that the Palestine National Council must complete the voiding of
anti-Israel provisions in the PLO charter in order for the peace
process to regain momentum.

Report: Two more Chinese dissidents detained, one missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have detained two more Chinese dissidents,
and the student author of a petition demanding the release of a
pro-democracy leader charged with subversion has disappeared, a
human rights group said Sunday.
	   The detentions bring to as many as 15 the number of people
picked up by police during an increasingly intense, two-week-old
crackdown on the would-be China Democratic Party.
	   The new detentions come just days before Wang Youcai, a former
student leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, is to
stand trial Thursday in the southern city of Hangzhou on subversion
charges for trying to set up the party.
	   On Saturday, a diverse group of 184 political activists released
a letter calling on President Jiang Zemin and other national
leaders to release Wang, or at least make sure his trial is open
and fair.
	   Police took Lou Yugen from his home Saturday in the southern
province of Zhejiang, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. It said Lou had
published a pamphlet about Wang.
	   Wei Linwen, deputy chairman in the central province of Hubei for
the China Democracy Party, was detained in the provincial capital
of Wuhan, the center said.
	   The whereabouts of both men are unknown, it said.
	   In addition, the center said Fang Xiaohuang, a law student at
Ningbo University in the southern city of Ningbo, has been missing
since Friday. She had gotten 10 fellow students to sign a petition
calling for Wang's release.
	   ``Her friends and fellow students ... believe she has been
detained by police,'' the center said in a statement faxed to
reporters in Beijing.
	   Wang rose to prominence as a student leader of the
demonstrations based in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. He was
imprisoned for two years.
	   Wang announced the formation of the China Democracy Party on
June 25, the day President Bill Clinton arrived in China for the
first visit by a U.S. president in nine years.
	   Authorities have blocked attempts to get a defense lawyer for
Wang, the Information Center said Saturday.
	   A lawyer hired by his family was detained Friday when he tried
to buy a train ticket to Hangzhou, held for a day and told he could
not represent Wang, a statement from the center said.
	   It said attempts to hire another lawyer have been blocked, and
Wang could be forced to represent himself.

	   That process, he said, should begin with revoking the 1964
charter. ``It would be a welcome and positive development,'' he
said.
	   Netanyahu said he was looking to Clinton, who helped arrange the
accords in October, to intercede with the Palestinians.

Hodler says he's been `muzzled' following bribery allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The senior Olympic official who
leveled stunning allegations of corruption with the IOC said Sunday
he had been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, said
Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet. He said he was told not to
appear at a scheduled routine news conference.
	   Hodler was clearly angry as he passed through the IOC lobby on
his way to lunch after a morning meeting of the executive board.
	   Surrounded by reporters, photographers and television cameras,
he covered his mouth with both hands.
	   ``I don't have the right to say anything,'' he said. ``I'm not
to say anything by presidential orders _ nothing.''
	   Asked whether he had been muzzled, he said, ``Exactly, I'm
muzzled.''
	   A few minutes earlier, IOC officials denied that Hodler had been
ordered to keep quiet.
	   Asked why Hodler did not appear at a news conference with
organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games, IOC director
general Francois Carrard said: ``Mr. Hodler has his own program. He
is acting on his own, independently. I can assure you he hasn't
been hampered in any way. Maybe he went home. He is free to do what
he wants.''
	   On Saturday, Hodler made allegations of systematic buying and
selling of the Olympic Games, setting off the biggest corruption
scandal in the history of the 104-year-old IOC.
	   ``To my knowledge, there has always, always, been a certain part
of the vote given to corruption,'' he said.
	   Hodler cited a pattern of bribery and other ethical malpractice
in the bidding and selection of at least four Olympic host cities _
Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia; and Salt Lake City.
	   Hodler said a network of four ``agents'' _ including an IOC
member _ have approached bidding cities seeking bribes of up to
dlrs 1 million to secure IOC votes. He didn't identify any of them.
	   The IOC ``disassociated'' itself from Hodler's allegations
Saturday, saying he was voicing his personal opinions. However, it
did not deny his charges.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla positions in the western Bekaa Valley Sunday.
	   There were no reports of casualties.
	   Earlier, Israeli planes broke the sound barrier over Beirut,
rattling windows of apartment buildings.
	   Four Israeli jets fired 12 rockets at targets in the Wadi Zellya
in the western sector of the Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon.
	   An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said the pilots of
the raiding jets reported ``good hits'' and returned safely to
their bases.
	   The raids came a few hours after Shiite Muslim Hezbollah shelled
an outpost of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon militia in Wadi
Zellaya just north of the occupation zone.
	   A Hezbollah spokesman in Beirut, however, had no comment on the
air raid that came 95 minutes after two Israeli jets flew low over
Beirut, breaking the sound barrier.

Cambodian prime minister still hopes for admission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to add comment from Hun Sen, Siazon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Sunday he is hopeful his country will be admitted to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in time for him to attend a
summit this week as a full-fledged member.
	   ``Yes, I hope, I hope,'' he told reporters after arriving and
immediately starting a round of meetings to rally support.
	   And while Hun Sen said he realizes the decision is beyond his
control, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said his
presence ``could conceivably help his chance of getting into
ASEAN.''
	   Cambodia's admission has been a hot topic at pre-summit
meetings. ASEAN foreign ministers said after discussing the issue
over dinner Friday that they could not reach a consensus and would
leave it up to their leaders to decide.
	   Cambodia was originally scheduled to join the group in July 1997
along with Laos and Myanmar, but its admission was delayed after
Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a
violent coup.
	   Following a close election this July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
settled their differences last month and formed a coalition
government. Hun Sen was made sole prime minister in the deal and
the prince was named president of the National Assembly.
	   Host nation Vietnam had spearheaded the effort to get its
neighbor accepted this time.
	   However, several foreign ministers apparently stuck to their
views that Hun Sen's coalition with his former enemy must prove
stable first, saying loose ends remain, including a controversial
plan to form an upper house of Parliament in Cambodia.
	   Before leaving Phnom Penh, Cambodian Foreign Affairs Secretary
of State Ouch Kim An said it would be disheartening and potentially
damaging for Cambodia to have its membership application put on
hold for the second time in as many years.
	   ``We will be disappointed if we will not be admitted because we
have been prepared for more than a year to enter ASEAN,'' he said.
``It is economically important for us to be a part of ASEAN. We
cannot be isolated.''
	   Hun Sen's arrival caused a media stir Sunday that ended with a
security guard knocking over a lamp that hit him on the back of the
neck.
	   Hun Sen did not appear to be injured in the incident at the
Sofitel Metropole, where he is staying while having meetings over
the next two days on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations summit.

	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ Tricia Byrnes of the United
States outbattled continual snow Saturday to win a World Cup
halfpipe competition at Whistler Mountain.
	   In the men's halfpipe contest, defending World Cup champion
Fredrik Sterner of Sweden and Olympic bronze medalist Ross Powers
of the United States tied with 44.0 points apiece. However, Sterner
won on technical merit scores.
	   Zach Horwitz of the United States was fourth (32.6).
	   ``Everyone rode well in difficult conditions,'' said Powers, who
leads the World Cup points after three snowboard contests. ``Any
time you get on the podium (top three), it feels good.''
	   Byrnes, who collected about dlrs 6,500 (9,000 Swiss francs) for
her second victory of the season, received 37.9 points to 34.7 for
French rider Doriane Vidal. Kim Stacey of the United States was
third (33.8) and Michele Taggart of the United States fourth (33.2)
on the third day of the meet.
	   ``The snow conditions were more a nuisance than anything but
they didn't slow me down that much,'' Byrnes said. ``The crew did a
very good job maintaining the 'pipe so it stayed in good shape.''

Former mayor of Vladivostok files suit against Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ex-mayor of Russia's eastern city of
Vladivostok filed a suit against Boris Yeltsin with Russia's
Supreme Court on Sunday, protesting the president's decision to
boot him from office last week, a news report said.
	   Yeltsin signed a decree Friday stripping Viktor Cherepkov of the
Vladivostok mayorship. The decree said Cherepkov held office
illegally because his term had run out months before.
	   Cherepkov's term ended in July, but subsequent mayoral elections
were declared void when voters rejected all candidates to protest a
local court's last minute decision to bar Cherepkov from running.
The mayor remained in office.
	   In an interview on Russian radio on Sunday, Cherepkov said
Yeltsin's decree violates Russia's law of local self government. He
threatened to take the case to the European Court of Justice if it
is not considered by the Supreme Court within 20 days, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   ``Not a single line of the presidential decree is in keeping
with the law,'' Interfax cited Cherepkov as saying.
	   Yeltsin's move and Cherepkov's reaction were the latest in a
long history of scandals and petty squabbling between Cherepkov,
Yeltsin, and regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko that has left
Vladivostok's government in shambles.
	   The city of 800,000 people, located 6400 kilometers (4,000
miles) east of Moscow, suffers from periodic cuts of water, heat
and electricity. City services like public transport, emergency
medical help and trash removal are sometimes put on hold when
neither mayor nor governor agrees to pay the bills.
	   Cherepkov and Nazdratenko have been bitter enemies ever since
Cherepkov's 1993 election. Their feud, seen largely as a
personality clash, boiled over in 1994 when Nazdratenko kicked the
mayor from office on corruption charges.
	   Cherepkov fought back, and President Boris Yeltsin reinstated
him as mayor in 1996 after the courts found him innocent of
corruption.

Paper says `well of horror' contained 110 bodies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Some 110 bodies have been pulled from a
well used as a mass grave south of Algiers, where some of the
biggest massacres in a seven-year-old Islamic insurgency have taken
place, the privately-owned newspaper El Watan reported Sunday.
	   The paper cited police experts for what it said was the final
count of bodies pulled from the well over a two-week period. The
previous count, given four days ago, was 62 bodies.
	   The final body count was based on ``the number of femurs pulled
from the well of horror,'' the French-language newspaper said.
	   According to the paper, police ended the search operation on
Saturday at the well on the Hafiz farm, near Meftah, 35 kilometers
(20 miles) south of the capital, and ``in the coming days'' planned
to reopen the search several dozen meters (yards) from the well.
	   Police have pulled out partially decomposed bodies, bones and
bits of clothing from the 70-meter-deep (230-foot) well, which no
longer holds water.
	   El Watan quoted a police expert, not identified by name, as
saying that identification of the remains was extremely difficult.
	   The decision to search the well was based on information
provided by a member of the radical Armed Islamic Group who had
turned himself in, officials have said.
	   The group, blamed for most of the numerous massacres, used the
region south of Algiers as its prime base until last year when
security forces stepped up their crackdown on the area.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the start of
the insurgency in 1992, triggered by an army decision to cancel
legislative elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front
was poised to win.

China adds individual saber gold to fencing haul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China recaptured the lead in Asian
Games fencing golds from South Korea Sunday when Guo Rong
outpointed Ko Young-tae by two cuts, 15-13, to capture the men's
individual saber title. China's Lin Zhang win the bronze.
	   Guo's victory gave China a third gold to add the the men's and
women's individual foil titles, compared to South Korea's pair of
golds in the individual epee events.
	   Between them, China and South Korea have captured every fencing
medal at stake so far. Ko's silver was South Korea's fourth and the
country has a single bronze. China has one silver and four bronzes.
	   Zhang easily overcame Iran's A. Rahimi for the bronze, 15-4.
Rahimi and two remnants of the once-mighty Soviet fencing system,
Victor Egorov of Kazakstan and Uzbekistan's Vadim Sossine, were the
only fencers not from China or South Korea to reach the final
eight.
	   Sossine fell to Guo and Egorov to Ko in the quarterfinals.

	   Reflecting on the deep-seated distrust between Israel and the
Palestinians, Clinton said ``We can't overcome all that history,''
but the fact that there are difficulties in carrying out the Wye
accords makes them worth adopting.
	   ``In the end, there have been fundamental decisions made to deal
with this through honest discussion and negotiation,'' Clinton
said. ``That is the only way it can be done. It cannot be done by
resorting to other means when times get difficult.''
	   At a news conference, questions about the House Judiciary
Committee's moves to impeach Clinton competed with those bearing on
the Mideaest situation. At one point, Netanyahu urged reporters to
try to stay focused on the purpose of Clinton's trip.
	   Clinton told reporters he has no intention of resigning.
	   On another touchy subject, Clinton declined to say whether he
would free Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. Navy analyst who is serving a
life sentence for providing Israel with sensitive information.
	   Clinton again said he had asked for recommendations from his
advisers.
	   But Netanyahu, acknowledging Pollard had ``done something bad,''
nonetheless urged that Pollard be released on humanitarian grounds.
	   The prime minister said Pollard had served 13 years in virtual
isolation and ought to be released now.

Report: Indonesia's Suharto tense during questioning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto was tense and
weary last week when questioned over allegations of massive
corruption, a newspaper Sunday quoted a prosecutor as saying.
	   Kompas newspaper quoted Anton Sujata, one of several state
prosecutors who quizzed Suharto, as saying the former leader
responded to many of 43 questions put to him with drawn out answers
that often veered from the topic at hand.
	   On several occasions the prosecutors had to cut off the
ex-leader in mid-sentence, Anton said.
	   ``Whoever the person, even (Suharto), although once in power
over this country, as soon as he faces prosecutors and the
questions, the self-confidence of that person, I believe, will at
least weaken. I saw this in Suharto when we were questioning him,''
he said.
	   Anton said Suharto asked three times to go to the mens room
during the four-hour interrogation that also included two rest
breaks.
	   ``This showed too that he was not to happy with the
investigation,'' Anton said.
	   The paper quoted Anton as saying the old leader's face had a
furrowed expression that changed to one of relief when the
questioning ended.
	   The 77-year-old retired army general, who quit office after
student protests and deadly riots six months ago, smiled but looked
tired when he emerged from the Jakarta High Attorney's office
accompanied by eight lawyers.
	   At that time he said he had answered all question put to him and
that he would continue to cooperate with prosecutors.
	   His lawyers later said the questions related to
multimillion-dollar charitable foundations formerly under his
control, a national car project run by one of his sons with huge
tax breaks, the contents of his bank accounts and presidential
decrees that allegedly benefited his family and friends.
	   Suharto, now a virtual recluse in his Jakarta home, has denied
accusations that he stashed billions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts.
	   However, opponents accuse him of abusing his power over three
decades of virtually unchallenged power to enrich himself, his
family and a clique of cronies.
	   Forbes magazine has estimated his wealth at dlrs 4 billion. But
others say it is much greater.
	   A former investigation into Suharto several months ago failed to
find any evidence of wrongdoing.
	   However, Suharto's successor and former ally, President B.J.
Habibie, ordered a new inquiry after a wave of student protests.
	   Student want him sent to trial immediately for corruption.
	   Tight security was in place for last week's questioning. Many
streets were blocked off. Protests and clashes between students and
police erupted later in the day.

Blair asked to stop Foster extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair has
been asked to stop Britain's attempts to extradite fugitive Gold
Coast businessman Peter Foster to London to face charges of
falsifying a credit application.
	   Foster, a former boyfriend of British pinup model Samantha Fox,
first gained notoriety in Australia with claims of discovering a
miraculous diet tea.
	   Foster's Gold Coast lawyer, Chris Nyst, said Sunday that London
lawyer David James had delivered a detailed ``extraordinarily
sensitive'' dossier to 10 Downing Street, which he says outlines
Foster's involvement as an undercover operation for British and
Australian law enforcement agencies.
	   James had said that because a number of law agencies were
involved, the British prime minister was the appropriate person to
study the dossier, Nyst said.
	   In previous court appearances in Australia, Foster has argued
that his life would be in danger if returned to the British prison
system because of undercover work he says he has done for police.
	   He also claimed to face danger because of giving evidence at an
inquiry into corruption in British jails.
	   Newspaper reports last month said Foster's family had been told
by 12 of Australia's leading insurance companies including AMP, MLC
and FAI, they would not insure Foster's life if he was returned to
Britain.
	   Foster's fake diet remedies made him a millionaire in the 1980s
but led to his jailing in Britain last year on charges relating to
his companies Foremost Body Care and Alchemy Holdings.
	   Foster is alleged to have absconded to Australia while on work
release in Britain. He was arrested in Melbourne in February for
failing to appear last December at a Brisbane magistrates court to
face extradition charges.
	   In October, Federal Court Justice Jeff Spender ruled a warrant
for Foster's extradition was not valid because it was signed by
Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone instead of Attorney-General Daryl
Williams.
	   Williams has appealed Spender's ruling but Nyst has
cross-appealed, claiming Vanstone had not properly investigated
concerns about Foster's safety.
	   During the Federal Court hearing, Spender said there may be some
face-saving in the pursuit of Foster.
	   ``We're not talking about Jack the Ripper,'' he said.
	   Foster is in custody awaiting the outcome of the extradition
proceedings.
	   Nyst said: ``I hope the submission to Blair will bring an end to
my client's incarceration.''

Pope: Christmas is for families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Pope John Paul II visited a working-class parish in
Rome on Sunday, wishing members of his flock a ``Merry Christmas''
and saying Mass for the faithful.
	   ``Christmas is above all a family holiday,'' the pink-caped
pontiff said. ``It's the same for families all over the world.
	   The pontiff also met with the children of the parish of Santa
Giulia Biallart and with members of the parish council.
	   In addition to being the head of the nearly 1 billion-strong
Roman Catholic Church, the pope is also the bishop of Rome.
Throughout his pontificate he has faithfully tended his flock,
visiting parishes throughout the city.
	   Later, at St. Peter's Basilica, the pope continued an old Roman
tradition, blessing statutes of the baby Jesus for home nativity
scenes brought to him by local children.

Poles remember 17th anniversary of martial law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Rightist activists on Sunday picketed the
house of the man known as Poland's architect of martial law to mark
the 17th anniversary of a decree that suppressed basic freedoms and
the Solidarity democratic movement.
	   At midnight, more than a hundred activists of the Republican
League lit candles in front of the house of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski and pinned obituaries of 36 opposition members killed in
the 1980s to his fence, PAP news agency reported.
	   Mariusz Kaminski, the League leader and Solidarity deputy, said
he hoped Jaruzelski would someday have to answer for his deeds in
court, because ``making dictators accountable is discussed all over
the world.''
	   The lights in Jaruzelski's villa were off and the demonstrators
dispersed after a short time, PAP said.
	   An anniversary survey, published in a weekend issue of
Rzeczpospolita daily, showed that Poles remain divided over whether
Jaruzelski's communist government did the right thing by imposing
military rule.
	   In a survey by the PBS agency, 39 percent of those asked said
martial law brought Poland more bad than good, while 30 percent
disagreed and 31 percent were undecided. The survey of 1,094 adults
had a margin of error of three percent.
	   Thousands of opposition leaders, including Lech Walesa, who
later became Poland's first popularly elected president, were
jailed Dec. 13, 1981, when Jaruzelski imposed military rule.
	   Jaruzelski has repeatedly said his decision was a ``lesser
evil'' that prevented Soviet intervention in Poland.
	   In 1996, the ex-communist-dominated parliament decided not to
press charges against Jaruzelski for imposing martial law.

Indonesian President asks Muslims to protect Christian churches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped title and initials for President B.J.
Habibie, graf 4

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Worried by a rise in religious
violence, Indonesia's Islamic president called on fellow Muslims
Sunday to help the Christian minority protect churches against
attack.
	   Twenty-two churches were burned or ransacked on Nov. 22 after
tensions erupted between Indonesia's Muslim majority and Christian
minority in the capital, Jakarta.
	   Fourteen people were killed and the violence sparked revenge
attacks on mosques in other places.
	   Speaking to 10,000 Muslim worshippers at dawn prayers, President
B.J. Habibie said fighting among religions was against the tenets
of Islam, which first came to Indonesia in the 7th century.
	   ``Muslims should respect houses of God that belong to other
religions,'' he said at Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in
Southeast Asia.
	   ``We even have an obligation to protect them if certain groups
want to destroy these houses of God,'' he said.
	   Habibie has repeatedly condemned violence based on religious
grounds and on Sunday he called on Christians to also respect
Islam.
	   Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic crisis in three
decades.
	   Soaring inflation, mass unemployment and widespread poverty
helped lead to the ouster of Habibie's predecessor, former
President Suharto in May.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people follow Islam,
making it the world's largest Muslim country. Others are mainly
Christian, Buddhist or Hindu.
	   Religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy,
Pancasila as well as the constitution.

	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ British swimmers Mark Foster in the
50-meter freestyle and James Hickman in the 100 butterfly turned in
world records Sunday in preliminary heats of the European
short-course swimming championships.
	   The Swedish 200-meter men's medley relay also posted a new world
mark in Sunday's heats.
	   That brought to eight the number of new world short-course
records set with the three-day meet ending Sunday.
	   Foster clocked 21.48 seconds, surpassing the old record of 21.50
by Russian Alex Popov. Hickman clocked 51.02, bettering Australian
Michael Klim's old time of 51.07.
	   The Swedish relay clocked a new world best of 1:36.24.
	   On Saturday, Milos Milosevic of Croatia, Martina Moravcova of
Slovakia and the Netherlands' 200 men's relay set world marks.
	   Milosevic swam 23.30 seconds to win the 50-meter butterfly,
breaking the old world record of 23.35 set by Russian Denis
Pankratov.
	   Moravcova won the 100 individual medley in 1:00.43, topping the
old record of 1:00.60 by China's Xiaowen Hu Chn. Moracvoca also set

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM _ In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S.
President Bill Clinton called Sunday on Israel and the Palestinians
to use ``honest discussion,'' not violence, in dealing with their
differences over their latest U.S.-brokered, land-for-peace deal.
Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton
echoed Israel's concerns over violence and said he would ask
Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion in special assistance to help carry
out the Wye accord and security measures connected with it.
Netanyahu, in a warm tribute to Clinton, who is in political
difficulty at home, said no other leader has shown more
perseverance in seeking peace. But the prime minister made clear
that the Palestine National Council must complete the voiding of
anti-Israel provisions in the PLO charter in order for the peace
process to regain momentum. (CLINTON-MIDEAST)
	   JERUSALEM _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, dogged by the
impeachment drama on the first day of his Middle East trip, said
Sunday that he has ``no intention of resigning'' in the face of
U.S. House Judiciary Committee approval of four articles of
impeachment. ``It's never crossed my mind,'' Clinton said at a news
conference. The president said he was not surprised by the actions
of the committee, which approved the fourth article shortly before
he arrived here Saturday. If the full House endorses impeachment on
the charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and misuse of power
in the coming week, the case will be sent for trial in the Senate,
which could vote on whether to remove Clinton from office.
(CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   SURAT THANI, Thailand _ Caskets containing 40 of the 101 victims
of a Thai Airways jetliner crash were loaded on a C-130 transport
plane Sunday for the grim voyage back to Bangkok as questions arose
about the safety of Surat Thani airport. Later in the day, 15 of
the 45 injured survivors boarded another plane to the capital to
seek medical treatment. Many of the survivors blamed the pilot of
the A310-200 for the crash which killed 101 people on board, but an
official investigation into the tragedy has just begun and
government officials cautioned against rushing to judgment. Flight
TG261 slammed into a flooded rubber plantation during a heavy
rainstorm Friday evening as it made a third attempt to land at
Surat Thani, a port and fishing village that serves as a gateway to
several resort islands popular with foreign tourists.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan _ Terrorized residents scrambled for cover as
successive rocket assaults shook the war-ravaged capital on Sunday
killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 80 others,
witnesses and officials said. The worst barrage shattered a
northern neighborhood of Kabul killing at least 15 people and
wounding about 70 others, they said. No one took responsibility for
the rocket attacks, but they all came from north of the city where
anti-Taliban fighters loyal to ousted military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood are deployed. (AFGHANISTAN-ROCKETS)
	   TEHRAN, Iran _ An Iranian writer missing since last week has
been found dead, the latest victim in a spate of mysterious
killings of government critics, his daughter said Sunday. Mohammad
Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old writer and translator, had been
missing since last Wednesday. His family said they identified his
body late Saturday after getting a call from the police, and that
he had apparently been strangled. Four other government critics,
including two writers, have been found dead in the past four weeks.
Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, said a special
committee had been set up to investigate the killings and that a
number of arrests had been made, the daily Akhbar reported. He was
quoted as saying the suspects apparently wanted to tarnish the
image of Iran's moderate president, Mohammad Khatami. (IRAN-WRITER

Bomb rips through gun shop killing 4 and wounding 11
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb destroyed a gun store in a
remote corner of northwest Pakistan on Sunday, killing four people
and wounding 11 others, said police officials.
	   No one took responsibility for the explosion in Landi Kotal,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the provincial capital of
Peshawar.
	   Seven of the wounded were in critical condition, police said.
	   Landi Kotal is the headquarters of Khyber Agency _ a tribal area
in northern Pakistan famous for the manufacture and illegal sale of
handmade automatic weapons.
	   Tribal feuds are common in the area and often result in revenge
killings. Most people in the region are heavily armed.

Clinton says will ask Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion for Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines pvs, edits throughout to conform, tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an atmopshere of political tension, U.S.
President Bill Clinton called on Israel and the Palestinians Sunday
to use ``honest discussion,'' not violence, in dealing with their
differences over the Wye land-for-peace deal.
	   Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton
echoed Israel's concerns over violence and said he would ask
Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion in special assistance to help carry
out the accord and security measures connected to it.
	   Netanyahu, in a warm tribute to Clinton, who is in political
difficulty at home, said no other leader has shown more
perserverance in seeking peace. But the prime minister made clear
that the Palestine National Council must complete the voiding of
anti-Israel provisions in the PLO charter in order for the peace
process to regain momentum.
	   ``What we really expect is that the Palestinians honor their
commitments,'' Netanyahu said.
	   That process, he said, should begin with revoking the 1964
charter. ``It would be a welcome and positive development,'' he
said.
	   At a news conference, questions about the House Judiciary
Committee's approval Saturday of four articles of impeachment
against Clinton competed with those bearing on the Mideaest
situation. At one point, Netanyahu urged reporters to try to stay
focused on the purpose of Clinton's trip.
	   Clinton told reporters he has no intention of resigning or
admitting that he perjured himself, as some Republicans in Congress
have demanded. ``I cannot admit to doing something that I am quite
sure I did not do,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said he was looking to Clinton, who helped arrange the
accords in October, to intercede with the Palestinians.
	   ``If there is anyone who can help bring the peace process to a
satisfactory conclusion, it is you,'' Netanyahu told Clinton.
	   Reflecting on the deep-seated distrust between Israel and the
Palestinians, Clinton said ``We can't overcome all that history,''
but the fact that there are difficulties in carrying out the Wye
accords makes them worth adopting.
	   ``In the end, there have been fundamental decisions made to deal
with this through honest discussion and negotiation,'' Clinton
said. ``That is the only way it can be done. It cannot be done by
resorting to other means when times get difficult.''
	   On another touchy subject, Clinton declined to say whether he
would free Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. Navy analyst who is serving a
life sentence for providing Israel with sensitive information.
	   Clinton again said he had asked for recommendations from his
advisers.
	   But Netanyahu, acknowledging Pollard had ``done something bad,''
nonetheless urged that Pollard be released on humanitarian grounds.
	   The prime minister said Pollard had served 13 years in virtual
isolation and ought to be released now.
	   Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday in the Gaza Strip, where he will be welcomed with the
trappings of a state visit. The visit, which includes an address to
the Palestinian National Council, is seen by some as a boost for
Palestinian statehood.
	   ``It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state,''
Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council,
said in an interview Sunday.
	   Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the
Clinton visit. At the hotel where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen
were posted to guard the president and his 600-member delegation.
	   There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school
student was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   In his remarks at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night,
Netanyahu said the peace process is in danger.
	   ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking in Hebrew, ``The
truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians again
constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to
forgo fulfillment of those commitments.''
	   Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil in his hard-line
coalition government, said he could not accept ``a phony peace on
paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.''
	   Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in
October, the land-for-security agreement has hit one snag after
another. Israel froze implementation of the accord altogether,
accusing Arafat of violating the deal and inciting violent street
protests.
	   Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The
Israeli leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament
prepares for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition
began to weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum
Oct. 23 agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to
be met by Palestinian security measures.
	   Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals
until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the
Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over the release of
Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails for militant or
political acts against the Jewish state.

Indonesia's military chief defends militia plan as protests

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's armed forces chief on
Sunday defended a controversial plan to establish a civilian
militia, saying it was needed to safeguard law and order while the
Southeast Asian nation struggles with political change.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto said about 40,000 young people
would be recruited beginning January. They would receive
three-month basic military training and would be equipped with
sticks, riot shields and handcuffs.
	   Like police, they would have the power of arrest, he said. Other
officials said as many 200,000 might eventually be recruited for
the group to be known as ``Rakyat Terlatih,'' or ``trained
people.''
	   In recent weeks thousands of students demanding greater
democracy have staged a series of anti-government protests in the
capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere.
	   Most of the protests have been peaceful, but several have ended
in violence and bloodshed. Thousands of troops have been deployed
throughout the capital and many roads have been blocked by armored
vehicles to stop street marches.
	   On Nov. 13 nine people were killed when security personnel
opened fire on students who tried to march on Parliament.
	   Last Thursday much of Jakarta was paralyzed when an estimated
10,000 protesters choked its streets.
	   Student protests and riots helped oust former authoritarian
President Suharto, 77, in May.
	   His successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie, has
proposed democratic reforms. However, students complain his agenda
for change is too slow and too conservative.
	   They also demand that Suharto, who was questioned by state
prosecutors last week, be put on trial immediately for corruption
during his 32 years in power.
	   Habibie has said that protests will be tolerated only if they
are staged within the law.
	   Many now fear that civil unrest and protests will worsen as
Indonesia prepares to hold a parliamentary election on June 7.
	   In response, the military and the government have announced a
plan to recruit and train unemployed young people for the militia
to help police and troops maintain order.
	   Wiranto said weeks of protest had stretched the resources of the
500,000-member military and police force and more personnel were
needed.
	   ``The level of disturbances has reached a level that's beyond
tolerance,'' Wiranto said.
	   He said Indonesia could only achieve a ``healthy democracy'' if
the rule of law is upheld.
	   ``I don't reckon mass gatherings that disregard the existing law
will promote democracy,'' he said of the almost daily protests.
	   ``We can no longer tolerate negative tendencies which create
anxieties, weaken confidence, and disturb the reform agenda. A
state that fails to uphold law and order would weaken...lose its
spirit and head toward a disaster,'' Wiranto said.
	   The plan to set up a militia has been widely criticized.
	   ``An armed militia would only create conflict among the
people,'' The Jakarta Post quoted former military commander,
retired army Gen. Edi Sudradjat, as saying.
	   Since Suharto's resignation, sporadic rioting and looting have
increased in many parts of the world's fourth most populous nation
as it grapples with the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Inflation and unemployment rates have soared. The government
says that almost half of its 202 million people now live in
poverty.
	   Supporters of the idea say it would employ otherwise jobless
young people.
	   Critics of the military say many Indonesians now do not respect
the armed forces as details emerge of widespread human rights
abuses and corruption during the Suharto era.
	   Last month groups of unemployed youths were recruited as private
security guards to protect the assembly when it last met.
	   That plan was widely criticized after many of the recruits
brawled with protesting students.

Hillary Clinton asks Arabs and Jews to overcome stereotypes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to remove period from slug &QL; 
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWE SHALOM, Israel (AP) _ Hillary Clinton on Sunday lit a
Hanukkah candle, a Christmas tree and a Ramadan lantern in a
village where 36 Arab and Jewish families live together and held up
the community as an example for others to follow.
	   ``If all children could have this experience, we would be that
much closer to peace,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a speech to Newe
Shalom school children sitting five-deep on the school house steps.
	   Newe Shalom, known in Arabic is Wahat as-Salam, or ``Oasis of
Peace,'' was founded 22 years ago by a Dominican monk who wanted to
show that Arabs and Jews could live in the same community.
	   However, the idea has not caught on and Arabs and Jews still
largely live in separate towns, villages and neighborhoods.
	   On her first stop in Newe Shalom, nestled on a hill west of
Jerusalem, Mrs. Clinton visited the kindergarten where youngsters
sat around three low tables and colored balloons were strung across
the room.
	   Kids at each table worked on drawings and cuttings for one of
the three holidays starting this month _ the Jewish Festival of
Lights, or Hanukkah, Christmas and the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan. Mrs. Clinton moved from table to table, smiling and
occasionally bending down to talk to one of the children.
	   On a fourth table, a Ramadan lantern, a small Christmas tree and
a Menorah, the eight-armed Hanukkah candelabra, were set up, with a
child standing behind each religious object.
	   Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by Sarah Netanyahu, the wife of the
Israeli prime minister, moved behind the children and was handed a
plain white candle. With the flame of Mrs. Clinton's candle, the
children lit the Menorah, the tree and the lantern as the others
clapped and sang holiday songs, including ``Jingle Bells'' in
Arabic.
	   Addressing the older children on the schoolhouse steps, Mrs.
Clinton, said she grew up in an all-white neighborhood and only as
a teen-ager began meeting blacks and Hispanics. Only then, she
said, did she understand that ``we had so much in common that I had
never understood before.''
	   Referring to the fragile Wye River peace agreement her husband
helped negotiate and is now trying to rescue, Mrs. Clinton said
that ``the strong belief that peace will prevail must once again be
reinforced.''
	   She said that for peace to be real, it was not enough to sign
agreements. ``Peace actually begins in our homes, in communities
like this, and in our hearts and it has to be nurtured within and
among human beings and then passed on to our children and that is
precisely what you are doing here,'' she said.
	   Later Sunday, Mrs. Clinton was to visit a mother-child center at
Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem and an Israeli preschool enrichment
program she helped bring to Arkansas. On Monday, in the Gaza Strip,
she was to tour the Shati refugee camp and, in the company of
Arafat's wife, Soha, visit a center for handicapped children.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The leader of the Salt Lake
organizing committee apologized Sunday for the alleged rules
violations during the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   The IOC, meanwhile, said it was prepared to investigate
allegations by one of its senior officials of bribery in the
selection of Olympic host cities.
	   At the same time, Marc Hodler _ the Swiss executive board member
who made the allegations Saturday _ said he has since been
``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee
(SLOC), apologized and accepted full responsibility for the
controversial scholarship program run by the group which won the
bid for the games.
	   The program provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other
assistance to 13 individuals _ including six relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   Hodler has used the word ``bribe'' to describe the fund. A
high-level IOC panel is investigating the charges.
	   ``With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been
part of the bid campaign,'' Joklik said in a prepared statement.
``At the same time, it is important to remember that Salt Lake City
won the bid on the merits, and not because of this program.''
	   Joklik was chairman of the bidding committee at the time. The
scholarship program was under the direction of the former bid
president, Thomas Welch.
	   ``Although I was not aware of the program, I must accept
responsibility,'' Joklik said. ``I apologize to the Olympic family
and to the citizens of Utah for the embarassment caused by the bid
committee program.''
	   Joklik defended the program as helping young people from
developing countries to receive education and athletic training.
	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibily
appear to influence improperly the voti), apologized and accepted
full responsibility for the controversial scholarship program run
by the group which won the bid for the games.
	   The program provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other

	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibly

	   Joklik said SLOC would cooperate fully with the IOC panel
investigating the case and would ``implement all recommendations it
may develop.'' He said SLOC's independent ethics board would also
review the program.
	   ``I will not hesitate to implement whatever steps are necessary
.... to maintain the integrity of the games,'' Joklik said.
	   IOC officials declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions
might be taken against Salt Lake. But, for the first time, IOC vice
president Dick Pound effectively ruled out any possibility of the
games behind taken away from Utah.
	   Pound said the executive board expressed ``complete, repeat,
complete confidence'' in the organizing committee.
	   ``We are satisfied Salt Lake City won the 2002 games on the
merit of the bid,'' he said.
	   Pound said the Salt Lake inquiry would be broadened to include
investigation of Hodler's allegations that ``agents'' have
approached bidding cities soliciting bribes of up to dlrs 1 million
to procure votes of IOC members.
	   ``What were are concerned with is whether there may or may have
been inappropriate conduct by some of our members or agents
involved in the bid process,'' Pound said.
	   ``We are aware there are agents and we are aware of the identity
of at least some of them,'' Pound said. ``What they've done or not
done, we don't know yet.''
	   Pound indicated the inquiry could be expanded to include
Hodler's charges that the selection of at least three other Olypmic
cities had been affected by corruption _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan;
and Sydney, Australia.
	   ``One is never sure where the trail will lead,'' Pound said.
``At this moment, the focus is on Salt Lake City.''
	   Hodler said he believed four agents _ including one IOC member _
had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He said he
believed 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _ currently numbering
115 _ were open to bribery.
	   He said there is one agent who boasts ``that no city has ever
won the Olympic Games without his help.''
	   Hodler said Sunday that Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet.
He said he was told not to appear at a scheduled routine news
conference.
	   Surrounded by reporters, photographers and television cameras,
Hodler covered his mouth with both hands.
	   ``I don't have the right to say anything,'' he said. ``I'm not
to say anything by presidential orders _ nothing. ... I'm
muzzled.''

South Korea knocks out Japan, enters volleyball final against

China &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results from women's matches, grafs 2, 8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China blew Taiwan off the court in
straight sets Sunday to reach the finals of the Asian Games men's
volleyball, while South Korea's superior blocking overcame an
injury-beset Japan for the other spot.
	   The Chinese women, who finished second in the World Volleyball
Championships in Japan last month, crushed host nation Thailand,
15-4, 15-2, 15-2. They also face a final against South Korea, which
overcame archrival Japan in the other semifinal, 16-14, 15-6, 15-7.
	   In the men's matches, Japan's Hideyuke Otake and ace server
Norihiko Miyazaki were instrumental in holding South Korea close in
the first two sets. Japan lost the first, 11-15, and won the
second, 15-13.
	   But the loss of three key players, including captain Yuichi
Nakagaiuchi, to injuries haunted the Japanese side late in the
encounter.
	   Korea's Lee Kyung-soo, Kim Kyoung-hoon and Bang Sin-bong erected
a blocking wall up front that Japan was unable to penetrate. The
Korean trio punched holes in the Japanese defenses with
well-placed, blistering spikes to gain the final sets 15-3, 15-6.
	   China's men beat Taiwan 15-11, 15-4, 15-11.
	   The Thai women's squad managed to break China's service a score
of times in the first set and even took an early 2-0 lead. But the
Chinese soon brought their height _ on average, a head taller _ to
bear on the young Thais and the points started piling up.
	   The addition of a libero _ a specialized defensive player _ did
little to shore up the Thai back row and the Thais became equally
unable to compete at the net and were overcome in just 54 minutes.
	   Chang Yoon-hee and Park Soo-jeong led South Korea's women's side
in demolishing Japan in 1 hour, 10 minutes.
	   Asian sides once dominated the sport but have been slipping in
recent years. Italy defeated Yugoslavia for the men's world
champion title last month. The top Asian finisher, South Korea,
came in 13th.
	   The Chinese women, who lost in the world championship final to
Cuba, were joined in the top eight by only one other Asian side,
Japan, finishing eighth.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Athens organizers told the
International Olympic Committee on Sunday that the first phase of
staff appointment is virtually complete for the 2004 Olympic Games.
	   Costas Bakouris, the committee's managing director, said plans
were advancing for the athletes' Olympic Village housing and that
top-class hotels are being built for VIPs.
	   Bakouris, giving a regular report to the IOC, countered concerns
that the Athens preparations were running behind schedule.
	   ``We have practically all the people we were going to have in
our first phase. We have 37 people, including most of the key
figures,'' said Bakouris.
	   ``On construction of the sports venues, we have highlighted all
the actions we have taken,'' Bakouris said, noting that legislation
has been introduced to cut the time significantly so that
everything can be built on schedule.
	   Bakouris said he was happy that plans were in hand to
accommodate the 16,000 athletes and officials in the Olympic
village, and that there would be sufficient high class hotel
accommodation for VIPs and dignitaries.
	   ``What we have to do obviously is to ensure the quality of the
five-star and four-star hotels,'' added Bakouris.
	   ``There is going to be classification of hotels, the same as in
the rest of Europe.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Muslims living in Belgium went to the
polls Sunday to elect a special executive council that will
represent the Islam religion in its relations with the Belgian
authorities.
	   After Roman Catholicism, Islam is Belgium's second religion,
with some 350,000 Muslims living in this nation of 9.9 million. The
majority of them are Moroccan and Turk, with about 10 percent
naturalized or converted Belgians.
	   The election comes 24 years after Belgium recognized Islam as an
official religion in Belgium. The establishment of an official
representative body however has been held back, partly because
Islam does not have a strict hierarchical structure like Roman
Catholicism has.
	   Observers said it was the first such election for Muslims in
Europe.
	   Some 74,000 Muslim voters will elect 51 representatives, who in
turn will choose 17 members of an executive council. The lack of
such a council has held back state subsidies, which are already
granted to other religions.
	   The results of the election are expected to be announced on
Monday.

Suspect in stabbing death of soccer fan held in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ One of three suspects in custody over the
stabbing death of a Spanish soccer fan has been jailed pending
further investigation, news reports said Sunday.
	   All three went before a judge Saturday night as police continue
to search for other suspects in the death of Aitor Zabaleta, 28,
who died Tuesday after being stabbed in the chest outside Madrid's
Vicente Calderon soccer stadium.
	   Zabaleta, from the Basque city of San Sebastian, was in Madrid
with his girlfriend to watch his team, Real Sociedad, take on
Atletico Madrid in a UEFA Cup match. They were assaulted by what
news reports say was a group of skinheads outside the stadium.
	   Newspapers say the three suspects detained Thursday belong to a
neo-fascist splinter group of a large Atletico Madrid fan club.
	   Police say they do not know if any of the three detainees is the
one who actually stabbed Zabaleta.
	   The detainee sent to jail will not necessarily be charged but
rather stay there while police continue their probe, the state news
agency Efe said.
	   The other two remain in custody but one might soon be released,
the agency added. None of the three have been named.
	   Zabaleta was buried Friday. A moment of silence in his memoary
was to be observed Sunday before all of Spain's first-division
soccer games, and Real Sociedad's players plan to wear jerseys with
his name on the back.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Statement delivered Sunday by Frank
Joklik, president and chief executive officer of the Salt Lake City
Organizing Committee for the 2002 Olympic Games:
	   I thank the press, the Olympic family and the citizens of Utah
for their patience in this matter.
	   This bid committee's program is being looked into by a special
commission of the IOC Executive Board. SLOC is cooperating and will
continue to cooperate fully with the IOC.
	   As you know, I believe the bid committee's program was intended
to help young people obtain an education and athletic training to
which they otherwise would not have had access.
	   With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been part
of the bid campaign. At the same time, it is important to remember
that Salt Lake City won the bid on the merits and not because of
this program.
	   I was the chairman of the Board of Trustees during the bid
campaign. Although I was not aware of the nature of the program, I
must accept responsibility. I apologize to the Olympic family and
to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment caused by the bid
committee program.
	   I continue to believe that assisting students and athletes in
developing nations should be an important Olympic cause. However,
it should not be done in a way that might possibly appear to
influence improperly the voting of IOC members.
	   My highest priority now is to resolve this matter and move
forward in an honest and positive manner to plan and organize the
2002 Olympic Winter Games. I have instructed SLOC's employees to
continue to cooperate fully with the IOC's investigation. We will
implement all recommendations it may develop.
	   I will also ask that our own independent board of ethics review
this bid committee program.
	   Let me reemphasize that I will not hesitate to implement
whatever steps are necessary going forward to maintain the
integrity of the games.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Germany must work hard for expansion of
the European Union despite Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
insistence that his country's share of the costs be reduced,
Austria's foreign minister said Sunday.
	   ``The Germans must strive for (EU) expansion,'' Austrian Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said during a television interview.
Austria will hand over the presidency of the EU to Germany on Jan.
1.
	   On Saturday, the 15 EU leaders ended their summit in the
Austrian capital with no real headway in readying EU finances to
absorb up to 12 new members, mostly from the Cold War-era Warsaw
Pact.
	   EU leaders have still not agreed on how to finance expansion
over the next decade. Rich countries like Germany and Britain
already feel they are paying too much to the EU.
	   Schroeder, whose country is still paying the costs of absorbing
East Germany, made it clear during the Vienna summit that Europe's
enlargement problems are not going to be solved with ``a German
checkbook.''
	   During the interview, Schuessel said he was ``surprised'' that
Schroeder had raised the issue.
	   ``Normally, the current and upcoming EU president hold back on
putting forward their own interests and concentrates on
coordination,'' Schuessel said. Nevertheless, the Austrian minister
said he remains hopeful a compromise formula for financing EU
expansion will be reached by March.
	   ``Schroeder has spoken out very clearly for (EU) expansion,'' he
said. ``Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania received `de facto' promises
that the (EU) commission will begin with the accession screening.
Bulgaria and Romania must wait.''
	   Countries such as Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ukraine should
be bound by ``partnership'' agreements with the EU, he said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stone-throwing teenage gangs clashed
with security personnel and damaged police stations in the city of
Solo on Sunday, the military said.
	   Privately-owned television network, SCTV, said at least 10
people were injured.
	   The military said 39 people had been arrested after several
police stations were pelted with stones.
	   SCTV said fighting among the gangs and police broke out at about
2 a.m. local time and raged for five hours.
	   It quoted witnesses as saying the local police chief's house was
attacked by a mob in the city of about 2 million people, 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   A small market was burned along with two cars.
	   SCTV quoted police spokesman Col. Zainal Abidin as saying
security forces brought the situation under control by 7 a.m.
	   The trigger for Sunday's riot was not immediately clear.
However, residents said tensions have been running high among
police and local youths for some time.
	   Solo, the ancient capital of what once had been an important
royal dynasty in the center of the island of Java, has been plagued
repeatedly by civil unrest.
	   The latest violence follows a brawl among rival villagers on the
tourist island of Bali on Friday. The military said Sunday that
four people were killed and one was reported missing.
	   Four houses were burned and several others were damaged in the
fighting in Buleleng district, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
north of the main city of Dempasar, and away from resort areas.
	   Bali is located about 945 kilometers (590 miles) east of the
capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
	   Social turmoil has increased in Indonesia since the Southeast
Asian country was hit hard by a regional financial crisis last
year. Tensions have mounted amid mass unemployment, food shortages
and fears of political instability.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May during riots that helped
force longtime authoritarian President Suharto to quit.
	   Solo was badly hit by that wave of violence with many house and
other buildings ransacked or burned.

Suspect in stabbing death of soccer fan held in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ One of three suspects in custody in the
stabbing death of a Spanish soccer fan has been jailed pending
further investigation, news reports said Sunday.
	   All three went before a judge Saturday night as police continued
to search for other suspects in the death of Aitor Zabaleta, 28,
who died Tuesday after being stabbed in the chest outside Madrid's
Vicente Calderon soccer stadium.
	   Zabaleta, from the Basque city of San Sebastian, was in Madrid
with his girlfriend to watch his team, Real Sociedad, take on
Atletico Madrid in a UEFA Cup match. They were assaulted outside
the stadium by what news reports say was a group of skinheads.
	   Newspapers say the three suspects detained Thursday belong to a
neo-fascist splinter group of a large Atletico Madrid fan club.
	   Police say they do not know if any of the three detainees is the
one who actually stabbed Zabaleta.
	   The jailed suspect will not necessarily be charged but rather
stay there while police continue their probe, the state news agency
Efe said.
	   The other two remain in custody but one might soon be released,
the agency added. None of their names were released.
	   Zabaleta was buried Friday. A moment of silence in his memory
was to be observed Sunday before all of Spain's first-division
soccer games, and Real Sociedad's players plan to wear jerseys with
his name on the back.

Salt Lake apologizes; IOC to investigate agents; Hodler `muzzled'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: fixes garbles, typos
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The leader of the Salt Lake
organizing committee apologized Sunday for the alleged rules
violations during the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   The IOC, meanwhile, said it was prepared to investigate
allegations by one of its senior officials of bribery in the
selection of Olympic host cities.
	   At the same time, Marc Hodler _ the Swiss executive board member
who made the allegations Saturday _ said he has since been
``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee
(SLOC), apologized and accepted full responsibility for the
controversial scholarship program run by the group which won the
bid for the games.
	   The program provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other
assistance to 13 individuals _ including six relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   Hodler has used the word ``bribe'' to describe the fund. A
high-level IOC panel is investigating the charges.
	   ``With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been
part of the bid campaign,'' Joklik said in a prepared statement.
``At the same time, it is important to remember that Salt Lake City
won the bid on the merits, and not because of this program.''
	   Joklik was chairman of the bidding committee at the time. The
scholarship program was under the direction of the former bid
president, Thomas Welch.
	   ``Although I was not aware of the program, I must accept
responsibility,'' Joklik said. ``I apologize to the Olympic family
and to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment caused by the bid
committee program.''
	   Joklik defended the program as helping young people from
developing countries to receive education and athletic training.
	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibily
appear to influence improperly the voting of IOC members.''
	   Joklik said SLOC would cooperate fully with the IOC panel
investigating the case and would ``implement all recommendations it
may develop.'' He said SLOC's independent ethics board would also
review the program.
	   ``I will not hesitate to implement whatever steps are necessary
.... to maintain the integrity of the games,'' Joklik said.
	   IOC officials declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions
might be taken against Salt Lake. But, for the first time, IOC vice
president Dick Pound effectively ruled out any possibility of the
games behind taken away from Utah.
	   Pound said the executive board expressed ``complete, repeat,
complete confidence'' in the organizing committee.
	   ``We are satisfied Salt Lake City won the 2002 games on the
merit of the bid,'' he said.
	   Pound said the Salt Lake inquiry would be broadened to include
investigation of Hodler's allegations that ``agents'' have
approached bidding cities soliciting bribes of up to dlrs 1 million
to procure votes of IOC members.
	   ``What were are concerned with is whether there may or may have
been inappropriate conduct by some of our members or agents
involved in the bid process,'' Pound said.
	   ``We are aware there are agents and we are aware of the identity
of at least some of them,'' Pound said. ``What they've done or not
done, we don't know yet.''
	   Pound indicated the inquiry could be expanded to include
Hodler's charges that the selection of at least three other Olympic
cities had been affected by corruption _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan;
and Sydney, Australia.
	   ``One is never sure where the trail will lead,'' Pound said.
``At this moment, the focus is on Salt Lake City.''
	   Hodler said he believed four agents _ including one IOC member _
had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He said he
believed 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _ currently numbering
115 _ were open to bribery.
	   He said there is one agent who boasts ``that no city has ever
won the Olympic Games without his help.''
	   Hodler said Sunday that Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet.
He said he was told not to appear at a scheduled routine news
conference.
	   Surrounded by reporters, photographers and television cameras,
Hodler covered his mouth with both hands.
	   ``I don't have the right to say anything,'' he said. ``I'm not
to say anything by presidential orders _ nothing. ... I'm
muzzled.''

Maier returns to top of podium

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier
returned to the top of the podium for the first time since the
start of the season, winning a men's World Cup super-G on Sunday.
	   Maier, who was in an early season slump after winning the
inaugural giant slalom in October, rebounded from a dismal 36th
place in Saturday's downhill to claim his 13th career World Cup
victory.
	   It was another dominating performance from ``The Herminator,''
who charged down the drizzly, fog-shrouded Oreiller Killy course in
1 minute, 18.73 seconds, more than a second clear of his nearest
rival and teammate Stephan Eberharter, runnerup in 1:19.91.
	   ``It was once again a good race starting with the number eight
bib,'' said Maier, who has always been superstitious about starting
eighth, and won both the Olympic super-G and giant slalom titles
from that position.
	   Lasse Kjus, the winner of Saturday's downhill on the same
course, kept up a productive weekend, finishing third in 1:20.10,
ahead of compatriot Kjetil Andre Aamodt, fourth in 1:20.39.
	   If Kjus's victory on Saturday ended a two-year winning drought,
Maier's super-G win marked the Austrian's return to the top of the
podium for the first time since winning the season opener in
Soelden, Austria, two months ago.
	   Since then Maier _ who dominated the circuit last season winning
11 races on way to becoming the overall, super-G and giant slalom
World Cup champion _ had only a second place to show.
	   At this point last season, his rookie year on the World Cup
circuit, Maier had already collected a pair of victories and three
other podium finishes in five races.
	   ``O.K. maybe I didn't win so many races but I still raced
well,'' said Maier, who hinted he might race in a couple of
combined events this season, but not in the slalom. ``I won in
Soelden, came second in Aspen, went out in a giant slalom in Park
City after having the best time in the first leg, then won here.
	   ``O.K. I was 36th in the downhill here, but still, overall I
don't think that's so bad.''
	   The victory moved Maier up the World Cup overall rankings to
fourth from fifth with 280 points.
	   Eberharter's second-place finish allowed him to take the lead
from teammate Christian Mayer in the overall. Eberharter leads with
368 points, while Mayer drops to second, 66 points behind.
	   ``I don't want to focus on the overall because it's way too
early,'' said Eberharter, whose won a super-G and giant slalom this
season. ``I'm happy with my second place today and I just want to
focus on the races, on the next downhill.
	   ``I feel confident right now and I don't want to start thinking
about points.''
	   Kjus remains in third, a single point ahead of Maier.
	   After failing to place any skiers among the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill _ Austria's worst collective result ever _ the team's
one-two finish on Sunday helped restore the nation's dented pride.
	   This time, five Austrians placed in the top-10, with World Cup
downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finishing fifth in 1:20.40,
Hans Knauss sixth in 1:20.59 and Werner Franz crossing ninth, 2.44
adrift.
	   Italy's Peter Runggaldier had the seventh-fastest time, clocking
1:20.97, ahead of Fredrik Nyberg of Sweden, 2.34 back.
	   Daron Rahlves had the top American result, the super-G
specialist finishing in 12th place, 2.69 off the mark.

Rockets slam into Kabul; at least 17 people killed, 80 wounded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Cross canceling Sunday flight, heavy fighting
reported in northern Afghanistan; edits and trims. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Terrorized residents scrambled for
cover as successive rocket assaults shook the war-ravaged capital
on Sunday killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 80
others, witnesses and officials said.
	   The worst barrage shattered a northern Kabul neighborhood, with
one rocket hitting just in front of a crowded bus. Taxi drivers and
soldiers grabbed the seriously wounded and rushed them to hospitals
as dozens of others lay bleeding and pleading for help.
	   No one took responsibility for the attack, one of the worst
assaults on the capital in months.
	   But the rockets all came from north of the city where forces
loyal to ousted military chief Ahmed Shah Massood are based in
their fight against the Taliban militia, which controls Kabul and
most of Afghanistan and has imposed its strict version of Islamic
rule.
	   ``We don't know how many more Afghans will be killed by Afghans
. . . for how many years can this war will drag on?'' said Ghulam
Sakhi, a shopkeeper who was hiding in a basement of a six-story
apartment building along with about 12 other people.
	   A spokesman for the International Red Cross in neighboring
Pakistan said the international organization canceled its Sunday
flight to Kabul, but will resume flights on Tuesday.
	   The first attack of the day, in the worst-hit neighborhood,
occurred at dawn, killing a 15 year-old-boy and wounding his
father.
	   An assault in the early afternoon hit a residential area near
the combined military and civilian airport. A child was killed and
11 people, including eight women, were hurt when 11 rockets rained
down on their homes.
	   At area hospitals, doctors and nurses struggled to treat the
wounded with only a small amount of medicine. Some hospitals lacked
anesthetic, and painkilling drugs had to be bought from markets.
	   Red Cross ambulances screamed into stricken neighborhoods and
hurried wounded to the two hospitals that it supplies with
medicine.
	   In one taxi, 7-year-old Zarmeen wailed and clung to her mother.
The girl's leg was broken. Her mother cried and scolded her
daughter saying ``why did you go outside. I told you stay in the
house.''
	   After one attack, dozens of relatives gathered at the shattered
home of 15-year-old Zabiullah in Kalai Patula neighborhood to mourn
his death. They wrapped the boy's body in a white shroud and placed
him in the center of the rubble, while they sat around him wailing
and crying.
	   Zabiullah's father was in a nearby hospital, neighbors said. His
mother and sisters had been visiting a relative when the rocket
hit, they said.
	   In recent days there have been several bouts of heavy fighting
between Massood's troops and Taliban soldiers at the front line,
barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kabul.
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of the country while their
opponents control the remaining 10 percent.
	   Massood's spokesman said his forces launched a fresh offensive
against the Taliban in northern Takhar and Baghlan provinces,
killing at least 18 Taliban soldiers and capturing more than 100
others.
	   ``Our forces have made advances on three fronts inflicting heavy
losses to the Taliban,'' said opposition spokesman Abdullah, who
uses only one name.
	   The claim could not be independently confirmed.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Richard Holbrooke billed it as a more
moderate approach to help solve the 24-year-division of Cyprus.
	   But Sunday's meeting of Greek and Turkish Cypriot business
leaders once again ran afoul of the bitter disputes that have kept
the eastern Mediterranean island separated since 1974, when Turkish
troops invaded its northern third after an abortive Athens-backed
coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.
	   ``We came here to unite Cyprus, not separate it,'' said
Constatinos Lordos, head of the Greek Cypriot delegation.
	   He made the comment after Vedat Celik, head of the Turkish
Cypriot group, made a statement calling for international
recognition of the northern breakaway state. Only Turkey recognizes
the north, where it maintains 35,000 troops. Turkish Cypriots say
that has led to a de facto international trade embargo on the
north.
	   But Holbrooke managed to get the 20 business people from both
sides back to basics by reminding them that the meeting was
designed to avoid politics and deal with practical issues that can
be addressed by the entrepreneurial community.
	   ``We want business people to avoid the diplomatic dance,'' said
Dan Smith, director of the International Peace Research Institute
in Oslo, Norway.
	   But business leaders agree that not much can be done if a
political solution is not found. A decision by Greek Cypriots to
deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles later this month has worsened
chances and brought closer the possibility of a new war on the
island.
	   Holbrooke is to fly to Athens Monday for talks with Greece's
ministers of defense and foreign affairs in the hope that the
missiles can be deployed elsewhere, such as the Greek island of
Crete.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks have been deadlocked since late 1997, after
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insisted on recognition and an
end to negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European Union.
	   Denktash met with Turkish president Suleyman Demiral in Ankara
late Saturday. After the meeting, Demirel insisted on the need for
``the recognition of two states on Cyprus. Then these two states
will be able to find a solution on how to live on the island.''
	   Turkish Cypriots say the island can't join the EU _ of which
Greece is a member _ until Turkey joins the Union. But the EU last
year rejected Turkey as a candidate. Holbrooke late Saturday told
the delegates that the EU decision was a ``disaster.''
	   But Holbrooke said he placed great importance on the business
meeting as ``this doesn't change the objective realities of Cyprus,
but it helps smooth down the edges so we don't have a tragedy again
like we had in the past.''
	   Organized by the Oslo institute and Columbia University's
International Conflict Resolution Program, it was the third such
meeting since 1997.
	   ``They are talking, making proposals on projects, and moving
along,'' said Columbia's David L. Phillips, one of the leading
forces behind the initiative.
	   Instead of dealing with politics, the delegates have been
focusing on such issues as communication across the Green Line
dividing the island, fresh water supplies for its people, and
sewage treatment.

Maier returns to top of podium

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, CHANGES throughout &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier
returned to the top of the podium for the first time since the
start of the season, winning a men's World Cup super-G on Sunday.
	   Maier, who was in an early season slump after winning the
inaugural giant slalom in October, rebounded from a dismal 36th
place in Saturday's downhill to claim his 13th career World Cup
victory.
	   It was another dominating performance from ``The Herminator,''
who charged down the drizzly, fog-shrouded Oreiller Killy course in
1 minute, 18.73 seconds, more than a second clear of his nearest
rival and teammate Stephan Eberharter, runner-up in 1:19.91.
	   ``It was once again a good race starting with the No. 8 bib,''
said Maier, who has always been superstitious about starting
eighth, and won both the Olympic super-G and giant slalom titles
from that position.
	   Lasse Kjus, the winner of Saturday's downhill on the same
course, kept up a productive weekend, finishing third in 1:20.10,
ahead of compatriot Kjetil Andre Aamodt, fourth in 1:20.39.
	   If Kjus's victory on Saturday ended a two-year winning drought,
Maier's super-G win marked the Austrian's return to the top of the
podium for the first time since winning the season opener in
Soelden, Austria, two months ago.
	   Since then Maier _ who dominated the circuit last season winning
by 11 races on the way to becoming the overall super-G and giant
slalom World Cup champion _ had only a second place to show.
	   At this point last season, his rookie year on the World Cup
circuit, Maier had already collected a pair of victories and three
other podium finishes in five races.
	   ``O.K., maybe I didn't win so many races but I still raced
well,'' said Maier, who hinted that he might race in a couple of
combined events this season, but not in the slalom. ``I won in
Soelden, came second in Aspen, went out in a giant slalom in Park
City after having the best time in the first leg, then won here.
	   ``O.K., I was 36th in the downhill here, but still, overall I
don't think that's so bad.''
	   The victory moved Maier up the World Cup overall rankings to
fourth from fifth with 280 points.
	   Eberharter's second-place finish allowed him to take the lead
from teammate Christian Mayer in the overall. Eberharter leads with
368 points, while Mayer drops to second, 66 points behind.
	   ``I don't want to focus on the overall because it's way too
early,'' said Eberharter, whose won a super-G and giant slalom this
season. ``I'm happy with my second place today and I just want to
focus on the races, on the next downhill.
	   ``I feel confident right now and I don't want to start thinking
about points.''
	   Kjus remains in third, a single point ahead of Maier.
	   After failing to place any skiers among the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill _ Austria's worst collective result ever _ the team's
one-two finish on Sunday helped restore the nation's dented pride.
	   This time, five Austrians placed in the top-10, with World Cup
downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finishing fifth in 1:20.40,
Hans Knauss sixth in 1:20.59 and Werner Franz crossing ninth, 2.44
adrift.
	   Italy's Peter Runggaldier had the seventh-fastest time, clocking
1:20.97, ahead of Fredrik Nyberg of Sweden, 2.34 back.
	   Daron Rahlves had the top American result, the super-G
specialist finishing in 12th place, 2.69 off the mark.

Iranian official: Clinton's visit to Gaza part of a conspiracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The speaker of the Iranian Parliament said
Sunday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's planned visit to Gaza was
part of a ``dangerous conspiracy,'' the official news agency
reported.
	   Clinton, who arrived in Israel late Saturday, plans to visit the
Gaza Strip Monday and address the Palestine National Council. The
council is to remove clauses from the Palestinian charter that call
for Israel's destruction _ something Iran has rebuked.
	   ``This very dangerous and ominous conspiracy will be
materialized by the trip of the U.S. president to the occupied
lands and attending a meeting of the so-called Palestine National
Council,'' Iran's hard-line speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, told a
Parliament session.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Nateq-Nouri as saying
Clinton's presence at the PNC would be ``great catastrophe.''
	   Iran does not recognize Israel and believes it was built on land
belonging to the Palestinians.

Protests leave drivers in dire straits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEREK GATOPOULOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece is suffering through a bad case of
clogged arteries.
	   Striking workers and other demonstrators have staged nearly
daily roadblocks, turning any journey into a potential gridlock
grind.
	   Even motorists accustomed to Athens' epic traffic problems are
showing signs of frustration at the staggering tie-ups during the
traditional pre-holiday wave of protests. One taxi driver said he
bought a cassette of nature sounds to calm his nerves during the
interminable waits during the traffic jams.
	   This year's road rage is amplified by an usual array of
demonstrators taking to the streets _ from angry soccer fans to
students upset about education reforms. The government's austerity
measures to meet European Union standards have also launched dozens
of protest rallies.
	   The ability to cause major traffic disruptions has become a
major weapon of the protesters. And there is little chance of being
forcibly removed by Greek police, which generally take a laissez
faire attitude with peaceful protests.
	   On occasion, no more that a few dozen protesters have blocked
Greece's main highway, leading from Athens to the northern port of
Salonica. The highway could soon be the scene for more blockades by
farmers seeking concessions such as easing some crop limits.
	   In 1997, farmers used their tractors and field equipment to
close the highway for more than a month, stranding thousands of
trucks and causing a loss of more than dlrs 150 million in
international and domestic trade.
	   High school students also have gotten into the road block fever.
	   Students, who are occupying about 1,500 schools around Greece,
have begun daily blockades of busy roads of Athens and other towns.
Motorists who dared complain to kids at roadblock in Salonica
Friday were pelted with eggs.
	   The students oppose changes that would drop the single
university entrance exam and place greater weight on course work
and a series of tests to determine admission.
	   ``It's always us who pay for anything going on. They
(demonstrators) want to get noticed, but why should we have to be
put through this? I've been stuck here for two hours,'' an elderly
woman in Athens told television reporters from her driver seat,
near a school roadblock.
	   Motorists were recently put through additional strain when a
customs workers strike dried up gasoline supplies for days. Then
torrential rain last month washed away a bridge on the
Athens-Salonica highway.
	   In Salonica, furious soccer supporters staged a giant
demonstration in the city center after a local soccer was punished
for crowd violence.
	   Claiming the penalty was aimed at helping Athens teams, they
also briefly blocked the highway to Athens and set fire in the
street to television converter boxes of the pay channel that shows
Greek soccer games.
	   Many of the other protests are against a string of government
reforms introduced this fall. These include pension and health fund
mergers, changes to school and university systems and efforts to
streamline public transport.
	   Unions have called a general strike for Tuesday, expected to
stop all public services for a day.
	   Choking traffic in a city like Athens is not difficult. It is
now home to more than 4 million of Greece population of 10.2
million. A study conducted by the company building a new subway for
the city predicted that by 2020, cars in greater Athens will almost
double from their current number of about 1.5 million.

Presidents of Egypt and Congo discuss ways of ending Congolese
</HEADLINE>
civil war &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak and his Congolese
counterpart Laurent Kabila discussed Sunday a possible role for
Egypt in mediating an end to the four-month civil war in Congo,
government sources said.
	   The sources, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
declined to give details. Kabila arrived here Saturday and is
scheduled to leave Egypt Monday.
	   Kabila refuses to negotiate peace directly with the Congolese
rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda. The rebels, a coalition of
disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians, accuse
Kabila of corruption and ethnic favoritism.
	   Kabila, who is back by Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia,
alleges the rebels are merely pawns of neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda and insists on negotiating only with those two countries.

Nagano mayor denies wrongdoing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of
the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegations that city officials
bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to win the
right to host the games.
	   Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by
Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, of
systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games.
	   ``I have never heard of such a thing,'' Tsukada told the
Associated Press Sunday.
	   ``As far as Nagano is concerned, we haven't done anything wrong.
We were selected as host of the Olympics through our efforts. We
can't believe that Mr. Hodler has made such a statement,'' he said.
	   Tsukada was vice chairman of the Japanese committee to invite
the Olympics to Nagano.
	   Nagano has been criticized for spending a large amount of money
to win the games.
	   Sports Nippon, a leading Japanese sports newspaper, said more
than 2 billion yen (dlrs 17 million) of the money Nagano spent to
bring the games there has not been accounted for.
	   Japan Olympic Committee has warned cities seeking to host the
games in the future that they should not entertain IOC members
excessively, the newspaper said.
	   Holder's accusation might effect the invitation activities for
the 2008 summer Olympics by Osaka, Japan's second largest city, the
paper said. Osaka is competing with Beijing, China and other cities
for the right to host the games.
	   Nagano became the first Asian city to host the Winter Games
since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 games.
	   Eighty-eight IOC members took part in a secret vote in 1991 to
decide who would host the 1998 games. Nagano led in each of the
five rounds, beating out Salt Lake city 46 votes to 42 in the final
ballot.

U.S. envoy inaugurates Turkish natural gas plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARMARA EREGLISI, Turkey (AP) _A U.S. envoy in Turkey to renew
U.S. support for a proposed Caspian oil pipeline on Sunday joined
Turkish leaders to inaugurate of a dlrs 600 million natural gas
processing plant.
	   The joint U.S.-British-Turkish built plant, on the Marmara Sea
coast, some 110 kilometers (miles ) west of Istanbul, transforms
liquefied natural gas to produce 500 megawatt of electricity per
year.
	   ``This is the largest U.S. investment in Turkey apart from
defense contracts,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said at the
inauguration ceremony.
	   The U.S. envoy, Richard Morningstar, is scheduled to hold a
series of consultations in the capital, Ankara, starting Monday, to
strengthen a bid for the construction of a pipeline that would
transport oil from the Caspian region through Turkey to the
Mediterranean Sea.
	   A consortium of international oil companies are reluctant to
approve the proposed pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan on
Turkey's Mediterranean coast, because of the high cost of the
project and uncertainty over how much oil the Caspian fields will
produce.
	   The U.S. envoy is scheduled to chair a meeting between U.S.
ambassadors from Caspian oil producing countries meet with Turkish
energy official.

Cambodian prime minister still hopes for admission

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Sunday he is hopeful his country will be admitted to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in time for him to attend a
summit this week as a full-fledged member.
	   ``Yes, I hope, I hope,'' he told reporters after arriving and
immediately starting a round of meetings to rally support.
	   And while Hun Sen said he realizes the decision is beyond his
control, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said his
presence ``could conceivably help his chance of getting into
ASEAN.''
	   Cambodia's admission has been a hot topic at pre-summit
meetings. ASEAN foreign ministers said after discussing the issue
over dinner Friday that they could not reach a consensus and would
leave it up to their leaders to decide.
	   Cambodia was originally scheduled to join the grouping in July
1997 along with Laos and Myanmar, but its admission was delayed
after Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a violent coup.
	   Following a close election this July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
settled their differences last month and formed a coalition
government. Hun Sen was made sole prime minister in the deal and
the prince was named president of the National Assembly.
	   Vietnam, host of this year's ASEAN summit, has spearheaded the
effort to get its neighbor accepted this time.
	   However, the foreign ministers of the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand stuck to their views that Hun Sen's coalition with his
former enemy must prove stable first, saying loose ends remain,
including a controversial plan to form an upper house of Parliament
in Cambodia.
	   If Cambodia is allowed to join now, Siazon said, it might not
complete its reforms and ``politicians might feel that it's OK to
go back to their old ways and maybe even begin killing again.''
	   But Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, whose country
supports Cambodia's entry, said its political reforms are its own
internal problem.
	   ``Indonesia believes that we should be consistent. We in ASEAN
have always said that we don't interfere in internal affairs,'' he
said.
	   Before leaving Phnom Penh, Cambodian Foreign Affairs Secretary
of State Ouch Kim An said it would be disheartening and potentially
damaging for Cambodia to have its membership application put on
hold for the second time in as many years.
	   ``We will be disappointed if we will not be admitted because we
have been prepared for more than a year to enter ASEAN,'' he said.
``It is economically important for us to be a part of ASEAN. We
cannot be isolated.''
	   Hun Sen's arrival caused a media stir Sunday that ended with a
security guard knocking over a lamp that hit the Cambodian leader
on the back of the neck.
	   Hun Sen did not appear to be injured in the incident at the
Sofitel Metropole, where he is staying while having meetings over
the next two days on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations summit.

British entertainment tycoon Lew Grade dies at 91
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lew Grade, cigar-chomping, legendary entertainment
tycoon who founded Britain's first independent television company
and whose projects included the TV series, ``The Saint,'' and the
movie ``On Golden Pond,'' died Sunday. He was 91.
	   Lord Grade died of heart failure at the London Clinic, a private
hospital which he entered two weeks ago for surgery, his spokesman
Dennis Michael said.
	   His wife, Kathie, who he married 56 years ago, and their adopted
son, Paul, were at his bedside.
	   Grade, the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in
London's East End. He gave up an early career as hoofer to start a
small showbiz agency office in 1934.
	   Twenty-one years later _ and a lineup of contracts with stars
who included Edith Piaf, July Garland, Mario Lanza and Bob Hope _
Grade founded Associated Television, the first commercially funded
channel launched to face the formidable competition of the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Grade, who was knighted in 1963 and given a life peerage in
1976, never stopped working. His last movie, a weepy called
``Something To Believe In,'' was made this year _ and panned by
most critics.
	   For more than 70 years, Grade rode showbiz rapids _ with a
string of TV hits, some movie flops, fantastic deal-making skills,
and memorable one-liners.
	   Of perhaps his most expensive box-office flop, ``Raise the
Titantic'' which cost 18 million pounds (dlrs 30 million) to make
in 1980, he quipped, ``It would have been cheaper to lower the
Atlantic.''
	   Through ATV and later companies, Grade brought to millions a
string of TV shows that became household names.
	   They included ``Jesus of Nazareth,'' directed by Franco
Zeffirelli in 1975. His current company, The Grade Company,
co-produced ``Starlight Express'' on Broadway in 1985.
	   Louis Winogradsky was born on Christmas Day 1906 in Tokmak,
Ukraine, and came to London at the age of six.
	   The family became a British showbiz dynasty.
	   His brother, Bernie, later made a peer as Lord Delfont, was the
first was head of EMI, a music and electronics business that is now
Thorm-EMI Plc. His nephew, Michael Grade, the son of another
brother, Leslie, is the chief executive of Britain's Channel 4
television network.
	   After school, as Louis Grad he took up dancing, becoming in 1926
the World Charleston Champion in 1926. In 1929 a French journalist
misspelt his name _ and Lew Grade stuck.
	   Tributes poured in to his populist zeal, his colorful
personality, his rapid-fire decision-making, and his sheer love of
entertainment.
	   ``He was part of the great entrepreneurial group of Jewish
entrepreneurs who went to Hollywood, or in his case, stayed in
England of course, and ran the show immensely (well) privately and
personally,'' British film producer Michael Winner said Sunday.
	   His expansion in the agency business included taking over
Leslie's agency in 1943. Two years later it was the biggest in
Europe after William Morris.
	   ATV dominated much of British popular television through the
50s, 60s and 70s. Shows included ``Robin Hood,'' ``Emergency Ward
10,'' _ Britain's first twice-weekly soap, ``The Saint'' starring
Roger Moore, ``The Prisoner,'' ``Coronation Street'' and the
``Muppets.''
	   At the age of 71 he lost control of ATV (now Independent
Television) _ and turned to movies.
	   He is survived by his wife, the former Kathleen Moody, his son,
and two grandchildren.
	   Funeral arrangements were not announced immediately.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Another day, another world record: so
it goes for China's women weightlifters. What's more, the Chinese
say they're not even trying.
	   Ding Meiyuan broke two world records Sunday, completing another
Asian Games gold medal sweep for China's strongwomen.
	   It was the seventh straight day that China's women weightlifters
have broken world records. It also was the third consecutive games
that they have taken all the gold, following sweeps in 1990 and
1994, said head Chinese coach Han Guihua.
	   What makes China so strong? Officials and lifters say that apart
from having 1.3 billion people to choose from, China also has the
advantage of a state-sponsored sports system, more than a decade of
experience in the still developing sport of women's weightlifting
and a 40-strong team of women, some from needy families, who are
prepared to work harder than most for gold and begin training in
some cases as young as age 13.
	   ``We can eat more bitterness than foreigners,'' said Liu Xiuhua,
a petite lifter who set a snatch world record of 83.5 kilograms _
close to twice her bodyweight _ in the under 48-kilogram division
Monday.
	   ``Weightlifting is a sport of poor people. They can cope with
hardship and the monotony'' of weight training, added Wei Di, the
team manager. ``All of our team members are from peasant
families.''
	   The Chinese will get 2,000 yuan (dlrs 240) for each record, plus
10,000 yuan (dlrs 1,200) for their gold medals, said Wei. That is
about three times more than many Chinese farmers earn in a year.
	   Some Chinese weightlifters also have tried drugs: five were
caught last year for doping offenses and punished, said Wei. He
claimed that a Chinese black market for performance-enhancing
substances is supplied by ``Americans who come to China especially
to peddle drugs.''
	   In a measure of China's determination to stamp out the problem,
new rules introduced at the start of the year impose a life ban on
lifters who test positive for certain drugs, as well as their
coaches, he said. He noted that the punishment is much harsher than
the two-year ban demanded by the sport's governing body.
	   This year, no lifters have failed doping tests, he said. The
International Weightlifting Federation has conducted a minimum of
three surprise tests this year on every member of China's Asian
Games team, he added.
	   As for the records, no one in the Chinese camp seemed very
surprised.
	   ``They lift even heavier weights at home,'' said Wei. Some of
the Chinese weightlifters ``haven't displayed their full
strength.''
	   Ding, competing in the over-75 kilogram division, lifted 120
kilograms in the snatch, besting the 118.5 kilogram world record
set by her compatriot Zhang Nan on May 24.
	   She also jerked 150 for a combined 270 kilograms, breaking the
267.5-kilogram record set by China's Tang Gonghong on April 24.
Mynamar's Aye Aye Aung got silver with a 252.5 total. Taiwan's Chen
Hsiao Lien got bronze with 242.5.
	   Wei predicted, however, that China's dominance will wane as
other countries get stronger. Women's weightlifting will be
included as an Olympic event for the first time in 2000 in Sydney,
Australia, and Asian countries are piling resources into the sport
in the hope of getting a medal, said Richard Crawley of the Thai
Amateur Weightlifting Association.
	   ``China's strength will gradually disappear,'' Wei said. ``By
Sydney, all countries will be competing on an equal footing.''

Clinton promises prompt decision on whether to free convicted spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ President Bill Clinton on Sunday promised a
prompt decision on whether to free a former U.S. navy intelligence
analyst convicted of spying for Israel after a review is complete
in January.
	   Clinton noted he had promised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that he would look into his request for leniency for
Jonathan Pollard, who was sentenced to life for handing over
thousands of top secret documents to Israel in the mid-1980s.
	   ``I have instituted the review that I pledged to the prime
minister, and we've never done this on a case before, but I told
him I would do it, and we did it,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.S. president, speaking at a joint news conference with
Netanyahu, said he had instructed White House counsel Charles F.C.
Ruff to sound out all the relevant intelligence and security
agencies for their opinion.
	   Clinton said he would also weigh the opinions of Pollard's
supporters, ``and I will make a decision in a prompt way.''
	   ``We are giving everyone time to present their comments, and I
will get comments on both sides of the issue, evaluate it, and make
a decision,'' he added.
	   The review is expected to be complete in mid-January.
	   Netanyahu told a joint news conference that he was not excusing
Pollard's behavior but felt that releasing him was in order since
the Israeli spy had been in what amounted to solitary confinement
for 13 years.
	   ``It's a very very heavy sentence, and since he was sent by us
on a mission ... we hope that on a purely humanitarian appeal a way
will be found to release him,'' said Netanyahu.
	   He added the appeal was not political or designed to exonerate
Pollard but ``merely to end a very, very sorry case that has
afflicted him and the people of Israel.''
	   Pollard's supporters, including a Cabinet minister and four
legislators, claim the U.S. intelligence community is exacting
revenge on Pollard and that other spies have been released after
serving shorter terms. They planned to stage a protest calling for
Pollard's release during Clinton's visit.
	   Successive U.S. administrations have turned down Israeli
requests for Pollard's release. After Israel had claimed for years
that Pollard was part of a rogue operation run without the
knowledge of the government, Netanyahu's government recognized him
as an Israeli agent and granted him citizenship. He has since been
visited by a number of top officials.
	   In October, the Pollard case led to a crisis in the Wye River
Mideast summit. On the last day of the summit, Netanyahu demanded
Pollard's release as a condition for release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails. He had hoped to fly home with Pollard
on his plane, a move that would have helped him sell the Wye accord
with his right-wing coalition partners.
	   However, the proposal met stiff opposition from U.S.
intelligence officials, past and present, and CIA Director George
Tenet reportedly threatened to resign if Pollard went free.
	   A U.S. official confirmed last week that information Pollard
handed over included a top secret 10-volume manual used by the
National Security Agency to tap foreign communications and protect
U.S. communications from intercept.
	   CBS reported Pollard's information told the Israelis the
disposition of U.S. Navy ships in the Mediterranean so that Israel
could strike PLO headquarters in Tunisia without being detected.
The 1985 raid was carried out with satellite photos Pollard had
given to the Israelis, the network reported.

with 407.5 and South Korea's Choi Jong-kun won bronze with 405.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss IOC executive board member
Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International
Olympic Committee for making allegations of corruption within the
Olympic movement.
	   Asked whether he might resign, Hodler said, ``No, I don't
resign. But maybe I will be expelled. You never know.''
	   Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said he has since
been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   His comments came as the leader of the Salt Lake organizing
committee apologized Sunday for the alleged rules violations during
the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The IOC, meanwhile, said it was prepared to investigate
allegations made by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic
host cities.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending the Russian government's plans to print
more money in 1999, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said paying
workers on time is more important than propping up the ruble, a
news report said Sunday.
	   ``It is unbelievable sometimes when I hear that the most
important thing now is to strengthen the ruble, even by delaying
pensions and wages in the budget sector,'' Primakov said in an
interview with the ORT television station on Saturday, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov was defending the government's draft budget for 1999,
which calls for printing an additional dlrs 1.7 billion worth of
rubles to cover part of a deficit equivalent to around dlrs 5
billion. Some economists believe the government will print far
more.
	   Before Russia's economic crisis hit in August, the ruble was
trading at six to the dollar. It now stands at around 20 to the
dollar, and is expected to continue falling. Russia faces mounting
debts and falling revenues next year, and many government officials
say the only way out is to print more cash.
	   Russia's money supply has gone from about 160 billion rubles
(dlrs 8 billion) when the crisis struck to more 190 billion rubles
(dlrs 9.5 billion) Friday, according to government figures.
	   Primakov said Russia should not have to depend on Western
credits, as it has in the past.
	   ``Why should we beg all the time,'' Primakov said. ``We must
revive the real economy to create a sound foundation and build
relations with people on this basis,'' he said.

Palestinians appear to be softening stance on PNC vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian negotiator saying the PNC
members will raise their hands to affirm changes in the PLO
charter, U.S. flags burned in rally &QL; 
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Sunday there would
be a show of hands to affirm the abrogation of PLO charter clauses
seeking Israel's destruction, a move that could help solve the key
dispute overshadowing U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the Palestine National
Council votes to annul the offending charter clauses.
	   Clinton is to address the PNC session in Gaza City on Monday,
along with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   In the West Bank, new violence erupted despite efforts by the
Palestinian Authority to calm the situation during the Clinton
visit. Palestinians threw stones at Israeli troops in several West
Bank towns, including Ram north of Jerusalem. A 15-year-old
Palestinian girl protesting the Clinton visit wounded an Israeli
teen-ager near the Shavei Shomron settlement in a stabbing attack.
	   Two U.S. flags were burned at a rally attended by 2,000
followers of a radical PLO faction, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine that opposes the peace accords.
	   Monday's PNC session is the most sensitive stop of Clinton's
three-day trip and could lead to a showdown if Clinton and
Netanyahu disagree over whether the PNC has completed its task.
	   The Palestinians have insisted that a vote is not required by
the Wye River peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate. The accord
says the PNC must ``reaffirm'' a letter to Clinton in which Arafat
lists the charter clauses considered revoked.
	   However, on Sunday, the Palestinians appeared to be softening
their position. Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Arafat
will ask the delegates at the end of his speech whether they
support the peace process and the letter to Clinton.
	   ``Then we will raise our hands and stand up and applaud,''
Asfour said. Despite the show of hands, this should not be
considered a formal vote, Asfour said.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel was evasive when asked
whether such a show of hands would satisfy Israel. ``We're
demanding a vote, but we're not going to discuss the technicalities
in the media,'' he said.
	   The Israeli Cabinet will meet Thursday or Friday to decide
whether Israel would carry out the next troop withdrawal, said
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon. ``As it looks now, I think
it will be very hard for the government to approve it,'' he said.
	   Even if the PNC votes to Israel's satisfaction, Netanyahu says
the Palestinians will have to meet several other conditions before
he will redeploy troops.
	   Netanyahu wants Arafat to withdraw publicly from intentions to
unilaterally declare a state in May and to accept Israel's terms
for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a dispute that has
triggered daily clashes in the West Bank.
	   Under the Wye agreement, Israel promised to release 750
prisoners by the end of January. Last month, Israel freed 250, but
most of them were criminals.
	   The Palestinians said they were given to understand that those
released would be prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities, but
Israel has denied making such a promise.
	   In a nod to Clinton, Palestinian prisoners will suspend their
weeklong hunger strike to lower tensions, said Hisham Abdel Razek,
a Palestinian Cabinet minister for prisoner affairs.
	   The Palestinian Authority has already canceled a commercial
strike in the West Bank and Gaza planned for Monday. Instead of the
strike, church bells will ring in the biblical town of Bethlehem,
one of the stops on Clinton's itinerary.
	   Abdel Razek said he would meet with Clinton on Monday, along
with children of prisoners, to hand over a petition with more than
1 million signatures demanding the release of the prisoners.
	   In a letter to Clinton, the Palestinian Prisoners' Association
wrote: ``Mr. President, five years have passed since the signing of
the peace agreement and we are still in Israeli jails ... This is
against the spirit of a just peace.''
	   U.S. officials have said Israel has not broken promises
concerning the prisoners, but Palestinian negotiators said Clinton
promised to intercede and try to resolve the dispute.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending the Russian government's plans to print
more money in 1999, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said paying
workers on time is more important than propping up the ruble, a
news report said Sunday.
	   ``It is unbelievable sometimes when I hear that the most

Nestle tries to recoup after poisoned Christmas cake scare
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The maker of two popular brands of Christmas
cake launched a counteroffensive Sunday after a rat poison scare
that alarmed the nation.
	   After testing, the government determined that the only cakes
with poison in them were two sent to the ANSA news agency. They
were accompanied by a warning from animal-rights activists that
cakes, called ``panettone,'' had been injected with poison
nationwide.
	   Nestle Italia put on a ``panettone'' festival Sunday in front of
Milan's central train station in a bid to restore faith in its
Motta and Alemagna brand cakes. People dressed in blue Santa Claus
costumes handed out free samples as cheery Christmas tunes played.
Nestle also handed out free cakes in Rome.
	   An undersecretary of the interior, Diego Masi, attended the
Milan event, publicly sampling the yeast cakes laden with fruit and
nuts that are an indispensable part of Christmas in Italy. He
declared the poison alert over.
	   ``It facts are simple,'' Masi said, according to the ANSA news
agency. ``We're talking about just two panettone, which weren't
sold but were mailed to ANSA.''
	   The government did spot checks of panettone taken off store
shelves after ANSA got the two poisoned ones on Thursday night and
they tested positive for rat poison.
	   The president of Nestle Italia, Yves Barbieux, had harsh words
for the media, which he said had blown the incident out of
proportion.
	   ``It's incredible that in Italy, no one's talking about the
Clinton impeachment, the tragic air crash (in Thailand), but only
about two poisoned panettone,'' he said bitterly. Injected them
with rat poison.
	   The warnings from the Animal Liberation Front that accompanied
the two poisoned cakes said the group was protesting the use of
genetically engineered ingredients, such as certain types of wheat,
in the cakes.
	   ``It was a great success for the ecoterrorists,'' Barbieux said
of the scare.
	   Nestle says it isn't currently using such ingredients in the
products sold in Italy. But, Barbieux said defiantly, it plans to
in the future.
	   ``We will use these products, as we do in the rest of Europe,
because its part of progress,'' he said. ``We're trying to improve
production and lower prices.''
	   Police are questioning members of the Animal Liberation Front,
an organization perhaps best known for staging raids on
laboratories that experiment on animals and on mink farms.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Muslims living in Belgium went to the
polls Sunday to elect a special executive council that will
represent the Islamic religion in its relations with the Belgian
authorities.
	   After Roman Catholicism, Islam is Belgium's second religion,
with some 350,000 Muslims living in this nation of 9.9 million. The
majority of them are Moroccan and Turk, with about 10 percent
naturalized or converted Belgians.
	   The election comes 24 years after Belgium recognized Islam as an
official religion in Belgium. The establishment of an official
representative body however has been held back, partly because
Islam does not have a strict hierarchical structure in Belgium as
Roman Catholicism does.
	   Observers said it was the first such election for Muslims in
Europe.
	   Some 74,000 Muslim voters will elect 51 representatives, who in
turn will choose 17 members of an executive council. The lack of
such a council has held back state subsidies, which already are
granted to other religions.
	   Results of the election were to be announced Monday.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Kuwait will lend Syria 15 million dinars
(about dlrs 45 million) under agreement signed Sunday to finance a
road project.
	   The easy loan by the government-run Kuwaiti Fund for Arab
Economic Development carries an interest rate of 3 percent a year
and is payable in 20 years with five years grace period.
	   The 100-kilometer (62 miles) Latakia-Ariha expressway, which
will cost dlrs 275 million, is expected to be completed in 2003.
	   The loan agreement was signed by the Syrian minister of state
for planning, Abdul-Rahim Subeii, and the chairman of the Kuwaiti
Fund, Bader Mushara al-Humeidhi.
	   The project is aimed at connecting the road network in the
country, especially linking the Latakia port with Aleppo, Syria's
second largest city.
	   The fund has already extended 24 loans to Syria totaling about
dlrs 1 billion to finance development projects.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has sold dlrs 1.85 billion of crude oil
in its current fiscal year under an advance sales program in which
it gets paid now for oil to be delivered sometime in 1999, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The English-language Iran Daily reported Hojjatollah
Ghanimifard, head of international affairs at the National Iranian
Oil Co., as saying that delivery dates and prices already have been
fixed. But he declined to give specifics.
	   The paper said Ghanimifard made the comments to the
Abrar-Eqtesadi newspaper, which ran the report over the weekend.
	   Oil sold under the advance sales program is in addition to the
country's normal oil exports. The program is aimed at providing the
government with additional revenue to help fill budgetary
shortfalls. The Iranian fiscal year ends in March.
	   Current oil prices are about dlrs 5 a barrel lower than the dlrs
16 a barrel originally expected by the government.
	   For NIOC's customers, the advance sales are a sort of futures
contract that allows them to lock in current low oil prices for
supply needs next year.
	   Iran exports about 2.2 million barrels a day of crude,
Ghanimifard said.
	   He said he does not expect an improvement in oil prices in the
coming year.
 &UR; ___
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Omani exports dropped 27 percent to 1.6
billion rials (dlrs 4 billion) in the first nine months of this
year, compared with exports of 2.19 billion rials (dlrs 5.7
billion) for the same period last year, the official Oman New
Agency reported.
	   Oil exports, Oman's main source of revenue, dropped 35 percent
to 1 billion rials (dlrs 2.6 billion) compared with 1.67 billion
(dlrs 4.35 billion) a year earlier, the agency said.
	   It said non-oil exports increased over the same period by 4
percent to 150.6 million rials (dlrs 392 million) from 144.9
million rials (dlrs 377 million) a year earlier. Oman's non-oil
exports are mainly agricultural products and textiles.
	   Oman produces 870,000 barrels of oil per day, following a cut of
50,000 barrels agreed upon with oil producing countries earlier
this year.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The National Industries Co., a leading
manufacturer, announced Sunday it has changed its name and adopted
a new strategy that includes being listed on European stock
exchanges.
	   According to the Kuwait News Agency, Saud al-Osaimi, the
company's chief executive officer, said NIC's name has become
National Industries Group. He said the group planned to attract
foreign capital, close some of its plants including those that
manufacture batteries and detergents, and expand in the more
profitable ones such as building materials.
	   Al-Osaimi said the group was going to be the first Kuwaiti
company to be listed on the stock exchanges of London and
Luxembourg. He did not provide any dates or details.
	   KUNA quoted the executive as saying the company has abandoned a
bond issue to raise its capital by 20 percent. The decision was
partly motivated by the sharp fall in prices on the Kuwait Stock
exchange, al-Osaimi said.
	   NIG is listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange with a paid-up
capital of 50.79 million dinars (dlrs 168.17 million).

Star tenor cancels planned Berlin Philharmonic appearance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Star tenor Luciano Pavarotti has
canceled a planned appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic on New
Year's eve, ZDF television said Sunday.
	   A ZDF spokesman said Pavarotti had been advised by his lawyer to
cancel the appearance because the tenor is being investigated in a
tax evasion case in Germany. ``We are very disappointed by the
cancellation.''
	   Pavarotti, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and star soprano
Montserrat Caballe, were named as suspects last month for helping
German concert promoter Matthias Hoffmann evade taxes.
	   Mannheim prosecutor Hubert Jobski said there were signs that the
four may have been involved in the case against Hoffmann, but that
the investigation had only started and could take months.
	   Hoffmann went on trial on fraud and tax evasion charges in
October. He is accused of using unreported payments and shell
companies in Ireland, London and elsewhere to evade almost 24
million marks (dlrs 15 million) in German taxes.
	   Hoffmann, who has been in investigative custody since July 30,
1997 has organized concerts with the three tenors and Caballe.

Lee sails to victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-Hwa was one
of the first to congratulate Olympic windsurfer Lee Lai-Shan after
she won its second ever Asian Games gold medal Sunday.
	   Lee won Hong Kong's only Olympic gold medal ever when she
claimed the event at Atlanta in 1996, but she said she might not
try to defend the title in Sydney in 2000.
	   ``I'm not sure if I will take part in the Sydney Olympics. I am
lacking motivation at the moment,'' said Lee, 28, after adding the
Asian Games gold to other victories in the world, European and
Asian championships.
	   But Sunday night was spent in celebration with Hong Kong sports
officials and members of the yachting and rowing teams at Pattaya,
the venue for the two sports.
	   ``It was a very happy gathering, opening champagne, cutting
cakes,'' said Pang Chung, the team's leader. ``She is our star.''
	   The former British colony of 6.6 million people, which was
reintegrated into China last year, had won only one other Asian
Games gold _ in bowling in 1986.
	   Hong Kong's 297-member delegation is the biggest it has sent to
an Asian Games. Hong Kong won 12 medals _ all silver and bronze _
at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. Despite its
July 1, 1997, handover to Chinese rule, Hong Kong still competes
separately from the mainland, under the title ``Hong Kong, China.''
	   Hong Kong also lifted a silver in the men's light raceboard
competition as Wong Tak-Sum finished second to China's Zhou
Yuanguo.
	   Thailand snatched two golds through Suhaimee Moohammadkasem and
Arun Homraruen, in the men's heavy raceboard and men's mistral
events.
	   China won the women's Europe class through Zhang Hong and also
took the women's 470 competition.
	   South Korea won in six of the 16 divisions. Singapore won its
first two golds of these games, and Indonesia won one.
	   Chae Bong-jin, in the men's Optimist, and Laser sailor Kim
Ho-Kon won their events for South Korea while Indonesian Oka
Sulaksana triumphed in the mistral heavyweight. Singapore claimed
the men's and women's 420 gold.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian Games officials struggled Sunday
to bring the sale of soccer tickets under control and announced
that 70 scalpers had been arrested in connection with a shortage
that triggered violence Saturday by thousands of angry fans.
	   Four more ticket booths were opened Sunday to help meet the
demand on sales at Rajamangala National Stadium, where host
Thailand is to play heavily favored South Korea in the
quarterfinals Monday. Buyers were to be limited to five tickets.
	   ``We must reduce the pressure outside the stadium,'' Sakchye
Tupsuwan, chairman of the Asian Games technical committee, told a
news conference Sunday. ``We are trying to solve this problem, but
it is difficult, particularly with football.''
	   Sakchye, who urged soccer-mad Thais to stay home and watch
Monday's match on television, said that scalpers at Saturday's
group decider between Thailand and Qatar had driven up prices by
three to five times their original value.
	   Thousands of people had camped outside the stadium before the
official opening of the ticket booths at 8 a.m. Saturday, Sakchye
said. Noting the large numbers, officials opened sales early and
when more people showed up at the normal hours, tickets were gone.
	   Ticketless fans stormed the stadium fences and threw bottles,
cans and shoes at riot police.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Lew Grade, the cigar-chomping, legendary
entertainment tycoon who founded Britain's first commercially
funded television company, died Sunday. He was 91.
	   Lord Grade, whose projects included the TV series, ``The
Saint,'' and the movie ``On Golden Pond,'' died of heart failure at
the London Clinic which he entered two weeks ago for surgery, his
spokesman Dennis Michael said.
	   His wife, Kathie, who he married 56 years ago, and their adopted
son, Paul, were at his bedside.
	   Grade, the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in
London's East End. He gave up an early career as a hoofer to start
a small showbiz agency office in 1934.

Israeli jets attack suspected guerrilla positions in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired rockets at
suspected guerrilla positions in the southwestern Lebanon on
Sunday.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   Earlier, Israeli planes broke the sound barrier over Beirut,
rattling windows of apartment buildings.
	   Four Israeli jets fired 12 rockets at targets in the western
sector of the Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon.
	   An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said the jet pilots
reported ``good hits'' and returned safely to their bases.
	   The raids came a few hours after the Shiite Muslim militant
group Hezbollah shelled an outpost of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon militia in Wadi Zellaya just north of the occupation zone.
	   A Hezbollah spokesman in Beirut had no comment on the air raid,
but the group said its fighters on the ground hit an Israeli
Merkava tank with rockets in Iqlim al-Tuffah province, some 15
kilometers (9 miles) southeast of the southern city of Sidon.
	   It gave no casualty figures. There was no Israeli confirmation
of the attack on the tank.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is trying to oust the 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army from
the 1,100-square-kilometer (440-square-mile) occupation strip along
the Lebanese-Israeli border.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece is suffering through a bad case of
clogged arteries.
	   Striking workers and other demonstrators have staged nearly
daily roadblocks, turning any journey into a potential gridlock
grind.
	   Even motorists accustomed to Athens' epic traffic problems are
showing signs of frustration at the staggering tie-ups during the
traditional pre-holiday wave of protests. One taxi driver said he
bought a cassette of nature sounds to calm his nerves during the
interminable waits during the traffic jams.
	   This year's road rage is amplified by an unusual array of
demonstrators taking to the streets _ from angry soccer fans to
students upset about education reforms. The government's austerity
measures to meet European Union standards have also launched dozens
of protest rallies.

Angola army chief surprised by UNITA rebels' military strength
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Backed by superior firepower, the rebel
group UNITA has gained the upper hand in battles against the
government's army in Angola's central highlands, the government's
chief-of-staff said Sunday.
	   Gen. Joao de Matos expressed surprise over UNITA's firepower,
which he said included tanks, assault vehicles, and long-range
artillery.
	   ``We stand before a UNITA with a military potential far beyond
the one it had before,'' Gen. Matos said in an interview broadcast
Sunday on state radio RNA.
	   Government officials had not made any public comment on the
fighting since the army launched an attack on UNITA's central
highland strongholds Dec. 4, ending a 4-year-old peace pact between
the two sides.
	   Gen. Matos said UNITA had launched a ``large scale''
counterattack near Huambo and Kuito, the strategic capitals of the
central, highland provinces of Huambo and Bie, some 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda.
	   ``It's a critical and difficult situation,'' Matos said, adding
that the rebels were supported by mercenaries from Israel, South
Africa, Ukraine and Morrocco.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 agreement which ended a two-decade civil war in which 500,000
people were killed and hundreds of thousands more were left maimed,
homeless and threatened by disease and hunger.
	   The pact called on UNITA to disarm its 70,000-strong army and
hand over control of almost half the country it occupied to the
government.
	   In the interview, Gen. Matos expressed dismay over UNITA's
military buildup, which had taken place ``under the passive gaze of
the United Nations.''
	   UNITA reportedly has rearmed in the past year and has a
well-equipped guerilla army of about 30,000. The government army
numbers 100,000, though only about 30,000 are believed to be
properly trained soldiers.
	   Civil war first erupted in Angola after the southwest African
nation's 1975 independence from Portugal. The fighting was halted
by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement collapsed a year later
after UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's first elections.

Greek protests leave drivers in dire straits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEREK GATOPOULOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece is suffering through a bad case of
clogged arteries.
	   Striking workers and other demonstrators have staged nearly
daily roadblocks, turning any journey into a potential gridlock
grind.
	   Even motorists accustomed to Athens' epic traffic problems are
showing signs of frustration at the staggering tie-ups during the
traditional pre-holiday wave of protests. One taxi driver said he
bought a cassette of nature sounds to calm his nerves during the
interminable waits during the traffic jams.
	   This year's road rage is amplified by an unusual array of
demonstrators taking to the streets _ from angry soccer fans to
students upset about education reforms. The government's austerity
measures to meet European Union standards also have sparked dozens
of protest rallies.
	   The ability to cause major traffic disruptions has become a
major weapon of protesters. And there is little chance of being
forcibly removed by Greek police, who generally take a laissez
faire attitude with peaceful protests.
	   On occasion, no more that a few dozen protesters have blocked
Greece's main highway, leading from Athens to the northern port of
Salonica. The highway could soon be the scene for more blockades by
farmers seeking concessions such as easing some crop limits.
	   In 1997, farmers used their tractors and field equipment to
close the highway for more than a month, stranding thousands of
trucks and causing a loss of more than dlrs 150 million in
international and domestic trade.
	   High school students also have gotten into the road block fever.
	   Students, who are occupying about 1,500 schools around Greece,
have begun daily blockades of busy roads of Athens and other towns.
Motorists who dared complain at a student roadblock in Salonica
Friday were pelted with eggs.
	   The students oppose changes that would drop the single
university entrance exam and place greater weight on course work
and a series of tests to determine admission.
	   ``It's always us who pay for anything going on. They
(demonstrators) want to get noticed, but why should we have to be
put through this? I've been stuck here for two hours,'' an elderly
woman in Athens said from her driver seat, near a school roadblock.
	   Motorists were recently put through additional strain when a
customs workers strike dried up gasoline supplies for days. Then
torrential rain last month washed away a bridge on the
Athens-Salonica highway.
	   In Salonica, furious soccer fans staged a giant demonstration in
the city center after a local team was punished for crowd violence.
	   Claiming the penalty was aimed at helping Athens teams, they
also briefly blocked the highway to Athens and set fire to
television converter boxes of the pay channel that shows Greek
soccer games.
	   Many of the other protests are against government reforms
introduced this fall. These include pension and health fund mergers
and efforts to streamline public transport.
	   Unions have called a general strike for Tuesday, expected to
stop all public services for a day.
	   Choking traffic in a city like Athens is not difficult. It is
now home to more than 4 million of Greece's population of 10.2
million. A study conducted by the company building a new subway for
the city predicted that by 2020, cars in greater Athens will almost
double from their current number of about 1.5 million.

South Korea beats Japan to top Pool A in baseball
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korean center fielder Lee
Byung-kyu led his team to a convincing 9-2 win over Japan in the
last game of the preliminary round of Asian Games baseball
competition.
	   Lee scored six runs with a double and two homers, the first a
grand slam in the second inning and the second a single-run blast
in the fifth.
	   But Japan's first baseman Yoshihiko Kajiyama provided the
biggest crowd-pleaser, with a rare inside-the-park home run in the
eighth inning.
	   Korea's victory set up a semifinal against China on Tuesday. The
other knockout semifinal will between Japan and Taiwan with the
final to be played Wednesday.
	   Erratic pitching by both teams was responsible for some runs.
Japan got on the scoreboard in the top of the first, when left
fielder Koji Okumura doubled and Korean starter Choi Won-ho then
threw three straight walks, pushing him home.
	   Korea evened the score in the bottom of the inning, when Lee
doubled to drive in left fielder Park Han-yi.
	   Korea went ahead in the second, when first baseman Chang
Young-kyoon walked, third baseman Kang Bong-kyu pushed him to
second with a single, and another single by second baseman Hwang
Woo-gu drove him in. Shortstop Back Jae-ho was then hit by a pitch
by Japan's Hisanori Takahashi, loading the bases, and setting the
stage for Lee's grand slam, which put Japan ahead 5-1.
	   Korea added another run in the fifth on Lee's second homer,
blasted to right, and Chang hit a sixth-inning home run down the
right field line to put Japan ahead 8-1.
	   Korea's Park hit a leadoff double off Japanese reliever Shoji
Hirota in the seventh, advanced to third base on a wild pitch, and
then scored on another wild pitch, putting Japan up 9-1.
	   Sidearm thrower Kim Byung-kyu came in to relieve for Korea in
the top of the eighth, and gave up Japan's second and final run,
when Yoshihiko Kajiyama hit a line shot to center which got past
the fielder all the way to the wall. Kajiyama ran through, and
scored when the catcher fumbled the relay. In an earlier game,
China defeated Thailand 13-3.

U.S. warns of possible terrorist attack on Americans in Gulf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ United States embassies in four Gulf
nations said Sunday they have information indicating the ``strong
possibility'' of a terrorist attack at one or more U.S. targets in
the region over the next 30 days.
	   A statement distributed to American citizens in Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain asked them to be on alert
to ``any suspicious activity and take precautionary steps to reduce
the profile and vulnerability of any U.S. facilities.''
	   The statement did not give details beyond saying there is ``a
strong possibility that terrorist elements are planning an attack
against U.S. targets in the Gulf, possibly in the next 30 days.''
	   In Bahrain, the embassy said some 1,000 military personnel
stationed in the country have been put under curfew and told not to
gather in large numbers at public places. The 1,300 American
civilians in Bahrain also are being discouraged from gathering in
public places.
	   Security for the 40,000 Americans working in Saudi Arabia _
along with an estimated 5,000 military personnel _ has been a
priority following two fatal bombings aimed at U.S. troops in the
kingdom.
	   Five American servicemen and two Indian nationals were killed in
an attack on a military center in Riyadh in November 1995. A truck
bombing in the eastern city of Dhahran in June 1996 killed 19 U.S.
airmen.
	   The U.S. missions in Saudi Arabia closed for four days in
October to review security after receiving information that the
embassy in Riyadh was under threat of a terrorist attack.
	   That warning followed the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Saalam, Tanzania, in which 224 people
were killed and 5,000 injured.

Daehlie moves atop standings; Martinsen wins easily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOBBIACO, Italy (AP) _ Bjorn Daehlie moved atop the World Cup
cross country skiing standings Sunday by dominating a 15-kilometer
classical race for a second straight win.
	   The Norwegian finished in 38 minutes, 30.5 seconds to beat
countryman Espen Bjervig by 8 seconds. Finland's Jari Isometsa was
third in 38:39.3.
	   Bente Martinsen, another Norwegian, stormed to an easy victory
in the women's 10-kilometer event, beating runner-up Nina Gavriljuk
of Russia by nearly 25 seconds.
	   Daehlie, owner of a record eight Winter Olympics gold medals and
five World Cup titles, took over the season lead with 280 points
after four races.
	   Sweden's Mathias Fredriksson _ seventh Sunday in 38:57.3 _
dropped out of the top spot and is now second overall with 231
points. Per Elofsson is next with 202.
	   ``I started very quickly and gave it my all, but then halfway I
slowed down because I realized I didn't need to push anymore,''
said Daehlie, who has 43 career World Cup race wins. ``I really
wanted to take the standings lead, because now I have confidence in
myself. It's not easy to find motivation for every race, like it
was 10 years ago.''
	   He won a 10-kilometer freestyle race Saturday.
	   Martinsen completed the women's course at this Dolomite resort
in 28:33.9 for her first win of the season, and jumped from sixth
to second in the World Cup standings.
	   Gavriljuk was second in 28:58.3, followed by Sweden's Antonina
Ordina in 29:05.3, and Russia's Olga Danilova in 29:20.7.
	   Katerina Neumannova, who won Saturday's 5-kilometer race,
finished fifth Sunday in 29:22.8, but she held onto her overall
lead. The Czech skier has 285 points to 214 for Martinsen.
Gavriljuk has 200, Ordina 176.

EU envoy discusses Mideast peace with Syrian officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The European Union's Middle East envoy
said Sunday that Europe will continue to work on reviving the
stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
	   ``For the moment, there is no new plan for reactivating talks,
but there are ongoing efforts. I will continue my mission to see
how and when we can re-launch peace talks,'' Miguel Moratinos told
The Associated Press after a one-hour meeting with Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
	   He met with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa shortly
after his arrival here Saturday.
	   Moratinos is in the Syrian capital as part of his regular trips
to the Middle East to promote Mideast talks. He has already
traveled to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan and
Lebanon. He leaves for Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, later Sunday.
	   Syria ``supports an active and engaged European role'' in the
region, he said.
	   Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been stalled since early 1996.
Syria insists on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel says the
plateau is essential to its security.
	   Moratinos described U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to Israel
and the Palestinian territories as ``a historic visit.''
	   He said Clinton's visit will hopefully restore trust and
confidence between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   High pressure from the surface through the upper levels will
remain in control of our weather for one more day before a change
to increasing cloudiness and showers begins tonight and Monday.
	   The middle and upper levels of the atmosphere remain dry this
morning, leaving only moisture in the lowest few thousand feet of
the atmosphere to move across the area today.
	   This will produce a few clusters of low clouds with weak
embedded showers to move through the area this morning before
afternoon clearing occurs across most of the area.
	   A trough of low pressure across the Atlantic to our east the
past several days has begun to move into the eastern Caribbean
overnight and will move west across the Leeward Islands today and
into our area tonight.
	   This will cause a decrease in the trade winds, with increasing
cloudiness and scattered showers. Moisture will increase through
the middle levels of the atmosphere by Monday, and moderate to
briefly heavy rainfall will be possible by then.
	   Northeast winds of 20 to 25 knots will continue this morning
across portions of our Caribbean coastal waters before winds across
the region begin to subside this afternoon.
	   As the surface trough moves into the area tonight, wind will
become east and then east to southeast behind the trough on Monday.
This will allow coastal seas to smooth, particularly across the
Caribbean.
	   San Juan and the northern sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Today... Partly sunny in the morning with widely scattered
showers, becoming mostly sunny and breezy during the afternoon.
High around 85. Wind northeast 15 to 20 mph. Chance of rain is 20

Newspaper owned by Kenyan ruling party changes name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A company owned by President Daniel arap
Moi's ruling party Sunday unexpectedly changed the name of its
newspaper from Sunday Times to The Herald.
	   There had been no previous announcement of the name change and
the tabloid did not refer to itself. All telephone calls to the
newspaper's office at the headquarters of the Kenya African
National Union party in Nairobi were not answered.
	   KANU, which has ruled Kenya since independence from Britain in
1963, established the Kenya Times Media Trust in 1983 and publishes
a daily, The Kenya Times.
	   Although they have a monopoly of advertisement from the
government and state-owned corporation, the Kenya Times and The
Sunday Times are not considered a business success. The circulation
figures are unavailable because the newspaper group is not a member
of Audit Bureau of circulation.
	   The Herald will continue competition with the Nation Newspapers,
which also has daily and Sunday editions and has the highest
circulation in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The group also owns a
weakly, The EastAfrican.
	   The East African Standard, which started in 1902 and is the
oldest newspaper in Kenya also has a daily. Early this month, The
People, owned by opposition political leader Kenneth Matiba, also
changed from being a weekly to a daily, including Sunday.

Puerto Ricans vote on their century-old U.S. ties

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In a divisive election aimed at the
U.S. Congress, Puerto Ricans voted Sunday on whether to petition
for statehood in the country that colonized this Caribbean island
100 years ago.
	   An extremely close race, Sunday's referendum pitted statehood
advocates against defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S.
commonwealth, in which islanders are U.S. citizens but have no vote
in Washington.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot
soon after voting stations opened. Voting was to end at 3 p.m.
(1900 GMT) and initial results were expected after 6 p.m. (2200
GMT).
	   ``It's very important because today is the day that could decide
what Puerto Rico desires. We have to demonstrate to the federal
government what the people want'', said Juan Aponte, 40, a pharmacy
technician who worked until 2 a.m. but got up early to vote.
	   Polls put both causes virtually even in the election, and heavy
turnout was expected among 2.2 million registered voters. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the non-binding referendum.
	   Initial results were due Sunday evening.
	   Pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello called the referendum in hopes
of persuading Congress to end a colonial relationship that dates
from the 1898 U.S. occupation of Puerto Rico during the
Spanish-American War.
	   The opposition Popular Democratic Party sought to frustrate
those plans, supporting a ``none of the above'' protest option on
the ballot because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth
description.
	   Written by a legislature dominated by Rossello's statehood
party, the ballot says that under commonwealth, Congress can revoke
Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship. The commonwealth party maintains
that is not so, and that Rossello's party is trying to capitalize
on an unrealistic fear.
	   In the last non-binding referendum in 1993, commonwealth edged
statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.
	   Also listed as options on the ballot are independence, and a
``free association'' form of independence with U.S. treaty ties.
	   Under commonwealth, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with local
autonomy. Its 3.8 million residents can't vote for president or
Congress, which alone can change Puerto Rico's political status.
	   The U.S. Senate this year failed to act on legislation that
called for a binding series of votes designed to resolve the
contentious status debate.
	   Rossello, whose New Progressive Party controls the local
legislature, sought to present Congress with a mandate to pursue
statehood _ and eliminate what he calls Puerto Ricans' second-class
U.S. citizenship.
	   Noting that Congress has begun to question spending dlrs 10
billion a year in a territory that pays no federal taxes, he
insisted that statehood would raise the island's standard of living
_ and allow it to pay its fair share.
	   Puerto Rico's per-capita income of dlrs 8,000 a year is half
that of the poorest U.S. state, Mississippi.
	   Commonwealthers countered that statehood would destroy Puerto
Rico's culture and that English would supplant the Spanish
language. They argued that Puerto Ricans already have the best of
both worlds: U.S. citizenship and a fierce cultural independence.
	   Some in Congress have warned that commonwealth, adopted in 1952,
must eventually give way to either statehood or independence,
despite the Popular Democratic Party's support for greater autonomy
for Puerto Rico.
	   ``None of the above,'' said Democratic Representative Jose
Serrano of New York, would provide Congress little to work with.
	   ``Definitely, I am against (commonwealth) because it is
colonial,'' he said last week.

`Iron man's' son wins hammer throw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with track, weightlifting, wrestling, sailing, other
late medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ His father was dubbed Asia's ``iron
man'' after winning the hammer throw at five consecutive Asian
Games. Now Koji Murofushi has taken over the family business.
	   Murofushi won gold Sunday with a throw of 78.57 meters, beating
the 77.14 of Uzbekistan's Andrey Abduvaliev, who holds the Asian
record at 83.36. Kyrgyzstan's Nikolay Davydor took bronze with
68.10.
	   Thus the gold is back in the family after a 12-year break. The
winner's father, Shigenobu Murofushi, who was here watching, won in
1970, 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986.
	   China's iron women completed seven days of daily world records
in weightlifting as Ding Meiyuan set marks for the snatch and total
in the over 75-kilogram class.
	   Her 120 kilograms in the snatch broke the world record of 118.5
set by China's Zhang Nan in May, and her total of 270 beat the mark
of 267.5 set by China's Tang Gonghong in April. Aye Aye Aung of
Myanmar won the silver with a total of 252.5. Teammate Cui Wenhua
won in the men's 105-kilogram class.
	   Meanwhile, yachting gave Hong Kong and Singapore their first
gold medals of these games, although South Korea won gold in six of
the 16 divisions.
	   Windsurfer Lee Lai-Shan, who had given Hong Kong its only
Olympic gold medal ever in 1996, gave the territory only its second
at an Asian Games, and the first in 12 years.
	   South Korea's yachting triumphs were among 12 gold medals,
making it the big winner of the day and putting it ahead of
archrival Japan in the overall gold race.
	   China's nine for the day gave it 79 in all, South Korea had 36
and Japan had 31, after winning five Sunday _ three in track and
field and two in men's golf.
	   Tied at 14 were Taiwan, which added two in women's golf and one
in eight-ball pool Sunday, and Kazakstan, which added two in
Greco-Roman wrestling.
	   Thailand had 13 after winning three of the yachting divisions.
	   In track and field, some of the drama came in preliminaries.
	   World 200-meter silver medalist Susantika Jayasinghe, trying to
rebound from an investigation of drugs charges, said she pulled a
muscle in qualifying and was in doubt for the final of the
100-meter event.
	   Japan's Koji Ito jumped for joy after setting an Asian record of
10.00 seconds in the semifinals of the men's 100.
	   Ito's Japanese colleague Kenji Takao was just as excited after
winning gold at 10,000 meters by outsprinting Qatar's Ahmed Hashim
over the last 50 meters.
	   Japan had another gold from Yoko Ota in the women's high jump.
	   For China, which is expected to dominate track and field here,
Yo Guohui won the 20-kilometer walk, and Luan Zhili won the women's
discus.
	   South Korea's big collection for the day included victories in
the team dressage event of equestrian competition, two in the Asian
sport of softball tennis, two in Greco-Roman wrestling and one in
shooting.
	   South Korea also stayed unbeaten in baseball, drubbing Japan 9-2
with help from Lee Byung-kyu's two homers _ a grand slam and a solo
shot. It now will meet China in one semifinal Tuesday, with Japan
and Taiwan meeting in the other.
	   China's winnings included three golds in yachting, one in men's
saber fencing, and Zhou Xiaojing's triumph in all-around rhythmic
gymnastics.
	   In shooting, North and South Korea split the golds in men's
center-fire pistol competition.
	   Competition began in the South Asian sport of kabaddi, a sort of
team tag, with defending champion India beating Pakistan 17-9 in a
preliminary round game.
	   Meanwhile, Chinese weightlifting team manager Wei Di said the
women weightlifters have not shown their full strength, despite the
daily world records here.
	   ``They lift even heavier weights at home,'' said Wei.
	   ``We can eat more bitterness than foreigners,'' said Liu Xiuhua,
a petite lifter who set a snatch world record of 83.5 kilograms _

ASEAN ministers agree on `bold measures' to attract investment

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian foreign and economic
ministers said they had largely finished work Sunday on a plan of
action to tackle their financial crisis and draw investors back to
the region.
	   They then told lower-level officials to work out details as they
awaited approval from home of a batch of ``bold measures'' that
would cut into tax revenues in exchange for an effort to attract
investment and create new jobs.
	   The ministers said the measures will not be announced until
their leaders meet at the annual Association of Southeast Asian
Nations summit that starts with a dinner Monday night, followed by
formal talks Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   A draft of the measures, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires,
includes tariff cuts, investor incentives, duty-free status for
capital equipment, relaxed rules on foreign ownership of land on a
``best-effort'' basis, and speeded-up implementation of an ASEAN
Free Trade Area and ASEAN Investment Area.
	   Some of the measures would be put on a dual-track scenario that
would allow developing countries more time and leeway.
	   Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said officials passed
three documents in the morning _ including a final declaration and
a plan of action _ for endorsement by the ASEAN leaders.
	   But the centerpiece was the separate list of ``bold measures.''
Some are to take effect almost immediately in an effort to shore up
investor confidence and show the world the region is willing to
take tough action instead of just talking about it.
	   ``I feel it will put us back on the investment map again,''
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said. ``It will be too
difficult for investors in the West to refuse to take a hard look
at the opportunities that are here.''
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the economic
ministers understand this is the best time for liberal reforms and
integration within ASEAN, despite protectionist pressure from
domestic industries that want tariff increases.
	   ``We have all realized that we are all in this East Asia sea,
and when the tide rises, all the boats rise. When the tide goes
down, all the boats go down together,'' Siazon said.
	   As a result, ASEAN members want to work together to keep the
tide high as much of the time as possible, he said.
	   The land issue is sticky. The Philippines, for instance, has
constitutional restrictions on foreign ownership, while Vietnam
bans private ownership of land.
	   The measures were developed after the economic ministers told
senior officials, who had worked out the joint declaration and plan
of action earlier in the week, to bolster their proposals.
	   One goal is to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group of less-developed and rapidly
industrializing nations. But the region's economies already range
from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sun arrived Sunday for a state
visit and hoped to stay on for the summit, although it was
uncertain if it would be as an observer or as a full-fledged
member.
	   Whether to admit Cambodia has been a sticky issue for ASEAN. It
had been scheduled to join in July 1997, but its membership was put
on hold due to political turmoil. Agreement on a coalition
government was reached late last month.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Indonesian official says probe of Suharto's son proves anti-graft
</HEADLINE>
drive

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A move to name the son of former President
Suharto as a suspect in a corruption case proves the Indonesian
government is serious about cracking down on graft, Indonesian
foreign minister Ali Alatas said Sunday.
	   ``What we should read from (the investigation) is that the
government is determined to implement what it has promised to do:
namely to pursue policy that would try to get to the bottom of all
alleged cases of either corruption, collusion or nepotism,'' he
said.
	   ``The government is sincere and determined to implement what it
has promised to do,'' he said.
	   Prosecutors last week formally named Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala
Putra, the youngest son of former President Suharto, as a suspect
in a corruption case involving a shady land deal. Officials at the
attorney general's office say they are investigating a land deal
between the state logistics company Bulog and a company that had
been owned by Hutomo, in which the Indonesian government allegedly
lost millions of dollars.
	   Under Indonesian law, people are named as suspects after
preliminary questioning but before formal charges are filed in a
criminal case.
	   The development came days after prosecutors questioned the
ex-president in a separate investigation over allegations that he
had amassed a fortune during 32 years in power. Suharto, who
stepped down in May after a wave of protests and riots, has denied
any wrongdoing. But opponents allege that he abused his power to
build massive business empires for his six wealthy children.
	   Alatas said the investigation into Suharto himself must be based
on the rule of law and a presumption of innocence. Suharto has
pledged to cooperate with the attorney general's investigation.
Many are skeptical that the investigation will actually lead to the
conviction of Suharto, however, given that the government is
staffed with many holdovers from his era.
	   ``I don't know what will happen to him,'' Alatas said. ``He
hasn't resisted efforts to question him, he has submitted himself
to questioning by the public prosecutor. I think it's quite
interesting to see this happening in a country like Indonesia.''

Newsweek: Milosevic says NATO operation in Kosovo would be
</HEADLINE>
aggression &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Any attempt by a French-led NATO force to
move into Kosovo if fighting endangers international monitors in
the province would be considered an act of aggression, the Yugoslav
president was quoted by Newsweek as saying.
	   NATO is setting up a 1,700-member force in Macedonia to rescue
international personnel monitoring the October peace accord in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
	   In an interview with Newsweek and The Washington Post, Milosevic
said, ``if they come into our territory, we will consider it an act
of aggression.''
	   Asked whether the Yugoslav army would fight back, Milosevic
replied, ``That is the duty of our army, not to allow any foreign
troops to get into our territory.''
	   The NATO extraction force was created in the wake of U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the fighting
in Kosovo without airstrikes. The October truce was aimed at ending
the fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels
seeking independence.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 forced from
their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   Milosevic denied he had ever agreed to allow ``any foreign
military on the territory of Yugoslavia,'' including Kosovo.
	   ``If they want to have their forces in another country, we
cannot prohibit that,'' he said.
	   U.S. efforts to arrange direct talks between the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian politicians have bogged down, with both sides
rejecting four U.S. drafts on the future of the province.
	   In the interview, Milosevic claimed the diplomatic deadlock in
resolving the Kosovo crisis was caused by ``groups of Albanian
politicians who are Nazis.''
	   ``Their publicly declared aim is an ethnically pure state,'' he
said. Milosevic said the latest American plan, which both ethnic
Albanian and Serbs have rejected, ``favors the Albanians'' and
``has to be developed.''
	   ``Kosovo was always a region of Serbia and will always be part
of Serbia,'' he said. ``That region is populated by many different
national communities: Serbs, Montenegrin Albanians and others. The
approach of the Serbian government is that the national communities
living there have to be equal.''

	   REGGIO EMILIA, Italy (AP) _ Police on Sunday were searching for
clues in a late-night grenade attack on a bar that injured 11
people, the ANSA news agency said.
	   Two of the victims were seriously injured and required surgery,
the report said.
	   The newspaper La Repubblica said the attack was apparently
carried out by a group of four men, who fled on foot after lobbing
a grenade through a window of ``Il Pendolino'' bar in the northern
city of Reggio Emilia.
	   The bar is frequented by people from the southern province of
Calabria, home to the notorious 'ndrangheta crime organization, and
several reports speculated that the attack was part of a gang war.
	   Some said police believed the Saturday night bombing could have
been retaliation for the drive-by slaying on Tuesday of a
26-year-old Calabrian man who lived in Reggio Emilia.

British Liberal on fact-finding Kosovo mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain's Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democratic Party, met the head of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian negotiating team Sunday to discuss prospects for solving
the province's conflict through negotiations.
	   After meeting Fehmi Agani, Ashdown said he had come back to
Kosovo on a fact-finding mission and that the province is now ``at
least, in slightly better circumstances than before.''
	   Ashdown, who first visited the Albanian-majority province in
September, said he would also meet with a political representative
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla movement fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   The British MP also planned Monday to tour Kosovo's countryside
where he may talk with the rebels.
	   Ashdown said he would make recommendations to his government
after returning home.
	   Agani said the meeting Sunday was mostly ``informative'' and
that the ethnic Albanian side had elaborated to Ashdown on specific
points they disagree with on a U.S.-sponored draft proposal for
Kosovo.
	   On his previous visit to Kosovo, Ashdown witnessed columns of
refugees fleeing burned villages and condemned the ``excessive use
of force'' by the Serbian regime to crack down on Kosovo's
separatists.

 &UR; Eds: Includes background on rules for expulsion; Hodler's 1968
 &UR; Olympic scandal may cost IOC executive his job
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A powerful Olympic executive said
Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic
Committee for accusing some IOC members of taking bribes.
	   Marc Hodler, a Swiss IOC executive board member, insisted he
would not quit.
	   ``I don't resign,'' he said. ``But maybe I will be expelled. You
never know.''
	   Hodler, who made the accusations Saturday, said he has since
been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Hodler said he believed four agents _ including one IOC member _
had been involved in vote-buying the past 10 years. He said he
thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _ currently numbering 115
_ were open to bribery.
	   He said there is one agent who boasts ``that no city has ever
won the Olympic Games without his help.''
	   Hodler said Sunday that Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet.
He said he was told not to appear at a scheduled routine news
conference.
	   Surrounded by reporters, photographers and television cameras,
Hodler covered his mouth with both hands.
	   ``I don't have the right to say anything,'' he said. ``I'm not
to say anything by presidential orders _ nothing.''
	   Under Olympic rules, an IOC member can be expelled if he has
``betrayed his oath'' or ``neglected or knowingly jeopardized the
interests of the IOC or acted in a way which is unworthy of the
IOC.''
	   Expulsion requires a two-thirds majority vote of the full IOC
assembly. The next IOC session is scheduled for next June in Seoul,
South Korea.
	   Hodler was temporarily suspended from the IOC in 1968 by former
IOC president Avery Brundage in a dispute over professionalism.
Hodler supported the right of pro skiers to compete in the games,
while Brudage was opposed.
	   Hodler's comments came as the leader of the Salt Lake organizing
committee apologized Sunday for the alleged rules violations during
the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The IOC, meanwhile, said it was prepared to investigate claims
by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host cities.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee
apologized and accepted full responsibility for the controversial
scholarship program run by the group that won the bid for the
games.
	   The program provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other
assistance to 13 individuals _ including six relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   Hodler has used the word ``bribe'' to describe the fund. A
high-level IOC panel is investigating.
	   ``With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been
part of the bid campaign,'' Joklik said. ``At the same time, it is
important to remember that Salt Lake City won the bid on the
merits, and not because of this program.''
	   Joklik was chairman of the bidding committee at the time. The
scholarship program was under the direction of the former bid
president, Thomas Welch.
	   ``Although I was not aware of the program, I must accept
responsibility,'' Joklik said. ``I apologize to the Olympic family
and to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment caused by the bid
committee program.''
	   Joklik defended the program as helping young people from
developing countries to receive education and athletic training.
	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibly
appear to influence improperly the voting of IOC members.''
	   Joklik said the SLOC would cooperate fully with the IOC panel.
He added that the SLOC's independent ethics board would also review
the program.
	   ``I will not hesitate to implement whatever steps are necessary
.... to maintain the integrity of the games,'' Joklik said.
	   IOC officials declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions
might be taken against Salt Lake. But, for the first time, IOC vice
president Dick Pound in effect ruled out any possibility of the
games behind taken away from Utah.
	   Pound said the executive board expressed ``complete, repeat,
complete confidence'' in the organizing committee.
	   ``We are satisfied Salt Lake City won the 2002 games on the
merit of the bid,'' he said.
	   Pound said the Salt Lake inquiry would be broadened to include
investigation of Hodler's allegations that ``agents'' have
approached bidding cities soliciting bribes of up to dlrs 1 million
to procure votes of IOC members.
	   ``What were are concerned with is whether there may or may not
have been inappropriate conduct by some of our members or agents
involved in the bid process,'' Pound said.
	   ``We are aware there are agents and we are aware of the identity
of at least some of them,'' Pound said. ``What they've done or not
done, we don't know yet.''
	   Pound indicated the inquiry could be expanded to include
Hodler's charges that the selection of at least three other Olympic
cities had been affected by corruption _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan;
and Sydney, Australia.
	   ``One is never sure where the trail will lead,'' Pound said.
``At this moment, the focus is on Salt Lake City.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S.
President Bill Clinton called on Israel and the Palestinians Sunday
to use ``honest discussion,'' not violence, in dealing with their
differences over the Wye land-for-peace deal.
	   Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton
echoed Israel's concerns over violence and renewed his pledge to
ask Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion in special assistance to help
carry out the accord and security measures connected to it.
	   Netanyahu, in a warm tribute to Clinton, said no other leader
has shown more perseverance in seeking peace. But the prime
minister made clear that the Palestine National Council must
complete the voiding of anti-Israel provisions in the PLO charter
if the peace process is to regain momentum.
	   ``What we really expect is that the Palestinians honor their
commitments,'' Netanyahu said.
	   That process, he said, should begin with revoking the 1964
charter. ``It would be a welcome and positive development,'' he
said.
	   At a news conference, questions about the House Judiciary
Committee's approval Saturday of four articles of impeachment
against Clinton competed with those on the Mideast. At one point,
Netanyahu urged reporters to try to stay focused on the purpose of
Clinton's trip.
	   Clinton said he has no intention of resigning or admitting that
he perjured himself, as some Republicans in Congress have demanded.
``I cannot admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not
do,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said he was looking to Clinton, who helped arrange the
accords in October, to intercede with the Palestinians.
	   ``If there is anyone who can help bring the peace process to a
satisfactory conclusion, it is you,'' Netanyahu told Clinton.
	   Reflecting on the deep-seated distrust between Israel and the
Palestinians, Clinton said ``We can't overcome all that history,''
but the fact that there are difficulties in carrying out the Wye
accords makes them worth adopting.
	   ``In the end, there have been fundamental decisions made to deal
with this through honest discussion and negotiation,'' Clinton
said. ``That is the only way it can be done. It cannot be done by
resorting to other means when times get difficult.''
	   Later, in an interview on Fox TV, Netanyahu said it was unlikely
that Israel would make the troop withdrawal scheduled for Friday.
``It's very to see how we could do that,'' he said, in light of
continued Palestinian violence against Israelis.
	   On another touchy subject, Clinton declined to say whether he
would free Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. Navy analyst who is serving a
life sentence for providing Israel with sensitive information.
	   Clinton again said he had asked for recommendations from his
advisers.
	   But Netanyahu, acknowledging Pollard had ``done something bad,''
nonetheless urged that Pollard be released on humanitarian grounds.
	   Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday in the Gaza Strip, where he will be welcomed with the
trappings of a state visit. The visit, which includes an address to
the Palestinian National Council, is seen by some as a boost for
Palestinian statehood.
	   ``It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state,''
Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council,
said in an interview Sunday.
	   At sundown, Clinton went to the home of Israeli President Ezer
Weizman, to light the first candle on a menorah at a Hanukkah
celebration. ``On this occasion, you celebrate not simply a long
week of happiness, but thousands of years of triumph over
adversity,'' Clinton said.
	   Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the
Clinton visit. At the hotel where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen
were posted to guard the president and his 600-member delegation.
	   There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school
student was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   In remarks at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night,
Netanyahu said the peace process is in danger.
	   ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking in Hebrew, ``The
truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians again
constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to
forgo fulfillment of those commitments.''
	   Netanyahu, who is facing a no-confidence vote within two weeks,
said he could not accept ``a phony peace on paper'' which is ``not
honored in practice.''
	   Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in
October, the land-for-security agreement has hit one snag after
another. Israel froze implementation of the accord altogether,
accusing Arafat of violating the deal and inciting violent street
protests.
	   Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals
until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the
Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over the release of
Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails for militant or
political acts against the Jewish state.

Newsweek: Milosevic says NATO operation in Kosovo would be
</HEADLINE>
aggression &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Any attempt by a French-led NATO force to
move into Kosovo if fighting endangers international monitors in
the province would be considered an act of aggression, the Yugoslav
president was quoted by Newsweek as saying.
	   NATO is setting up a 1,700-member force in Macedonia to rescue
international personnel monitoring the October peace accord in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
	   In an interview in the Dec. 21 issue of Newsweek, Milosevic
said, ``if they come into our territory, we will consider it an act
of aggression.''
	   Asked whether the Yugoslav army would fight back, Milosevic
replied, ``That is the duty of our army, not to allow any foreign
troops to get into our territory.''
	   The NATO extraction force was created in the wake of U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the fighting
in Kosovo without airstrikes. The October truce was aimed at ending
the fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels
seeking independence.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 forced from
their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   Milosevic denied he had ever agreed to allow ``any foreign
military on the territory of Yugoslavia,'' including Kosovo.
	   ``If they want to have their forces in another country, we
cannot prohibit that,'' he said.
	   U.S. efforts to arrange direct talks between the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian politicians have bogged down, with both sides
rejecting four U.S. drafts on the future of the province.
	   In the interview, Milosevic claimed the diplomatic deadlock in
resolving the Kosovo crisis was caused by ``groups of Albanian
politicians who are Nazis.''
	   ``Their publicly declared aim is an ethnically pure state,'' he
said. Milosevic said the latest American plan, which both ethnic
Albanian and Serbs have rejected, ``favors the Albanians'' and
``has to be developed.''
	   ``Kosovo was always a region of Serbia and will always be part
of Serbia,'' he said. ``That region is populated by many different
national communities: Serbs, Montenegrin Albanians and others. The
approach of the Serbian government is that the national communities
living there have to be equal.''

Japan nationalizes ailing bank for second time in postwar era

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government took over the operations of
a major bank hobbled by bad loans on Sunday, overriding objections
from bank executives who insisted Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. was not
insolvent.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marks only the
second time since World War II that a top lender has come under
state control. In October, the government took over the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. when a huge burden of bad loans
threatened to sink it.
	   ``I have decided to place the bank under special public
management from today,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi announced in
statement.
	   The government took control of Nippon Credit after financial
authorities declared the bank insolvent with at least 3.2 trillion
yen (dlrs 27 billion) in unrecoverable or high-risk loans and
massive stock valuation losses.
	   Nippon Credit, with 2,000 employees, was among the world's top
50 banks in 1997, according to Fortune magazine, with assets
totaling 12.3 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion).
	   The widely expected move to nationalize the bank was the latest
act in a drama which began early last week when Japan's Chuo Trust
and Banking Co. denied reports it was considering a buyout of
Nippon Credit.
	   Prime Minister Obuchi said the action was taken to safeguard
depositors and shore up confidence in the Japanese financial
system.
	   ``The government will continue to do whatever is needed to
protect depositors and credit markets, and ensure the stability of
financial markets at home and abroad,'' Obuchi said.
	   On Friday, the Financial Supervisory Agency had determined that
the bank could not restructure on its own and moved to pull the
plug. But Nippon Credit executives balked at a government request
on Saturday that they voluntarily apply for nationalization.
	   Following an extraordinary board meeting, Nippon Credit
submitted a petition to the government early Sunday contesting the
Financial Supervisory Agency's assessment of its balance sheet.
	   But the last minute appeal failed.
	   Bank executives who oppose the nationalization have argued that
the agency's standards for judging loan risks were too strict. They
may also have feared a government takeover because the law requires
top managers of nationalized banks to resign.
	   Nippon Credit President Shigeoki Togo told a press conference
Sunday evening that the bank was ``not satisfied'' with the
government's decision but that it had no choice but to accept it.
	   All of the bank's top executives would resign to make room for
the government-appointed managers, Togo said.
	   Many of the problem loans which hurt Nippon Credit were made by
subsidiaries which extended easy credit to real estate developers
during a speculative land price boom in the late 1980s. These debts
quickly soured at the outset of this decade with the collapse of
Japan's so-called ``bubble'' economy.
	   Nippon Credit, one of Japan's three so-called long-term credit
banks, was also fatally wounded by its inability to evolve from a
traditional role as a supplier of long-term loans to industry.
	   Deregulation and development of Japan's financial markets has
allowed companies to raise money more cheaply by issuing bonds and
selling equity, thus reducing demand for bank loans.
	   The government was expected to announce plans shortly for buying
all outstanding shares of Nippon Credit. But because the bank has
been declared insolvent, current shareholders are unlikely to
receive much, if any, compensation.
	   That would result in big losses for major shareholders such as
Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Nippon Life Insurance Co.
Another loser would be Bankers Trust Corp., the New York-based
investment bank acquired last month by Deutsche Bank AG.
	   In September of 1997, Bankers Trust said it bought dlrs 10
million worth of Nippon Credit stock to cement a tie-up with the
Japanese bank. It had planned to gradually raise its equity stake
in Nippon Credit to about 4 percent within three years.
	   But Japan's leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai, reported
Sunday that NCB will dissolve the strategic alliance with Bankers
Trust following its nationalization.

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ British swimmers Mark Foster in the
50-meter freestyle and James Hickman in the 100 butterfly turned in
world records Sunday in preliminary heats of the European
short-course swimming championships.
	   The Swedish 200-meter men's medley relay also posted a new world
mark in Sunday's heats.
	   That brought to nine the number of new world short-course
records set with the three-day meet ending Sunday.
	   Foster clocked 21.48 seconds, surpassing the old record of 21.50
by Russian Alex Popov. Hickman clocked 51.02, bettering Australian
Michael Klim's old time of 51.07.
	   The Swedish relay clocked a new world mark of 1:36.24.
	   On Saturday, Milos Milosevic of Croatia, Martina Moravcova of
Slovakia and the Netherlands' 200 men's relay set world records.
	   Milosevic swam 23.30 seconds to win the 50-meter butterfly,
breaking the old world record of 23.35 set by Russian Denis
Pankratov.
	   Moravcova won the 100 individual medley in 1:00.43, topping the
old record of 1:00.60 by China's Xiaowen Hu Chn. Moracvoca also set
a European record of 57.72 in winning the 100-meter butterfly.
	   The other mark went to the Dutch men, clocking a time of 1:26.99
in the 200 relay.
	   On Friday, Germans Mark Warnecke and Thomas Rupprath set world
records. Warnecke won gold in a record time of 26.70 seconds in the
50-meter breaststroke, and Rupprath clocked 24.13 in winning the
50-meter backstroke. The German womens' 200 freestyle relay also
set a world mark of 1:39.56.

Body of missing Iranian writer found, daughter says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with judiciary blaming foreign power
for killings &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian writer missing since last week
has been found dead, his daughter said Sunday. He is the fifth
critic of the hard-line clerical regime to die in mysterious
circumstances.
	   Iran's judiciary, controlled by the hard-liners, blamed unnamed
foreigners for the killings while a group of lawmakers accused an
exiled Iranian opposition organization.
	   The latest victim is Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old
writer and translator, who had been missing since last Wednesday.
	   His body was found Thursday, apparently strangled to death,
Pouyandeh's daughter, 17-year-old Nazanin, said. No personal
belongings including his watch were missing, she said.
	   Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, said the
killings are aimed at tarnishing the image of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who is locked in a power struggle with
conservative clergymen opposed to his political and social reforms.
	   Khatami's efforts had emboldened many free-thinkers in Iran such
as Pouyandeh.
	   But that has also angered the hard-liners, who control nearly
all key institutions, including the security forces, the
intelligence network and the office of the supreme leader, who has
the last say on all matters.
	   The daily Akhbar newspaper quoted Tajzadeh as saying that a
number of arrests had been made and ``some clues'' have been found.
He said a special committee is investigating. He did not elaborate.
	   He described the killings as a conspiracy to make ``things
bitter for the people, at a time that the system is moving toward
political development.''
	   Pouyandeh's daughter said the family identified his body late
Saturday after being notified by the police.
	   ``I have lost all hope. I don't know who will die next, but I
hope that my father was the last victim of these slayings,'' she
told The Associated Press.
	   Ali Abbasi-Fard, the spokesman of Iran's judiciary, said Sunday
it appears that a ``sinister and organized movement is using agents
affiliated to foreign elements to undermine social stability and to
create fear throughout the society.''
	   In a joint letter to Khatami, 140 of Iran's 270 Parliament
members accused the Iraq-based opposition Mujahedeen Khalq and
unspecified foreign intelligence services of carrying out the
killings.
	   ``Those masterminding such conspiracies are trying to suggest
that insecurity is prevailing in Iran,'' the letter said.
	   In the past two weeks, four other government critics, including
two writers, have been found dead.
	   One of them, Mohammad Mokhtari, was possibly strangled,
according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Majid Sharif,
another writer also went missing and was found dead. The head of an
Iranian opposition group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh,
were found stabbed to death in their home last month.
	   Over the past year, the hard-liners have resorted to increasing
violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Nobody has been
charged in any of the attacks.

	   HOCHFILZEN, Austria (AP) _ Oleg Ryzhenkov of Belarus shot
perfectly to beat Olympic champion Ole Einar Bjoerndalen of Norway
in a biathlon World Cup 20-kilometer race Sunday.
	   Ryzhenkov clocked 53 minutes, 0.9 seconds to clinch his third
career World Cup victory.
	   Bjoerndalen, last season's World Cup champion and leader after
three events this season, was penalized two minutes for missing two
targets on the shooting range. His time was 53:23.0.
	   Ivan Masarik of the Czech Republic was third in 53:56.2, also
after perfect shooting.
	   German veteran Uschi Disl won the women's 15-kilometer event,
overcoming a one-minute penalty for a winning time of 45:35.7.
	   World Cup leader Magdalena Forsberg was second in 47:23.1, with
two penalty minutes.
	   Corinne Niogret of France was third in 47:46.5, also with two
penalty minutes.

Pinochet realizes he may be in Britain for at a year, says aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet now realizes he could be in
Britain for at least a year fighting extradition to Spain, but he
is optimistic he will go home again, a close friend of the former
Chilean dictator said Sunday.
	   ``At the moment I think he is not depressed,'' Peter Schaad,
coordinator of a campaign to free Pinochet, said in an interview on
Sky TV.
	   ``He is optimistic in the middle-term he will be able to go back
to Chile,'' added Schaad. ``... We all understand this could take a
year or more.''
	   Meanwhile, a London newspaper, Sunday Business, said Chile in
protest at Pinochet's arrest has pulled out of a 100 million pound
(dlrs 168 million) deal to buy bridge-layers and other support
equipment for a tank regiment.
	   Vickers PLC, the company reportedly in line for most of the
contract, could not be contacted for comment Sunday.
	   The 83-year-old general was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while
recuperating from back surgery during one of his regular visits to
Britain. A Spanish extradition warrant alleged murder, torture and
other heinous crimes by secret police during 1973-1990 rule.
	   Pinochet, in a wheelchair and looking dour, appeared in court on
Friday for a routine bail hearing following a Dec. 9 ruling by Home
Secretary Jack Straw that extradition proceedings can start.
	   Pinochet is under police guard at a rented mansion, Wentworth,
20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   Earlier, Schaad denied a report in a London tabloid, The Sunday
Mirror, quoting Pinochet of accusing the British government of
``treason'' for allowing his arrest and the extradition
proceedings.
	   ``I wouldn't put it that strongly but he feels very, very bitter
about what happened to him since Oct. 16, considering the close
cooperation between the two countries historically, especially
during the Falklands war,'' Schaad told the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``He feels confused ... he feels bitter about the treatment
in this country.''
	   Pinochet, who took power by overthrowing an elected Marxist, was
the only Latin American leader to support Margaret Thatcher, then
Britain's Conservative Party prime minister, during her 1982 war to
reclaim the Falkland Islands from Argentine invaders.
	   The Conservatives, now replaced by Prime Minister Tony Blair's
Labor Party government, on Sunday stepped up demands to send
Pinochet home.
	   Chile wants him back, partly because of the divided reactions to
his arrest. Under political compromises, Pinochet has immunity in
Chile and was commander-in-chief of the army until March.
	   Britain and Spain have no right to dictate to Chile about
political deals, particularly as Britain is releasing convicted
Irish Republican Army terrorists from jail under a peace agreement
in Northern Ireland, said Douglas Hurd, a former foreign secretary.
	   ``We are playing with explosives in their (Chile's) house,''
added Hurd. ``We're letting out (IRA) murderers ... and there's a
good reason for that. We are interested in reconciliation.''

Survivors blame pilot for crash of Thai Airways jet liner

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Caskets containing 40 of the 101
victims of a Thai Airways jetliner crash were loaded on a C-130
transport plane Sunday for the grim voyage back to Bangkok as
questions arose about the safety of Surat Thani airport.
	   Later in the day, 15 of the 45 injured survivors boarded another
plane to the capital to seek medical treatment.
	   Many of the survivors blamed the pilot of the A310-200 for the
crash which killed 101 people on board, but an official
investigation into the tragedy has just begun and government
officials cautioned against rushing to judgment.
	   Flight TG261 slammed into a flooded rubber plantation during a
heavy rainstorm Friday evening as it made a third attempt to land
at Surat Thani, a port and fishing village that serves as a gateway
to several resort islands popular with foreign tourists.
	   Control tower personnel insisted all their systems had been
functioning at the time of the disaster and said it was solely the
pilot's decision to attempt another landing.
	   But a Thai Airways official in Surat Thani, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the airport's instrument landing
system, normally used to guide aircraft in, had been removed during
a runway expansion several months ago.
	   That meant the pilot would have had to land based only on what
he could see of the runway, or possibly with radio navigation aids
less precise than an instrument landing system.
	   ILS systems make it possible for airliners to land in poor
visibility. Many airports lack ILS systems, but that limits the
kind of weather in which airliners can land safely.
	   Diverting to another airport would presuppose that there was
another airport with acceptable weather conditions that the plane
could reach with the fuel it had aboard.

Clerides says no change in plans for missiles deployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on
Sunday insisted that he will deploy as planned the Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles, which Turkey has threatened to block by
force.
	   ``There has been no change in the situation,'' Clerides told
reporters on his return from the Vienna summit meeting of the
European Union's existing and prospective members.
	   He said the missile issue was not raised during the meeting.
	   The warning by longtime enemy Turkey to prevent the missile
deployment has dragged Greece into the row: under a joint defense
agreement with Cyprus, Greece is obliged to defend it from Turkey.
	   Clerides has refused to reveal the missiles' arrival date,
though this is expected within the next few weeks.
	   U.S. presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke and his deputy, State
Department Cyprus coordinator Thomas Miller, are in the region to
defuse the crisis.
	   Clerides said he has not had any contact with the two officials
for the past fortnight.
	   He reiterated his willingness to postpone the missile deployment
``if there is substantive progress'' on his proposal to
demilitarize Cyprus, something rejected by Turkey, and if there is
a resumption of the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of
the island.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized
its northern third in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The reunification talks collapsed in 1997 when the Turkish side
objected to Greek Cyprus' attempts to join the EU.

Clinton says he will not resign under pressure of impeachment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES thruout with congressional reaction, edits to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, dogged by the
impeachment drama at the outset of his Middle East trip, said
Sunday that he has ``no intention of resigning'' in the face of
House Judiciary Committee approval of four articles of impeachment.
	   ``It's never crossed my mind,'' a grim-faced Clinton said in
response to a question from an Israeli reporter at a news
conference with Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The president, who issued a fresh apology for the Monica
Lewinsky affair on Friday, said he would not admit to having
committed perjury.
	   ``I did not commit perjury,'' Clinton asserted. The testimony in
which his Republican accusers say he lied was ``difficult and
ambiguous and unhelpful,'' the president said, but not perjurious.
	   ``I could not admit to doing something that I am quite sure I
did not do,'' Clinton said.
	   He stressed that four legal experts who testified in his defense
before the Judiciary Committee agreed that he had not committed
perjury.
	   The four ``went through the law in great detail and explained
that it is not a perjury case,'' Clinton said, and the Republican
members of the committee made ``no credible argument'' to counter
that testimony.
	   Three moderate Republicans, officially undecided, said Clinton's
remarks Sunday were not enough.
	   ``It doesn't help us, those of us who are looking for a way to
be able to get through this constitutional crisis, really looking
to Bill Clinton to help us in this quest,'' Rep. Brian Bilbray,
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' He said he thought that Clinton
should have used the opportunity to admit he lied under oath.
	   W.J. Tauzin and Scott Klug, also appearing on NBC, agreed.
	   Clinton said he would not telephone members of the House to
lobby against impeachment but that he would make himself available
to those who wanted to discuss the matter with him. Two House
Republicans are in a congressional delegation that is traveling
with Clinton.
	   ``I think it's important that they be free to make this decision
and that they not be put under any undue pressure from any
quarter,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton said he was not surprised that the Judiciary Committee
voted to send four articles of impeachment to the full House for
votes this week.
	   ``I think it's been obvious to anyone who's following it for
weeks that that vote was foreordained and now it is up to the
members of the House of Representatives to vote their conscience on
the Constitution and the law, which I believe are clear,'' the
president said.
	   As reporters pressed Clinton on several aspects of the
impeachment drama, Netanyahu interceded to urge questions about the
Middle East peace process _ the purpose for Clinton's trip. ``You
are free to ask any one of your questions, but I think the
president has come here on a very clear message, on a very clear
voyage of peace,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, House Majority Whip Tom Delay, who is leading the
drive for impeachment on the House floor, said the process had
destroyed Clinton's credibility to conduct foreign policy.
	   ``I'm suggesting that the president of the United States cannot
be believed, and I think it's reflective in his foreign policy.
Saddam Hussein knows it, and that's why he jerks his chain all the
time,'' Delay said on NBC, referring to the leader of Iraq.
	   Clinton, asked about Republican opposition to a formal censure
as an alternative to impeachment, indicated that their reluctance
may indicate a fear that such a resolution could pass the full
House.
	   ``Apparently somewhere around three-quarters of the American
people think that's the right thing to do,'' Clinton said.
	   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde acknowledged
Sunday that the Republican drive to impeach the president ``makes
us look like we are kind of strange and out of step with the
mainstream.'' But he said ``we take our duty seriously as a matter
of conscience.''
	   Hyde, who spoke on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' led his committee
Republicans in rejecting a Democratic attempt to bring a censure
motion to the House floor.
	   Later, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters
that the impeachment issue was not distracting Clinton or limiting
his effectiveness.
	   ``Obviously, this is something that he has on his mind, that he
is concerned about,'' Lockhart said of the impeachment problem.
``But I think it's a testament to the reasons that the public has
continued to support him ... that he continues to focus on the
job.''

Late Weah goal puts AC Milan in second
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ George Weah, the Liberian striker, fired in the
winner with six minutes left Sunday as 10-man AC Milan overcame
Vicenza 1-0 and vaulted into second place in Serie A.
	   Milan took full advantage of the 1-1 draw between AC Parma and
AS Roma, clubs that had entered the day tied for second in the
standings. Parma took the lead on Argentine striker Hernan Crespo's
first-half goal, and Roma finally broke down Italy's toughest
defense to tie the score on substitute Carmine Gautieri's goal in
the 62nd.
	   Weah, starting to regain the form that earned him World,
European and African Player of the Year awards in 1995, turned home
a low cross from German forward Oliver Bierhoff from 8 meters
(yards) out to give Milan its third win in four games.
	   Before the late goal, Milan looked headed for a draw at best,
having seen midfielder Massimo Ambrosini sent off in the 72nd
minute with two yellow cards.
	   Weah's successor as FIFA Player of the Year, two-time winner
Ronaldo, also came through with a decisive late strike, hitting the
target off Roberto Baggio's assist with seven minutes remaining to
lift Internazionale of Milan past Udinese 1-0. The Brazilian star
has battled knee tendinitis all season, but has scored in four of
the six league games he has managed to play for the Champions Cup
quarterfinalists.
	   The results left Milan (7-3-3) with 24 points, one behind leader
Fiorentina, which hosted two-time defending league champions
Juventus of Turin later Sunday.
	   Roma and Parma are next with 23 points, two ahead of
Internazionale.
	   Lazio of Rome is in sixth place, with 20 points, after routing
Sampdoria of Genoa 5-2. Lazio's Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic
recorded a rare hat-trick _ all the goals came off free kicks _
while both of Sampdoria's goals were penalty kicks by Francesco
Palmieri.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Perugia beat Cagliari 2-1 in a game that saw
both clubs score in injury time, Bari edged Empoli 2-1, Bologna and
Salernitana drew 1-1, and relegation battlers Venezia and Piacenza
drew 0-0.

Pinochet realizes he may be in Britain for a year, says aide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet now realizes he could be in
Britain for at least a year fighting extradition to Spain, but he
is optimistic he will go home again, a close friend of the former
Chilean dictator said Sunday.
	   ``At the moment I think he is not depressed,'' Peter Schaad,
coordinator of a campaign to free Pinochet, said in an interview on
Sky TV.
	   ``He is optimistic in the middle-term he will be able to go back
to Chile,'' added Schaad. ``... We all understand this could take a
year or more.''
	   Meanwhile, a London newspaper, Sunday Business, said Chile in
protest at Pinochet's arrest has pulled out of a 100 million pound
(dlrs 168 million) deal to buy bridge-layers and other support
equipment for a tank regiment.
	   Vickers PLC, the company reportedly in line for most of the
contract, could not be contacted for comment Sunday.
	   The 83-year-old general was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while
recuperating from back surgery during one of his regular visits to
Britain. A Spanish extradition warrant alleged murder, torture and
other heinous crimes by secret police during 1973-1990 rule.
	   Pinochet, in a wheelchair and looking dour, appeared in court on
Friday for a routine bail hearing following a Dec. 9 ruling by Home
Secretary Jack Straw that extradition proceedings can start.
	   Pinochet is under police guard at a rented mansion, Wentworth,
20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   Earlier, Schaad denied a report in a London tabloid, The Sunday
Mirror, quoting Pinochet of accusing the British government of
``treason'' for allowing his arrest and the extradition
proceedings.
	   ``I wouldn't put it that strongly but he feels very, very bitter
about what happened to him since Oct. 16, considering the close
cooperation between the two countries historically, especially
during the Falklands war,'' Schaad told the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``He feels confused ... he feels bitter about the treatment
in this country.''
	   Pinochet, who took power by overthrowing an elected Marxist, was
the only Latin American leader to support Margaret Thatcher, then
Britain's Conservative Party prime minister, during her 1982 war to
reclaim the Falkland Islands from Argentine invaders.
	   The Conservatives, now replaced by Prime Minister Tony Blair's
Labor Party government, on Sunday stepped up demands to send
Pinochet home.
	   Chile wants him back, partly because of the divided reactions to
his arrest. Under political compromises, Pinochet has immunity in
Chile and was commander-in-chief of the army until March.
	   Britain and Spain have no right to dictate to Chile about
political deals, particularly as Britain is releasing convicted
Irish Republican Army terrorists from jail under a peace agreement
in Northern Ireland, said Douglas Hurd, a former foreign secretary.
	   ``We are playing with explosives in their (Chile's) house,''
added Hurd. ``We're letting out (IRA) murderers ... and there's a
good reason for that. We are interested in reconciliation.''

	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ British swimmers Mark Foster in the
50-meter freestyle and James Hickman in the 100 butterfly turned in
world records Sunday in preliminary heats of the European
short-course swimming championships.
	   That brought to six the number of new world records in the
three-day meet. In addition, the Swedish 200-meter men's medley
relay also posted a new world-best in Sunday's heats. It was the
third world-best in the little-swum relays as the meet ended
Sunday.
	   Foster clocked 21.48 seconds, surpassing the old record of 21.50
by Russian Alex Popov set in 1994. Hickman clocked 51.02, bettering
Australian Michael Klim's old time of 51.07 set in January of this
year.
	   The Swedish relay clocked a world best of 1:36.24.
	   On Saturday, Milos Milosevic of Croatia, Martina Moravcova of
Slovakia and the Netherlands' 200 men's relay set world records.
	   Milosevic swam 23.30 seconds to win the 50-meter butterfly,
breaking the old world record of 23.35 set by Russian Denis
Pankratov.
	   Moravcova won the 100 individual medley in 1:00.43, topping the
old record of 1:00.60 by China's Xiaowen Hu Chn. Moracvoca also set
a European record of 57.72 in winning the 100-meter butterfly.
	   The other mark went to the Dutch men, clocking a world-best of
1:26.99 in the 200 relay.
	   On Friday, Germans Mark Warnecke and Thomas Rupprath set world
records. Warnecke won gold in a record time of 26.70 seconds in the
50-meter breaststroke, and Rupprath clocked 24.13 in winning the
50-meter backstroke. The German womens' 200 freestyle relay also
set a world-best of 1:39.56.

	   NAGANO, Japan (AP) _ A minor mishap kept Olympic gold medalist
speedskater Catriona LeMay Doan from sweeping the women's sprints
Sunday but helped yield a new star, Tonny de Jong of the
Netherlands.
	   In the 1,000-meter event at the Nagano World Cup speedskating
competition, LeMay Doan was forced to slow down to let Eriko
Sanmiya of Japan switch into the outside lane.
	   Sanmiya admitted she was at fault.
	   ``It happened either because I was too slow as the starter on
the inside lane or Catriona was too fast and almost caught me up at
the switching point,'' said Sanmiya, who was seeking her fourth
silver in two days.
	   ``I feel very sorry that it might have cost her a medal,'' she
added.
	   Going into the race, LeMay Doan seemed a good bet to take all
four women's golds.
	   Earlier in the second day of the two-day event, she won the 500
meters after winning both races on the first day.
	   After the setback, LeMay Doan finished fifth in 1 minute, 18.88
seconds, 0.97 second off the pace. Sanmiya was 16th with an
unimpressive time of 1:19.94.
	   Tonny de Jong, a 5,000-meter specialist from the Netherlands,
set her personal best of 1:17.91 for the gold in her second
competition in a World Cup 1,000 meters. In her maiden contest
Saturday, she placed seventh in 1:18.89.
	   ``I didn't expect to win although my trainer said I might have a
good chance if I make a good start,'' said de Jong, winner of
several World Cup 3,000 and 5,000 meters in the 1996-1997 season.
	   ``I myself was surprised even though my sprint has improved a
lot in the past year owing to new team coach Peter Muller,'' said
the 24-year-old de Jong.
	   Still, the Canadians won their fourth overall gold, thanks, in
large part, to the 27-year-old LeMay Doan.
	   And no complaint was filed by the Canadians with the organizers
over the mishap with the Japanese skater.
	   ``When I apologized to Catriona after the race, she told me not
to worry. ``Don't worry. No problem,'' she said apparently trying
to comfort me,'' Sanmiya said.
	   On Saturday, the Canadian star skated 1:18.07 for the gold in
the 1,000 meters. Sanmiya posted a time of 1:19.49 for the silver.
	   Jeremy Wotherspoon took the men's 500 meters after Olympic gold
medalist and world-record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu of Japan fell
while negotiating a corner.
	   Shimizu, winner of the event Saturday, had the day's fastest lap
time of 9.64 seconds for the first 100 meters before he fell and
slammed into the protective wall. Shimizu suffered minor contusion
on the elbow and the buttock, his staff said.
	   His race partner in the final twosome, Wotherspoon, sped alone
to victory in 35.85 seconds. The Canadian was the silver medalist
Friday.
	   Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos gave the Netherlands the day's
fourth gold with a victory in the men's 1,000 meters. He also won
the event on Saturday.
	   Bos said the Netherlands, long a powerhouse in long-distance
races, is now putting as much emphasis on shorter races under the
influence and program of Mueller, an American coach the country
hired one and a half years ago.
	   ``From the beginning it started well for the team and he has a
really good program,'' said the 22-year-old Bos. ``He has built a
team of harmony and good atmosphere _ we have a lot of fun together
_ and we train very hard.''
	   With Muller at the helm, the Dutch excelled in both the long
distances and sprints in the Nagano Olympics in February. They won
five of the 10 races at M-Wave Arena and would up with 11 medals
overall.
	   Casey Fitzrandolph won the day's lone medal for the U.S. team as
he placed second behind Wotherspoon in the 500 in 35.95.
	   ``We are happy with that,'' said American team coach David
Besteman, who was hired in August. ``Fitzrandolph has focused more
on 500 meters and 1,000 meters, and he had a good result in the 500
today.
	   ``In this World Cup Chris Witty is a little bit under the
weather from her virus earlier this week so she has definitely lost
some power.''
	   Witty, Olympic silver medalist in the 1,000 meters and the
bronze medalist in the 500 meters, won a bronze in the 500 meters
Saturday. On Sunday, she was 11th in the 1,000 meters and 17th in
the 500.
	   The two-day event at M-Wave was the first of five short-race
World Cups for the 1998-1999 season. Two rounds of 500- and
1,000-meter competition were staged both for women and men.
	   In all, Canada won seven medals, host Japan six, the Netherlands
five, Germany three, and the United States two. Russia and Norway
each had a bronze medal.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In a divisive election aimed at the
U.S. Congress, Puerto Ricans voted Sunday on whether to petition
for statehood in the country that colonized this Caribbean island
100 years ago.
	   An extremely close race, Sunday's referendum pitted statehood
advocates against defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S.
commonwealth, in which islanders are U.S. citizens but have no vote
in Washington.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot
soon after voting stations opened. Voting was to end at 3 p.m.
(1900 GMT) and initial results were expected after 6 p.m. (2200
GMT).
	   ``It's very important because today is the day that could decide
what Puerto Rico desires. We have to demonstrate to the federal
government what the people want'', said Juan Aponte, 40, a pharmacy
technician who worked until 2 a.m. but got up early to vote.
	   Polls put both causes virtually even in the election, and heavy
turnout was expected among 2.2 million registered voters. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the non-binding referendum.
	   ``We have seen over the years a decrease in support for
commonwealth status,'' pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello said when
he voted. In the last non-binding referendum, in 1993, commonwealth
edged out statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.
	   Rossello called Sunday's referendum in hopes of persuading
Congress to end a colonial relationship that dates from the 1898
U.S. occupation of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War.
	   The opposition Popular Democratic Party sought to frustrate
those plans, supporting a ``none of the above'' protest option on
the ballot because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth
description.
	   ``We are very happy with our commonwealth, and we want to keep
it,'' the party's San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon said when she voted.
``Today, we Puerto Rican people are asserting our identity, our
love for commonwealth, our love of our U.S. citizenship.''

Vicious far right fracture could change French politics

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The ``bete noir'' of French politics, the
extreme-right National Front, is on the verge of imploding in a
vicious public spectacle, and its enemies are lapping up the
name-calling and low blows like juicy gossip.
	   The demise of the National Front in its current form would
amount to a small earthquake on the French political landscape,
pummeled for nearly 15 years by the divisive power of the party
accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   A week after the National Front erupted in crisis, with bitter
feuding between its top two figures _ charismatic leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen and former No. 2 man Bruno Megret _ the schism appeared all
but complete.
	   The question was who, if anyone, might profit from an eventual
splintering of the far right without committing political suicide.
	   The National Front has long been considered a political pariah
but proved a magnet for voters dissatisfied with the traditional
right.
	   The anti-immigration party has for years garnered 15 percent of
the vote in elections, local, regional and national, bolstering the
left while robbing votes from the right, which was brought to its
knees in 1997 legislative elections.
	   With European Parliamentary elections seven months away, the
possible disintegration of the National Front means unexpected
complications. Politicians watched cautiously.
	   Le Pen fears Megret is out to unseat him and has publicly called
his followers ``traitors'' and accused them of ``racism'' and
``extremism'' _ labels usually pinned on Le Pen himself.
	   Megret shares the same ideological ground as Le Pen, but has
strived to dilute the stigma attached to the party.
	   It is widely assumed the National Front will split into two
groups. According to the scenario laid out in the press, Le Pen
would head a reduced party, keeping the National Front name. Megret
would start up a new party.
	   The French media relished recounting the divorce between the
flamboyant, silver-haired Le Pen, at 70 still a fiery orator, and
Megret, an understated technocrat of 47. Some of the meanest scenes
were played out before television cameras.
	   At a rally Friday in Metz, Le Pen compared himself to Julius
Caesar and Megret to Brutus, the adopted son who slew the Roman
emperor.
	   ``But what differentiates me from Caesar,'' Le Pen said, ``as
Brutus approaches, knife in hand ... is that I pull out my sword
and kill Brutus before he kills me.''
	   Le Pen fired Megret from his post of general delegate after the
crisis exploded 10 days ago, and, on Friday, suspended him and four
allies from the party after they called for an extraordinary
congress to unify ranks.
	   On Thursday, Serge Martinez, a Megret loyalist also suspended,
was refused access to a post office box used to gather votes for
the special congress. Megret loyalists also accuse the Le Pen camp
of an illegal search of a Marseille office, with intruders pulling
pictures of Megret from walls and making off with forms for the
special congress.
	   The National Front crisis ``is good news'' for the right, the
secretary general of President Jacques Chirac's conservative Rally
for the Republic party said in an interview published Friday.
	   ``If (National Front) voters or activists want to turn away from
this party to join us, we will accept them,'' Nicolas Sarkozy was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Le Figaro.
	   Others were more cautious. Those daring to favor taking National
Front members into their parties specified that any offer would
exclude former officials.
	   Regional elections in March underscored the stigma attached to
dealings with the National Front. Seven rightist politicians
elected with National Front votes were banished or resigned from
their party.
	   But former Defense Minister Charles Millon, one of the disgraced
officials, said in an interview in Saturday's Lyon paper Le Progres
that he would willingly take both National Front members and
elected officials into his new movement.
	   The fear is that extreme-rightist theses will creep into other
parties' programs, becoming acceptable political fare.
	   National Front ideas, like a ``little bird, could settle in the
nests of other parties,'' Jean-Marc Ayrault, head of the Socialist
parliamentary group, warned lawmakers.
	   The National Front, founded in 1972, first got noticed in 1984
with an 11 percent score in European parliamentary elections.
Conservatives accused the late Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand of endowing the party with lasting clout by switching to
a proportional voting system in 1986 legislative elections. The
National Front got 35 seats.
	   Since then, the party has stalked the political scene.
	   ``We must let them kill each other, and count the pieces when
it's over,'' said Pascal Clement, a lawmaker with Liberal
Democracy, a new rightist party accused of flirting with the
National Front. ``Above all, we must do nothing and say as little
as possible.''

Rockets slam into Kabul; at least 17 people killed, 80 wounded

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Terrorized residents scrambled for
cover as successive rocket assaults shook the war-ravaged capital
on Sunday killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 80
others, witnesses and officials said.
	   A Taliban-run Radio Shariat broadcast said 21 people were killed
and that three houses were destroyed. The death toll discrepancy
could not immediately be reconciled; however in Afghanistan people
typically bury their dead the same day without bringing bodies to a
hospital or morgue.
	   The worst barrage shattered a northern Kabul neighborhood, with
one rocket hitting just in front of a crowded bus. Taxi drivers and
soldiers grabbed the seriously wounded and rushed them to hospitals
as dozens of others lay bleeding and pleading for help.
	   No one took responsibility for the attack, one of the worst
assaults on the capital in months.
	   But the rockets all came from north of the city where forces
loyal to ousted military chief Ahmed Shah Massood are based in
their fight against the Taliban militia, which controls Kabul and
most of Afghanistan and has imposed its strict version of Islamic
rule.
	   ``We don't know how many more Afghans will be killed by Afghans
. . . for how many years can this war will drag on?'' said Ghulam
Sakhi, a shopkeeper who was hiding in a basement of a six-story
apartment building along with about 12 other people.
	   A spokesman for the International Red Cross in neighboring
Pakistan said the international organization canceled its Sunday
flight to Kabul, but will resume flights on Tuesday.
	   The first attack of the day, in the worst-hit neighborhood,
occurred at dawn, killing a 15 year-old-boy and wounding his
father.
	   An assault in the early afternoon hit a residential area near
the combined military and civilian airport. A child was killed and
11 people, including eight women, were hurt when 11 rockets rained
down on their homes.
	   At area hospitals, doctors and nurses struggled to treat the
wounded with only a small amount of medicine. Some hospitals lacked
anesthetic, and painkilling drugs had to be bought from markets.
	   Red Cross ambulances screamed into stricken neighborhoods and
hurried wounded to the two hospitals that it supplies with
medicine.
	   In one taxi, 7-year-old Zarmeen wailed and clung to her mother.
The girl's leg was broken. Her mother cried and scolded her
daughter saying ``why did you go outside. I told you stay in the
house.''
	   After one attack, dozens of relatives gathered at the shattered
home of 15-year-old Zabiullah in Kalai Patula neighborhood to mourn
his death. They wrapped the boy's body in a white shroud and placed
him in the center of the rubble, while they sat around him wailing
and crying.
	   Zabiullah's father was in a nearby hospital, neighbors said. His
mother and sisters had been visiting a relative when the rocket
hit, they said.
	   In recent days there have been several bouts of heavy fighting
between Massood's troops and Taliban soldiers at the front line,
barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kabul.
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of the country while their
opponents control the remaining 10 percent.
	   Massood's spokesman said his forces launched a fresh offensive
against the Taliban in northern Takhar and Baghlan provinces,
killing at least 18 Taliban soldiers and capturing more than 100
others.
	   ``Our forces have made advances on three fronts inflicting heavy
losses to the Taliban,'' said opposition spokesman Abdullah, who
uses only one name.
	   The claim could not be independently confirmed.

President's daughter prays at Western Wall on eve of Hannukah
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Chelsea Clinton prayed at Judaism's holiest
site on the eve of Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights, and
visited Christian and Muslim holy places, as well.
	   In keeping with Jewish custom, she placed a note in the Western
Wall, last remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by the
Romans in A.D. 70.
	   Standing in front of the Western Wall, she stroked the ancient
stone, running her hand high up the stone as Jewish women rocked
back and forth in prayer beside her. Chelsea then knelt in prayer.
	   During her visit, a shofar - or ram's horn - sounded a wailing
note.
	   Hannukah commemorates the eight-day rededication of the Jewish
Temple by the Maccabees after their victory over the Syrians.
	   The only gaff in her visited occurred when Chelsea toured the
Haram al-Sharif, or noble sanctuary, where one of Islam's holiest
sites, the al-Aqsa mosque, is located. It stands directly above the
Western Wall, and Jews revere the site as the location of the
ancient Temple.
	   She entered the landmark Dome of the Rock and tried to shake
hands with a Muslim man wearing a white skullcap, but quickly
withdrew her hand when he recoiled.
	   In accordance with traditions of modesty, devout Muslim men do
not shake hands with women.
	   The president's daughter, dressed in dark pants and jacket,
prayed in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which marks a
traditional site of the tomb from which Jesus was resurrected after
the Crucifixion. Officials said a special room was opened for her
to pray.
	   Emerging from the church, a smiling Chelsea Clinton shook hands
with a Greek Orthodox priest. Earlier, she shook hands with a group
of visiting U.S. Marines.
	   A swarm of Israeli police and photographers followed her through
the narrow byways of the Old City.
	   She strolled along the Cardo, a reconstructed Roman-era walkway
lined with modern-day shops and ancient ruins, and walked through
the crowded ``suq,'' or market that is crowded with shops selling
clothes, aromatic spices, rugs and souvenirs. Tourists, a group of
Israeli soldiers and shoppers stopped to watch and wave.
	   During her tour, she also bought and drank some pomegranate
juice in the Muslim Quarter.
	   After the Old Walled City, Chelsea was driven to the Zova
Kibbutz, a communal farm on the outskirts of Jerusalem where she
visited the dairy and a children's playground.

Priests ignore Vatican's decision to expel them from Church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPLJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ It looked like a routine
mass in a small-town church. The fact that two of the three friars
had recently been fired by the Roman Catholic Church didn't seem to
bother neither them nor the congregation.
	   On Nov. 10, a letter from the Vatican was delivered to two
Franciscan friars here, Boze Rados and Bonifacije Barbaric, saying
they were being dismissed for disobedience toward superiors and
illegal activities in the Capljina parish.
	   But the two friars along with the third, Mile Vlasic, decided
simply to ignore Vatican's order and continue as if nothing
happened. All three expect Vlasic to receive a similar dismissal
letter soon.
	   ``We friars have given our vow to God until the end of our this
world's life,'' Rados said. ``Not guilty of anything, we are
sentenced to be lynched in our own homes.''
	   He blamed the regional bishop in Mostar, Rt. Rev. Ratko Peric,
and Cardinal Vinko Puljic for the dispute.
	   The monks have been working in Capljina since the 13th Century
when they were sent by the Vatican to spread the faith. They have
served as keepers of Bosnia's literature and culture down through
the centuries.
	   In 1975, a Vatican decree, named ``Romanis Pontificibus,''
ordered the parishes in Herzegovina, the southern part of the
country and home to most of the Bosnian Catholics, to be
subordinate to the bishop of Mostar.
	   Defying Vatican's order, the Herzegovina friars carried on with
their services for two decades. In the spring of 1996, Bishop Peric
decided to implement Vatican's decree.
	   Under pressure from Church authorities, the Capljina friars were
forced to leave town. But parishoners walled up the entrance to the
local St. Franjo's Church and called it 'the wall of shame' in
protest.
	   A note saying ``It will be pulled down when those who
established this church _ the friars - come back'' was left on the
wall. The friars returned two months later, but the wall remained
until last Christmas.
	   Supporters of Bishop Peric say some of the friars in
Herzegovina, especially the ones in Medjugorje, have violated their
vows of poverty and instead have amassed wealth.
	   Millions of pilgrims flocked for years to Medjugorje, since
children there reported seeing visions of the Virgin Mary there.
	   In November, Bishop Peric ordered all Franciscan friars from
seven parishes under his responsibility to leave by February 1999.
	   ``No chance!'' Tomo Filipovic, a 60-year-old resident of
Capljina, said. ``I'll rather give my head away, then allow that to
happen.''
	   Meanwhile, the three Capljina friars accused Bishop Peric of
fraud, publicly claiming he opened a milk factory from money
collected by the Roman Catholic Church abroad as humanitarian aid.
	   They also told several magazines in Bosnia and Croatia that
Bishop Peric is allegedly trying to cover up an alleged affair
between a priest and a refugee woman from central Bosnia.
	   Neither Bishop Peric nor Cardinal Puljic office has commented on
any of the allegations.

Police kill 11 rebels in Nepal

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Maoist rebels ambushed a police patrol in
midwestern Nepal, but were repelled and lost at least eight men in
the ensuing gunbattle, police said Sunday.
	   Police said they did not suffer any casualties in the attack
Saturday in Thumi, a village 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the
capital, Katmandu.
	   The rebels have intensified their attacks to disrupt local
elections scheduled for Friday.
	   In another battle, police killed three rebels in Rolpa District
on Saturday, 300 kilometers (185 miles) west of Katmandu.
	   Since the insurgency began two and a half years ago, more than
350 people have been killed. The guerrillas oppose Nepal's
constitutional monarchy and demand that the country be turned into
a republic.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Milan 1, Vicenza 0 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   At Milan, Bierhoff sent a precise cross from the left flank to
Weah, and the powerful Liberian had little trouble slotting the
ball in to close a counterattack for his fourth goal of the season
and second in two weeks.
	   Milan, which won four titles early in the decade, looks more and
more like a serious title contender again, following back-to-back
mid-table finishes. Vicenza (2-5-6) dropped to 17th in the 18-team
league.
 &UR; Parma 1, Roma 1 &QC; 
	   At Parma, no one was able to win the battle between the league's
top offense (Roma has scored 27 goals) and the top defense (Parma
has allowed 6). Crespo tallied his eighth of the year by knocking
in the rebound after Roma 'keeper Antonio Chimenti blocked Enrico
Chiesa's shot in the 40th minute. Roma _ which protested twice when
players were brought down in the penalty area and no foul was
called _ threatened often, but got only Gautieri's score.
	   Both clubs are 6-5-2, but Roma has a better goal differential.
 &UR; Inter 1, Udinese 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Baggio latched onto a loose ball and passed to
Ronaldo, who left-footed it home. Like Ronaldo, Baggio has also had
trouble with his knees this season, and the veteran only entered
the game with 28 minutes left.
	   The win was the first in league play for Inter's new coach,
Romanian Mircea Lucescu, who used Nigerian defender Taribo West in
the second half. There was speculation West might be shipped
elsewhere because of last week's outburst in which the player took
off his jersey and threw it at Lucescu after being substituted
during a 1-1 draw at Vicenza.
	   Inter improved to 6-3-4, Udinese is 4-4-5.
 &UR; Lazio 5, Sampdoria 2 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Mihajlovic _ who has never scored more than four goals
in an entire Serie A season _ tallied in the 29th, 44th and 52nd
minutes for Lazio (5-5-3), which also benefitted from goals by
Yugoslav midfielder Dejan Stankovic and Chilean striker Marcelo
Salas. Palmieri scored in the 37th and 55th minutes for Sampdoria
(3-4-6).
 &UR; Perugia 2, Cagliari 1 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, late substitute Riccardo Maspero scored in the
second minute of injury time _ just 60 seconds after midfielder
Daniele Berretta had tied the score for Cagliari (4-2-7) _ to give
the hosts (5-3-5) the victory.
 &UR; Bari 2, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Bari, Gianluca Zambrotta put back the rebound after South
African striker Phil Masinga's shot hit the crossbar in the 55th
minute to pace the hosts (3-9-1). Empoli is 3-5-5.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, defender Michele Paramatti accidentally knocked a
Salernitana free kick into his own goal in the 31st minute to allow
the visitors (3-3-7) to salvage a draw. Giuseppe Signori's sixth
goal of the season had put Bologna (4-6-3) ahead in the 16th.
 &UR; Venezia 0, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Venezia, neither club took the initiative in a key game in
the fight to avoid demotion to Serie B. Last-place Venezia is
2-4-7, 13th-place Piacenza is 3-4-6.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ George Weah, the Liberian striker, fired in the
winner with six minutes left Sunday as 10-man AC Milan overcame
Vicenza 1-0 and vaulted into second place in Serie A.
	   Milan took full advantage of the 1-1 draw between AC Parma and
AS Roma, clubs that had entered the day tied for second in the
standings. Parma took the lead on Argentine striker Hernan Crespo's
first-half goal, and Roma finally broke down Italy's toughest
defense to tie the score on substitute Carmine Gautieri's goal in
the 62nd.
	   Weah, starting to regain the form that earned him World,
European and African Player of the Year awards in 1995, turned home
a low cross from German forward Oliver Bierhoff from 8 meters
(yards) out to give Milan its third win in four games.
	   ``It's great to have Weah back on track,'' Milan coach Alberto
Zaccheroni said. ``He's the kind of player who can make a
difference in the long run.''
	   Before the late goal, Milan looked headed for a draw at best,
having seen midfielder Massimo Ambrosini sent off in the 72nd
minute with two yellow cards.
	   Weah's successor as FIFA Player of the Year, two-time winner
Ronaldo, also came through with a decisive late strike, hitting the
target off Roberto Baggio's assist with three minutes remaining to
lift Internazionale of Milan past Udinese 1-0. The Brazilian star
has battled knee tendinitis all season, but has scored in four of
the six league games he has managed to play for the Champions Cup
quarterfinalists.
	   The results left Milan (7-3-3) with 24 points, one behind leader
Fiorentina, which hosted two-time defending league champions
Juventus of Turin later Sunday.
	   Roma and Parma are next with 23 points, two ahead of
Internazionale.
	   Lazio of Rome is in sixth place, with 20 points, after routing
Sampdoria of Genoa 5-2. Lazio's Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic
recorded a rare hat-trick _ all the goals came off free kicks _
while both of Sampdoria's goals were penalty kicks by Francesco
Palmieri.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Perugia beat Cagliari 2-1 in a game that saw
both clubs score in injury time, Bari edged Empoli 2-1, Bologna and
Salernitana drew 1-1, and relegation battlers Venezia and Piacenza
drew 0-0.
 &UR; Milan 1, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Bierhoff sent a precise cross from the left flank to
Weah, and the powerful Liberian had little trouble slotting the
ball in to close a counterattack for his fourth goal of the season
and second in two weeks.
	   Milan, which won four titles early in the decade, looks more and
more like a serious title contender again, following back-to-back
mid-table finishes. Vicenza (2-5-6) dropped to 17th in the 18-team
league.
 &UR; Parma 1, Roma 1 &QC; 
	   At Parma, no one was able to win the battle between the league's
top offense (Roma has scored 27 goals) and the top defense (Parma
has allowed 6). Crespo tallied his eighth of the year by knocking
in the rebound after Roma 'keeper Antonio Chimenti blocked Enrico
Chiesa's shot in the 40th minute. Roma _ which protested twice when
players were brought down in the penalty area and no foul was
called _ threatened often, but got only Gautieri's score.
	   Both clubs are 6-5-2, but Roma has a better goal differential.
 &UR; Inter 1, Udinese 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Baggio latched onto a loose ball and passed to
Ronaldo, who left-footed it home. Like Ronaldo, Baggio has also had
trouble with his knees this season, and the veteran only entered
the game with 28 minutes left.
	   The win was the first in league play for Inter's new coach,
Romanian Mircea Lucescu, who used Nigerian defender Taribo West in
the second half. There was speculation West might be shipped
elsewhere because of last week's outburst in which the player took
off his jersey and threw it at Lucescu after being substituted
during a 1-1 draw at Vicenza.
	   Inter improved to 6-3-4, Udinese is 4-4-5.
 &UR; Lazio 5, Sampdoria 2 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Mihajlovic _ who has never scored more than four goals
in an entire Serie A season _ tallied in the 29th, 44th and 52nd
minutes for Lazio (5-5-3), which also benefited from goals by
Yugoslav midfielder Dejan Stankovic and Chilean striker Marcelo
Salas. Palmieri scored in the 37th and 55th minutes for Sampdoria
(3-4-6).
 &UR; Perugia 2, Cagliari 1 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, late substitute Riccardo Maspero scored in the
second minute of injury time _ just 60 seconds after midfielder
Daniele Berretta had tied the score for Cagliari (4-2-7) _ to give
the hosts (5-3-5) the victory.
 &UR; Bari 2, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Bari, Gianluca Zambrotta put back the rebound after South
African striker Phil Masinga's shot hit the crossbar in the 55th
minute to pace the hosts (3-9-1). Empoli is 3-5-5.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, defender Michele Paramatti accidentally knocked a
Salernitana free kick into his own goal in the 31st minute to allow
the visitors (3-3-7) to salvage a draw. Giuseppe Signori's sixth
goal of the season had put Bologna (4-6-3) ahead in the 16th.
 &UR; Venezia 0, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Venezia, neither club took the initiative in a key game in
the fight to avoid demotion to Serie B. Last-place Venezia is
2-4-7, 13th-place Piacenza is 3-4-6.

Body of missing Iranian writer found, daughter says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with judiciary blaming foreign power
for killings &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian writer missing since last week
has been found dead, his daughter said Sunday. He is the fifth
critic of the hard-line clerical regime to die in mysterious
circumstances in recent weeks.
	   Iran's judiciary, controlled by the hard-liners, blamed unnamed
foreigners for the killings while a group of lawmakers accused an
exiled Iranian opposition organization.
	   The latest victim is Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old
writer and translator, who had been missing since last Wednesday.
	   His body was found Thursday, apparently strangled, Pouyandeh's
daughter, 17-year-old Nazanin, said. No personal belongings were
missing, she said.
	   Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, said the
killings are aimed at tarnishing the image of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who is locked in a power struggle with
conservative clergymen opposed to his political and social reforms.
	   Khatami's efforts had emboldened many free-thinkers in Iran such
as Pouyandeh.
	   But that has also angered the hard-liners, who control nearly
all key institutions, including the security forces, the
intelligence network and the office of the supreme leader, who has
the last say on all matters.
	   The daily Akhbar newspaper quoted Tajzadeh as saying that a
number of arrests had been made and ``some clues'' have been found.
He said a special committee is investigating. He did not elaborate.
	   He described the killings as a conspiracy to make ``things
bitter for the people, at a time that the system is moving toward
political development.''
	   Pouyandeh's daughter said the family identified his body late
Saturday after being notified by the police.
	   ``I have lost all hope. I don't know who will die next, but I
hope that my father was the last victim of these slayings,'' she
told The Associated Press.
	   Ali Abbasi-Fard, the spokesman of Iran's judiciary, said Sunday
it appears that a ``sinister and organized movement is using agents
affiliated to foreign elements to undermine social stability and to
create fear throughout the society.''
	   In a joint letter to Khatami, 140 of Iran's 270 Parliament
members accused the Iraq-based opposition Mujahedeen Khalq and
unspecified foreign intelligence services of carrying out the
killings.
	   ``Those masterminding such conspiracies are trying to suggest
that insecurity is prevailing in Iran,'' the letter said.
	   In the past three weeks, four other government critics,
including two writers, have been found dead.
	   One of them, Mohammad Mokhtari, was possibly strangled,
according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Majid Sharif,
another writer also went missing and was found dead. The head of an
Iranian opposition group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh,
were found stabbed to death in their home last month.
	   Over the past year, the hard-liners have resorted to increasing
violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Nobody has been
charged in any of the attacks.

Salt Lake regrets embarrassment from alleged rules violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Olympics-IOC-Bribes &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The chief organizer of the 2002
Winter Games in Salt Lake City expressed regret Sunday that a
controversial scholarship program had embarrassed the Olympic
movement and Utah.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,
issued a public apology for the controversy caused by the fund. One
senior IOC member has described the scholarships as a ``bribe'' to
win IOC votes.
	   Joklik, who was part of the bidding group which won the games,
said he still supported giving academic aid and athletic training
to young people from developing countries.
	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibly
appear to influence improperly the voting of IOC members,'' he
said.
	   The Salt Lake program gave nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and
other aid to 13 people _ including six relatives of IOC members,
mostly from Africa _ while the IOC was deciding which city was to
host the 2002 games.
	   ``With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been
part of the bid campaign,'' Joklik said. ``I apologize to the
Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment
caused by the bid committee program.''
	   Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler has used the word
``bribe'' to describe the fund. A high-level IOC panel is
investigating.
	   Asked whether he accepted Joklik's apology, Hodler said, ``Of
course.''
	   ``Salt Lake is a victim,'' he said, repeating his assertion that
the bid committee felt compelled to offer the scholarships rather
than collude with agents promising to deliver votes.
	   Both Joklik and IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading a
special panel investigating the Salt Lake program, asserted that
Salt Lake City won the bid on its own merits, not because of the
scholarships.
	   Pound said the IOC executive board, which met with SLOC Sunday,
expressed ``complete, I repeat complete, confidence'' in the
organizing committee.
	   Joklik was chairman of the bidding committee at the time. The
scholarship program was under the direction of the former bid
president, Thomas Welch.
	   ``Although I was not aware of the program, I must accept
responsibility,'' Joklik said.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with the IOC for a periodic
update on preparations, Joklik said SLOC would cooperate fully with
the IOC panel investigating the case.
	   ``I will not hesitate to implement whatever steps are necessary
.... to maintain the integrity of the games,'' Joklik said.
	   Pound said the panel would investigate as quickly as possible
but that it wouldn't be finished by the time the IOC executive
board winds up its current meeting Monday.
	   ``This is a matter of enormous importance,'' Pound said.
	   IOC officials declined to speculate on whether any sanctions
would be imposed on Salt Lake. But Pound effectively ruled out any
possibility of the games behind taken away from Utah.
	   ``We are satisfied Salt Lake City won the 2002 games on the
merit of the bid,'' he said.
	   Pound said the Salt Lake inquiry would be broadened to include
investigation of other allegations that self-appointed ``agents''
have solicited bidding cities for bribes of up to dlrs 1 million to
procure votes of IOC members.
	   Joklik said he was unaware if any agents made overtures to Salt
Lake City.
	   ``I wasn't approached. I'm not aware of any member of our staff
being approached. We did employ lobbyists. I have no evidence that
they were involved in any unethical behavior.''
	   Robert Garf, chairman of the organizing committee, said SLOC
hopes the investigation can be concluded soon.
	   ``We'd like to put this behind us as quickly as possible,'' Garf
said. ``We would not like to be distracted. It's imperative that we
don't fall behind in the preparation of the games.''
	   At Sunday's meeting, the IOC board approved SLOC's dlrs 1.43
billion budget, which already has been approved by Salt Lake and
Utah officials.
	   The board also approved the long-delayed designs for the 2002
mascots.
	   ``They are cute,'' said Pound, who as top IOC marketing is
responsible for sales of Olympic related products.
	   Francois Carrard, IOC director general, added that the still
secret mascots _ which will be unveiled to the public Feb. 8 _ are
`` excellent, refreshing and cute.''
	   SLOC also received approval for accommodation plans for the
biathlon and cross-country skiing competitions in Soldier Hollow in
Wasatch Mountain State Park near Midway.
	   The housing, expected to be luxury hotels, is separate from the
main athletes' village under construction at the campus of the
University of Utah.
	   Joklik said SLOC expects to decide within three months whether
any sports will be added to the program. Possible addition are
women's bobsled and skeleton, a head-first version of the luge.

Child, worker injured in land-mine explosions in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A 12-year-old boy lost his arm and a worker
was injured in the leg when they triggered land mines in two
separate incidents in eastern Egypt, a land mine watchdog said
Sunday.
	   The first explosion occurred Thursday after Said Ibrahim picked
up a device in a public garden in Abu Syal village, about 30
kilometers (18 miles) from the port city of Suez, the Land Mines
Struggle Center said in a statement.
	   The mine went off when the boy was tossing it away, ripping
through the tissues of his left arm. Doctors amputated it and the
boy is recovering in a hospital, the center said in a statement.
	   Suez is 130 kilometers (80 miles) east of Cairo.
	   The second mine was triggered Friday when Mohammed Hassan
Mahmoud, 29, stepped on it while working on a government irrigation
project just east of the Suez Canal.
	   Mahmoud was also hospitalized and doctors were able to control
the bleeding. He was later discharged.
	   The center says there are some 23 million anti-personnel land
mines in all of Egypt, mostly in the northern desert where many
World War II battles were fought between Germans and British
troops. The area east of the Suez Canal has an estimated 2.5
million land mines.
	   Three people have been killed and 37 have been injured by the
mines since September when the Land Mine Struggle Center opened a
tally.
	   Egypt has asked Germany, England and their allies to help remove
the mines, but has received little assistance.

Body of missing Iranian writer found, daughter says

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS critics found dead in last three weeks sted two in

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian writer missing since last week
has been found dead, his daughter said Sunday. He is the fifth
critic of the hard-line clerical regime to die in mysterious
circumstances in recent weeks.
	   Iran's judiciary, controlled by the hard-liners, blamed unnamed
foreigners for the killings while a group of lawmakers accused an
exiled Iranian opposition organization.
	   The latest victim is Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old
writer and translator, who had been missing since last Wednesday.
	   His body was found Thursday, apparently strangled, Pouyandeh's
daughter, 17-year-old Nazanin, said. No personal belongings were
missing, she said.
	   Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, said the
killings are aimed at tarnishing the image of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who is locked in a power struggle with
conservative clergymen opposed to his political and social reforms.
	   Khatami's efforts had emboldened many free-thinkers in Iran such
as Pouyandeh.
	   But that has also angered the hard-liners, who control nearly
all key institutions, including the security forces, the
intelligence network and the office of the supreme leader, who has
the last say on all matters.
	   The daily Akhbar newspaper quoted Tajzadeh as saying that a
number of arrests had been made and ``some clues'' have been found.
He said a special committee is investigating. He did not elaborate.
	   He described the killings as a conspiracy to make ``things
bitter for the people, at a time that the system is moving toward
political development.''
	   Pouyandeh's daughter said the family identified his body late
Saturday after being notified by the police.
	   ``I have lost all hope. I don't know who will die next, but I
hope that my father was the last victim of these slayings,'' she
told The Associated Press.
	   Ali Abbasi-Fard, the spokesman of Iran's judiciary, said Sunday
it appears that a ``sinister and organized movement is using agents
affiliated to foreign elements to undermine social stability and to
create fear throughout the society.''
	   In a joint letter to Khatami, 140 of Iran's 270 Parliament
members accused the Iraq-based opposition Mujahedeen Khalq and
unspecified foreign intelligence services of carrying out the
killings.
	   ``Those masterminding such conspiracies are trying to suggest
that insecurity is prevailing in Iran,'' the letter said.
	   In the past three weeks, four other government critics,
including two writers, have been found dead.
	   One of them, Mohammad Mokhtari, was possibly strangled,
according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Majid Sharif,
another writer also went missing and was found dead. The head of an
Iranian opposition group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh,
were found stabbed to death in their home last month.
	   Over the past year, the hard-liners have resorted to increasing
violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Nobody has been
charged in any of the attacks.

Defending champion Zoeggeler wins men's singles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIGULDA, Latvia (AP) _ Armin Zoeggeler of Italy, Olympic silver
and bronze medalist and defending World Cup champion, turned back a
pair of German racers Sunday to win the third men's World Cup luge
event of the season.
	   Zoeggeler captured his second straight race and leads the
overall standings with 255 points.
	   ``I take the World Cup very seriously,'' he said. ``I'm not
thinking right now about the World Championships, just the next
week's race.''
	   Zoeggeler clocked the two top times of 49.399 and 49.515 seconds
for a combined 1 minute, 38.914 seconds.
	   He defeated two-time Olympic medal winner Jens Mueller, who
settled for second in 1:39.072.
	   Hard-charging Georg Hackl improved to third in 1:39.271 and is
second overall with 209 points.
	   The gold medalist of the past three Olympics, Hackl came from
seventh place with a brilliant second run down one of the longest
and most difficult tracks on the circuit.
	   ``This is unbelievable!'' Hackl said. ``I had a problem in curve
three during the first run, but made the correction in the
important second run.''
	   Markus Prock of Austria, eight-time World Cup champion, was
sixth in the race and is third overall with 205 points.
	   Adam Heidt lead five American racers with a seventh place. Heidt
was fifth at the halfway point, but made a costly error at the top
of the second run. He finished in 1:39.345, just .07 of a second
from the podium.
	   Heidt's third top 10 of the campaign puts the 21-year-old in
eighth place overall with 128 points.
	   Clay Ives, a native born Canadian now racing for the U.S. was
17th. Christian Niccum, after winning Saturday's doubles event,
took 22nd.

 &UR; NATO secretary general sees no dispute with German foreign
minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Secretary General Javier Solana sees no
dispute with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer over a
suggestion that alliance members consider dropping NATO's first
strike nuclear strategy, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   In an interview with the Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag, Solana
was quoted as saying he had understanding for Fischer and that it
was legitimate to question the first strike strategy.
	   At the same time, Solana told he newspaper atomic weapons
remained important as a deterrence against a mass-destruction
weapons threat and that the Germans were well aware of that.
	   Fischer ``can access security risks well,'' Solana was quoted as
saying. He added that the German foreign minister's contribution to
NATO's autumn meeting in Brussels last week was ``definitely
constructive.''
	   Fischer, an environmentalist Green and 1980s anti-nuclear
activist, drew tough criticism from opposition politicians in
Germany when he suggested last month that NATO would help defuse
tensions in the world by getting rid of what he called an outmoded
first-strike nuclear strategy.
	   The strategy was originally developed to prevent Warsaw Pact
forces from invading western Europe, a threat which no longer
exists, Fischer said.
	   At the same time he said he didn't expect to find consensus for
his suggestion, but wanted to jog NATO planners into updating their
strategy. NATO's three nuclear powers, the United States Britain
and France were cool to Fischer's suggestion.
	   ``A ballistic missile attack using a weapon of mass destruction
from a rogue state is every bit as much a ... threat to our borders
now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two decades ago,'' U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright told the NATO meeting. ``We have the right
nuclear strategy.''
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said in an interview
with the Berliner Zeitung daily, that he is satisfied that he and
Fischer have cleared up any differences they appeared to have
regarding NATO first-strike strategy.
	   ``I find this element of deterrence in the framework of a
political strategy sensible,'' Sharping said in the interview that
appears in the newspaper's Monday editions.

Nelson Mandela gives the church council a morale boost, but
</HEADLINE>
internal tensions linger &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ South Africa's President Nelson Mandela
gave the World Council of Churches a big morale boost as it marked
50 years of existence Sunday with a rousing celebration replete
with drums, videos, balloons, banners and bouncing balls, and
swaying African choirs in multicolored robes.
	   The festivities were on the next to last day of an international
WCC assembly, made up of 960 delegates representing hundreds of
millions of non-Catholic Christians in 112 countries. Thousands of
observers also attended.
	   Mandela, given a hero's welcome, expressed warm thanks to the
WCC for its financial and political support for his own and other
revolutions in southern Africa starting in the 1970s. ``The name of
the WCC struck fear in the hearts of those who ruled our country
during the inhuman days of apartheid,'' he said.
	   The president also paid tribute to the Christian workers who
educated him and many other African leaders. ``I will never have
sufficient words to thank the missionaries for what they did for
us.''
	   Looking ahead, Mandela urged the WCC to now apply the same
determination it showed in aiding revolutions to helping establish
African democracy and securing its position in the global market.
The WCC will take up global economics in its deliberations Monday.
	   Following the anniversary celebration, participants filed into a
huge open-air tent for a service of worship and commitment to the
WCC.
	   Church leaders ceremonially exchanged crosses and the
congregation vowed: ``Because Christ has commanded us to love one
another, with God's help we are confident to say: We intend to stay
together.'' The last five words were a quotation from the WCC's
founding assembly of 1948.
	   The ritual fell short of the ideal, however, since it was
boycotted by a number of Orthodox church delegates, including the
representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church, which alone
accounts for perhaps a fourth of the WCC constituency.
	   The Russians and some other Orthodox have shunned WCC worship
services here to protest what they see as the organization's
increasing control by western liberal Protestant thinking. Other
Orthodox, though also upset, have participated to varying degrees.
	   Orthodox alienation has been the top issue at the assembly,
which on Saturday endorsed an Orthodox proposal to set up a special
commission to consider Orthodox complaints about the organization's
structure, methods and message.
	   Another bow to Orthodoxy came Saturday night from the new
Central Committee, made up of 150 delegates elected from this
assembly, which will govern the WCC until the next assembly in
seven years.
	   The body re-elected Catholicos Aram I, an Orthodox churchman
from Lebanon, to the key post of Central Committee moderator. That
step quashed hopes of some delegates that the WCC would choose its
first woman moderator, though the Central Committee did pick two
women as vice moderators.
	   The leader of the Russian delegation here, 32-year-old Father
Hilarion Alfeyev, said in an interview that ``our commitment to the
WCC depends on the work of the special commission, whose creation
we approve. We are not committed to the present structure. It is
not adequate. If a new council is truly born, then we will be in
participation.''
	   He said the renovations in structure and program would have to
be substantial, but declined to say whether his church would quit
the WCC if they are not
	   ``I don't want to use the language of threat. There is a heated
debate in the Russian Orthodox Church,'' Alfeyev said. ``Many are
calling for immediate withdrawal. We have distanced ourselves from
the council, but we have not left and hope we can participate.''
	   The gay liberation workshops that were scheduled during the past
week's WCC open forum, he said, ``reflect the growing liberalism.
The gap between the traditional stream of Christianity and the
liberal stream represented by many Protestants is becoming wider
and wider.''

Lebid, Radcliffe take European cross country crowns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FERRARA, Italy (AP) _ Ukraine's Sergiy Lebid outkicked pre-race
favorite Mohamed Mourhit to win the senior men's title at the
European Cross Country Championships Sunday, while Britain's Paula
Radcliffe took the women's event.
	   Lebid, third last year, made his decisive move Sunday with 300
meters (yards) left in the 9.7-kilometer (6-mile) route and
finished in 28 minutes, 7 seconds.
	   Belgium's Mourhit crossed the line a second behind, with Driss
El Himer of France third in 28:16. Mourhit had been the top
European at the World Championships in March, arriving eighth
behind seven Kenyans.
	   Italy edged Portugal for the team title, based on the finishes
of each country's top four entrants on the course in Ferrara, 150
kilometers (90 miles) north of Florence.
	   Radcliffe covered the women's 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) in
18:07. Finland's Annemarie Sandell was next in 18:10, followed by
Yugoslavia's Olivera Jevtic in 18:11.
	   Portugal won the women's team title.
	   Radcliffe, the 1992 junior world champion, was the runner-up at
each of the last two World Championships.
	   Spain's Joussef El Nassri won the junior men's race, covering
5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) in 16:50, and Hungary's Katalin
Szentgyorgyi was the junior women's champion, completing 3.6
kilometers (2.2 miles) in 11:51.

Chechen reservists prepare for anti-crime campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with thousands of veterans
turning out in response to reserve call-up to fight crime. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thousands of veterans turned out Sunday in
response to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's call for army
reserves to combat a crime wave sweeping the breakaway southern
Russian region, a Russian news agency reported.
	   At the Khankala army headquarters near the capital, Grozny,
1,100 men showed up for the first roll call after the Chechen
leader ordered the call-up Saturday night, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev told Interfax the men
would be divided up into task-force teams which, along with police,
will take over all strategic sites in Chechnya over the next two
days.
	   Several thousand other reservists showed up at other
mobilization centers across the republic, the report said. It was
not known how many reservists would eventually be called to duty.
	   Presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev told Interfax that the
reservists will be assigned to law enforcement structures.
	   ``Tired of bandits' arbitrary rule, the population has
resolutely backed the president's call to launch a decisive battle
against them,'' Vachagayev said.
	   Maskhadov's decree was issued on the same day as Russian
security forces freed a kidnapped Frenchman working for the U.N.
refugee agency after more than 10 months in captivity.
	   Chechen Prosecutor-General Mansur Tagirov was also released
Saturday after apparently being taken captive on Thursday.
	   At the time of his abduction, Tagirov was investigating the
deaths of three Britons and a New Zealander: Peter Kennedy, Darren
Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New
Zealand.
	   Gunmen abducted the four in Grozny at the beginning of October.
They had been beheaded, apparently after a botched attempt by
Russian security services to free them.
	   Atgeriyev accused a renegade warlord of kidnapping and murdering
the four, the ITAR-Tass news said on Sunday.
	   Appearing on state television Saturday, Atgeriyev claimed that
warlord Arbi Barayev masterminded the kidnapping and killing of the
four men, who were in Chechnya to install a cellular phone system.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.

against them,'' Vachagayev said.
	   Maskhadov's decree was issued on the same day as Russian
security forces freed a kidnapped Frenchman working for the U.N.
refugee agency after more than 10 months in captivity.
	   Chechen Prosecutor-General Mansur Tagirov was also released
Saturday after apparently being taken captive on Thursday.
	   At the time of his abduction, Tagirov was investigating the
deaths of three Britons and a New Zealander: Peter Kennedy, Darren
Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New
Zealand.
	   Gunmen abducted the four in Grozny at the beginning of October.
They had been beheaded, apparently after a botched attempt by
Russian security services to free them.
	   Atgeriyev accused a renegade warlord of kidnapping and murdering
the four, the ITAR-Tass news said on Sunday.
	   Appearing on state television Saturday, Atgeriyev claimed that
warlord Arbi Barayev masterminded the kidnapping and killing of the
four men, who were in Chechnya to install a cellular phone system.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.

International officials condemn bogus ruling of Serb court,

	   BIJELJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's top international
official Sunday condemned the long sentences handed down by a Serb
court to three Muslims and said efforts would be undertaken against
the ruling.
	   A Bosnian Serb court Saturday sentenced three Muslims to a total
of 51 years in prison for murder. Two men were found guilty of
three counts of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison each.
The third was given an 11-year sentence for one count of murder.
	   The spokeswoman for chief international official Carlos
Westendorp, Alexandra Stiegelmayer, said in a statement that the
sentences were handed down despite a lack of evidence.
	   The defendants had signed a confession to having committed the
crime but were forced to do so, she said. She added that both
international and domestic laws prohibited use of coerced
confessions.
	   Last year, the court sentenced each of the three to 20 years
imprisonment. But international officials overseeing the 1995
Dayton peace agreement demanded a retrial, calling the first
proceedings a sham.
	   The three men were part of a group of seven, who escaped from an
alleged massacre of thousands of Muslim men aftern Bosnian Serbs
captured the town of Srebrenica in July 1995.
	   They said they survived months in the wild, and surrendered when
they spotted U.S. soldiers patrolling the former front line in May
1996.
	   The U.S. troops noted some of the men were wearing military
uniforms, carrying weapons and had recent haircuts, and handed them
over to a Bosnian Serb police. They were held for a year before the
first trial opened.
	   The other four men were found guilty of illegal possession of
weapons at the 1997 trial were not retried this year.
	   Saturday's ruling stunned the defense lawyers, who plan to
appeal the ruling to a Bosnian Serb supreme court.
	   ``This is a catastrophe. There is no evidence of a murder,''
said Bakir Pasic, a defense lawyer. ``There are no bodies of those
murdered.''
	   According to Pasic, the court based its ruling on a report that
four Serbs from the Zvornik area went missing and were never found
without any substantial evidence linking their disappearance to the
Muslims.
	   Some remains found in the woods were used as evidence, but the
court refused a doctor's request that forensics be used to identify
them.
	   The three men convicted _ Nedzad Hasic, Ahmo Harbas and Behudin
Husic _ announced they were staging a hunger strike in protest of
the court's decision.
	   In Sarajevo, the Muslim-led government said it was ``shocked''
by the sentences and will raise this question at a forthcomming
conference on Bosnia which will convene in Madrid.
	   The Bosnian Serb court passed the ``unlawful and political
sentence'' without evidence, in an obviously staged process, said
Adamir Jerkovic, spokesman for Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim member
of Bosnia's joint presidency.
	   Jerkovic urged international officials to get the three men out
of jail.

Clerides says no change in plans for missile deployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on
Sunday insisted that he will deploy as planned Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles, which Turkey has threatened to block by
force.
	   ``There has been no change in the situation,'' Clerides told
reporters on his return from a Vienna summit of the European
Union's existing and prospective members.
	   He said the missile issue was not raised during the meeting.
	   The warning by longtime enemy Turkey to prevent the missile
deployment has dragged Greece into the row: under a joint defense
agreement with Cyprus, Greece is obliged to defend it from Turkey.
	   Clerides has refused to reveal the missiles' arrival date,
though this is expected within the next few weeks.
	   U.S. presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke and his deputy, State
Department Cyprus coordinator Thomas Miller, are in the region to
try to defuse the crisis.
	   Clerides said he has not had any contact with the two officials
for the past fortnight.
	   He reiterated his willingness to postpone the missile deployment
``if there is substantive progress'' on his proposal to
demilitarize Cyprus, something rejected by Turkey, and if there is
a resumption of the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of
the island.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized
its northern third in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The reunification talks collapsed in 1997 when the Turkish side
objected to Greek Cyprus' attempts to join the EU.

DiMaggio cuts off medical updates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with DiMaggio asking for end to public updates on his
condition; No Pick Up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) _ U.S. baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, well
enough to talk after awakening from a coma and fighting off another
lung infection, ordered doctors Sunday to stop giving public
updates on his condition.
	   ``We allowed Joe to talk this morning and he was very angry,''
said Dr. Earl Barron, who heads the six-person team treating the
84-year-old baseball Hall of Famer. ``He said, `No more press.'''
	   With that, Barron said he could no longer comment on DiMaggio's
health. He refused to say whether his condition had been upgraded
from critical to serious, as had been anticipated.
	   DiMaggio, who was briefly married to actress Marilyn Monroe in
the 1950s, has guarded his privacy intently since his retirement
from U.S. Major League Baseball in 1951. Information about his
condition has been tightly controlled since he entered the
hospital, which has a wing named in his honor, Joe DiMaggio
Children's Hospital.
	   DiMaggio entered the hospital Oct. 12 and had surgery two days
later to remove a cancerous tumor.
	   On Friday, Barron reported DiMaggio to be in a ``very dire
situation'' as the baseball great slipped in and out of a coma. But
on Saturday, he was sitting up in bed visiting with friends and
family.
	   DiMaggio's condition bounced back after his treatment was
changed to administer antibiotics intravenously instead of orally.
Doctors discovered the oral medication was not being absorbed into
his bloodstream.
	   DiMaggio's family _ including his brother, Dom; grandchildren
Kathy and Paula; and longtime friend and lawyer Morris Engelberg _
have been at his bedside.
	   Last weekend, the family was summoned when he took what Barron
called ``a significant and serious turn for the worse.'' Again, he
improved overnight, leaving doctors stunned by his resiliency.
	   At least twice, he has had last rites of the Roman Catholic
church administered when it seemed he was slipping away.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S.
President Bill Clinton called on Israel and the Palestinians Sunday
to use ``honest discussion,'' not violence, in dealing with their
differences over the Wye land-for-peace deal.
	   Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton
echoed Israel's concerns over violence and renewed his pledge to
ask Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion in special assistance to help
carry out the accord and security measures connected to it.
	   Netanyahu, in a warm tribute to Clinton, said no other leader
has shown more perseverance in seeking peace. But the prime
minister made clear that the Palestine National Council must
complete the voiding of anti-Israel provisions in the PLO charter
if the peace process is to regain momentum.
	   ``What we really expect is that the Palestinians honor their
commitments,'' Netanyahu said.
	   That process, he said, should begin with revoking the 1964
charter. ``It would be a welcome and positive development,'' he
said.
	   At a news conference, questions about the House Judiciary
Committee's approval Saturday of four articles of impeachment
against Clinton competed with those on the Mideast. At one point,
Netanyahu urged reporters to try to stay focused on the purpose of
Clinton's trip.
	   Clinton said he has no intention of resigning or admitting that
he perjured himself, as some Republicans in Congress have demanded.
``I cannot admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not
do,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said he was looking to Clinton, who helped arrange the
accords in October, to intercede with the Palestinians.
	   ``If there is anyone who can help bring the peace process to a
satisfactory conclusion, it is you,'' Netanyahu told Clinton.
	   Reflecting on the deep-seated distrust between Israel and the
Palestinians, Clinton said ``We can't overcome all that history,''
but the fact that there are difficulties in carrying out the Wye
accords makes them worth adopting.
	   ``In the end, there have been fundamental decisions made to deal
with this through honest discussion and negotiation,'' Clinton
said. ``That is the only way it can be done. It cannot be done by
resorting to other means when times get difficult.''
	   Later, in a speech before young people, Clinton urged Israelis
to approach the process of building peace ``without illusions, but
not without hope'' that one day they will live alongside
Palestinians in peace.
	   ``If you are to build a future together, hard realities cannot
be ignored,'' Clinton said. ``There is a history of heartbreak and
loss, but the violent past and the difficult present do not have to
be repeated forever.''
	   In an interview on Fox TV, Netanyahu said it was unlikely that
Israel would make the troop withdrawal scheduled for Friday, in
light of continued Palestinian violence against Israelis.

Aston Villa back on top after rallying to beat Arsenal 3-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL UPDATE with late match Wimbledon-Liverpool &QL;

	   LONDON (AP) _ Dion Dublin got the winner in the 83rd minute as
Aston Villa rallied with three second-half goals Sunday to beat
Arsenal 3-2 at Villa Park and regain first place in England's
Premier League.
	   Arsenal, the defending league and F.A. Cup champions, pulled
ahead 2-0 on two first-half strikes by Dutch striker Dennis
Bergkamp, who returned to the lineup after missing four games and
pushed his season goal total to four.
	   But Villa rallied with a strike in the 62nd by Julian Joachim
and then two by Dublin in the 65th and 83rd. Dublin, who got the
winner on a 12-meter (yard) shot off a corner, has made Villa a
title contender since moving earlier in the season from Coventry on
a 5.75-million pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer.
	   Villa, which dropped out of first place on Saturday for the
first time all season, moved back on top with 33 points to 30 for
Manchester United.
	   In a late game Sunday, struggling Liverpool played at Wimbledon.
	   On Saturday, Manchester United drew 2-2 at Tottenham, but United
should have had a victory as it blew a 2-0 lead on two headers in
the last 20 minutes by Tottenham's Sol Campbell.
	   Chelsea also blew its chance to move to the top of English
soccer for the first time since 1989, drawing 2-2 with Derby when
substitute Dean Sturridge scored in second-half injury time to
equalize for the Rams.
	   Chelsea holds third place with 29 points followed by
Middlesbrough (27), Leeds (26), Arsenal (26) West Ham (26) and
Leicester (24).
	   Middlesbrough, promoted back to the Premier League this season,
won 1-0 at home over West Ham and dominated the match with the
winner from Brian Deane in the 40th.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Blackburn 0, Newcastle
0; Everton 1, Southampton 0; Leicester 3, Nottingham Forest 1;
Sheffield Wednesday 3, Charlton 0.
	   In Monday's only match, Leeds played host to Coventry.
	   On Sunday in England's first division, Grimsby won at Portsmouth
1-0. On Saturday, Sunderland won at home 2-0 over Port Vale on
goals by Martin Smith (24th) and Paul Butler (44th) to stay in
first place with 49 points, seven clear of Ipswich. Ipswich lost
2-0 at home to Barnsley and stayed on 42 points.
	   In Scotland, Rangers defeated second-place Kilmarnock 1-0 on Rod
Wallace's goal in the 10th. Rangers have 34 points to 31 for
Kilmarnock and 27 for third-place Celtic.
	   In other Scottish Premier League games: Aberdeen 2, Hearts 0;
Dundee United 1, Celtic 1; Dunfermline 1, Motherwell 1; St.
Johnstone 1, Dundee 1.

Primakov promises wage payments, even if they mean a weakening
</HEADLINE>
ruble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending the Russian government's plans to print
more money in 1999, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said paying
workers on time is more important than propping up the ruble, a
news report said Sunday.
	   ``It is unbelievable sometimes when I hear that the most
important thing now is to strengthen the ruble, even by delaying
pensions and wages in the budget sector,'' Primakov said in an
interview with the ORT television station Saturday, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov was defending the government's draft budget for 1999,
which calls for printing an additional $1.7 billion worth of rubles
to cover part of a deficit equivalent to $5 billion. Some
economists believe the government will print far more.
	   Before Russia's economic crisis hit in August, the ruble was
trading at six to the dollar. It now stands at around 20 to the
dollar and is expected to continue falling. Russia faces mounting
debts and falling revenues next year, and many government officials
say the only way out is to print more cash.
	   Russia's money supply has gone from about $8 billion when the
crisis struck to more $9.5 billion Friday, according to government
figures.
	   Primakov said Russia should not have to depend on Western
credits, as it has in the past.
	   ``Why should we beg all the time,'' Primakov said. ``We must
revive the real economy to create a sound foundation and build
relations with people on this basis.''

Zimbabwe-South Africa relations thaw after Mandela meets with
</HEADLINE>
Mugabe
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela
said he made progress Sunday in talks with Zimbabwe President
Robert Mugabe over their sharp differences on Zimbabwe's military
intervention in support of embattled Congolese leader Laurent
Kabila.
	   Mandela, who has criticized the deployment of troops in the
Congo by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, met with Mugabe for the
first time since a regional summit in September.
	   ``We are going to find a way forward to peace. That's the spirit
in which we have had discussions,'' Mandela said.
	   Mandela met with Mugabe after flying to Harare as guest speaker
at the eighth assembly of the World Council of Churches, a
convention of 330 churches representing 450 million non-Roman
Catholic Christians worldwide.
	   ``We have in this region leaders who are competent and
experienced who understand the importance of peace. All of them
want peace,'' Mandela told reporters.
	   Mugabe was seen a key belligerent in the Congolese conflict when
he dispatched 8,000 Zimbabwean troops, backed by warplanes and
armor, to support Kabila after the rebellion erupted Aug. 2.
	   South Africa refused to join Zimbabwe and its African allies
fighting rebels led by ethnic Tutsis who vowed to overthrow Kabila.
	   Mandela has repeatedly called for a negotiated peace and the
inclusion of the rebels in peace talks.
	   Kabila's refusal to meet with the rebels has doomed a series of
peace initiatives seeking an end to the four-month Congolese war.
	   Kabila alleges the rebels are merely pawns of Rwanda and Uganda
and insists on negotiating only with those two countries.
	   Mugabe told reporters Kabila's allies had to abide by his
decision not to meet directly with the rebels, but that they were
in favor in indirect negotiations.
	   ``The rebels will be talked to, but perhaps not in a manner that
they desire,'' he said.
	   Mandela's remarks in Harare were seen as a major thaw in icy
relations between Zimbabwe and neighboring South Africa over the
Congo.
	   ``We are not fortune tellers, we are not prophets, we are not
saying there will be a breakthrough, but we are moving in that
direction,'' Mandela said.
	   Mandela said the talks also touched on his controversial meeting
earlier this month in South Africa with fugitive former Zimbabwean
President Canaan Banana, convicted on sodomy and homosexual assault
charges in the Harare High Court Nov. 26.
	   ``This is a very sensitive matter...Zimbabwe and South Africa
are the greatest of friends and I would not like anything to happen
which will ruffle the feathers between our countries,'' Mandela
said.
	   He did not elaborate.
	   Zimbabwean officials say they are preparing a formal request for
the return of Banana, who faces a maximum prison term of 22 years,
from South Africa.
	   Mandela said he did not know Banana's present whereabouts or
whether he was still in South Africa.

	   NAGANO, Japan (AP) _ A minor mishap kept Olympic gold medalist
skater Catriona LeMay Doan of Canada from sweeping the women's
sprints Sunday but helped yield a new star, Tonny de Jong of the
Netherlands.
	   In the 1,000-meter event at the Nagano World Cup speedskating
competition, LeMay Doan was forced to slow down to let Eriko
Sanmiya of Japan switch into the outside lane.
	   Sanmiya admitted she was at fault.
	   ``It happened either because I was too slow as the starter on
the inside lane or Catriona was too fast and almost caught me up at
the switching point,'' said Sanmiya, who was seeking her fourth
silver in two days.
	   ``I feel very sorry that it might have cost her a medal,'' she
added.
	   Going into the race, LeMay Doan seemed a good bet to take all
four women's golds.
	   Earlier in the second day of the two-day event, she won the 500
meters after winning both races on the first day.
	   After the setback, LeMay Doan finished fifth in 1 minute, 18.88
seconds, 0.97 second off the pace. Sanmiya was 16th with an
unimpressive time of 1:19.94.
	   De Jong, a 5,000-meter specialist, set her personal best of
1:17.91 for the gold in her second competition in a World Cup 1,000
meters. In her maiden contest Saturday, she placed seventh in
1:18.89.
	   ``I didn't expect to win although my trainer said I might have a
good chance if I make a good start,'' said de Jong, winner of
several World Cup 3,000 and 5,000 meters in the last few years.
	   ``I myself was surprised even though my sprint has improved a
lot in the past year owing to new team coach Peter Mueller,'' said
the 24-year-old de Jong.
	   Still, the Canadians won their fourth overall gold Sunday in the
men's 500 meters.
	   And no complaint was filed by the Canadians with the organizers
over the mishap with the Japanese skater.
	   ``When I apologized to Catriona after the race, she told me not
to worry. ``Don't worry. No problem,'' she said apparently trying
to comfort me,'' Sanmiya said.
	   On Saturday, the Canadian star skated 1:18.07 for the gold in
the 1,000 meters. Sanmiya posted a time of 1:19.49 for the silver.
	   Jeremy Wotherspoon took the men's 500 meters after Olympic gold
medalist and world-record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu of Japan fell
while negotiating a corner.
	   Shimizu, winner of the event Saturday, had the day's fastest lap
time of 9.64 seconds for the first 100 meters before he fell and
slammed into the protective wall. Shimizu suffered minor contusion
on the elbow and the buttock, his staff said.
	   His race partner in the final twosome, Wotherspoon, sped alone
to victory in 35.85 seconds. The Canadian was the silver medalist
Saturday.
	   Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos of the Netherlands won the day's
fourth gold with a victory in the men's 1,000 meters. He also won
the event on Saturday.
	   Bos said the Netherlands, long a powerhouse in long-distance
races, is now putting as much emphasis on shorter races under the
influence and program of Mueller, an American coach the team hired
one and a half years ago.
	   ``From the beginning it started well for the team and he has a
really good program,'' said the 22-year-old Bos. ``He has built a
team of harmony and good atmosphere _ we have a lot of fun together
_ and we train very hard.''
	   With Mueller at the helm, the Dutch excelled in both the long
distances and sprints in the Nagano Olympics in February. They won
five of the 10 races at M-Wave Arena and wound up with 11 medals
overall.
	   Casey Fitzrandolph won the day's lone medal for the U.S. team as
he placed second behind Wotherspoon in the 500 in 35.95.
	   ``We are happy with that,'' said American team coach David
Besteman, who was hired in August. ``Fitzrandolph has focused more
on 500 meters and 1,000 meters, and he had a good result in the 500
today.
	   ``In this World Cup Chris Witty is a little bit under the
weather from her virus earlier this week so she has definitely lost
some power.''
	   Witty, Olympic silver medalist in the 1,000 meters and the
bronze medalist in the 500 meters, won a bronze in the 500
Saturday. On Sunday, she was 11th in the 1,000 meters and 17th in
the 500.
	   The two-day event at M-Wave was the first of five short-race
World Cups for the 1998-1999 season. Two rounds of 500- and
1,000-meter competition were staged both for women and men.
	   In all, Canada won seven medals, host Japan six, the Netherlands
five, Germany three, and the United States two. Russia and Norway
each had a bronze medal.

Clinton says will ask Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion for Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Islamic Jihad leader, edits thruout
to tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S.
President Bill Clinton called on Israel and the Palestinians Sunday
to use ``honest discussion,'' not violence, in dealing with their
differences over the Wye land-for-peace deal.
	   Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton
echoed Israel's concerns over violence and renewed his pledge to
ask Congress for dlrs 1.2 billion in special assistance to help
carry out the accord and security measures connected to it.
	   Netanyahu, in a warm tribute to Clinton, said no other leader
has shown more perseverance in seeking peace. But the prime
minister made clear that the Palestine National Council must
complete the voiding of anti-Israel provisions in the PLO charter
if the peace process is to regain momentum.
	   ``What we really expect is that the Palestinians honor their
commitments,'' Netanyahu said.
	   At a news conference, questions about the House Judiciary
Committee's approval Saturday of four articles of impeachment
against Clinton competed with those on the Mideast. At one point,
Netanyahu urged reporters to try to stay focused on the purpose of
Clinton's trip.
	   Clinton said he has no intention of resigning or admitting that
he perjured himself, as some Republicans in Congress have demanded.
``I cannot admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not
do,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said he was looking to Clinton, who helped arrange the
accords in October, to intercede with the Palestinians.
	   ``If there is anyone who can help bring the peace process to a
satisfactory conclusion, it is you,'' Netanyahu told Clinton.
	   Reflecting on the deep-seated distrust between Israel and the
Palestinians, Clinton said ``We can't overcome all that history,''
but the fact that there are difficulties in carrying out the Wye
accords makes them worth adopting.
	   ``In the end, there have been fundamental decisions made to deal
with this through honest discussion and negotiation,'' Clinton
said. ``That is the only way it can be done. It cannot be done by
resorting to other means when times get difficult.''
	   Later, in a speech before young people, Clinton urged Israelis
to approach the process of building peace ``without illusions, but
not without hope'' that one day they will live alongside
Palestinians in peace.
	   ``If you are to build a future together, hard realities cannot
be ignored,'' Clinton said. ``There is a history of heartbreak and
loss, but the violent past and the difficult present do not have to
be repeated forever.''
	   In an interview on Fox TV, Netanyahu said it was unlikely that
Israel would make the troop withdrawal scheduled for Friday, in
light of continued Palestinian violence against Israelis.
	   On another touchy subject, Clinton declined to say whether he
would free Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. Navy analyst who is serving a
life sentence for providing Israel with sensitive information.
	   But Netanyahu, acknowledging Pollard had ``done something bad,''
nonetheless urged that Pollard be released on humanitarian grounds.
	   Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday in the Gaza Strip, where he will be welcomed with the
trappings of a state visit. The visit, which includes an address to
the Palestinian National Council, is seen by some as a boost for
Palestinian statehood.
	   ``It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state,''
Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council,
said in an interview Sunday.
	   But Abdallah Shami, leader of the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza,
told Associated Press Television that n he believes Clinton should
die if Palestinians get a bad deal under the Wye accord. When asked
whether he would kill Clinton, Shami said, ``If I could, I would,
with every method I can muster.''
	   ``I don't know of anybody in Gaza who is thinking of killing
Clinton now,'' Shami said. ``But if (the) Wye River agreement
involves a change in the Palestinian position to the worse, and
somebody does kill him, I will be happy.''
	   At sundown, Clinton went to the home of Israeli President Ezer
Weizman, to light the first candle on a menorah at a Hanukkah
celebration.
	   Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the
Clinton visit. At the hotel where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen
were posted to guard the president and his 600-member delegation.
	   There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school
student was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in
October, the land-for-security agreement has hit one snag after
another. Israel froze implementation of the accord altogether,
accusing Arafat of violating the deal and inciting violent street
protests.
	   Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals
until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the
Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over the release of
Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails for militant or
political acts against the Jewish state.

Pinochet realizes he may be in Britain for a year, says aide

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet now realizes he could be in
Britain for at least a year fighting extradition to Spain, but he
is optimistic he will go home again, a close friend of the former
Chilean dictator said Sunday.
	   ``At the moment I think he is not depressed,'' Peter Schaad,
coordinator of a campaign to free Pinochet, said in an interview on
Sky TV.
	   ``He is optimistic in the middle-term he will be able to go back
to Chile,'' added Schaad. ``... We all understand this could take a
year or more.''
	   Meanwhile, a London newspaper, Sunday Business, said Chile, in
protest at Pinochet's arrest, has pulled out of a 100 million pound
(dlrs 168 million) deal to buy bridge-layers and other support
equipment for a tank regiment.
	   Vickers PLC, the company reportedly in line for most of the
contract, could not be contacted for comment Sunday.
	   The 83-year-old general was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while
recuperating from back surgery during one of his regular visits to
Britain. A Spanish extradition warrant alleged murder, torture and
other heinous crimes by secret police during 1973-1990 rule.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Dec. 9 that extradition
proceedings can start.
	   In Chile, rightist Sen. Ignacio Perez Walker told the Santiago
daily El Mercurio in London that the Chilean government will file
on Monday its appeal to an earlier House of Lords ruling that
Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest as a former foreign
head of state.
	   Perez Walker said the appeal, which is scheduled to be heard
Tuesday and Wednesday, will be based on the ties of one of the law
lords who ruled on the case, Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, to
Amnesty International, which has campaigned to have Pinochet
brought to trial.
	   Hoffmann is the unpaid director of the fundraising arm of
Amnesty, but the group says he did not take part in the campaign to
put Pinochet on trial.
	   Pinochet is under police guard at a rented mansion, Wentworth,
20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   In Chile, Pinochet supporter and former Chilean cabinet minister
Sergio de Castro on Sunday flatly denied speaking for Pinochet to a
London tabloid, The Sunday Mirror, which quoted Pinochet as
accusing the British government of ``treason'' for allowing his
arrest and the extradition proceedings.
	   De Castro acknowledged talking to the newspaper, but insisted he
was not an intermediary and that the sentiments expressed were his
own.
	   Pinochet, who took power by overthrowing an elected Marxist, was
the only Latin American leader to support Margaret Thatcher, then
Britain's Conservative Party prime minister, during her 1982 war to
reclaim the Falkland Islands from Argentine invaders.
	   ``He feels very, very bitter about what happened to him since
Oct. 16, considering the close cooperation between the two
countries historically, especially during the Falklands war,''
Schaad told the British Broadcasting Corp. ``He feels confused ...
he feels bitter about the treatment in this country.''
	   The Conservatives, now replaced by Prime Minister Tony Blair's
Labor Party government, on Sunday stepped up demands to send
Pinochet home.
	   Britain and Spain have no right to dictate to Chile about
political deals, particularly as Britain is releasing convicted
Irish Republican Army terrorists from jail under a peace agreement
in Northern Ireland, said Douglas Hurd, a former foreign secretary.
	   ``We are playing with explosives in their (Chile's) house,''
added Hurd. ``We're letting out (IRA) murderers ... and there's a
good reason for that. We are interested in reconciliation.''

	   DOBBIACO, Italy (AP) _ Three women skiers failed doping tests
carried out during World Cup cross country events this weekend, the
ANSA news agency reported Sunday.
	   The athletes, identified as two Norwegians and a Ukrainian,
turned in tests Saturday that showed elevated red blood cell
counts, which can be an indication of the use of EPO, a banned,
performance-enhancing synthetic hormone.
	   ANSA said the three skiers did not participate in Saturday's
5-kilometer freestyle race.
	   World Cup officials would neither confirm nor deny the report.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hodler saying he won't be expelled
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A powerful Olympic executive said
Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic
Committee for accusing some IOC members of taking bribes. Later, he
said the IOC wouldn't expel him.
	   Marc Hodler, a Swiss IOC executive board member, insisted he
would not quit.
	   ``I don't resign,'' he said. ``But maybe I will be expelled. You
never know.''
	   Hodler, who made the accusations Saturday, said he has since
been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   After further meetings with Samaranch, Hodler emerged late in
the day to say he was still an IOC member.
	   ``I shall not be expelled, no,'' he said.
	   Asked whether he now regretted his allegations of corruption,
Hodler said, ``Not at all. ... The cities have been the victim and
not the villain.''
	   Hodler said Saturday he believed four agents _ including one IOC
member _ had been involved in vote-buying the past 10 years. He
said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _ currently
numbering 115 _ were open to bribery.

President asks kidnappers to release Germans by Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's president has told the tribal
kidnappers of four German tourists to free them by Tuesday,
security officials said Sunday.
	   President Ali Abdullah Saleh sent a message Saturday through an
intermediary to the Bani Dhabyan tribe that it has four days to
free the hostages, the officials told The Associated Press. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The officials did not say what will happen if the hostages are
not released, but Saleh's message could mean that the government is
ready to use force to secure the freedom of the three women and a
man.
	   They were abducted Monday by three Bani Dhabyan gunmen near
Serwah in Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of
the capital, San'a.
	   The security officials said Saleh also told German Ambassador
Helga Strathwitz of his warning to the Bani Dhabyan tribe, and
assured her that the captives would be released ``very soon,''
diplomats said without elaborating. They also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Saleh left for France on an official visit Sunday.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
lawless and controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to
take the law in their hands to get their demands fulfilled. The
hostages _ often oil-industry workers, diplomats or tourists _ are
usually treated well and released unhurt.
	   The German embassy was informed Sunday that representatives from
other tribes would attempt to negotiate the release of the hostages
before Saleh returns from France either Tuesday or Wednesday,
tribal sources said.
	   Another group of tribal representatives tried but failed to
secure their release.
	   The Yemeni government has said the tribe abducted the Germans to
force it to pay for land on which a dam has been built.
	   In April, members of the same tribe released British hostages
after the government promised to build more roads in the area and
return a four-wheel drive vehicle that was seized in March.
	   A spokesman for the Bani Dhabyan tribe last week accused the
government of failing to honor its previous pledges. But officials
have said they would not review the earlier undertakings until the
Germans are released.
	   More than 250 troops in armored vehicles are reported to be
circling the mountainous area where the Germans are thought to be
held.
	   Security forces have detained several members of the Bani
Dhabyan tribe in an apparent bid to gain leverage with the tribal
elders.

Priests ignore Vatican's decision to expel them from Church

	   CAPLJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ It looked like a routine
mass in a small-town church. The fact that two of the three friars
had recently been fired by the Roman Catholic Church didn't seem to
bother either them or the congregation.
	   On Nov. 10, a letter from the Vatican was delivered to two
Franciscan friars here, Boze Rados and Bonifacije Barbaric, saying
they were being dismissed for disobedience toward superiors and
illegal activities in the Capljina parish.
	   But the two friars along with the third, Mile Vlasic, decided
simply to ignore Vatican's order and continue as if nothing
happened. All three expect Vlasic to receive a similar dismissal
letter soon.
	   ``We friars have given our vow to God until the end of our this
world's life,'' Rados said. ``Not guilty of anything, we are
sentenced to be lynched in our own homes.''
	   He blamed the regional bishop in Mostar, Rt. Rev. Ratko Peric,
and Cardinal Vinko Puljic for the dispute.
	   The monks have been working in Capljina since the 13th Century
when they were sent by the Vatican to spread the faith. They have
served as keepers of Bosnia's literature and culture down through
the centuries.
	   In 1975, a Vatican decree, named ``Romanis Pontificibus,''
ordered the parishes in Herzegovina, the southern part of the
country and home to most of the Bosnian Catholics, to be
subordinate to the bishop of Mostar.
	   Defying the Vatican's order, the Herzegovina friars carried on
with their services for two decades. In the spring of 1996, Bishop
Peric decided to implement Vatican's decree.
	   Under pressure from Church authorities, the Capljina friars were
forced to leave town. But parishoners walled up the entrance to the
local St. Franjo's Church and called it 'the wall of shame' in
protest.
	   A note saying ``It will be pulled down when those who
established this church _ the friars - come back'' was left on the
wall. The friars returned two months later, but the wall remained
until last Christmas.
	   Supporters of Bishop Peric say some of the friars in
Herzegovina, especially the ones in Medjugorje, have violated their
vows of poverty and instead have amassed wealth, presumably from
religious tourism.
	   Millions of pilgrims flocked for years to Medjugorje, since
children there reported seeing visions of the Virgin Mary there.
	   In November, Bishop Peric ordered all Franciscan friars from
seven parishes under his responsibility to leave by February 1999.
	   ``No chance!'' Tomo Filipovic, a 60-year-old resident of
Capljina, said. ``I'll rather give my head away, then allow that to
happen.''
	   Meanwhile, the three Capljina friars accused Bishop Peric of
fraud, publicly claiming he opened a milk factory from money
collected by the Roman Catholic Church abroad as humanitarian aid.
	   They also told several magazines in Bosnia and Croatia that
Bishop Peric is allegedly trying to cover up an alleged affair
between a priest and a refugee woman from central Bosnia.
	   Neither Bishop Peric nor Cardinal Puljic office has commented on
any of the allegations.

	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Britain's Mark Foster lowered his own
50-meter freestyle world short-course record of 21.31 seconds
Sunday as the three-day European short-course championships ended
with seven new world records and four new world-best times.
	   Foster clocked 21.48 seconds in Sunday's preliminaries,
surpassing the old record of 21.50 by Russian Alex Popov set in
1994. Several hours later he came back to win the final in an even
quicker 21.31.
	   ``Watch this space,'' said Foster, who can be regarded as the
world's fastest swimmer on the 25-meter indoor course. ``My next
target is to go under 21 seconds.''
	   British teammate James Hickman also set a world record Sunday in
the 100 butterfly. Hickman clocked 51.02 in the prelims, bettering
Australian Michael Klim's old time of 51.07 set in January of this
year.
	   In the 50-meter backstroke, Germany's Sandra Voelker won in
world-record time of 27.27, topping the old mark by China's Xiuyu
Bia.
	   Also on Sunday, the German women set a world-best time of
1:50.13 in the 4x50 medley relay. In the men's 4X50 medley relay,
Sweden and German tied for gold, both with world-bests of 1:35.51.
	   Sweden had broken the world-best time in Sunday's prelims with a
time of 1:36.24.
	   The world-best designation is reserved for seldom swum events
that do not have world-record status.
	   On Saturday, Milos Milosevic of Croatia and Martina Moravcova of
Slovakia set world records and the Netherlands' 4x50 men's relay
set a world-best.
	   Milosevic swam 23.30 seconds to win the 50-meter butterfly,
breaking the old world record of 23.35 set by Russian Denis
Pankratov.
	   Moravcova won the 100 individual medley in 1:00.43, topping the
old record of 1:00.60 by China's Xiaowen Hu Chn.
	   The other mark went to the Dutch men, clocking a world-best of
1:26.99 in the 4x50.
	   On Friday, Germans Mark Warnecke and Thomas Rupprath set world
records. Warnecke won gold in a record time of 26.70 seconds in the
50-meter breaststroke, and Rupprath clocked 24.13 in winning the
50-meter backstroke. The German womens' 4x50 freestyle relay also
set a world-best of 1:39.56.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The ``bete noir'' of French politics, the
extreme-right National Front, is on the verge of imploding in a
vicious public spectacle, and mainstream parties are lapping up the
name-calling and low blows.
	   The demise of the National Front in its current form would
amount to a small earthquake on the French political landscape,
pummeled for nearly 15 years by the divisive power of the party
accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   A week after the National Front erupted in crisis, with bitter
feuding between its top two figures _ charismatic leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen and former No. 2 man Bruno Megret _ the schism appeared all
but complete.
	   The question was who, if anyone, might profit from an eventual
splintering of the far right without committing political suicide.
	   ``This is blessed bread,'' said Yves Verwaerde, on the electoral
commission of Liberal Democracy, a new rightist party. ``It's a
real calamity for the left.''
	   The National Front has long been considered a political pariah
but proved a magnet for voters dissatisfied with the traditional
right.
	   The anti-immigration party has for years garnered 15 percent of
the vote in elections, local, regional and national, bolstering the
left while robbing votes from the right, which was brought to its
knees in 1997 legislative elections.
	   With European Parliamentary elections seven months away, the
possible disintegration of the National Front means unexpected
complications. Politicians watched cautiously.
	   Le Pen fears Megret is out to unseat him and has publicly called
his followers ``traitors'' and accused them of ``racism'' and
``extremism'' _ labels usually pinned on Le Pen himself.
	   Megret shares the same ideological ground as Le Pen, but has
strived to dilute the stigma attached to the party.
	   It is widely assumed the National Front will split into two
groups. According to the scenario laid out in the press, Le Pen
would head a reduced party, keeping the National Front name. Megret
would start up a new party.
	   The French media relished recounting the divorce between the
flamboyant, silver-haired Le Pen, at 70 still a fiery orator, and
Megret, an understated technocrat of 47. Some of the meanest scenes
were played out before television cameras.
	   At a rally Friday in Metz, Le Pen compared himself to Julius
Caesar and Megret to Brutus, the adopted son who slew the Roman
emperor.
	   ``But what differentiates me from Caesar,'' Le Pen said, ``as
Brutus approaches, knife in hand ... is that I pull out my sword
and kill Brutus before he kills me.''
	   Le Pen fired Megret from his post of general delegate after the
crisis exploded 10 days ago, and, on Friday, suspended him and four
allies from the party after they called for an extraordinary
congress to unify ranks.
	   On Thursday, Serge Martinez, a Megret loyalist also suspended,
was refused access to a post office box used to gather votes for
the special congress. Megret loyalists also accuse the Le Pen camp
of an illegal search of a Marseille office, with intruders pulling
pictures of Megret from walls and making off with forms for the
special congress.
	   The National Front crisis ``is good news'' for the right, the
secretary general of President Jacques Chirac's conservative Rally
for the Republic party said in an interview published Friday.
	   ``If (National Front) voters or activists want to turn away from
this party to join us, we will accept them,'' Nicolas Sarkozy was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Le Figaro.
	   Others were more cautious. Those daring to favor taking National
Front members into their parties specified that any offer would
exclude former officials.
	   Regional elections in March underscored the stigma attached to
dealings with the National Front. Seven rightist politicians
elected with National Front votes were banished or resigned from
their party.
	   But former Defense Minister Charles Millon, one of the disgraced
officials, said in an interview in Saturday's Lyon paper Le Progres
that he would willingly take both National Front members and
elected officials into his new movement.
	   The fear is that extreme-rightist theses will creep into other
parties' programs, becoming acceptable political fare.
	   National Front ideas, like a ``little bird, could settle in the
nests of other parties,'' Jean-Marc Ayrault, head of the Socialist
parliamentary group, warned lawmakers.
	   The National Front, founded in 1972, first got noticed in 1984
with an 11 percent score in European parliamentary elections.
Conservatives accused the late Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand of endowing the party with lasting clout by switching to
a proportional voting system in 1986 legislative elections. The
National Front got 35 seats.
	   Since then, the party has stalked the political scene.
	   ``We must let them kill each other, and count the pieces when
it's over,'' said Pascal Clement, a Liberal Democracy lawmaker.
``Above all, we must do nothing and say as little as possible.''

Low turnout in second round of legislative vote in Central Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Low turnout marked the
second round of legislative elections Sunday in the Central African
Republic, where the ruling party and the opposition are vying for
control of parliament.
	   International observers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
estimated the turnout at 35-40 percent, though it was clear to
journalists that few people turned out to vote.
	   The run-up to the election has been marred by violence,
including a Wednesday clash between supporters of the ruling party
and the opposition that left six people wounded in Bangui, the
capital.
	   Fearing more violence, government soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers
patrolled the city and polling places throughout the country, but
there were no immediate reports of disturbances.
	   Fourteen political parties, many of them set up along ethnic
lines, are vying for the 63 seats that were not captured in the
first round of voting on Nov. 22. Fifty-five seats are needed to
take control of 109-seat parliament.
	   Most of the parliamentary seats are now controlled by President
Ange-Felix Patasse's ruling Movement for the Liberation of the
People of Centrafrique, or MLPC.
	   Following the first round of elections, eight opposition
political parties stopped campaigning for seats, trying to focus
opposition votes on the strongest parties.
	   However, many voters appeared to be confused or angered by that
decision, and may have stayed away from the polls as a result.
	   Through the 1960s and 1970s, the Central African Republic fell
under the tyrannical rule of former army Col. Jean-Bedel Bokassa,
who was accused of corruption, murder, torture and cannibalism
before being ousted in a bloodless coup in 1979.
	   In his wake, the Central African Republic remains a troubled and
isolated country that at times appears to be teetering on anarchy.
Armed bandits frequently attack motorists and rival factions fight
for territory.
	   Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major
rebellions against Patasse, whose election in 1993 ended more than
a decade of army rule.

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Fernando Vargas is looking
forward to fighting again. So is Arturo Gatti.
	   ``This is a young man's sport,'' Vargas said after winning the
IBF junior middleweight title by stopping veteran Yory Boy Campas
after seven rounds Saturday night at the Trump Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City.
	   The 21-year-old Vargas became a champion in only his 15th pro
fight, beating an opponent who was fighting for the 75th time.
	   ``Beginning in 1999, everybody's taking a back seat to Fernando
Vargas because he's going to be a superstar in boxing,'' promoter
Dina Duva said early Sunday.
	   Vargas, of Oxnard, California, showed fair power and a lot of
poise in remaining unbeaten and becoming the second 1996 U.S.
Olympic Boxer to win a world title. The first was Floyd Mayweather,
World Boxing Council super featherweight champion.
	   Gatti did not attend the news conference because he went to a
hospital for the stitching of cuts above and below the left eye. He
lost a unanimous decision to Ivan Robinson in a 10-round brawl that
was the second half of a cable television doubleheader.
	   ``I will fight again,'' said Gatti, a former International
Boxing Federation junior lightweight champion from Jersey City, New
Jersey, who now has taken batterings in losing three straight
fights.
	   ``They should never fight anyone but each other,'' said Lou
DiBella of HBO.
	   The 27-year-old Robinson (26-2), of Philadelphia, certainly
doesn't need another fight against Gatti, who he now has beaten
twice while taking a good deal of punishment. Another win over
Gatti would do him no good.
	   Gatti is only 26 and has a 29-4 record, but his brawling style
in which defense seems almost an afterthought has cost him in many
of his wins, as well as losses. But he makes exciting fights, and
that makes him popular with fans and with television.
	   According to CompuBox punch counts, Gatti landed 274 punches
when he lost a split decision to Robinson Aug. 22 and he connected
with 342 blows Saturday night. Robinson, however, connected with
400 punches in the first fight and with 440 Saturday night.
	   Campas, bleeding from the nose and from cuts over the right eye
and on the upper lip, also did not attend the news conference
	   The Mexican is only 27, not an old man, but 75 fights, of which
he has won 72, appear to have made him an old fighter.
	   At the end of the seventh round, Campas, who has scored 62
knockouts, turned to his corner and said he had enough.
	   Youth had been served.

Aston Villa back on top after rallying to beat Arsenal 3-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Wimbledon 1, Liverpool 0 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dion Dublin got the winner in the 83rd minute as
Aston Villa rallied with three second-half goals Sunday to beat
Arsenal 3-2 at Villa Park and regain first place in England's
Premier League.
	   Meanwhile, Wimbledon defeated slumping Liverpool 1-0 on Robbie
Earle's 48th mintue goal.
	   Villa has 33 points followed by Manchester United (30), Chelsea
(29), Middlesbrough (27), Leeds (26), Arsenal (26), West Ham (26),
Wimbledon (26) and Leicester (24).
	   Arsenal, the defending league and F.A. Cup champions, pulled
ahead 2-0 on two first-half strikes by Dutch striker Dennis
Bergkamp, who returned to the lineup after missing four games and
pushed his season goal total to four.
	   But Villa rallied with a strike in the 62nd by Julian Joachim
and then two by Dublin in the 65th and 83rd. Dublin, who got the
winner on a 12-meter (yard) shot off a corner, has made Villa a
title contender since moving earlier in the season from Coventry on
a 5.75-million pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer.
	   Villa, which dropped out of first place on Saturday for the
first time all season, moved back on top with 33 points to 30 for
Manchester United.
	   In Sunday's other match, Wimbledon kept up Liverpool's misery
with a 1-0 victory on a 48th-minute goal by Robbie Earle.
	   Wimbledon, the low budget team that defies critics, has reached
the semifinals of League Cup and _ with this win _ moved into
eighth place on 26 points.
	   Liverpool, which played well and deserved a least a tie, was
doomed when Michael Owen missed a late penalty to tie on the eve of
his 19th birthday.
	   Liverpool stayed on 22 points in 12th place. The Reds have lost
seven of their last 11 games and were ousted last week from the
European UEFA Cup.
	   On Saturday, Manchester United drew 2-2 at Tottenham, but United
should have had a victory as it blew a 2-0 lead on two headers in
the last 20 minutes by Tottenham's Sol Campbell.
	   Chelsea also blew its chance to move to the top of English
soccer for the first time since 1989, drawing 2-2 with Derby when
substitute Dean Sturridge scored in second-half injury time to
equalize for the Rams.
	   Middlesbrough, promoted back to the Premier League this season,
won 1-0 at home over West Ham and dominated the match with the
winner from Brian Deane in the 40th.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Blackburn 0, Newcastle
0; Everton 1, Southampton 0; Leicester 3, Nottingham Forest 1;
Sheffield Wednesday 3, Charlton 0.
	   In Monday's only match, Leeds played host to Coventry.
	   On Sunday in England's first division, Grimsby won at Portsmouth
1-0. On Saturday, Sunderland won at home 2-0 over Port Vale on
goals by Martin Smith (24th) and Paul Butler (44th) to stay in
first place with 49 points, seven clear of Ipswich. Ipswich lost
2-0 at home to Barnsley and stayed on 42 points.
	   In Scotland, Rangers defeated second-place Kilmarnock 1-0 on Rod
Wallace's goal in the 10th. Rangers have 34 points to 31 for
Kilmarnock and 27 for third-place Celtic.
	   In other Scottish Premier League games: Aberdeen 2, Hearts 0;
Dundee United 1, Celtic 1; Dunfermline 1, Motherwell 1; St.
Johnstone 1, Dundee 1.

Using a stone of peace, Clinton honors a friend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Using a pebble from Wye River, President Bill
Clinton paid respects Sunday at the grave of slain Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose 1993 agreement with the Palestinians
paved the way for the one his successor sealed at the river's
shores.
	   Clinton visited the grave in Har Herzl Cemetery with Rabin's
widow Leah Rabin and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president, wearing
a navy blue yarmulke, and the first lady, clutching a bouquet of
pink flowers, knelt and bowed their heads.
	   Clinton briefly traced the black-and-white tombstone with his
fingers, then placed the smooth gray stone on it in keeping with
the Jewish tradition of remembrance of the dead.
	   Mrs. Rabin placed a bouquet of white flowers on the grave and
stepped away hand-in-hand with Mrs. Clinton. The Rabins' daughter
Dalia Pilosoph and granddaughter Noa Pilosoph, also placed stones
on the grave.
	   White House officials said the stone Clinton used came from the
Wye River area of Maryland, site of the conference center where
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat reached their peace accord.
	   Rabin was assassinated in Tel Aviv on Nov. 4, 1995, by an ardent
Israeli opponent of the policy of relinquishing land to the
Palestinians. At the Wye talks, Netanyahu agreed to give up another
13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Rabin's grave, nestled among those of other Israeli presidents
and prime ministers, is a popular pilgrimage site. Mourners
routinely place candles, flowers and other mementos there.
	   The visit, described as a personal one, was Clinton's second
since Rabin's funeral.

AEK beats Panathinaikos 2-0, takes lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With one goal in each half from Vassilis
Lakis and Toni Savevski respectively, AEK Athens beat crosstown
Panathinaikos Sunday in a game for the Greek first division soccer
league.
	   The win, the seventh in a row at home, sent AEK atop the 18-team
standing with 29 points from 13 games.
	   Olympiakos Piraeus follows with 28 points. But the defending
champions may regain the lead if they beat last-placed crosstown
Ethnikos in the round's last game Monday.
	   Panathinaikos retained third place, tied with provisional Xanthi
at 25 points.
	   On Saturday, Xanthi played to a scoreless draw against Iraklis
Salonica at home.
	   In the round's major game, AEK dominated throughout, playing
before 22,000 spectators of which only about 500 were Panathinaikos
fans.
	   AEK took the lead with Vassilis Lakis in the 9th minute.
	   In the team's first real attack, Lakis took a pass from Arnar
Gretarsson and scored with a lob when he spied Polish goalminder
Jozef Wandzik out of position.
	   Panathinaikos, coming from four straight losses both in the
Greek league and Champions League, had a good chance to level in
the 32nd when Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha, one-on-one with
keeper Ilias Atmatzidis, shot over the crossbar.
	   Panathinaikos' Greek coach Vassilis Daniel's decision to replace
two midfielders with strikers in an effort to score, backfired.
	   The hosts took full control of midfield and scored their second
goal with veteran Savevski in the 59th.
	   The winners came close to a third goal but Gretarsson's
blistering shot from the edge of the area hit Wandzik's right bar.
	   In the northern town of Xanthi, some 2,000 spectators saw a
lackluster match between the team of the same name and Iraklis.
	   During the 90 minutes of the match both sides missed only one
scoring opportunity each.
	   In the 40th, Iraklis' striker Michael Constantinou, face-to-face
with goalie Jurai Bucek, swung at the ball and missed.
	   The chance for the hosts came in the 76th when a header by
Thomas Kyparissis went wide, scraping Ilias Stoyannis' right bar.
	   The hosts claimed a penalty in the 33th when Nzongani Kidoda
tackled Stelios Venetidis in the area. But referee Thanassis
Briakos denied it.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Michelle Kwan won with the jumps and she won
without them. She beat the pros, she beat her fellow Olympians.
	   With confident technique and stunning grace, the U.S. figure
skater dominated the field over the weekend at the World
Professional Figure Skating Championships, capping a year in which
she won everything she skated _ except, of course, the Nagano
Olympics.
	   ``I am very impressed by her, she is a true champion,'' said
1984 and 1988 Olympic champion Katarina Witt, who finished fifth
after conceding there was no way she could beat Kwan. ``What she
went through at the Olympics and then to come back and to win. It
was like after (the Olympics) she was saying, `This is me. I
deserve to win.'
	   ``It was a beautiful moment out there to watch.''
	   Alexei Yagudin became the first Russian in the event's 26-year
history to win the men's event, holding on to his lead even though
three-time defending champion Kurt Browning won Saturday night's
artistic skate.
	   Olympic champions Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev won the
pairs, while new partners Maya Usova and Yevgeny Platov blossomed
through a difficult and painful year to win the dance.
	   Kwan, meanwhile, even upstaged herself. Her big moment was
supposed to be Friday night, when she used the technical program to
unveil the ``Lamento d'Ariane'' piece that will serve as her free
skate at the U.S. championships in February and the Olympic-level
world championships in March.
	   Kwan landed seven triple jumps and got one perfect 6.0 for the
routine, which will need some polish over the next few months.
Saturday, however, she lifted the MCI Center with a beautiful,
mature skate to ``East of Eden,'' which included just three triples
but earned five 6.0s.
	   ``It was one of my best performances,'' said Kwan, the youngest
world pro champion at 18. ``When I skated, it was magical. ... I
didn't expect much from this competition coming in. Tonight, I felt
really on. I enjoyed myself. I felt very confident when I stepped
on the ice.''
	   Japan's Yuka Sato, winner of this event in 1996, finished
second, followed by former U.S. champion Nicole Bobek and China's
Lu Chen. Then came the only Olympic champions in the women's field,
Witt and Oksana Baiul.
	   ``If the roof came down, the whole history of figure skating
would come down with it,'' Kwan said.
	   ``I had the chills in the warmup today. I looked at Oksana and
saw her '94 performance at the Olympics and Katarina and saw her at
the Olympics, and Lulu at worlds ... It was like a flashback. I saw
all their performances right before my eyes.''
	   But Kwan was better than all of them in an event that was open
to both pro and Olympic-level skaters for the first time. The
opening of the competition also allowed Yagudin to finish a year
similar to Kwan's _ no Olympic gold, but a pair of world
championship titles on the sports' two different levels.
	   ``This title I won is a nice end to this year, because it's my
last championships this year,'' said Yagudin, also 18.
	   Browning, with a nearly insurmountable deficit to make up after
a lackluster performance on Friday, had the crowd in an uproar with
a hilarious clown routine that received four perfect marks. But it
was only a moral victory for the Canadian, who usually takes the
competition more seriously than his fellow pros.
	   ``These pro titles mean a lot to me,'' Browning said. ``When I
became champion, it meant almost as much as the (Olympic-level)
world championships. This is the one I hold in my heart every
year.''
	   Todd Eldredge was third, followed by Rudy Galindo.
	   Still, nothing held more intrigue than the dance, where Usova
defeated both her ex-partner and ex-husband _ Alexander Zhulin _
and her ex-husband's former mistress _ Pasha Grischuk _ as she and
Platov danced romantically to ``Moonlight Sonata.''
	   ``It's a really, really difficult year for me,'' said Usova, who
divorced Zhulin this summer. ``I change all my life. I change where
I live. I change coach. I change partner. I change ice rinks. I
change everything. I even change my hair. It's just like everything
changes. But it's a good change, and right now I'm so happy.''
	   Grischuk and Zhulin finished third, behind Americans Elizabeth
Punsalan and Jerod Swallow.

Donkey carts and satellite dishes: Gaza's contradictions greet

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Watching workers struggle to raise
a giant American flag on Sunday in Gaza City's main square, college
student Ahmed Masoudi was unimpressed.
	   ``All these U.S. flags everywhere _ what's it for? For Clinton
to see for one day?'' the 18-year-old said on the eve of the
American president's arrival. ``We should think about the day
after.''
	   The Gaza Strip, a self-ruled sliver of Mediterranean coast
wedged between Israel and Egypt, is famous among Palestinians for
its fortunetellers and clairvoyants, but few of those living here
can agree on a vision of its future. The present is confounding
enough.
	   President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton will spend
only a few hours on the ground in Gaza Monday, but even such a
brief stay is sufficient to get a sense of its jarring
contradictions.
	   The region _ a complex patchwork of Palestinian refugee camps,
Jewish settlements and Israeli military bases _ has been under
Palestinian rule for the past four years. But most Palestinians
living here still feel suffocated by Israeli restrictions.
	   Israel controls the external borders, patrols the coastal
waters, grants or denies permits to travel to the West Bank,
regulates the water supply. Gaza is powerless even in the most
literal sense: it must buy its electricity from Israel.
	   Yet the sense of coming statehood may be strongest here.
Palestinians rejoiced last month over the opening of their
international airport in Gaza, their first gateway to the world,
and have made it clear that they consider Clinton's landing at it
akin to a presidential seal of approval for their larger
aspirations.
	   When Israel handed most of Gaza over to the Palestinians in the
wake of the Oslo peace accords, most Israelis were happy to let it
go. The land to which Israel laid biblical claim was in the West
Bank, not here. The late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was once
quoted as saying he wouldn't care if Gaza fell into the sea.
	   Gazans complain that Israel's nearly 30-year military occupation
_ which began when Israel seized the strip in the 1967 Mideast war
_ left them with an infrastructure either wrecked or never built to
begin with. When the six-year intefadeh, or uprising against
Israeli rule, trailed off in 1993, Gaza City _ a metropolis of
nearly half a million people _ did not even have a single traffic
light.
	   Now Gaza City presents a boomtown landscape, bristling with
satellite dishes and new high-rises _ though many buildings stand
unfinished because developers ran out of money midway, or absconded
with it.
	   An infusion of foreign aid helped pave main roads and even
create a few belts of greenery, but the spruced-up appearance
belies huge tracts of abject poverty, including the Shati refugee
camp in Gaza City, which the first lady will visit.
	   The strip's eight refugee camps, created when Palestinians fled
or were driven from their homes with the creation of Israel in
1948, are home to nearly 400,000 people.
	   The camps contain some of the world's most densely populated
areas, with among the highest fertility rates. Barefoot children
play in unpaved streets plied by donkey-drawn carts. Many people
live in concrete-block shacks with corrugated tin roofs topped with
rocks to keep them from blowing away.
	   Beautifying Gaza might seem like a contradiction in terms, but
in the days before the Clinton visit, workers were doing their best
to dispel the general impression of dinginess. In some areas where
his motorcade was to pass, workers planted flowers and applied
fresh coats of paint.
	   ``We should make Gaza look better, especially now that we have
this historic visit,'' said municipal spokesman Hamdi Abu Karsh.
	   Gaza's public mores are generally more conservative than in the
West Bank _ there are no movie theaters, alcohol is banned, and
nightspots are almost nonexistent. Perhaps because of that, the
Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal gives genuine offense to many here.
	   Fundamentalist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad were doing
all they could to capitalize on that distaste in advance of the
visit.
	   ``This trip is to serve Clinton first _ he has domestic
problems, and we should not pay the price for his immoral
behavior,'' said Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar. ``In Islam, a man
who has conducted such behavior deserves flogging, not an honorable
reception.''

AEK beats Panathinaikos 2-0, takes lead in Greek first division

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With one goal in each half from Vassilis
Lakis and Toni Savevski respectively, AEK Athens beat cross-town
Panathinaikos Sunday in a game for the Greek first division soccer
league.
	   The win, the seventh in a row at home, sent AEK atop the 18-team
standing with 29 points in 13 games.
	   Olympiakos Piraeus follows with 28 points. But the defending
champions may regain the lead if they beat last-placed cross-town
Ethnikos in the round's last game Monday.
	   Panathinaikos retained third place, tied with provisional Xanthi
at 25 points.
	   On Saturday, Xanthi played to a scoreless draw against Iraklis
Salonica at home.
	   In the round's major game, AEK dominated throughout, playing

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton tried Sunday to
repair the tattered Wye River peace accords with appeals to Israel
and the Palestinians to implement the difficult land-for-security
decisions they made two months ago.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured Clinton ``we
are prepared to do our part.'' But he linked any further Israeli
withdrawal on the West Bank to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
renouncing his plans to declare statehood and taking steps to
squelch violence.
	   ``I'm sure that we can achieve peace between Palestinians and
Israelis if we stand firm on Palestinian compliance,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   He urged Clinton to take that message to Arafat in Gaza on
Monday.
	   Clinton's three-day visit to the Middle East was initially
designed to celebrate the peace accords he mediated along the Wye
River of Maryland two months ago. But with the momentum for
impeachment growing back home and the peace agreement threatened,
the day took on a more somber tone.
	   Responding to questions at a news conference, Clinton said he
would not resign or admit perjury.
	   Netanyahu, who faces his own political troubles, offered Clinton
a hand. ``Your devotion to this cause, your perseverance, your
timeless energy, your commitment, have been an inspiration to us
all,'' he told the president.
	   And as he stood by the president's side, he admonished reporters
to focus on the matter at hand _ Mideast peacemaking _ rather than
the impeachment drama.
	   Clinton credited the Palestinian Authority with taking some
``important steps,'' including deeper security cooperation with
Israel and confiscating illegal weapons, but he was also critical.
	   ``Have the Palestinians fulfilled all their commitments?'' he
asked. ``They certainly could be doing better to preempt violent
demonstrations in the street. This is a terribly important
matter.''
	   Clinton renewed his pledge to ask Congress to provide dlrs 1.2
billion to help Israel take new security measures to carry out the
Wye accords. This is in addition to the dlrs 3 billion a year in
annual U.S. economic and military assistance that Israel gets.
	   At the same time, he cautioned that Israel needed to reach out
and not be preoccupied with security or live in a permanent state
of siege.
	   The Palestinians, he said in a speech to a mostly young audience
at the Jerusalem Convention Center, ``feel you should acknowledge
they, too, have suffered and have legitimate expectations that
should be met.''
	   ``And they are right, too,'' Clinton said.
	   On Monday, in Gaza, with Clinton in attendance, the Palestine
National Council is due to repeal articles of a founding charter
that call for Israel's destruction.
	   ``That will be a welcome development,'' Netanyahu said.
	   However, he accused Arafat of gross violations of the Wye and
other accords with Israel by declaring he would establish a
Palestinian state unilaterally if he could not get one through
negotiations.
	   ``I think no one can seriously expect Israel to hand over
another inch of territory unless and until such an unambiguous
correction is made,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Recognizing that Netanyahu and Arafat are being pressed by
critics of the accords they reached in the Wye negotiations,
Clinton exhorted the two leaders to revive the cooperation that led
to the accords. Officials held out the possibility of a three-way
meeting.
	   Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the
Clinton visit. At Clinton's hotel, 500 policemen were posted to
guard the president and his delegation.
	   Abdallah Shami, leader of the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza, said
in an interview with APTN that he would kill Clinton if he could
``with every method I can muster.''
	   ``I would not hesitate,'' Shami said.
	   But, he said, ``I don't know of anybody in Gaza who is thinking
of killing Clinton now.''
	   There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school
student was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   Two U.S. flags were burned at a rally attended by 2,000
followers of a radical PLO faction, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, which opposes the peace accords.
	   Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright underscored
that the administration wanted Israel to take the next scheduled
step in relinquishing more territory on the West Bank.
	   ``We would like this timetable to get back on track,'' she said.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In a divisive election aimed at the
U.S. Congress, Puerto Ricans voted Sunday on whether to petition
for statehood in the country that colonized this Caribbean island
100 years ago.
	   An extremely close race, Sunday's referendum pitted statehood
advocates against defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S.
commonwealth, in which islanders are U.S. citizens but have no vote
in Washington.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot
soon after voting stations opened. Voting was to end at 3 p.m.
(1900 GMT) and initial results were expected after 6 p.m. (2200
GMT).
	   ``It's very important because today is the day that could decide
what Puerto Rico desires. We have to demonstrate to the federal
government what the people want'', said Juan Aponte, 40, a pharmacy
technician who worked until 2 a.m. but got up early to vote.
	   Polls put both causes virtually even in the election, and heavy
turnout was expected among 2.2 million registered voters. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the non-binding referendum.
	   But mainlander Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old engineer from South
Carolina who has married and settled on the island, confronted the
95-year-old founder of the statehood party, Luis A. Ferre, to say
that Americans don't want Puerto Rico.
	   ``I know my people, and Americans don't want Puerto Rico to be a
state,'' Lewis, an election volunteer, told Ferre at a polling
station in southern Ponce city.

 &UR; Samaranch says corrupt members will be expelled

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch on Sunday promised to expel any members if they are found
guilty of accepting bribes.
	   Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations of corruption
in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member
Marc Hodler.
	   But he said the allegations would be considered by a special IOC
panel looking into alleged rules violations by the Salt Lake group
which won the 2002 Winter Games.
	   ``If it is necessary, we will expel members if this commission
feels these members are guilty,'' Samaranch said at a news
conference. ``After we get the recommendations of the panel, we
will take the measures necessary to arrange the problem.''
	   Samaranch said the IOC was intent on protecting the integrity of
the organization and the Olympics as a whole.
	   ``If we have to clean, we will clean,'' he said. ``After, the
IOC will be even stronger than before.''
	   Samaranch said he was taken aback by Hodler's allegations, which
were made to reporters Saturday. Samaranch said Hodler should have
brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board.
	   ``For me, I was really surprised. If he has names and evidence,
he must go to the executive board.''
	   Hodler said he believed four agents _ including one IOC member _
had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He said he
thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _ currently numbering 115
_ were open to bribery.
	   Samaranch denied that he ``muzzled'' Hodler, as the Swiss
official claimed earlier Sunday. He said he had told all members of
the executive board that only himself and director general Francois
Carrad could speak to the media.
	   ``This is not the first time I do this,'' he said.
	   Samaranch expressed his respect and admiration for Hodler and
ruled out the possbility of expelling him from the IOC, an option
the Swiss member had raised.
	   ``Never, never, is anyone thinking to expel Mr. Hodler,''
Samaranch said.
	   The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping Salt Lake
City of the games over alleged rules violations during the bid.
	   ``No, there is not any kind of possibiity,'' he said. ``We trust
the organizing committee of Salt Lake City.''
	   The Salt Lake controvery centers on a scholarship program that
provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other assistance to 13
individuals _ including six relatives of IOC members, mostly from
Africa.
	   Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure
to eliminate the tempations for corruption in the selection of host
cities. Under current rules, all IOC members have a vote.
	   Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the formula used by sports
federations such as FIFA, world soccer's governing body, which
assign their executive boards to select sites.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead UPDATES with possible new German-NATO
disagreement. trims pvs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ With the dust just settling over a
suggestion by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer that NATO
rethink its first-strike nuclear policy, a remark by the country's
defense minister released Sunday raised the prospect of a possible
new dispute over NATO strategy.
	   In an interview to be published in the Monday edition of the
Berliner Zeitung, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping was quoted as
saying he ``discounted'' NATO intervening in regions distant from
Europe.
	   The report quoted Scharping as saying that ``here and there such
considerations may exist. But the strategy of the alliance will be
decided in consensus.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a NATO
meeting in Brussels last Tuesday that the alliance must be prepared
to take action beyond its borders, while rejecting concerns that
this would create a new global NATO as ``hogwash.''
	   Albright pointed to Bosnia and Kosovo as outside NATO regions
were the alliance has already adapted to a new strategic
environment to prevent unrest from spreading.
	   NATO defense ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels again
starting Wednesday, and Sharping's comments could renew frowns over
Germany's new center-left coalition, now that Fischer was forced to
admit his suggestion got nowhere.
	   Fischer got some diplomatic forgiveness from NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana, who was quoted by a newspaper Sunday as
saying he saw no dispute with the German defense minister.
	   In an interview with the Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag, Solana
was quoted as saying he had understanding for Fischer and that it
was legitimate to question NATO strategy. He also said Fischer's
contribution to last week's NATO meeting was ``definitely
constructive.''
	   At the same time, Solana told the newspaper atomic weapons
remained important as a deterrence against a mass-destruction
weapons threat and that the Germans were well aware of that.
	   Fischer, an environmentalist Green and 1980s anti-nuclear
activist, drew tough criticism from opposition politicians in
Germany when he suggested last month that NATO would help defuse
tensions in the world by getting rid of what he called an outmoded
first-strike nuclear strategy.
	   The strategy was originally developed to prevent Warsaw Pact
forces from invading western Europe, a threat which no longer
exists.
	   At the same time Fischer said he didn't expect to find consensus
for his suggestion, but just wanted to jog NATO planners into
updating their strategy. NATO's three nuclear powers, the United
States, Britain and France were among those rejecting Fischer's
suggestion.

Hillary Clinton asks Arabs and Jews to live together

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWE SHALOM, Israel (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton lit a Hanukkah
candle, a Christmas tree and a Ramadan lantern Sunday as she
promoted Jewish-Arab coexistence as the basis for a lasting peace.
	   ``Religion should not be an instigator of war, but a bridge to
peace,'' Mrs. Clinton told school children in Newe Shalom, a
village tucked into a hillside west of Jerusalem where 36 Arab and
Jewish families live together.
	   Referring to the fragile Wye River peace agreement her husband
helped negotiate and is now trying to rescue, Mrs. Clinton said
that ``the strong belief that peace will prevail must once again be
reinforced.''
	   The remarks were broadcast live by both Israeli television
stations. At each stop of her tour, she was attended by a phalanx
of Israeli reporters.
	   Israelis have paid particular attention to Mrs. Clinton's
remarks since May, when she told high school students in Geneva
that she thought a Palestinian state would make for a stabler
Mideast. The statement was disavowed by the White House.
	   Israel says talk of Palestinian statehood is subject to final
status negotiations. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has angered
Israelis by saying he will declare a Palestinian state next year.
	   Israeli reporters repeatedly asked Mrs. Clinton _ accompanied at
each of her stops by Sarah Netanyahu, wife of the Israeli prime
minister, whether she still endorsed a Palestinian state.
	   She ignored the questions.
	   ``The president's wife is here to see us, because there is peace
here,'' said Manar Gabriel of Newe Shalom, a member of a
fourth-grade dance troop bedecked with gold pantaloons and
brightly-colored scarves.
	   The Utopian settlement's teachings have failed to catch on in
Israel, where Jews and Arabs live separately, and its teachings are
anathema to Netanyahu's hard-line government _ a fact not lost on
Rayek Rizek, the settlement's mayor.
	   After praising Mrs. Clinton's interest in the village, Rizek
turned to Mrs. Netanyahu and said: ``It is no secret that the
interest of the world in (Newe Shalom) has never been matched by a
similar degree of interest here.''
	   It was a message subtly conveyed at all of Mrs. Clinton's stops.
	   At a children's ward in Hadassah Hospital, she praised the
hospital for treating all patients equally, regardless of their
backgrounds, and made a point of meeting with both Jewish and Arab
children.
	   She especially praised the transplant work at the hospital,
noting that organs had been transplanted from Arabs to Jews and
Jews to Arabs.
	   ``You are truly doing God's work by making us recognize our
common humanity,'' she said.
	   That irked David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu.
	   ``I was really surprised that the president's wife was surprised
that so many patients at Hadassah Hospital were Arabs and that the
exchange of implants was done regardless of whether the patients
were Arabs or Jews,'' he told The Associated Press.

	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Low turnout marked the
second round of legislative elections Sunday in the Central African
Republic, where the ruling party and the opposition are vying for
control of parliament.
	   International observers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
estimated the turnout at 35-40 percent just before polling ended at
at 6 p.m. It was not clear when results would be released.
	   The run-up to the election has been marred by violence,
including a Wednesday clash between supporters of the ruling party
and the opposition that left six people wounded in Bangui, the
capital.
	   Fearing more violence, government soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers
patrolled the city and polling places throughout the country, but
there were no immediate reports of disturbances.
	   Fourteen political parties, many of them set up along ethnic
lines, are vying for the 63 seats that were not captured in the
first round of voting on Nov. 22. Fifty-five seats are needed to
take control of 109-seat parliament.
	   President Ange-Felix Patasse's ruling Movement for the
Liberation of the People of Centrafrique, or MLPC, won 26 slots in
the first round and opposition parties won 20.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ If it wasn't for U.S. President
Bill Clinton's huge security detail, the leader of a small Islamic
militant group says he would kill the president when he comes to
the Gaza Strip on Monday.
	   Clinton is in the Mideast to try and salvage the accord he
worked out between Israelis and Palestinians at Wye River in
Maryland in October.
	   ``I don't know of anybody in Gaza who is thinking of killing
Clinton now,'' Abdallah Shami, the leader of the Islamic Jihad told
the Spanish TV station Antenna 3 on Sunday.
	   ``But if the Wye River agreement involves a change in the
Palestinian position to the worse, and somebody does kill him, I
will be happy,'' said Shami, relaxing in his Gaza City office
decorated with Islamic calligraphy praising God.
	   Asked if he would kill Clinton, he said: ``If I could I would,
with every method I can muster. I would not hesitate. Clinton is
coming with 1,200 security men.''
	   Palestinian militants oppose Wye because it does not finalize
Palestinian claims to statehood and sovereignty in Jerusalem; and
because it explicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist.
	   The militants also accuse Arafat of kowtowing to Israel and the
Americans during an increase in violence sparked by an Israeli
refusal to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
	   Arafat has cracked down on Islamic militants since Wye, and
Hamas _ the more significant militant Islamic group _ has kept its
criticism of the Clinton visit to a minimum, fearful of further
restrictions.
	   Clinton's visit is seen by the Palestinians and Israelis as
endorsing Palestinian aspirations to statehood, and Arafat is
anxious to make the U.S. leader feel welcome.
	   Israel rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state, and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has expressed its
displeasure with some aspects of the Clinton visit _ but Shami says
he still identifies Clinton with the Israeli enemy.
	   ``Our people know that the bullets that are killing our sons in
the West Bank are Israeli bullets, that the bulldozers that are
building the settlements are Israeli, the aircraft that bombed our
refugee camps and our homes are American planes,'' he said.
	   Clinton ``can't suddenly turn into a friend and a hero. He will
always remain as one of the biggest enemies of the Palestinian
people.''

 &UR; Samaranch says corrupt members will be expelled
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further comments
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch on Sunday promised to expel any members if they are found
guilty of accepting bribes.
	   Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations of corruption
in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member
Marc Hodler.
	   But he said the allegations would be considered by a special IOC
panel looking into alleged rules violations by the Salt Lake group
which won the 2002 Winter Games.
	   ``If it is necessary, we will expel members if this commission
feels these members are guilty,'' Samaranch said at a news
conference. ``After we get the recommendations of the panel, we
will take the measures necessary to arrange the problem.''
	   Samaranch said the IOC was intent on protecting the integrity of
the organization and the Olympics as a whole.
	   ``If we have to clean, we will clean,'' he said. ``After, the
IOC will be even stronger than before.''
	   Samaranch said the current situation was as serious for the IOC
as the political boycotts of the 1980s and Ben Johnson's doping
scandal at the 1988 Seoul Games.
	   ``They were difficult moments, and now we are facing another
difficult moment,'' he said. ``I am sure that we will solve this
problem. After the black day, the sun will come again.''
	   ``I am a bit disappointed,'' he added. ``I am surprised. I am
not happy, but my obligation as president of the IOC is to look
forward to try to solve the problems and to reinforce the Olympic
movement.''
	   Samaranch said he was taken aback by Hodler's allegations, which
were made to reporters Saturday. Samaranch said Hodler should have
brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board.
	   ``For me, I was really surprised. If he has names and evidence,
he must go to the executive board.''
	   Hodler said he believed four agents _ including one IOC member _
had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He said he
thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _ currently numbering 115
_ were open to bribery.
	   Samaranch denied that he ``muzzled'' Hodler, as the Swiss
official claimed earlier Sunday. He said he had told all members of
the executive board that only himself and director general Francois
Carrad could speak to the media.
	   ``This is not the first time I do this,'' he said.
	   Samaranch expressed his respect and admiration for Hodler and
ruled out the possibility of expelling him from the IOC, an option
the Swiss member had raised.
	   ``Never, never, is anyone thinking to expel Mr. Hodler,''
Samaranch said.
	   The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping Salt Lake
City of the games over alleged rules violations during the bid.
	   ``No, there is not any kind of possibiity,'' he said. ``We trust
the organizing committee of Salt Lake City.''
	   The Salt Lake controversy centers on a scholarship program that
provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other assistance to 13
individuals _ including six relatives of IOC members, mostly from
Africa.
	   Samaranch said he expected the IOC inquiry to be wrapped up
before the end of January.
	   Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure
to eliminate the temptations for corruption in the selection of
host cities. Under current rules, all IOC members have a vote.
	   Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the formula used by sports
federations such as FIFA, world soccer's governing body, which
assign their executive boards to select sites.

Aston Villa back on top after rallying to beat Arsenal 3-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 10th graf to eight losses in last 11 for
Liverpool &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dion Dublin got the winner in the 83rd minute as
Aston Villa rallied with three second-half goals Sunday to beat
Arsenal 3-2 at Villa Park and regain first place in England's
Premier League.
	   Meanwhile, Wimbledon defeated slumping Liverpool 1-0 on Robbie
Earle's 48th mintue goal.
	   Villa has 33 points followed by Manchester United (30), Chelsea
(29), Middlesbrough (27), Leeds (26), Arsenal (26), West Ham (26),
Wimbledon (26) and Leicester (24).
	   Arsenal, the defending league and F.A. Cup champions, pulled
ahead 2-0 on two first-half strikes by Dutch striker Dennis
Bergkamp, who returned to the lineup after missing four games and
pushed his season goal total to four.
	   But Villa rallied with a strike in the 62nd by Julian Joachim
and then two by Dublin in the 65th and 83rd. Dublin, who got the
winner on a 12-meter (yard) shot off a corner, has made Villa a
title contender since moving earlier in the season from Coventry on
a 5.75-million pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer.
	   Villa, which dropped out of first place on Saturday for the
first time all season, moved back on top with 33 points to 30 for
Manchester United.
	   In Sunday's other match, Wimbledon kept up Liverpool's misery
with a 1-0 victory on a 48th-minute goal by Robbie Earle.
	   Wimbledon, the low budget team that defies critics, has reached
the semifinals of League Cup and _ with this win _ moved into
eighth place on 26 points.
	   Liverpool, which played well and deserved a least a tie, was
doomed when Michael Owen missed a late penalty to tie on the eve of
his 19th birthday.
	   Liverpool stayed on 22 points in 12th place. The Reds have lost
eight of their last 11 games _ their worst run in 44 years _ and
were ousted last week from the European UEFA Cup.
	   On Saturday, Manchester United drew 2-2 at Tottenham, but United
should have had a victory as it blew a 2-0 lead on two headers in
the last 20 minutes by Tottenham's Sol Campbell.
	   Chelsea also blew its chance to move to the top of English
soccer for the first time since 1989, drawing 2-2 with Derby when
substitute Dean Sturridge scored in second-half injury time to
equalize for the Rams.
	   Middlesbrough, promoted back to the Premier League this season,
won 1-0 at home over West Ham and dominated the match with the
winner from Brian Deane in the 40th.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Blackburn 0, Newcastle
0; Everton 1, Southampton 0; Leicester 3, Nottingham Forest 1;
Sheffield Wednesday 3, Charlton 0.
	   In Monday's only match, Leeds played host to Coventry.
	   On Sunday in England's first division, Grimsby won at Portsmouth
1-0. On Saturday, Sunderland won at home 2-0 over Port Vale on
goals by Martin Smith (24th) and Paul Butler (44th) to stay in
first place with 49 points, seven clear of Ipswich. Ipswich lost
2-0 at home to Barnsley and stayed on 42 points.
	   In Scotland, Rangers defeated second-place Kilmarnock 1-0 on Rod
Wallace's goal in the 10th. Rangers have 34 points to 31 for
Kilmarnock and 27 for third-place Celtic.
	   In other Scottish Premier League games: Aberdeen 2, Hearts 0;
Dundee United 1, Celtic 1; Dunfermline 1, Motherwell 1; St.
Johnstone 1, Dundee 1.

BBC survey indicates Britons' ignorance over the euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British Broadcasting Corp. survey published
Sunday indicates most Britons do not know the name of the European
single currency, how much it is worth or when its notes and coins
will be introduced.
	   The currency, called the euro, is being introduced for 11 EU
countries, excluding Britain, on January 1. The launch is meant to
create a single bloc that will rival the United States and Japan as
a global economic power.
	   Although the government has said it broadly supports entry into
the euro, most Britons remain skeptical about whether joining would
be good for Britain. The government has said it will not make a
decision until it has seen the effect of the new currency.
	   The telephone survey of 1,000 people, conducted by research
group Audience Selection between Nov. 27 and Nov. 29, revealed that
51 percent of Britons cannot name the euro, with guesses at its
name including Equarder, Ecru, Etu, Eu and Curo.
	   Estimates of its value ranged from one penny to 8 pounds (dlrs
13.20), with 10 percent of those questioned knowing it would be
worth about 70 pence (dlrs 1.15).
	   Most people thought they would be able to use notes and cash
next year, with only 5 percent knowing they would not be introduced
until 2002, the BBC said.
	   The survey had a margin of error of 3 percent.
	   Bankers are divided over how the British pound will respond next
year to the introduction of the euro and the melding of 11 European
economies.
	   On Wednesday, investor George Soros told a House of Commons
committee that the pound could be vulnerable to speculators if
Britain didn't join the single currency, while most economists say
the new currency is unlikely to make an immediate difference.
	   Soros, whose speculative attacks on the pound were a factor in
forcing it out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992,
reiterated his view in an interview on London Weekend Television on
Sunday.
	   Chief Treasury Secretary Stephen Byers rejected those warnings
Sunday, but he conceded the launch of the euro could lead to
speculation affecting currencies worldwide.
	   ``George Soros himself concedes that he's made quite a few
blunders himself,'' Byers told satellite television network SKY
News. ``I think he's wrong, and the evidence he gave before the
Treasury Select Committee wasn't as clear as that.
	   ``What he did say was that, clearly, once we get the single
currency established in the New Year there may be speculation not
just affecting the pound but across the world, and I think we need
to look very carefully at that.''

U.N. inspectors go out on last day of surprise visits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with details of inspections &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo Bag-101
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors visited 25 places Sunday on
the last day of their current round of search for Iraq's illegal
weapons, Iraqi and U.N. officials said.
	   Ten groups of experts of the United Nations Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency carried out 25 surprise
and scheduled checks, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   It quoted Gen. Hussam Mohammed Amin, head of the Iraqi National
Monitoring Directorate, as saying that two of the teams used
helicopters. No details were provided.
	   Amin's office liaises with UNSCOM and IAEA, which are
responsible for dismantling Iraq's banned programs for nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long range missiles.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of these weapons,
U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot
be lifted.
	   UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said most of the visiting 40
inspectors left the country on Sunday and the rest will leave
Monday.
	   Up to 140 resident experts will, however, remain in Iraq to
monitor previously inspected sites to ensure that Iraq does not use
them for illegal purposes.
	   INA quoted Amin as saying that Roger Hill, the Australian who
led the inspections this week, also left with the others for
Bahrain Sunday, the day he was planning to carry out a check.
	   Hill did not explain to the Iraqis ``the reasons behind cutting
short his visit and the sudden return to Bahrain,'' Amin was quoted
as saying.
	   This week's searches have been the most intensive since last
month when Iraq allowed UNSCOM to resume its work that was halted
in August.
	   Iraq recapitulated only hours before the United States had
planned to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam
Hussein's government also pledged full cooperation to the
inspectors, and the latest searches are seen as a test of that.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler is expected to report
soon on the level of Iraqi cooperation to the U.N. Security
Council.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Sunday accused Butler of prolonging the
inspections and the sanctions.
	   Butler's ``aggressive policy toward Iraq'' is aimed at
undermining Iraq's independence, said al-Thawra daily, a government
newspaper.
	   ``The continuation of the Commission's work means the
continuation of sanctions and plotting against Iraq,'' said the
pro-government al-Qadissiya daily in an editorial.

Protests leave drivers in dire straits

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece is suffering through a bad case of
clogged arteries.
	   Striking workers and other demonstrators have staged nearly
daily roadblocks, turning any journey into a potential gridlock
grind.
	   Even motorists accustomed to Athens' epic traffic problems are
showing signs of frustration at the staggering tie-ups during the
traditional pre-holiday wave of protests. One taxi driver said he
bought a cassette of nature sounds to calm his nerves during the
interminable waits during the traffic jams.
	   This year's road rage is amplified by an usual array of
demonstrators taking to the streets _ from angry soccer fans to
students upset about education reforms. The government's austerity
measures to meet European Union standards have also launched dozens
of protest rallies.
	   The ability to cause major traffic disruptions has become a
major weapon of the protesters. And there is little chance of being
forcibly removed by Greek police, which generally take a laissez
faire attitude with peaceful protests.
	   On occasion, no more that a few dozen protesters have blocked
Greece's main highway, leading from Athens to the northern port of
Salonica. The highway could soon be the scene for more blockades by
farmers seeking concessions such as easing some crop limits.
	   In 1997, farmers used their tractors and field equipment to
close the highway for more than a month, stranding thousands of
trucks and causing a loss of more than dlrs 150 million in
international and domestic trade.
	   High school students also have gotten into the road block fever.
	   Students, who are occupying about 1,500 schools around Greece,
have begun daily blockades of busy roads of Athens and other towns.
Motorists who dared complain to kids at roadblock in Salonica
Friday were pelted with eggs.
	   The students oppose changes that would drop the single
university entrance exam and place greater weight on course work
and a series of tests to determine admission.
	   ``It's always us who pay for anything going on. They
(demonstrators) want to get noticed, but why should we have to be
put through this? I've been stuck here for two hours,'' an elderly
woman in Athens told television reporters from her driver seat,
near a school roadblock.
	   Motorists were recently put through additional strain when a
customs workers strike dried up gasoline supplies for days. Then
torrential rain last month washed away a bridge on the
Athens-Salonica highway.
	   In Salonica, furious soccer supporters staged a giant
demonstration in the city center after a local soccer team was
punished for crowd violence.
	   Claiming the penalty was aimed at helping Athens teams, they
also briefly blocked the highway to Athens and set fire in the
street to television converter boxes of the pay channel that shows
Greek soccer games.
	   Many of the other protests are against a string of government
reforms introduced this fall. These include pension and health fund
mergers, changes to school and university systems and efforts to
streamline public transport.
	   Unions have called a general strike for Tuesday, expected to
stop all public services for a day.
	   Choking traffic in a city like Athens is not difficult. It is
now home to more than 4 million of Greece population of 10.2
million. A study conducted by the company building a new subway for
the city predicted that by 2020, cars in greater Athens will almost
double from their current number of about 1.5 million.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In a divisive election aimed at the
U.S. Congress, Puerto Ricans voted Sunday on whether to petition
for statehood in the country that colonized this Caribbean island
100 years ago.
	   An extremely close race, Sunday's referendum pitted statehood
advocates against defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S.
commonwealth, in which islanders are U.S. citizens but have no vote
in Washington.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot
soon after voting stations opened. Voting was to end at 3 p.m.
(1900 GMT) and initial results were expected after 6 p.m. (2200
GMT).
	   ``It's very important because today is the day that could decide
what Puerto Rico desires. We have to demonstrate to the federal
government what the people want'', said Juan Aponte, 40, a pharmacy
technician who worked until 2 a.m. but got up early to vote.
	   Polls put both causes virtually even in the election, and heavy
turnout was expected among 2.2 million registered voters. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the non-binding referendum.
	   But mainlander Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old engineer from South
Carolina who has married and settled on the island, confronted the
95-year-old founder of the statehood party, Luis A. Ferre, to say
that Americans don't want Puerto Rico.
	   ``I know my people, and Americans don't want Puerto Rico to be a
state,'' Lewis, an election volunteer, told Ferre at a polling
station in southern Ponce city.
	   In San Juan, thousands of voters gathered at political parties'
headquarters, dancing, eating and drinking at massive street
parties. On the highways, people drove cars with U.S. and Puerto
Rican flags and campaign banners flapping from windows.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lew Grade, the cigar-chomping, legendary
entertainment tycoon who founded Britain's first commercially
funded television company, died Sunday. He was 91.
	   Lord Grade, whose projects included the TV series, ``The
Saint,'' and the movie ``On Golden Pond,'' died of heart failure at
the London Clinic which he entered two weeks ago for surgery, his
spokesman Dennis Michael said.
	   His wife, Kathie, who he married 56 years ago, and their adopted
son, Paul, were at his bedside.
	   Grade, the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in
London's East End. He gave up an early career as a hoofer to start
a small showbiz agency office in 1934.
	   His wife, Kathie, who he married 56 years ago, and their adopted
son, Paul, were at his bedside.
	   Grade, the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in
London's East End. He gave up an early career as hoofer to start a
small showbiz agency office in 1934.
	   Twenty-one years later _ and a lineup of contracts with stars
who included Edith Piaf, July Garland, Mario Lanza and Bob Hope _
Grade founded Associated Television, the first commercially funded
channel launched to face the formidable competition of the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Grade, who was knighted in 1963 and given a life peerage in
1976, never stopped working. His last movie, a weepy called
``Something To Believe In,'' was made this year _ and panned by
most critics.
	   For more than 70 years, Grade rode showbiz rapids _ with a

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The leader of the Islamic Jihad
opposition group was detained by Palestinian police Sunday after he
said in a TV interview that he would not hestitate to kill U.S.
President Bill Clinton if he had the chance.
	   The Islamic leader, Abdallah Shami, was taken into custody on
Sunday afternoon, as he walked from a Gaza City junior high school
where he teaches to his home in the Shijaiyah district, said a
Palestinian police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In an interview with the Spanish TV station Antenna 3, Shami had
said earlier Sunday that if it wasn't for Clinton's huge security
detail, he would kill the president when he comes to the Gaza Strip
on Monday.
	   Clinton is in the Mideast to try and salvage the accord he
worked out between Israelis and Palestinians at Wye River in
Maryland in October.
	   However, Shami said he knew of no specific plans to attack the
president. ``I don't know of anybody in Gaza who is thinking of
killing Clinton now,'' Shami said.
	   ``But if the Wye River agreement involves a change in the
Palestinian position to the worse, and somebody does kill him, I
will be happy,'' said Shami, relaxing in his Gaza City office
decorated with Islamic calligraphy praising God.
	   Asked if he would kill Clinton, he said: ``If I could I would,
with every method I can muster. I would not hesitate. Clinton is
coming with 1,200 security men.''
	   Palestinian militants oppose Wye because it does not finalize
Palestinian claims to statehood and sovereignty in Jerusalem; and
because it explicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist.
	   The militants also accuse Arafat of kowtowing to Israel and the
Americans during an increase in violence sparked by an Israeli
refusal to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
	   Arafat has cracked down on Islamic militants since Wye, and
Hamas _ the more significant militant Islamic group _ has kept its
criticism of the Clinton visit to a minimum, fearful of further
restrictions.
	   Clinton's visit is seen by the Palestinians and Israelis as
endorsing Palestinian aspirations to statehood, and Arafat is
anxious to make the U.S. leader feel welcome.
	   Israel rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state, and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has expressed its
displeasure with some aspects of the Clinton visit _ but Shami says
he still identifies Clinton with the Israeli enemy.
	   ``Our people know that the bullets that are killing our sons in
the West Bank are Israeli bullets, that the bulldozers that are
building the settlements are Israeli, the aircraft that bombed our
refugee camps and our homes are American planes,'' he said.
	   Clinton ``can't suddenly turn into a friend and a hero. He will
always remain as one of the biggest enemies of the Palestinian
people.''

Italian media: Hodler's charges an attack on Turin 2006
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian media rallied around the Fiat auto family
Sunday, dismissing a top Olympic official's bribery allegations as
an attempt to derail Turin's candidacy for the 2006 Winter Games.
	   ``Low blow to Turin,'' read the headline in the Rome-based
Corriere dello Sport newspaper.
	   Marc Hodler, an executive board member of the International
Olympic Committee and former head of the International Ski
Federation, claimed Saturday that Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had
given out free vans to sway votes during the campaign which led to
the selection of the Italian resort of Sestriere to host the 1997
skiing World Championships.
	   The Agnelli family owns Fiat and holds major interests in hotels
and real estate in Sestriere, which is also the centerpiece of
Turin's 2006 bid. The family also controls the company which runs
the ski lifts and cable ways in the area west of Turin that
neighbors France.
	   ``Hodler did not provide a stitch of proof,'' wrote La Gazzetta
dello Sport editor Candido Cannavo in a front-page column under the
headline, ``A low blow to Turin 2006 ... the most vile
accusations.''
	   Gazzetta, like other newspapers and television reports,
portrayed Hodler's attack as an effort to help the efforts of Sion,
Switzerland, to land the 2006 Olympics.
	   Hodler, 80, is Swiss.
	   ``Even the dirty tricks that, unfortunately, come along for
every Olympic candidacy should have limits of decency,'' Cannavo
wrote. ``In this case, though, the limit was barbarically crossed
by Marc Hodler ... who, in the name of his Sion, slings mud on the
Sestriere World Championships to hurt the Turin candidacy.''
	   Cannavo also criticized Hodler for making the accusations ``on
the first anniversary of the death of someone who cannot defend
himself: Giovanni Agnelli ... who was president of the Sestriere
Committee.''
	   Giovanni Agnelli, Gianni's nephew and the heir-apparent to the
Fiat empire, died of cancer at age 33 a year ago Sunday.
	   Fiat issued a statement Saturday, rejecting Hodler's claims as
``completely false'' and threatening legal action.
	   The IOC disassociated itself from Hodler's allegations.
	   ``We are extremely sorry if these statements have caused pain
and embarrassment to the Agnelli family and Fiat,'' IOC president
Juan Antonio Samaranch said in a statement.
	   Holder's comments on the ski championships came as part of a
series of explosive allegations in which he charged that the
Olympics selection process is riddled with corruption, with agents
demanding up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes.

U.N. inspectors go out on last day of surprise visits

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with information on inspections &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors visited 25 places Sunday on
the last day of their current round of searches for signs of Iraqi
weapons programs banned by the United Nations, Iraqi and U.N.
officials said.
	   Ten groups of experts of the United Nations Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency carried out the
inspections, some of which were surprise checks, the official Iraqi
News Agency said.
	   It quoted Gen. Hussam Mohammed Amin, head of the Iraqi National
Monitoring Directorate, as saying that two of the teams used
helicopters.
	   No details, or results of the searches, were provided.
	   Amin's office works together with UNSCOM and IAEA, which are
responsible for dismantling Iraq's banned programs for nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long range missiles.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of these weapons,
U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot
be lifted.
	   UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said most of the visiting 40
inspectors left the country on Sunday and the rest will leave
Monday.
	   Up to 140 resident experts will remain in Iraq to monitor
previously inspected sites to ensure that Iraq does not use them
illegally.
	   INA quoted Amin as saying that Roger Hill, the Australian who
led the inspections this week, also left with the others for
Bahrain Sunday, the day he was planning to carry out a check. Hill
did not explain why he cut short his visit, Amin was quoted as
saying.
	   This week's searches have been the most intensive since last
month, when Iraq allowed UNSCOM to resume its work after halting
the inspections in August.
	   Iraq recapitulated only hours before the United States had
planned to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam
Hussein's government also pledged full cooperation to the
inspectors, and the latest searches have been seen as a test of
that pledge.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler is expected to report
soon on the level of Iraqi cooperation to the U.N. Security
Council.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Sunday accused Butler of prolonging the
inspections and the sanctions.
	   Butler's ``aggressive policy toward Iraq'' is aimed at
undermining Iraq's independence, said al-Thawra daily, a government
newspaper.
	   ``The continuation of the Commission's work means the
continuation of sanctions and plotting against Iraq,'' said the
pro-government al-Qadissiya daily in an editorial.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Richard Holbrooke billed it as a more
moderate approach to help solve the 24-year-division of Cyprus.
	   But Sunday's meeting of Greek and Turkish Cypriot business
leaders once again ran afoul of the bitter disputes that have kept
the eastern Mediterranean island separated since 1974, when Turkish
troops invaded its northern third after an abortive Athens-backed
coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.
	   With war once again threatening to visit the island because of a
Greek Cypriot decision to deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles, the
meeting provided an opportunity for the two communities to show
they are willing to talk and show goodwill.
	   ``Simply by being here we have continued an important part in
bringing reconciliation,'' Holbrooke said at the end of the first
day of meetings. ``I am encouraged by the spirit we have seen here
... and hope that authorities in the region support these people.''
	   But Holbrooke will not stay for the second day. He will fly to
Athens Monday for meetings with Greece's defense and foreign
ministers and talks about the S-300's, demonstrating Washington's
desire to quickly solve the problem.
	   Cyprus says it is determined to deploy the weapons and Turkey
has threatened to use force to stop them. One proposal is to base
them on the Greek island of Crete, but it has so far not panned
out.
	   Holbrooke, architect of the Bosnian peace agreement and the
recent Kosovo ceasefire, has refused to comment publicly on the
issue, indicating that developments may be at a crucial point.
	   The envoy also did not sound optimistic that a solution on
Cyprus may soon be found when he outlined the results of meetings
here.
	   ``If we can't solve it, at least we can improve conditions,''
Holbrooke said.
	   Organized by teams headed by David Phillips of Columbia
University's International Conflict Resolution Program and Dan
Smith of the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo,
Norway, with sponsorship from the American and Norwegian
governments, it was the third such meeting since late 1997.
	   Among the issues discussed were ways to solve Cyprus' critical
water problem. Turkish Cypriots currently import water from the
mainland by giant balloons towed by boats, while Greek Cypriots are
building a desalination plant.
	   Although the delegations also agreed to try and launch projects
to have their languages taught in each others schools, to establish
an agreement to have cellular phones work on both sides of the
island, and make efforts to restore historic monuments, politics
managed to creep into the meeting.
	   ``We came here to unite Cyprus, not separate it,'' said
Constatinos Lordos, head of the Greek Cypriot delegation.
	   He made the comment after Vedat Celik, head of the Turkish
Cypriot group, made a statement calling for international
recognition of the northern breakaway state. Only Turkey recognizes
the north, where it maintains 35,000 troops. Turkish Cypriots say
that has led to a de facto international trade embargo on the
north.
	   But Holbrooke managed to get the 20 business people from both
sides back to basics by reminding them that the meeting was
designed to avoid politics and deal with practical issues that can
be addressed by the entrepreneurial community.
	   ``We didn't come to Istanbul to settle the Cyprus question. The
two sides have to do that,'' Holbrooke said.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks have been deadlocked since late 1997, after
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insisted on recognition and an
end to negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European Union.
	   Turkish Cypriots say the island can't join the EU _ of which
Greece is a member _ until Turkey joins the Union. But the EU last
year rejected Turkey as a candidate. Holbrooke late Saturday told
the delegates that the EU decision was a ``disaster.''
	   But Holbrooke said he placed great importance on the business
meeting as ``this doesn't change the objective realities of Cyprus,
but it helps smooth down the edges so we don't have a tragedy again
like we had in the past.''

Van Gastel goal keeps Vitesse at a distance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Jean-Paul van Gastel's last-minute
free-kick gave Feyenoord a 1-1 draw at Vitesse Arnhem Sunday and
kept the gap between the top two at six points.
	   Feyenoord (13-3-1) has a game in hand over second-placed Vitesse
(11-3-4) and hosts third-placed Ajax next Sunday.
	   The game was a dismal spectacle with not losing uppermost in
both teams' minds, until Ghanean substitute Matthew Amoah's strike
four minutes from time gave Vitesse hope of narrowing the gap.
	   The top of the Dutch premiership remained unchanged as numbers
three and four, Ajax and SC Heerenveen also played to a draw, this
one entertaining but scoreless.
	   Ajax's first game under new coach Jan Wouters, who replaced
fired Dane Morten Olsen Saturday, should have produced three points
but Frank de Boer missed an 18th-minute penalty.
	   The spot kick was awarded after the star of the game, Danish
left-winger Jesper Gronkjaer, was pulled down by Max Houttuin.
	   On Saturday Bobby Robson's PSV continued its recent pattern of
attacking flair and defensive profligacy, gifting Roda JC two goals
in the final four minutes and a 3-3 draw.
	   PSV's brilliant strikeforce of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Belgian
Luc Nilis had taken PSV to a 3-1 lead with four minutes to play.
	   The first two came from League top-scorer Van Nistelrooy, the
second a 45 meter (50-yard) dipping shot which sailed over Roda
keeper Zeljo Kalac's head and into the top corner.
	   The wonder-goal took van Nistelrooy to 16 for the season and
Nilis is tied for second top marksman on 12, after his elegant solo
strike made it 3-1.
	   But PSV failed to mark Nigerian Garba Lawal at a corner for 3-1,
then keeper Ronald Waterreus cleared the ball straight to Dane Marc
Nygard, who shot into an empty net to tie up the game.
	   Despite scoring ten times in its last three games, PSV (7-7-4)
gained just five points after conceding nine goals.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid and Real Sociedad traded team
flags Sunday to unite against soccer violence as players and
spectators mourned a Spanish fan who was stabbed to death by a
supporter of a rival squad.
	   At Madrid's cavernous Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, some 65,000
people fell silent for one moment in memory of Aitor Zabaleta, a
28-year-old Basque stabbed in the chest outside Madrid's other
major football arena, the Vicente Calderon, before a UEFA Cup match
on Tuesday.
	   Wearing black armbands, the two teams ran out onto the field
together, rather than one after the other, and each was carrying
the other's flag. A huge banner hung from the stands said,
``Football says no to violence.''
	   Later came the silent tribute, which was repeated in stadiums
all over Spain as police announced that one of three suspects in
the attack had been jailed pending further investigation.
	   News reports say the three belong to a neo-fascist splinter
group of a mainstream fan club of Madrid's other major team,
Atletico Madrid. Zabaleta was in town to watch that team play his
side, Real Sociedad, when the attack occurred.
	   Madrid city officials called in extra security Sunday for the
Real Madrid-Real Sociedad game, described as high risk because of
lingering tension over Zabaleta's death. But the game went off
without incident and ended in a 3-2 win for Real Madrid.
	   The result raised Real Madrid from seventh to sixth place with
22 points after 14 weeks of play. It was the team's first league
win at home since the first week of the season.
	   The other traditional powerhouse of Spanish football, FC
Barcelona, was playing at home later Sunday against Villareal.
	   In other action Sunday, Mallorca remained the league leader with
28 points by beating Zaragoza 1-0.
	   Elsewhere it was Athletic Bilbao 2, Deportivo la Coruna 1;
Valencia 1, Salamanca 0; Valladolid 3, Alaves 0; Racing Santander
0, Tenerife 0; Celta 2, Espanyol 0; Oviedo 1, Extremadura 0.
	   In the Real Madrid game, Clarence Seedorf scored in the 86th
minute after a pass from Davor Suker to give the home side a 3-2
win after a game in which the Basques had matched Real goal for
goal.
	   Roberto Carlos scored first for Madrid in the 17th minute with a
soft arcing shot over the head of goalkeeper Alberto Lopez after a
pass from Pedrag Mijatovic.
	   The Basques tied it at 51 minutes with a goal by Darko Kovacevic
after a pass from Agustin Aranzabal. After scoring, in tribute to
Zabaleta, Kovacevic pointed to the slain fan's name on the back of
his jersey to say that goal was dedicated to him.
	   Real Madrid went ahead 2-1 on a goal by Raul Gonzalez in the
60th minute, only to see Real Sociedad tie it again five minutes
later with a second goal by Kovacevic, slamming home a deflected
free kick by Ricardo Manuel da Silva.
	   Real Madrid won it as Seedorf bounced the ball past Real
Sociedad goalie Alberto Lopez who had come out to challenge him.
	   Mallorca 1, Zaragoza,0 &QC; 
	   Mallorca, playing in Zaragoza and in control thoughout the game,
won with a free kick in the 19th minute by Marcelino Elena after
Jovan Estankovic was fouled. Zaragoza's Savo Milosevic was expelled
in the 75th minute for drawing two yellow cards.
	   Valladolid 3, Alaves 0 &QC; 
	   Valladolid pounded visiting and struggling Alaves with three
second-half goals, two of them by Croat Alen Peternac at 69 and 91
minutes. The first came from Jesus Angel Turiel in the 51st.
	   Athletic Bilbao 2, Deportivo 1 &QC; 
	   The local Basque team fought back from a one-goal deficit to
beat second-place Deportivo. They did it thanks to Joseba
Etxeberria's header in the 29th minute after a center from Julen
Guerrero and another header, this time by Ismael Urzaiz, after a
free kick by Guerrero.
	   Celta 2, Espanyol 0 &QC; 
	   Celta had no trouble with lowly Espanyol, using goals from Lubo
Penev in the 5th minute after a pass from Michel Salgado and
another by Salgado himself in the 14th to win 2-0 and move from
third to second place in the standings.
	   Valencia 1, Salamanca 0 &QC; 
	   Valencia won on a goal by Miguel Angel Angulo on a pass from
Claudio 'Piojo' Lopez.
	   Oviedo 1, Extremadura 0 &QC; 
	   Oviedo beat the league's last-placed team on a goal in the 33rd
minute by Deli Valdes.
	   In Saturday's only game, host Betis and Atletico Madrid played
to a scoreless tie.

British Liberal calls on Kosovo Albanian unity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain's Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democratic Party, called Sunday on Kosovo's Albanians
to unite their disparate viewpoints on ways to finding a solution
for the strife-torn province.
	   ``It is absolutely vital for the Kosovo Albanian community to
speak in a unified voice,'' Ashdown told reporters after meeting
different ethnic Albanian leaders in the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   ``Otherwise, the capacity to negotiate... the ability to put
across a powerful case is diminished,'' he stressed.
	   Arriving in the region for a five-day fact-finding mission,
Ashdown said the province is now ``at least, in slightly better
circumstances than before'' but warned that the truce is extremely
fragile.
	   Ashdown first visited the Albanian-majority province on Sept.
27, when he witnessed columns of refugees fleeing burned villages
and condemned the ``excessive use of force'' by the Serbian regime
to crack down on Kosovo's separatists.
	   The British MP on Sunday also met with Adem Demaci, the
political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
guerrilla movement fighting for independence from Serbia, and said
he planned to tour the province's countryside where he may talk
with the rebels.
	   ``The next month or so will tell us if we are able to put
together the ingredients for peace,'' Ashdown said. He expressed
fears that a failure of the political process and the advent of
spring could lead to a new outbreak of war.
	   ``The situation requires political leadership of the highest
order _ leaders must take risks,'' Ashdown concluded.
	   Ashdown also is scheduled to meet British peace verifiers who
are a part of the 2,000-strong international peace monitoring
mission in Kosovo.
	   The British MP said he would also travel to Belgrade for a
meeting with authorities there at the conclusion of his five-day
tour.

Protests leave drivers in dire straits

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece is suffering through a bad case of
clogged arteries.
	   Striking workers and other demonstrators have staged nearly
daily roadblocks, turning any journey into a potential gridlock
grind.
	   Even motorists accustomed to Athens' epic traffic problems are
showing signs of frustration at the staggering tie-ups during the
traditional pre-holiday wave of protests. One taxi driver said he
bought a cassette of nature sounds to calm his nerves during the
interminable waits during the traffic jams.
	   This year's road rage is amplified by an unusual array of
demonstrators taking to the streets _ from angry soccer fans to
students upset about education reforms. The government's austerity
measures to meet European Union standards have also launched dozens
of protest rallies.
	   The ability to cause major traffic disruptions has become a
major weapon of the protesters. And there is little chance of being
forcibly removed by Greek police, which generally take a laissez
faire attitude with peaceful protests.
	   On occasion, no more that a few dozen protesters have blocked
Greece's main highway, leading from Athens to the northern port of
Salonica. The highway could soon be the scene for more blockades by
farmers seeking concessions such as easing some crop limits.
	   In 1997, farmers used their tractors and field equipment to
close the highway for more than a month, stranding thousands of
trucks and causing a loss of more than dlrs 150 million in
international and domestic trade.
	   High school students also have gotten into the road block fever.
	   Students, who are occupying about 1,500 schools around Greece,
have begun daily blockades of busy roads of Athens and other towns.
Motorists who dared complain to kids at roadblock in Salonica
Friday were pelted with eggs.
	   The students oppose changes that would drop the single
university entrance exam and place greater weight on course work
and a series of tests to determine admission.
	   ``It's always us who pay for anything going on. They
(demonstrators) want to get noticed, but why should we have to be
put through this? I've been stuck here for two hours,'' an elderly
woman in Athens told television reporters from her driver seat,
near a school roadblock.
	   Motorists were recently put through additional strain when a
customs workers strike dried up gasoline supplies for days. Then
torrential rain last month washed away a bridge on the
Athens-Salonica highway.
	   In Salonica, furious soccer supporters staged a giant
demonstration in the city center after a local soccer team was
punished for crowd violence.
	   Claiming the penalty was aimed at helping Athens teams, they
also briefly blocked the highway to Athens and set fire in the
street to television converter boxes of the pay channel that shows
Greek soccer games.
	   Many of the other protests are against a string of government
reforms introduced this fall. These include pension and health fund
mergers, changes to school and university systems and efforts to
streamline public transport.
	   Unions have called a general strike for Tuesday, expected to
stop all public services for a day.
	   Choking traffic in a city like Athens is not difficult. It is
now home to more than 4 million of Greece population of 10.2
million. A study conducted by the company building a new subway for
the city predicted that by 2020, cars in greater Athens will almost
double from their current number of about 1.5 million.

More NATO troops arrived in Macedonia for Kosovo mission

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Nearly 200 NATO soldiers from France
and Italy arrived in Macedonia this weekend, building up the
alliance's rapid reaction force to assist international monitors in
Kosovo, Macedonian state television reported.
	   Some 170 French and 120 Italian troops, with accompanying dozens
of trucks and armored vehicles, disembarked in the port of Salonika
in neighboring Greece on Saturday and then used a land route to
deploy to a base in northern Macedonia.
	   The Italians arrived in Macedonia on Saturday and the French
reached the base near the Macedonian town of Kumanovo on Sunday.
	   They are part of the still-forming, French-led NATO force
stationed near the tense Serbian province of Kosovo to serve as
security backup for some 2,000 international civilians monitors
currently deployed there to verify a shaky truce.
	   With the latest arrival, the force has grown to about 550
troops. It will reach 1,800 troops with soldiers from Britain,
Germany, Italy, Canada and the Netherlands.

 &UR; Le Pen invites rival to form own party, but predicts it won't last &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen suggested Sunday
that his rival in the National Front start up his own extreme-right
party, but said he doubted it would survive more than six months.
	   Just over a week after the crisis in the National Front broke
into the open, threatening a schism, rancor ran increasingly deep
between Le Pen and Bruno Megret, the party's former No. 2 man.
	   Megret's membership in the party was suspended by Le Pen on
Friday, along with four Megret allies.
	   The Megret camp is demanding an extraordinary party congress to
unify ranks. Le Pen on Sunday reiterated with force his refusal. Le
Pen considers such a congress part of a ``plot'' to unseat him.
	   ``Let them hold their congress ... with their secessionist
intentions. I don't give six months for this party to disappear,''
Le Pen said on a French television talk show.
	   He spoke shortly after Megret announced on a radio talk show
that his loyalists have gathered more than 10,200 signatures --
more than the number required to hold a party congress.
	   The National Front can come out ``divided or shattered'' by the
crisis, Megret said, or ``renewed and strengthened.''
	   For Le Pen, ``we are in the corridor leading to the exit.''
	   ``There cannot be two chiefs,'' he said. ``The commander is at
the helm.
	   ``If he (Megret) continues, he is condemned to be but the
president of a Megret party.''

Italy's Zoff sets roster for centennial match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy coach Dino Zoff brought back Alessandro Nesta,
just over a World Cup injury, and gave forward Marco Delvecchio his
first call-up in naming 21 players Sunday to face an all-star team
in an exhibition match commemorating the Italian soccer
federation's centennial.
	   Nesta, 22, tore right knee ligaments during Italy's first-round
game against Austria at the World Cup in June. The defender
returned to action 10 days ago in an Italian Cup game for club
Lazio of Rome.
	   Delvecchio is tied for second in Serie A with eight goals and
joins three AS Roma teammates _ midfielders Eusebio Di Francesco
and Damiano Tommasi plus striker Francesco Totti _ on Zoff's
roster.
	   Totti, who made his first start for the Azzurri last month, is
likely to line up alongside Juventus of Turin's Filippo Inzaghi in
attack.
	   AC Parma, tied with Roma for third place in the Italian League
after the clubs played to a 1-1 draw Sunday, has the largest
contingent with five players.
	   Italy plays a ``Rest of the World'' selection at Rome's Olympic
Stadium on Wednesday.
	   The roster (clubs in parentheses):
	   Goalkeepers _ Gianluigi Buffon (Parma), Angelo Peruzzi
(Juventus)
	   Defenders _ Fabio Cannavaro (Parma), Mark Iuliano (Juventus),
Paolo Maldini (Milan), Alessandro Nesta (Lazio), Paolo Negro
(Lazio), Christian Panucci (Real Madrid), Gianluca Pessotto
(Juventus), Moreno Torricelli (Fiorentina)
	   Midfielders _ Demetrio Albertini (Milan), Jonathan Bachini
(Udinese), Dino Baggio (Parma), Sandro Cois (Fiorentina), Eusebio
Di Francesco (Roma), Diego Fuser (Parma), Damiano Tommasi (Roma)
	   Forwards _ Enrico Chiesa (Parma), Filippo Inzaghi (Juventus),
Francesco Totti (Roma), Marco Delvecchio (Roma)

Clinton promises prompt decision on whether to free convicted spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with pro-Pollard demonstration, Israeli
official says U.S. should show ``mercy.'' &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ President Bill Clinton on Sunday promised a
prompt decision on whether to free a former U.S. navy intelligence
analyst convicted of spying for Israel after a review is complete
in January.
	   Clinton noted he had promised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that he would look into his request for leniency for
Jonathan Pollard, who was sentenced to life for handing over
thousands of top secret documents to Israel in the mid-1980s.
	   ``I have instituted the review that I pledged to the prime
minister, and we've never done this on a case before, but I told
him I would do it, and we did it,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.S. president, speaking at a joint news conference with
Netanyahu, said he had instructed White House counsel Charles F.C.
Ruff to sound out all the relevant intelligence and security
agencies for their opinion.
	   Clinton said he would also weigh the opinions of Pollard's
supporters, ``and I will make a decision in a prompt way.''
	   ``We are giving everyone time to present their comments, and I
will get comments on both sides of the issue, evaluate it, and make
a decision,'' he added.
	   The review is expected to be complete in mid-January.
	   Netanyahu told a joint news conference that he was not excusing
Pollard's behavior but felt that releasing him was in order since
the Israeli spy had been in what amounted to solitary confinement
for 13 years.
	   ``It's a very very heavy sentence, and since he was sent by us
on a mission ... we hope that on a purely humanitarian appeal a way
will be found to release him,'' said Netanyahu.
	   He added the appeal was not political or designed to exonerate
Pollard but ``merely to end a very, very sorry case that has
afflicted him and the people of Israel.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said Pollard's case
did not come in formal talks between the Americans and Israelis
although aides said they were not aware of what was discussed in
the private session between the two leaders.
	   Bar-Illan said Pollard's deeds did not warrant the harsh
sentence he got. ``We feel it is missing the quality of mercy and
is unjust is that sense,'' he said.
	   Pollard's supporters claim the U.S. intelligence community is
exacting revenge on Pollard and that other spies have been released
after serving shorter terms.
	   Shouting ``free Pollard,'' about 30 demonstrators, including two
members of parliament, gathered outside as Clinton met with Israeli
President Ezer Weizman.
	   Successive U.S. administrations have turned down Israeli
requests for Pollard's release. After Israel had claimed for years
that Pollard was part of a rogue operation run without the
knowledge of the government, Netanyahu's government recognized him
as an Israeli agent and granted him citizenship. He has since been
visited by a number of top officials.
	   In October, the Pollard case led to a crisis in the Wye River
Mideast summit. On the last day of the summit, Netanyahu demanded
Pollard's release as a condition for release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails. He had hoped to fly home with Pollard
on his plane, a move that would have helped him sell the Wye accord
with his right-wing coalition partners.
	   However, the proposal met stiff opposition from U.S.
intelligence officials, past and present, and CIA Director George
Tenet reportedly threatened to resign if Pollard went free.
	   A U.S. official confirmed last week that information Pollard
handed over included a top secret 10-volume manual used by the
National Security Agency to tap foreign communications and protect
U.S. communications from intercept.
	   CBS reported Pollard's information told the Israelis the
disposition of U.S. Navy ships in the Mediterranean so that Israel
could strike PLO headquarters in Tunisia without being detected.
The 1985 raid was carried out with satellite photos Pollard had
given to the Israelis, the network reported.

Two top Brazilian athletes die in crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A car crash in a southern state
has killed two top Brazilian athletes, TV Globo reported Sunday.
	   Long-jumper Douglas de Souza, 26, and triple-jumper Gustavo Lima
Pinto, 21, died Saturday when the car they were travelling in
smashed into a pillar, the TV station said.
	   Souza, who competed in the 1996 Olympics, holds the South
American long-jump record of eight meters and 40 centimeters.
	   The crash happened on an interstate near Porto Alegre, the state
capital of Rio Grande de Sul, which is 960 miles (1,550 kms)
southeast of Rio, said the station.
	   According to recent figures some 50,000 people die each year on
Brazil's roads, despite government moves to clampdown on speeding
and drink-driving.

Canadian investigation focusing on computer problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Canadian investigators are focusing
on 90 seconds of computer anomalies before all flight recording
systems failed on Swissair flight 111, according to a report
Sunday.
	   ``Seven and a half minutes before the crash the computer system
went haywire. There were conflicting data,'' chief Canadian
investigator Vic Gerden was quoted as telling the weekly
SonntagsBlick.
	   First the autopilot failed and then irregularities got
increasingly worse until the flight data recorder and the cockpit
voice recorder went out completely six minutes before the crash,
Gerden said.
	   During the 90 seconds, the data recorder listed 250 different
events, 40 of which make no sense, he said. ``In part some of the
details are unreadable, in other cases things were recorded that we
know didn't occur.''
	   For example, some data indicate the steering was moved, ``but we
know from other data that this wasn't the case. Or one set of data
is just a repetition of the previous set.''
	   ``Now we have to figure out why that happened,'' Gerden said,
adding that investigators are studying whether the source of the
problem was the system itself, the cabling or the fuses.
	   The crew of the MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva
Sept. 2 reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash
that killed all 229 people aboard.
	   Gerden said that after the smoke was reported, everything
working normally until the computer problems started.
	   Investigators still know very little about the final six
minutes, but if they can find out more about what happened in the
90 seconds, they will have taken a big step forward, he said.
	   Gerden said it remained unclear whether cables overheated and
caused a fire or whether something else was the source of the heat.
	   ``For that reason we're checking all systems, not just the
cables.''
	   Heat damage was most intense in the ceiling area in front of and
behind the cockpit door. The reconstruction of the front end of the
plane will show how large the affected area was.
	   Gerden said the investigators had found that cable insulation
had been damaged by opening and closing doors elsewhere on Swissair
MD-11s like the one that crashed.
	   ``We are looking at every anomaly very closely. We didn't only
find the problem with the doors on the MD-11s of Swissair.''
	   The Canadian investigators have alerted all airlines to check
cabling around doors, he said.
	   Gerden said there were heat and arcing traces on the cables of
the inflight entertainment system, but also on other cabling.
	   ``At this point we're not blaming any system.'' He said the
Canadian investigators were keeping Swissair informed and that the
airline had voluntarily decided to disconnect the video-on-demand
system as a precaution.
	   Swissair said in October it turned off the state-of-the-art
entertainment system for first and business class because it was
nonessential and because that was the area where the investigation
was concentrated.

Van Gastel goal keeps Vitesse at a distance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Jean-Paul van Gastel's last-minute
free-kick gave Feyenoord a 1-1 draw at Vitesse Arnhem Sunday and
kept the gap between the top two soccer players at six points.
	   Feyenoord (13-3-1) has a game in hand over second-placed Vitesse
(11-3-4) and hosts third-placed Ajax next Sunday.
	   The game was a dismal spectacle with not losing uppermost in
both teams' minds, until Ghanean substitute Matthew Amoah's strike
four minutes from time gave Vitesse hope of narrowing the gap.
	   The top of the Dutch premiership remained unchanged as numbers
three and four, Ajax and SC Heerenveen also played to a draw, this
one entertaining but scoreless.
	   Ajax's first game under new coach Jan Wouters, who replaced
fired Dane Morten Olsen Saturday, should have produced three points
but Frank de Boer missed an 18th-minute penalty.
	   The spot kick was awarded after the star of the game, Danish
left-winger Jesper Gronkjaer, was pulled down by Max Houttuin.
	   On Saturday Bobby Robson's PSV continued its recent pattern of
attacking flair and defensive proficiency, giving Roda JC two goals
in the final four minutes and a 3-3 draw.
	   PSV's brilliant strikeforce of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Belgian
Luc Nilis had taken PSV to a 3-1 lead with four minutes to play.
	   The first two came from League top-scorer Van Nistelrooy, the
second a 45 meter (50-yard) dipping shot which sailed over Roda
keeper Zeljo Kalac's head and into the top corner.
	   The wonder-goal took van Nistelrooy to 16 for the season and
Nilis is tied for second top marksman on 12, after his elegant solo
strike made it 3-1.
	   But PSV failed to mark Nigerian Garba Lawal at a corner for 3-1,
then keeper Ronald Waterreus cleared the ball straight to Dane Marc
Nygard, who shot into an empty net to tie up the game.
	   Despite scoring ten times in its last three games, PSV (7-7-4)
gained just five points after conceding nine goals.

Explosion rocks suburban police station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A bomb exploded outside a suburban police
station Sunday, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The blast, in a residential area at the northern Athens suburb
of Holargos, shattered windows at nearby buildings and damaged
three parked cars.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Shortly before
the explosion, an anonymous telephone caller told a private
television station about the bomb but police were not alerted in
time.
	   The homemade device, made with dynamite, was placed at the
station's perimeter wall, police said.
	   Athens has been plagued this year by a spate of more than 200
arson attacks against cars and property mostly belonging to
government bodies and large companies. But no attack was aimed
directly against police.

Ninth 'Star Trek' movie beams up dlrs 22.4 million for first place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' replaced ``A
Bug's Life'' as the top movie in North America, while the snowman
fantasy ``Jack Frost'' opened to chilly business, industry
estimates showed Sunday.
	   The ninth installment of the science fiction franchise brought
in dlrs 22.4 million, more than twice the dlrs 11 million in ticket
sales of Disney's animated insect adventure.
	   ``Jack Frost,'' with Michael Keaton as a father who comes back
to life as a snowman, earned just dlrs 7 million for third place.
	   The novelty of a scene-by-scene color remake of the classic
``Psycho'' wore off quickly. The film brought in 62 percent less
than in its first week, falling from second to seventh place with
an estimated take of dlrs 3.8 million.
	   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' averaged dlrs 8,550 per location but
still had one of the weaker openings for a ``Star Trek'' film.
	   ``Star Trek: First Contact'' opened with dlrs 30.7 million in
1996 and ``Star Trek Generations'' took in dlrs 23.1 million in its
1994 debut. ``Insurrection'' did top 1991's ``Star Trek VI: The
Undiscovered Country,'' which opened with dlrs 18.2 million.
	   A trio of recent hits continued to do well. The Will Smith
thriller ``Enemy of the State'' had dlrs 6.6 million for fourth
place, followed by ``The Rugrats Movie'' with dlrs 4.5 million and
``The Waterboy'' with dlrs 4.3 million.
	   ``Psycho'' joined two other disappointments for Universal
Studios: ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' which had dlrs 1.8 million for
eighth place and ``Meet Joe Black,'' with dlrs 1.6 million for
ninth.
	   ``Elizabeth'' rounded out the top 10 list with dlrs 1.3 million.
	   Estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday through
Sunday as compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures
were to be released Monday:
	   1. ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' dlrs 22.4 million.
	   2. ``A Bug's Life,'' dlrs 11 million.
	   3. ``Jack Frost,'' dlrs 7 million.
	   4. ``Enemy of the State,'' dlrs 6.6 million.
	   5. ``The Rugrats Movie,'' dlrs 4.5 million.
	   6. ``The Waterboy,'' dlrs 4.3 million.
	   7. ``Psycho,'' dlrs 3.8 million.
	   8. ``Babe: Pig in the City'' dlrs 1.8 million.
	   9. ``Meet Joe Black,'' dlrs 1.6 million.
	   10. ``Elizabeth,'' dlrs 1.3 million

 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The leader of the Islamic Jihad
opposition group was detained by Palestinian police Sunday after he
said in a TV interview that he would not hesitate to kill U.S.
President Bill Clinton if he had the chance.
	   The Islamic leader, Abdallah Shami, was taken into custody on
Sunday afternoon, as he walked from a Gaza City junior high school
where he teaches to his home in the Shijaiyah district, said a
Palestinian police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In an interview with the Spanish TV station Antenna 3, Shami had
said earlier Sunday that if it wasn't for Clinton's huge security
detail, he would kill the president when he comes to the Gaza Strip
on Monday.
	   Clinton is in the Mideast to try and salvage the accord he
worked out between Israelis and Palestinians at Wye River in
Maryland in October.
	   However, Shami said he knew of no specific plans to attack the
president. ``I don't know of anybody in Gaza who is thinking of
killing Clinton now,'' Shami said.
	   ``But if the Wye River agreement involves a change in the
Palestinian position to the worse, and somebody does kill him, I
will be happy,'' said Shami, relaxing in his Gaza City office
decorated with Islamic calligraphy praising God.
	   Asked if he would kill Clinton, he said: ``If I could I would,
with every method I can muster. I would not hesitate. Clinton is
coming with 1,200 security men.''
	   His teen-age son Wisam said he was willing to die for the
Palestinian cause.
	   ``To die at the hand of God is better than to live as we do now.
There is no enjoyment in life, and the greatest joy is to be in
paradise,'' he said, moments after kneeling down on the living room
floor and praying side-by-side with his father.
	   Islamic Jihad, like the larger Islamic Palestinian group Hamas,
has carried out deadly suicide attacks against Israelis in a bid to
derail the peace process.
	   Palestinian militants oppose Wye because it does not finalize
Palestinian claims to statehood and sovereignty in Jerusalem; and
because it explicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist.
	   The militants also accuse Arafat of kowtowing to Israel and the
Americans during an increase in violence sparked by an Israeli
refusal to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
	   Arafat has cracked down on Islamic militants since Wye, and
Hamas _ the more significant militant Islamic group _ has kept its
criticism of the Clinton visit to a minimum, fearful of further
restrictions.
	   Clinton's visit is seen by the Palestinians and Israelis as
endorsing Palestinian aspirations to statehood, and Arafat is
anxious to make the U.S. leader feel welcome.
	   Israel rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state, and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has expressed its
displeasure with some aspects of the Clinton visit _ but Shami says
he still identifies Clinton with the Israeli enemy.
	   ``Our people know that the bullets that are killing our sons in
the West Bank are Israeli bullets, that the bulldozers that are
building the settlements are Israeli, the aircraft that bombed our
refugee camps and our homes are American planes,'' he said.
	   Clinton ``can't suddenly turn into a friend and a hero. He will
always remain as one of the biggest enemies of the Palestinian
people.''
	   Shami's family would not allow reporters or visitors to the home
after the arrest.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Le Pen invites rival to form own party, but predicts it won't last

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen suggested Sunday
that his rival in the National Front start up his own extreme-right
party, but said he doubted it would survive more than six months.
	   Just over a week after the crisis in the National Front broke
into the open, threatening a schism, rancor ran increasingly deep
between Le Pen and Bruno Megret, the party's former No. 2 man.
	   Megret's membership in the party was suspended by Le Pen on
Friday, along with four Megret allies.
	   The Megret camp is demanding an extraordinary party congress to
unify ranks. Le Pen on Sunday reiterated with force his refusal. Le
Pen considers such a congress part of a ``plot'' to unseat him.
	   ``Let them hold their congress ... with their secessionist
intentions. I don't give six months for this party to disappear,''
Le Pen said on a French television talk show.
	   He spoke shortly after Megret announced on a radio talk show
that his loyalists have gathered more than 10,200 signatures --
more than the number required to hold a party congress.
	   The National Front can come out ``divided or shattered'' by the
crisis, Megret said, or ``renewed and strengthened.''
	   For Le Pen, ``we are in the corridor leading to the exit.''
	   ``There cannot be two chiefs,'' he said. ``The commander is at
the helm.
	   ``If he (Megret) continues, he is condemned to be but the
president of a Megret party.''

Salt Lake regrets embarrassment from alleged rules violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Samaranch comments, free surgery, trims. &QL; 
 &UR; With Sports-Olympics-IOC-Bribes
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The chief organizer of the Salt
Lake City Olympic Games expressed regret Sunday that a
controversial scholarship program had embarrassed the Olympic
movement and Utah.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,
issued a public apology for the controversy caused by the fund. One
senior member of the International Olympic Committee has described
the scholarships as a ``bribe'' to win IOC votes.
	   Joklik, who was part of the bidding group which won the games,
said he still supported giving academic aid and athletic training
to young people from developing countries.
	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibly
appear to influence improperly the voting of IOC members,'' he
said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told reporters he was ``a
bit disappointed...surprised...not happy'' at the revelations, but
that there was not danger Salt Lake City would lose the games.
	   ``We trust the organizing committee of Salt Lake City. They
presented to us an excellent report,'' said Samaranch.
	   He added that the IOC might look into another way of choosing
Olympic cities in the future.
	   It was also disclosed Saturday that Utah's largest health care
provider gave free surgical services in 1994 to at least two people
associated with the IOC, one a relative of a committee member and
the other possibly a committee member.
	   ``Surgery was performed with donated services of IHC and
physicians,'' said Daron Cowley, spokesman for Intermountain Health
Care. Details and costs were not immediately available.
	   Cowley denied IHC did the free work to bolster its chances to
become primary medical provider for the 2002 Winter Olympics, which
it subsequently became.
	   ``We did this in a sincere effort, and in the spirit of being a
good community citizen,'' Cowley said.
	   The Salt Lake scholarship program gave nearly dlrs 400,000 in
tuition and other aid to 13 people _ including six relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa _ while the IOC was deciding which city
was to host the 2002 games.
	   ``With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been
part of the bid campaign,'' Joklik said. ``I apologize to the
Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment
caused by the bid committee program.''
	   Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler has used the word
``bribe'' to describe the fund. A high-level IOC panel is
investigating.
	   But Hodler said he didn't blame the city.
	   ``Salt Lake is a victim,'' Hodler said, repeating his assertion
that the bid committee felt compelled to offer the scholarships
rather than collude with agents promising to deliver votes.
	   Both Joklik and IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading a
special panel investigating the Salt Lake program, asserted that
Salt Lake City won the bid on its own merits, not because of the
scholarships.
	   Pound said the IOC executive board, which met with SLOC Sunday,
expressed ``complete, I repeat complete, confidence'' in the
organizing committee.
	   Joklik was chairman of the bidding committee at the time. The
scholarship program was under the direction of the former bid
president, Thomas Welch.
	   ``Although I was not aware of the program, I must accept
responsibility,'' Joklik said.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with the IOC for a periodic
update on preparations, Joklik said SLOC would cooperate fully with
the IOC panel investigating the case.
	   ``I will not hesitate to implement whatever steps are necessary
... to maintain the integrity of the games,'' Joklik said.
	   The commission is expected to finish its investigation by the
end of January.
	   Pound said the Salt Lake inquiry would be broadened to include
investigation of other allegations that self-appointed ``agents''
have solicited bidding cities for bribes of up to dlrs 1 million to
procure votes of IOC members.
	   Joklik said he was unaware if any agents made overtures to Salt
Lake City.
	   ``I wasn't approached. I'm not aware of any member of our staff
being approached. We did employ lobbyists. I have no evidence that
they were involved in any unethical behavior.''
	   At Sunday's meeting, the IOC board approved SLOC's dlrs 1.43
billion budget, which already has been approved by Salt Lake and
Utah officials.
	   The board also approved the long-delayed designs for the 2002
mascots. They remain top secret until the official unveiling Feb.
8.
	   Pound, who as top IOC marketing official is responsible for
sales of Olympic related products, described the mascots as
``cute'', while Francois Carrard, IOC director general, said they
were ``refreshing.''
	   SLOC also received approval for accommodation plans for the
biathlon and cross-country skiing competitions in Soldier Hollow in
Wasatch Mountain State Park near Midway.
	   Joklik said SLOC expects to decide within three months whether
any sports will be added to the program. Possible addition are
women's bobsled and skeleton, a head-first version of the luge.

 &UR; Eds: AMs; recasts; incorporates material from
 &UR; Samaranch promises crackdown on bribes
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The president of the IOC on Sunday
promised to clean up the Olympic movement by expelling any members
found guilty of taking bribes and considering changes to the way
Olympic host cities are selected.
	   Responding to the biggest corruption scandal in the IOC's
104-year history, Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was determined to
protect the integrity of the Olympics.
	   ``If we have to clean (up), we will clean,'' he said. ``After,
the IOC will be even stronger than before.''
	   Samaranch said the crisis was as serious for the IOC as the
political boycotts of the 1980s and Ben Johnson's drug scandal at
the 1988 Seoul Games.
	   ``They were difficult moments, and now we are facing another
difficult moment,'' he said. ``But I am sure that we will solve
this problem. After the black day, the sun will come again.''
	   Shaken by the allegations of vote-buying and payoffs leveled by
one of his own senior aides, Samaranch said, ``I am not happy, but
my obligation as president of the IOC is to look forward to try to
solve the problems and to reinforce the Olympic movement.''
	   Samaranch also ruled out any possibility of taking the 2002
Winter Olympics away from Salt Lake City as a result of the scandal
over scholarship funds benefiting relatives of IOC members.
	   Salt Lake officials apologized Sunday for the ``embarrassment''
caused by the controversy.
	   Samaranch spoke at a news conference at the close of another
extraordinary day at IOC headquarters. Senior Swiss official Marc
Hodler _ the man who made the bombshell corruption allegations
Saturday _ claimed he was ``muzzled'' by Samaranch and might be
kicked out of the IOC.
	   Samaranch ruled out expelling Hodler, but said he was taken
aback by his allegations and disappointed that he had made them to
the media and not the IOC.
	   ``For me, I was really surprised,'' Samaranch said. ``If he has
names and evidence, he must go to the executive board.''
	   Samaranch said Hodler's allegations would be considered by a
special IOC panel investigating the Salt Lake case.
	   ``If it is necessary, we will expel members if this commission
feels these members are guilty,'' he said.
	   Hodler alleged that four agents _ including one IOC member _ had
been involved in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He cited
alleged irregularities in the elections of at least four Olympic
cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia; and Salt Lake.
	   Hodler said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _
currently numbering 115 _ were open to bribery.
	   Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure
to eliminate the temptations for corruption in the selection of
host cities. Under current rules, all IOC members have a vote.
	   Samaranch called the current procedure too long, complicated and
expensive.
	   ``Maybe we have to think in the future to study another system
for picking the Olympic city,'' he said.
	   Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the formula used by sports
federations such as FIFA, world soccer's governing body, which
assign their executive boards to select sites.
	   But he ruled out any change before the next IOC session in
Seoul, South Korea, next June, when the site for the 2006 winter
Olympics will be awarded.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound said Hodler's allegations could
provide the impetus for the IOC to wipe out any corruption once and
for all.
	   ``I don't like this to be out there, but I'm glad it is because
it gives us the opportunity to deal with it _ to put a chapter that
appears to be somehat disagreable behind us,'' he said.
	   Pound said the IOC had met with Hodler and would look into his
charges.
	   ``We are aware there are agents and we are aware of the identity
of at least some of them,'' Pound said. ``What they've done or not
done, we don't know yet.''
	   ``We hear the rumors,'' he said. ``This is not a complete ivory
tower here. We say, `Please give us some ammunition and we will
investigate if there's something there.' Now we have it, now we
will.''
	   Pound said agents have become especially active in the bidding
process since the IOC decided to stagger the winter and summer
Olympics every two years. The new cycle started in 1994.
	   ``What seems to be developing is a professional classs of
Olympic agents who offer services to bid committees,'' Pound said.
	   He said the IOC has been warning cities bidding for the 2006
winter games to be careful in dealing with agents. But he said he
had no evidence that agents have been collecting cash for votes.
	   ``Nothing I have seeen so far would establish that,'' Pound
said. ``We don't know exactly what they are doing. We're short of
facts at the moment.''
	   Pound indicated the inquiry was focusing on the Salt Lake bid
but could be expanded.
	   ``One is never sure where the trail will lead,'' Pound said.
	   Pound said he was primarily concerned with stamping out any
corruption from within the IOC's own ranks, a view echoed by
American IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz.
	   ``We ask athletes to compete with integrity _ our members must
also act with integrity,'' she said. ``I think all but a few IOC
members behave that way.''

Italy's Zoff sets roster for centennial match

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy coach Dino Zoff brought back Alessandro Nesta,
just over a World Cup injury, and gave forward Marco Delvecchio his
first call-up in naming 21 players Sunday to face an all-star team
in an exhibition match commemorating the Italian soccer
federation's centennial.
	   Nesta, 22, tore right knee ligaments during Italy's first-round
game against Austria at the World Cup in June. The defender
returned to action 10 days ago in an Italian Cup game for club
Lazio of Rome.
	   Delvecchio is tied for second in Serie A with eight goals and
joins three AS Roma teammates _ midfielders Eusebio Di Francesco
and Damiano Tommasi plus striker Francesco Totti _ on Zoff's
roster.
	   Totti, who made his first start for the Azzurri last month, is
likely to line up alongside Juventus of Turin's Filippo Inzaghi in
attack.
	   AC Parma, tied with Roma for third place in the Italian League
after the clubs played to a 1-1 draw Sunday, has the largest
contingent with five players.
	   Italy plays a ``Rest of the World'' selection at Rome's Olympic
Stadium on Wednesday.
	   The roster (clubs in parentheses):
	   Goalkeepers _ Gianluigi Buffon (Parma), Angelo Peruzzi
(Juventus)
	   Defenders _ Fabio Cannavaro (Parma), Mark Iuliano (Juventus),
Paolo Maldini (Milan), Alessandro Nesta (Lazio), Paolo Negro
(Lazio), Christian Panucci (Real Madrid), Gianluca Pessotto
(Juventus), Moreno Torricelli (Fiorentina)
	   Midfielders _ Demetrio Albertini (Milan), Jonathan Bachini
(Udinese), Dino Baggio (Parma), Sandro Cois (Fiorentina), Eusebio
Di Francesco (Roma), Diego Fuser (Parma), Damiano Tommasi (Roma)
	   Forwards _ Enrico Chiesa (Parma), Filippo Inzaghi (Juventus),
Francesco Totti (Roma), Marco Delvecchio (Roma)

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton tried Sunday to
repair the tattered Wye River peace accords, appealing to
Palestinians to prove their peaceful intentions ``in word and
deed'' and Israel to acknowledge the ``legitimate expectations'' of
their longtime foes.
	   ``The violent past and the difficult present do not have to be
repeated forever,'' Clinton said, exhorting Israelis and
Palestinians to carry out their land-for-peace deal and go on from
there to an overall settlement.
	   But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the
Palestinians must first be convinced that ``violence and peace are
simply incompatible.''
	   He assured Clinton ``we are prepared to do our part.'' But he
linked any further Israeli withdrawal on the West Bank to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat renouncing his plans to declare
statehood and taking steps to squelch violence.
	   ``I'm sure that we can achieve peace between Palestinians and
Israelis if we stand firm on Palestinian compliance,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   He urged Clinton to take that message to Arafat in Gaza on
Monday.
	   Clinton's three-day visit to the Middle East was initially
designed to celebrate the peace accords he mediated along the Wye
River of Maryland two months ago. But with the momentum for
impeachment growing back home and the peace agreement threatened,
the day took on a more somber tone.
	   Responding to questions at a news conference, Clinton said he
would not resign or admit perjury.
	   Netanyahu, who faces his own political troubles, offered Clinton
a hand. ``Your devotion to this cause, your perseverance, your
timeless energy, your commitment, have been an inspiration to us
all,'' he told the president.
	   And as he stood by the president's side, he admonished reporters
to focus on the matter at hand _ Mideast peacemaking _ rather than
the impeachment drama.
	   Clinton credited the Palestinian Authority with taking some
``important steps,'' including deeper security cooperation with
Israel and confiscating illegal weapons, but he was also critical.
	   ``Have the Palestinians fulfilled all their commitments?'' he
asked. ``They certainly could be doing better to preempt violent
demonstrations in the street. This is a terribly important
matter.''
	   Clinton renewed his pledge to ask Congress to provide dlrs 1.2
billion to help Israel take new security measures to carry out the
Wye accords. This is in addition to the dlrs 3 billion a year in
annual U.S. economic and military assistance that Israel gets.
	   At the same time, he cautioned that Israel needed to reach out
and not be preoccupied with security or live in a permanent state
of siege.
	   The Palestinians, he said in a speech to a mostly young audience
at the Jerusalem Convention Center, ``feel you should acknowledge
they, too, have suffered and have legitimate expectations that
should be met.''
	   ``And they are right, too,'' Clinton said.
	   On Monday, in Gaza, with Clinton in attendance, the Palestine
National Council is due to repeal articles of a founding charter
that call for Israel's destruction.
	   ``That will be a welcome development,'' Netanyahu said.
	   However, he accused Arafat of gross violations of the Wye and
other accords with Israel by declaring he would establish a
Palestinian state unilaterally if he could not get one through
negotiations.
	   ``I think no one can seriously expect Israel to hand over
another inch of territory unless and until such an unambiguous
correction is made,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Recognizing that Netanyahu and Arafat are being pressed by
critics of the accords they reached in the Wye negotiations,
Clinton exhorted the two leaders to revive the cooperation that led
to the accords. Officials held out the possibility of a three-way
meeting.
	   Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the
Clinton visit. At Clinton's hotel, 500 policemen were posted to
guard the president and his delegation.
	   Abdallah Shami, leader of the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza, said
in an interview with APTN that he would kill Clinton if he could
``with every method I can muster.''
	   ``I would not hesitate,'' Shami said.
	   But, he said, ``I don't know of anybody in Gaza who is thinking
of killing Clinton now.''
	   Later, he was detained by Palestinian police as he walked home
from a junior high school in Gaza City, a Palestinian police
official said.
	   There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school
student was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager.
	   Two U.S. flags were burned at a rally attended by 2,000
followers of a radical PLO faction, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, which opposes the peace accords.
	   Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright underscored
that the administration wanted Israel to take the next scheduled
step in relinquishing more territory on the West Bank.
	   ``We would like this timetable to get back on track,'' she said.

Real Madrid beats Real Sociedad as Spanish soccer world mourns
</HEADLINE>
slain fan
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS &QC;

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to move up score of Real Madrid game; will be updated

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid beat Real Sociedad 3-2 Sunday
in a game that saw them trade team flags to unite against soccer
violence and mourn a fan who was killed by a supporter of a rival
squad.
	   At Madrid's cavernous Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, some 65,000
people fell silent for one moment in memory of Aitor Zabaleta, a
28-year-old Basque stabbed in the chest outside Madrid's other
major football arena, the Vicente Calderon, before a UEFA Cup match
on Tuesday.
	   Real Madrid won on a goal by Clarence Seedorf in the 86th
minute, and moved from seventh to sixth place in the standings. It
was Madrid's first league win at home since the first week of the
season.
	   Elsewhere, Mallorca remained in first place with a 1-0 win over
Zaragoza thanks to a goal by Marcelino Elena in the 19th minute.
	   FC Barcelona, the other traditional powerhouse of Spanish
soccer, was playing later at home against Villareal. The Catalan
team is languishing in eighth place and coach Louis van Gaal's job
is said to be on the line.
	   At Santiago Bernabeu, the atmosphere was solemn.
	   Wearing black armbands, the two teams ran out onto the field
together, rather than one after the other, and each was carrying
the other's flag. A huge banner hung from the stands said,
``Football says no to violence.''
	   Later came the silent tribute, which was repeated in stadiums
all over Spain as police announced that one of three suspects in
the attack had been jailed pending further investigation.
	   News reports say the three belong to a neo-fascist splinter
group of a mainstream fan club of Madrid's other major team,
Atletico Madrid. Zabaleta was in town to watch that team play his
side, Real Sociedad, when the attack occurred.
	   Madrid city officials called in extra security Sunday for the
Real Madrid-Real Sociedad game, described as high risk because of
lingering tension over Zabaleta's death. But the game went off
without incident.
	   Elsewhere it was Athletic Bilbao 2, Deportivo la Coruna 1;
Valencia 1, Salamanca 0; Valladolid 3, Alaves 0; Racing Santander
0, Tenerife 0; Celta 2, Espanyol 0; Oviedo 1, Extremadura 0.
	   In the Real Madrid game, Clarence Seedorf scored in the 86th
minute after a pass from Davor Suker to give the home side a 3-2
win after a game in which the Basques had matched Real goal for
goal.
	   Roberto Carlos scored first for Madrid in the 17th minute with a
soft arcing shot over the head of goalkeeper Alberto Lopez after a
pass from Pedrag Mijatovic.
	   The Basques tied it at 51 minutes with a goal by Darko Kovacevic
after a pass from Agustin Aranzabal. After scoring, in tribute to
Zabaleta, Kovacevic pointed to the slain fan's name on the back of
his jersey to say that goal was dedicated to him.
	   Real Madrid went ahead 2-1 on a goal by Raul Gonzalez in the
60th minute, only to see Real Sociedad tie it again five minutes
later with a second goal by Kovacevic, slamming home a deflected
free kick by Ricardo Manuel da Silva.
	   Real Madrid won it as Seedorf bounced the ball past Real
Sociedad goalie Alberto Lopez who had come out to challenge him.
	   Mallorca 1, Zaragoza,0 &QC; 
	   Mallorca, playing in Zaragoza and in control thoughout the game,
won with a free kick in the 19th minute by Marcelino Elena after
Jovan Estankovic was fouled. Zaragoza's Savo Milosevic was expelled
in the 75th minute for drawing two yellow cards.
	   Valladolid 3, Alaves 0 &QC; 
	   Valladolid pounded visiting and struggling Alaves with three
second-half goals, two of them by Croat Alen Peternac at 69 and 91
minutes. The first came from Jesus Angel Turiel in the 51st.
	   Athletic Bilbao 2, Deportivo 1 &QC; 
	   The local Basque team fought back from a one-goal deficit to
beat second-place Deportivo. They did it thanks to Joseba
Etxeberria's header in the 29th minute after a center from Julen
Guerrero and another header, this time by Ismael Urzaiz, after a
free kick by Guerrero.
	   Celta 2, Espanyol 0 &QC; 
	   Celta had no trouble with lowly Espanyol, using goals from Lubo
Penev in the 5th minute after a pass from Michel Salgado and
another by Salgado himself in the 14th to win 2-0 and move from
third to second place in the standings.
	   Valencia 1, Salamanca 0 &QC; 
	   Valencia won on a goal by Miguel Angel Angulo on a pass from
Claudio 'Piojo' Lopez.
	   Oviedo 1, Extremadura 0 &QC; 
	   Oviedo beat the league's last-placed team on a goal in the 33rd
minute by Deli Valdes.
	   In Saturday's only game, host Betis and Atletico Madrid played
to a scoreless tie.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The integrity of the Olympics will
be protected, the head of the international organization said
Sunday, responding to the biggest corruption scandal in the
Olympics' 104-year history.
	   ``If we have to clean, we will clean,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch
said. ``After, the IOC will be even stronger than before.''
	   Samaranch said the crisis was as serious for the International
Olympic Committee as the political boycotts of the 1980s and Ben
Johnson's drug scandal at the 1988 Seoul Games.
	   ``They were difficult moments, and now we are facing another
difficult moment,'' he said. ``But I am sure that we will solve
this problem. After the black day, the sun will come again.''
	   Shaken by allegations of vote-buying and payoffs leveled by one
of his own senior aides, Samaranch said, ``I am not happy, but my
obligation as president of the IOC is to look forward to try to
solve the problems and to reinforce the Olympic movement.''
	   Samaranch ruled out any possibility of taking the 2002 Winter
Olympics away from Salt Lake City as a result of the scandal over
scholarship funds benefiting relatives of IOC members.
	   Salt Lake officials apologized Sunday for the ``embarrassment''
caused by the controversy.
	   Samaranch spoke at a news conference at the close of another
extraordinary day at IOC headquarters. Senior Swiss official Marc
Hodler _ the man who made the bombshell corruption allegations
Saturday _ claimed he was ``muzzled'' by Samaranch and might be
kicked out of the IOC.
	   Samaranch ruled out expelling Hodler, but said he was taken
aback by his allegations and disappointed that he had made them to
the media and not the IOC.
	   ``For me, I was really surprised,'' Samaranch said. ``If he has
names and evidence, he must go to the executive board.''
	   Hodler cited alleged irregularities in the election of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia;
and Salt Lake.
	   Samaranch said Hodler's allegations would be considered by a
special panel investigating the Salt Lake case.

Palestinian radicals vow armed struggle against Israel

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hard-line Arab activists on Sunday vowed
to preserve their armed struggle against Israel, saying recognizing
the Jewish state's right to exist would lead to the ``destruction
of Palestinian unity.''
	   The hard-liners also announced the formation of a committee to
devise a new strategy for future action.
	   The announcement came in a statement issued at the end of a
two-day conference of 300 Palestinian and other delegates from the
Arab world. The statement gave no details of the proposed
committee.
	   The conference was called to discuss a strategy in light of a
scheduled meeting in Gaza City on Monday of the Palestinian
National Council, or the parliament, to expunge parts of the
Palestinian National Charter that call for the destruction of
Israel.
	   But aside from the blustery rhetoric of the speeches and the
final communique, the radicals offered no suggestions or plans on
how they would counter the mainstream Palestinian Authority.
	   ``The annulment of the charter is an annulment of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and a destruction of Palestinian unity,''
said the statement.
	   ``Our people's right to continue the resistance until we regain
all our national rights is a holy right guaranteed by international
laws,'' it said.
	   The statement was read out by Maher Taher, chairman of the
Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   Earlier, speaker after speaker gave fiery speeches denouncing
Israel, the United States and Yasser Arafat-led Palestinian
Authority.
	   The mainstream Palestinian leadership is committed to remove
anti-Israeli portions from the charter under the Wye River accord
that Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed in
October. U.S. President Bill Clinton, who arrived in Israel on
Saturday, is scheduled to attend the historic PNC meeting.
	   ``I say that the authority of Yasser Arafat and those with him
should be taken away from them,'' said Ahmed Jibril, leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
	   ``We will fight for the safeguarding of the Palestinian National
Charter and protect it with blood,'' Saeed Mousa, leader of the
Fatah Uprising said, adding that Arafat has ``betrayed a century of
(Palestinian) struggle.''
	   The conference, which included leaders who figure high on
Israel's list of persons wanted for violence, is the largest
gathering of Palestinian opposition leaders in many years.
	   Among those who took part were Ramada Abdullah Shallah of
Islamic Jihad, Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, George Habash of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine and Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the
Lebanese Haezbollah guerrilla group.

Astronauts set station loose, then pull away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After successfully joining and
outfitting the first two pieces of the international space station,
Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story complex loose Sunday and
then pulled away.
	   They were sorry to go.
	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   For NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle, it was ``a
tremendous relief'' and he was finally ready to declare the
assembly part of the 12-day shuttle mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber on Dec. 6, then
conducted three spacewalks to wire the components together, install
and fix antennas, and attach a tool box to the outside. They also
spent a full day inside the station, sprucing it up for the first
permanent crew, due to arrive in just over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Lew Grade, the cigar-chomping, legendary
entertainment tycoon who founded Britain's first commercially
funded television company, died Sunday. He was 91.
	   Lord Grade, whose projects included the TV series, ``The
Saint,'' and the movie ``On Golden Pond,'' died of heart failure at
the London Clinic which he entered two weeks ago for surgery, his
spokesman Dennis Michael said.
	   His wife, Kathie, who he married 56 years ago, and their adopted
son, Paul, were at his bedside.
	   Grade, the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in
London's East End. He gave up an early career as a hoofer to start
a small showbiz agency office in 1934.

Old Believer's role as policeman spans two worlds

<TEXT>
	   WOODBURN, Ore. (AP) _ Growing up as a Russian Old Believer,
Kalin Ayhan learned that preserving his religion came above all.
	   The centuries-old Christian orthodox rituals and other aspects
of their way of life transported from pre-Communist Russia to
Turkey to the United States were sovereign.
	   It often meant working on a farm or in furniture factories. It
meant socializing and marrying within the Old Believer community.
It meant men didn't shave.
	   It certainly didn't mean becoming a police officer. But 41/2
years ago, Ayhan became the first Old Believer on the force. Today,
the 29-year-old patrols the streets of Woodburn, an ideological
world away from where he grew up.
	   The simple choice of shaving his beard has made him something of
an outcast.
	   He cannot be an active member of his church because of it. And
only because his supervisors gave him permission to temporarily
grow his beard, he was able to marry in his church.
	   ``Some people just hate the idea that one of their own is
policing,'' Ayhan said.
	   From a community that started settling here in the 1960s and
remains largely closed to retain its identity, Ayhan chose a job
that put him in the thick of one of Oregon's most diverse
communities.
	   The town is part agricultural, part retirement community and
part growing freeway interchange with strong Latino and Russian
influences.
	   There are longtime Pentecostal Russians and newer Soviet
Russians as well. They have a language in common but differ in
their religious beliefs and on whether to ``Americanize.''
	   In January, Ayhan will receive one of six Woodburn Human Rights
Commission's annual awards for people who bridge cultures in the
community.
	   Ayhan was born here but spoke little English when he showed up
for first grade in 1976. He and the other Russian-speaking children
were grouped in a classroom with a bilingual teacher.
	   At home, he was admonished not to speak English by parents
worried he would forget his language.
	   Ayhan's father unknowingly first sparked his interest in police
work.
	   ``My dad had a lot of respect for the police and whenever we
would travel, my dad would point out that the police are good
people and they're there to help,'' Ayhan said.
	   As a teen-ager, Ayhan landed a job pumping gasoline at a
convenience store owned by former Marion County Sheriff Robert
Prinslow, who was running for office. He encouraged the teen to
pursue his interest in police work.
	   At 18, Ayhan enlisted in the U.S. Army with a plan: He would be
a military policeman.
	   A recruiter picked him up at his house. His parents cried. Ayhan
hugged his mom and rode away. That night, for the first time, he
shaved. There wasn't much to shave, some peach fuzz and a little
mustache.
	   After four years in the military, traveling to 25 countries,
Ayhan returned to Oregon.
	   He put himself through community college while working as a bank
security guard the applied to the Woodburn Police Department.
	   ``As hard as it is to be a police officer, it's probably twice
as hard in Woodburn because of cultural and language barriers,'' he
said.
	   The department loves him and figures it will be hard to keep him
because of his bilingual and bicultural background.
	   He figures his parents are proud, although ``they would more
likely to be more happy with me in a career that would allow me to
practice the religion.''
	   Once he returned to Woodburn, he renewed an acquaintance with
Mary Lisoff, an Old Believer. When they decided to marry, she
wanted a wedding within the culture. That required Ayhan to be an
active member of the church. That required a beard.
	   The department, which bans beards so they cannot be grabbed by
suspects, let him grow one, and the day before the October 1995
wedding, he was let back into the church.
	   About four months later, he shaved it again.
	   ``That was the hardest time for me,'' he said. ``My parents were
really, really disappointed. It started all over again, as far as
getting away from the religion and such.''
	   Mary Ayhan, a former volunteer firefighter, decided she wanted a
career. Now, she's a parole-probation officer with the Marion
County Juvenile Department.
	   Kalin Ayhan long ago abandoned traditional Russian dress. His
Russian accent is barely detectable.
	   He still loves his culture. But what he hopes to pass along to
his children will be the language and what he knows about his
family's struggle to preserve a religious way of life.
	   ``I'm not accepted in the church because of my appearance,'' he
said. ``Appearance seems to be more important than conduct.''

Astronauts set station loose, then pull away

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After successfully joining and
outfitting the first two pieces of the international space station,
Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story complex loose Sunday and
then pulled away.
	   They were sorry to go.
	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   For NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle, it was ``a
tremendous relief'' and he was finally ready to declare the
assembly part of the 12-day shuttle mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber on Dec. 6, then
conducted three spacewalks to wire the components together, install
and fix antennas, and attach a tool box to the outside. They also
spent a full day inside the station, sprucing it up for the first
permanent crew, due to arrive in just over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.

SAfrican A-team to have five nonwhites for non Test match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's top cricket
official said Sunday that five nonwhites would play on the
country's A-squad against West Indies in the next non-Test match.
	   But Ali Bacher, managing director of the United Cricket Board,
said their inclusion in the squad was not a response to pressure to
include more black, colored and Asian players in international
play.
	   ``In the past two years, we've had quite a few players of color
playing on the A-squad in international matches,'' said Bacher in a
telephone interview.
	   The A-squad is made up of players who are on the periphery of
selection for the national team and need opportunities to hone
their skills in international play, Bacher said.
	   The A-squad, which will face the West Indies in a four-day match
in Pietermaritzberg next Saturday, is to include batsman Ashwell
Prince, off-spinner Shafiek Abrahams, left-arm wrist spinner Paul
Adams and fast bowlers Makhaya Ntini and Victor Mpitsang.
	   All are players of color, or nonwhites, Bacher said.
	   Adams and Herschelle Gibbs, a nonwhite batsman, will continue to
play on the South African national team that faces West Indies in
the third Test after Christmas in Durban, Bacher said.
	   Recent criticism focused on Adams' placement as 12th man for the
second Test, a position that sees little play.
	   Last week, the governing African National Congress threw its
weight behind charges that racism was keeping nonwhites off
national sports teams, and promised legislation to rectify the
problem.
	   The ANC charged that both cricket and rugby teams were not
trying hard enough to promote talented players of other races.
	   The attack followed similar pronouncements by the National
Sports Council and Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, who has announced
the creation of a special commission to explore integration
efforts.

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hard-line Arab activists on Sunday vowed
to preserve their armed struggle against Israel, saying recognizing
the Jewish state's right to exist would lead to the ``destruction
of Palestinian unity.''
	   The hard-liners also announced the formation of a committee to
devise a new strategy for future action.
	   The announcement came in a statement issued at the end of a
two-day conference of 300 Palestinian and other delegates from the
Arab world. The statement gave no details of the proposed
committee.
	   The conference was called to discuss a strategy in light of a
scheduled meeting in Gaza City on Monday of the Palestinian
National Council, or the parliament, to expunge parts of the
Palestinian National Charter that call for the destruction of
Israel.
	   But aside from the blustery rhetoric of the speeches and the
final communique, the radicals offered no suggestions or plans on
how they would counter the mainstream Palestinian Authority.
	   ``The annulment of the charter is an annulment of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and a destruction of Palestinian unity,''
said the statement.
	   ``Our people's right to continue the resistance until we regain
all our national rights is a holy right guaranteed by international
laws,'' it said.
	   The statement was read out by Maher Taher, spokesman of the
Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   Earlier, speaker after speaker gave fiery speeches denouncing
Israel, the United States and Yasser Arafat-led Palestinian
Authority.
	   The mainstream Palestinian leadership is committed to remove
anti-Israeli portions from the charter under the Wye River accord
that Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed in
October. U.S. President Bill Clinton, who arrived in Israel on
Saturday, is scheduled to attend the historic PNC meeting.
	   ``I say that the authority of Yasser Arafat and those with him
should be taken away from them,'' said Ahmed Jibril, leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
	   ``We will fight for the safeguarding of the Palestinian National
Charter and protect it with blood,'' Saeed Mousa, leader of the
Fatah Uprising said, adding that Arafat has ``betrayed a century of
(Palestinian) struggle.''
	   The conference, which included leaders who figure high on
Israel's list of persons wanted for violence, is the largest
gathering of Palestinian opposition leaders in many years.
	   Among those who took part were Ramadan Abdullah Shallah of
Islamic Jihad, Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, George Habash, chairman of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
leader of the Lebanese Haezbollah guerrilla group.

Youths ransack police station, burn cars to avenge killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Rioting youths smashed a police station,
burned cars and faced off police Sunday night in a working class
district of this southern French city, trying to get even for the
shooting death of a buddy the night before.
	   Six policemen were slightly injured in clashes that started in
the early evening and continued for several hours, police said. No
youths were reported injured.
	   Some 150 police faced off an estimated 180 youths in Toulouse's
suburban Reynerie district, which counts an unemployment rate of 35
percent.
	   Police said that 11 cars and a school bus were burned by
rampaging youths and several stores ransacked.
	   The youths first broke into a small neighborhood police station,
breaking windows and ransacking the inside, according to police.
	   The rampage was triggered by the shooting death at 4 a.m. Sunday
of a youth in his 20s, killed by a stray police bullet, police
said. The circumstances of the shooting remained unclear.

Necaxa bests Guadalajara in Mexican winter soccer championship

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City's Necaxa Rayos bested the Chivos
of the western city of Guadalajara 2-0 Sunday to take Mexico's 1998
Winter Soccer Championship.
	   After a scoreless first half in which the Guadalajara squad
dominated play and bounced several shots off the posts, Necaxa
moved in on well-tuned passing to place two goals in the second
half.
	   Forward Salvador Cabrera tipped in the first goal for Necaxa at
56 minutes in front of 65,000 spectators at Guadalajara's Jalisco
stadium.
	   Uruguayan forward Sergio Vazquez punched through Necaxa's second
goal at the 89-minute mark on a pass from Carlos Hermosillo, who
outwitted three defensemen to set up the play.
	   Necaxa goalkeeper Adolfo Rios stopped a Guadalajara penalty shot
in the first half, and distinguished himself in saving several head
shots aimed at his goal.
	   It was Necaxa's third championship in the 1990s. Mexican teams
play another championship round in the summer.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo called in congratulations to Enrique
Borja, president of the Necaxa squad.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Lew Grade, the cigar-chomping, legendary
entertainment tycoon who founded Britain's first commercially
funded television company, died Sunday. He was 91.
	   Lord Grade, whose projects included the TV series, ``The
Saint,'' and the movie ``On Golden Pond,'' died of heart failure at
the London Clinic which he entered two weeks ago for surgery, his
spokesman Dennis Michael said.
	   His wife, Kathie, who he married 56 years ago, and their adopted
son, Paul, were at his bedside.
	   Grade, the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in
London's East End. He gave up an early career as a dancer to start
a small showbiz agency office in 1934.

Bayern Munich regains Bundesliga lead by beating Leverkusen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Michael Tarnat and Giovane Elber scored
first half-time goals as Bayern Munich regained first place in the
Bundesliga by beating closest rival Bayern Leverkusen 2-0 on
Sunday.
	   With one round left before the winter break, Bayern opened a
three-point lead over Leverkusen. But Bayern has a game in hand and
could spend the break with an even bigger lead.
	   Leverkusen's coach Christoph Daum has not won a game in Munich
for 10 years, with different clubs.
	   Leverkusen suffered its first defeat on the road season and only
the second loss of the season and had its 14-game unbeaten streak
snapped by a powerful performance from the Champions League
quarterfinalist.
	   Bayern dominated the game from the opening whistle and took the
lead in the 20th minute.
	   Striker Carsten Jancker won the ball on the corner line against
the lethargic Leverkusen defender Boris Zivkovic and slipped the
ball into Tarnat's path. The midfielder easily put it into the net
from close range.
	   Elber, the Brazilian forward, made it 2-0 in the 30th when he
volleyed in a good cross from Mario Basler, notching his 10th goal
of the season.
	   Bayern had another goal denied in the second half and Basler hit
the post as the home side kept up the pressure before 35,000 at
Munich's Olympic stadium. A deflected cross also hit the bar of
Leverkusen's goal two minutes before the end.
	   Leverkusen's defender Robert Kovac was sent off in the 75th
minute for bringing down Elber.
	   Tempers flared three minutes later, after Carsten Ramelow had
shot the ball at the head of Elber, who was prone on the ground
after a foul. Punches were thrown in a mass melee but the the
situation quickly calmed down and nobody was sent off.

Another slow day in NBA lockout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They've tried almost everything to end the U.S.
National Basketball Association lockout, from secret negotiating
sessions to private breakfasts to ``unofficial'' offers in stuffy
back rooms.
	   They even tried going casual Saturday at the union's law office,
showing up in some nice leather jackets.
	   But that didn't work either.
	   Now, it might be several more days before the league and the
union meet again.
	   ``There's no meeting today,'' NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said
Sunday, one day after a small negotiating session lasted less than
30 minutes and included the union informing commissioner David
Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik where it was willing to
make some movement.
	   The offer wasn't enough, and the parties soon walked off into
the cold December air, their hopelessness plainly evident. The
lockout, essentially a strike by the owners, has been frustrating
for all parties. Under American labor law, without a contract _ or
in this case a collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit
_ or lock out _ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   ``No one knows what their schedule is,'' said union attorney
Jeffrey Kessler, who had enough of a sense of humor left to note
that at least they hadn't ruined too much of a Saturday.
	   There was room for a little levity because there still is enough
time to save the season. The top negotiators could decide to meet
this week, or they could decide to put the process back on the slow
track and settle in front of their television sets Friday night to
watch agent David Falk's exhibition game from Atlantic City.
	   No one is quite sure which choice they'll make.
	   ``It's very clear we don't have the basis for a deal between us,
or anything even close,'' Granik said. ``It's clear we have very
different ideals of what an appropriate deal should look like.''
	   The quick departure from Saturday's session by Stern and Granik
surprised many around the league, especially some on the ownership
side who had been told after Thursday's secret negotiating session
that a deal was close.
	   The union contingent seemed to think the same thing as it walked
into Saturday's meeting hopeful that the sides would make enough
progress to call back the full negotiating teams Tuesday or
Wednesday to perhaps close the deal.
	   The union's offer, however, which was believed to include an
absolute limit on the top salary for any player with less than
seven years' of experience, wasn't good enough to keep Stern at the
table.
	   The commissioner has said he is planning to lay off employees at
the NBA office, which draws its budget from a 6 percent cut of gate
receipts. He also says the season will cancel itself if a deal
isn't reached in the not-too-distant future.
	   The union still thinks Stern is bluffing. Stern insists he's
dead serious.
	   ``Right now it does not look good,'' he said.
	   There isn't much time for it to start looking better.

Real Madrid beats Real Sociedad as Spanish soccer world mourns

 &UR; Eds: updates with Barcelona losing 1-3 to Villareal

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid beat Real Sociedad 3-2 Sunday
in a game that saw them trade team flags to unite against soccer
violence and mourn a fan who was killed by a supporter of a rival
squad.
	   At Madrid's cavernous Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, some 65,000
people fell silent for one moment in memory of Aitor Zabaleta, a
28-year-old Basque stabbed in the chest outside Madrid's other
major football arena, the Vicente Calderon, before a UEFA Cup match
on Tuesday.
	   Real Madrid won on a goal by Clarence Seedorf in the 86th
minute, and moved from seventh to sixth place in the standings. It
was Madrid's first league win at home since the first week of the
season.
	   Elsewhere, Mallorca remained in first place with a 1-0 win over
Zaragoza thanks to a goal by Marcelino Elena in the 19th minute.
	   And struggling FC Barcelona, the other traditional powerhouse of
Spanish soccer, sank deeper into crisis by losing 1-3 at home to
Villareal, a team debuting in the first division. The loss left
Barcelona in 10th place.
	   As Villareal ran up a 0-3 lead fans waved white handkerchiefs
and screamed for the resignation of coach Lous van Gaal and club
president Jose Luis Nunez. In the final minutes the chorus reached
a fever pitch.
	   At Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, the atmosphere was more solemn.
	   Wearing black armbands, the two teams ran out onto the field
together, rather than one after the other, and each was carrying
the other's flag. A huge banner hung from the stands said,
``Football says no to violence.''
	   Later came the silent tribute, which was repeated in stadiums
all over Spain as police announced that one of three suspects in
the attack had been jailed pending further investigation.
	   News reports say the three belong to a neo-fascist splinter
group of a mainstream fan club of Madrid's other major team,
Atletico Madrid. Zabaleta was in town to watch that team play his
side, Real Sociedad, when the attack occurred.
	   Madrid city officials called in extra security Sunday for the
Real Madrid-Real Sociedad game, described as high risk because of
lingering tension over Zabaleta's death. But the game went off
without incident.
	   Elsewhere it was Athletic Bilbao 2, Deportivo la Coruna 1;
Valencia 1, Salamanca 0; Valladolid 3, Alaves 0; Racing Santander
0, Tenerife 0; Celta 2, Espanyol 0; Oviedo 1, Extremadura 0.
	   In the Real Madrid game, midfielder Seedorf scored in the 86th
minute after a pass from Davor Suker to give the home side a 3-2
win after a game in which the Basques had matched Real goal for
goal.
	   Roberto Carlos scored first for Madrid in the 17th minute with a
soft arcing shot over the head of goalkeeper Alberto Lopez after a
pass from Pedrag Mijatovic.
	   The Basques tied it at 51 minutes with a goal by Darko Kovacevic
after a pass from Agustin Aranzabal. After scoring, in tribute to
Zabaleta, Kovacevic pointed to the slain fan's name on the back of
his jersey to say that goal was dedicated to him.
	   Real Madrid went ahead 2-1 on a goal by Raul Gonzalez in the
60th minute, only to see Real Sociedad tie it again five minutes
later with a second goal by Kovacevic, slamming home a deflected
free kick by Ricardo Manuel da Silva.
	   Real Madrid won it as Seedorf bounced the ball past Real
Sociedad goalie Alberto Lopez who had come out to challenge him.
	   Barcelona 1, Villareal 3 &QC; 
	   Villareal scored twice in the first half and added one more for
safety to make it 3-0 with just 15 minutes left to go in the game,
leaving Barcelona little chance to even tie, although it did score
once.
	   George Craioveanu scored first in the 12th minute thanks to a
defensive error by Barcelona's Jose Guardiola. In the 24th he
scored again on a fine individual effort, dodging several
defenders. Gerardo Garcia made it 3-0 in the 75th minute as he
recovered a ball from Moises Garcia and slammed it past bewildered
goalkeeper Ruud Hesp.
	   Barcelona got on the board in the 82nd minute with a goal from
Giovanni da Silva who forced Villareal goalie Andres Palop to come
out in a vain effort to defend.
	   Mallorca 1, Zaragoza,0 &QC; 
	   Mallorca, playing in Zaragoza and in control thoughout the game,
won with a free kick in the 19th minute by Marcelino Elena after
Jovan Estankovic was fouled. Zaragoza's Savo Milosevic was expelled
in the 75th minute for drawing two yellow cards.
	   Valladolid 3, Alaves 0 &QC; 
	   Valladolid pounded visiting and struggling Alaves with three
second-half goals, two of them by Croat Alen Peternac at 69 and 91
minutes. The first came from Jesus Angel Turiel in the 51st.
	   Athletic Bilbao 2, Deportivo 1 &QC; 
	   The local Basque team fought back from a one-goal deficit to
beat second-place Deportivo. They did it thanks to Joseba
Etxeberria's header in the 29th minute after a center from Julen
Guerrero and another header, this time by Ismael Urzaiz, after a
free kick by Guerrero.
	   Celta 2, Espanyol 0 &QC; 
	   Celta had no trouble with lowly Espanyol, using goals from Lubo
Penev in the 5th minute after a pass from Michel Salgado and
another by Salgado himself in the 14th to win 2-0 and move from
third to second place in the standings.
	   Valencia 1, Salamanca 0 &QC; 
	   Valencia won on a goal by Miguel Angel Angulo on a pass from
Claudio 'Piojo' Lopez.
	   Oviedo 1, Extremadura 0 &QC; 
	   Oviedo beat the league's last-placed team on a goal in the 33rd
minute by Deli Valdes.
	   In Saturday's only game, host Betis and Atletico Madrid played
to a scoreless tie.

Youths ransack police station, burn cars to avenge killing

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Rioting youths smashed a police station,
burned cars and threw stones and Molotov cocktails at police Sunday
night, trying to avenge the shooting death of a buddy the night
before.
	   Six policemen were injured in clashes that started in the early
evening and continued for several hours, police said. The all-news
television station LCI said that three of the policemen were
hospitalized.
	   No youths were reported injured.
	   At least 150 police faced off up to 200 youths in suburban
Toulouse's Reynerie section, a working class district with an
unemployment rate of 35 percent. The angry youths threw stones and
Molotov cocktails at security forces.
	   Police said that 11 cars and a school bus were burned by the
rampaging youths and several stores ransacked in the melee.
	   The youths first broke into a small neighborhood police station,
breaking windows and ransacking the inside, according to police.
	   The rampage was triggered by the shooting death at 4 a.m. Sunday
of a youth, killed by a stray police bullet, according to police.
	   LCI said the shooting of the 17-year-old occurred when police
tried to arrest the suspect for alleged car theft.

DiMaggio orders doctors not to discuss condition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICIA MALDONADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) _ U.S. baseball legend Joe DiMaggio must be
feeling better: He told his doctors to shut up.
	   Two days after awakening from a coma, an irate DiMaggio ordered
them Sunday to stop giving public updates on his recovery from lung
cancer surgery and pneumonia.
	   Doctors had said Friday that the 84-year-old baseball great was
very close to death. Now, he's talking and trying to recapture the
privacy he has always cherished.
	   ``We allowed Joe to talk this morning and he was very angry,''
said Dr. Earl Barron, who heads the six-person team treating the
Hall of Famer. ``He said, `No more press.'''
	   Barron said he could no longer comment on DiMaggio's health. He
refused to say whether his condition had been upgraded from
critical to serious, as had been expected.
	   DiMaggio, who was once married to actress Marilyn Monroe, has
guarded his privacy since his retirement from baseball in 1951, and
information about his condition has been tightly controlled since
he checked into Memorial Regional Hospital on Oct. 12. He had
surgery two days later to remove a cancerous tumor in his right
lung.
	   In a nationally televised news conference Friday, Barron
reported that the former New York Yankees outfielder was in a
``very dire situation'' as he slipped in and out of a coma. But on
Saturday, DiMaggio was sitting up in bed visiting with friends and
family and even said, ``Hello.''
	   DiMaggio's condition improved after doctors started giving him
antibiotics intravenously instead of orally. Doctors discovered the
oral medication was not being absorbed into his bloodstream.
	   DiMaggio's family _ including his brother, Dom; grandchildren
Kathy and Paula; and longtime friend and lawyer Morris Engelberg _
have been at his bedside.
	   Last weekend, the family was summoned when DiMaggio had what
Barron called ``a significant and serious turn for the worse.''
Again, he improved overnight, leaving doctors stunned by his
resiliency.
	   At least twice, he has had last rites of the Roman Catholic
church administered when it seemed he was slipping away.
	   DiMaggio's last public appearance was Sept. 27, when he was
honored at Yankee Stadium and received replicas of nine
championship rings that were stolen from his hotel room three
decades ago.
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had wanted him to throw out
the ceremonial first pitch at the World Series. But by then, he was
in the South Florida hospital which has a children's wing named in
his honor.

Batistuta's 13th is lucky: Fiorentina beats Juventus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Fiorentina-Juventus late match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta keeps scoring and Fiorentina keeps
winning.
	   The Argentine star's league-high 13th goal in as many games gave
Serie A leader Fiorentina a 1-0 victory Sunday night over Juventus
of Turin, dropping the two-time defending champions into ninth
place.
	   Batistuta cut behind a defender to head Belgian winger Luis
Oliveira's cross in from 10 meters (yards) away in the 59th minute
as Fiorentina won its seventh straight home game and increased its
standings lead to a season-high 4 points.
	   Juventus, which saw Uruguayan defender Paolo Montero sent off at
the end of the first half, lost its third straight and was shut out
for the fifth game in a row since Alessandro Del Piero went out for
the year with knee ligament damage.
	   It was Juve's first game since coach Marcello Lippi confirmed he
will leave the storied club when his contract expires in June.
Juventus has now lost five of 13 games; it dropped two all last
season.
	   Batistuta remained on pace to break the single-season record of
33 goals, and he could pull off a rare double: only four players in
the last 20 years have led Serie A in scoring while playing for a
title winner.
	   Fiorentina (9-1-3), enjoying its first stay alone atop the
standings since 1982, has 28 points, and AC Milan (7-3-3) is next
with 24. AS Roma and AC Parma each have 23, followed by
Internazionale of Milan with 21. Juventus has 18.
	   Earlier Sunday, Liberian striker George Weah fired in the winner
with six minutes left as 10-man Milan overcame Vicenza 1-0 to vault
into second place.
	   Milan took full advantage of the 1-1 draw between AC Parma and
AS Roma, clubs that had entered the day tied for second in the
standings. Parma took the lead on Argentine striker Hernan Crespo's
first-half goal, and Roma finally broke down Italy's toughest
defense to tie the score on substitute Carmine Gautieri's goal in
the 62nd.
	   Weah, starting to regain the form that earned him World,
European and African Player of the Year awards in 1995, turned home
a low cross from German forward Oliver Bierhoff from 8 meters
(yards) out to give Milan its third win in four games.
	   ``It's great to have Weah back on track,'' Milan coach Alberto
Zaccheroni said. ``He's the kind of player who can make a
difference in the long run.''
	   Before the late goal, Milan looked headed for a draw at best,
having seen midfielder Massimo Ambrosini sent off in the 72nd
minute with two yellow cards.
	   Weah's successor as FIFA Player of the Year, two-time winner
Ronaldo, also came through with a decisive late strike, hitting the
target off Roberto Baggio's assist with three minutes remaining to
lift Internazionale past Udinese 1-0. The Brazilian star has
battled knee tendinitis all season, but has scored in four of the
six league games he has managed to play for the Champions Cup
quarterfinalists.
	   Lazio of Rome is in sixth place, with 20 points, after routing
Sampdoria of Genoa 5-2. Lazio's Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic
recorded a rare hat-trick _ all the goals came off free kicks _
while both of Sampdoria's goals were penalty kicks by Francesco
Palmieri.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Perugia beat Cagliari 2-1 in a game that saw
both clubs score in injury time, Bari edged Empoli 2-1, Bologna and
Salernitana drew 1-1, and relegation battlers Venezia and Piacenza
drew 0-0.
	   At Florence, a sloppy game turned Fiorentina's way in the 43rd
minute, when Montero was sent off with his second yellow card after
a foul on Brazilian striker Edmundo.
	   Oliveira, consigned to mostly defensive duties before Juventus
(5-3-5) was reduced to 10 players, lofted a precise, 30-meter
(yard) cross for Batistuta to head home.
	   Juventus, which scraped into the Champions Cup quarterfinals
Wednesday, has finished a season lower than sixth in the Serie A
standings just twice in the past 40 years.

Mixed identity, insecurity affect Puerto Ricans' vote

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Papillon Garces thinks Puerto Rico
should be independent, but is voting for it to remain a U.S.
commonwealth.
	   ``It's a vote for security,'' he explained with resignation.
	   Maria Santiago, who lived in the United States for 40 years,
likes her native land the way it is _ a U.S. territory that's
almost like a country. But in Sunday's nonbinding referendum, she's
voting to make it the 51st state _ just in case things take a turn
for the worse down the road.
	   ``I'm voting for security,'' she said.
	   Across party lines and political positions, Puerto Ricans voted
for what they thought would be the safest choice for the island's
future _ though their hearts and minds were not always in synch.
	   The chief success of the statehood movement may be in having
planted a seed of insecurity _ a fear that the U.S. citizenship
Puerto Ricans prize, and its benefits, may somehow be in danger
unless something is done.
	   Whatever the real or imagined slights of a century of U.S. rule,
many voters recognized the economic and political security the
United States brings.
	   This compounds a century-old identity crisis.
	   ``Actually, we Puerto Ricans are all `independentistas' in our
hearts,'' said Garces, 42, an aspiring actor who works for the
electric company. ``But I'm a pragmatist. If we weren't American,
we'd be poor like other Caribbean islands, like the Dominican
Republic'' _ another former Spanish colony.
	   Puerto Ricans have numerous metaphors and jokes to describe
their mixed identity.
	   Every Puerto Rican is an independentista after three beers, says
one.
	   Another says Puerto Ricans who talk up an independentista storm,
then vote for remaining a commonwealth are like watermelons: Green
_ the color of independence _ on the outside, and commonwealth red
inside.
	   ``Estamos confused'' laughed Santiago, 56. The phrase, meaning
``We're confused'' in a mix of English and Spanish, has been heard
across the island in recent days.
	   Santiago, a retired flight attendant whose family moved to New
York when she was 12, said she's basically happy with Puerto Rico's
ambiguous link to the mainland. But she has some doubts the
commonwealth system devised in 1952 can be permanent, and is
reluctantly opting for statehood to preserve the tie.
	   Her concern, she said, is ``for the future of my grandchildren
in San Francisco,'' teen-age twins who say they want to settle in
the island of their ancestry when they turn 18. She wants to ensure
that they'll always be able to move back and forth with ease.
	   Santiago is hopeful that statehood might soften racism on the
mainland against Puerto Ricans. Enhanced ties also might mitigate
the kind of prejudice she said she faced since returning four years
ago, for ``not being Puerto Rican enough.''
	   Some people, she recognized, will ``say I'm Americanized for
voting for statehood.''
	   But she laughed off claims that Puerto Rico's Hispanic culture
would be corrupted by statehood. The United States, she said, is
already a mix of cultures. Her blonde, blue-eyed granddaughters are
learning Spanish in California, she noted: ``And they speak it with
a Mexican accent!''

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ U.S. baseball legend Joe DiMaggio has
told his doctors to shut up.
	   Days after doctors said the 84-year-old ex-ballplayer was very
close to death, and then reported excitedly that he had awakened
from a coma, DiMaggio ordered them Sunday to stop giving public
updates on his recovery from lung cancer surgery and pneumonia.
	   ``We allowed Joe to talk this morning and he was very angry,''
said Dr. Earl Barron, who heads the six-person team treating
Dimaggio. ``He said `No more press.'''
	   Because of that, Barron refused to say whether DiMaggio's

	   DiMaggio, who was once married to Marilyn Monroe, has guarded
his privacy since his retirement from baseball in 1951, and
information about his condition had been tightly controlled since
he checked into Memorial Regional Hospital on Oct. 12. He had
surgery two days later to remove a cancerous tumor in his right

	   In a news conference Friday, Barron reported that the former New
York Yankees outfielder was in a ``very dire situation'' as he

bed visiting with friends and family.
	   The improvement came after doctors started giving him

honored at Yankee Stadium.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The integrity of the Olympics will
be protected, the head of the international organization said
Sunday, responding to the biggest corruption scandal in the
Olympics' 104-year history.
	   ``If we have to clean, we will clean,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch
said. ``After, the IOC will be even stronger than before.''
	   Samaranch said the crisis was as serious for the International
Olympic Committee as the political boycotts of the 1980s and Ben
Johnson's drug scandal at the 1988 Seoul Games.
	   ``They were difficult moments, and now we are facing another
difficult moment,'' he said. ``But I am sure that we will solve
this problem. After the black day, the sun will come again.''
	   Shaken by allegations of vote-buying and payoffs leveled by one
of his own senior aides, Samaranch said, ``I am not happy, but my
obligation as president of the IOC is to look forward to try to
solve the problems and to reinforce the Olympic movement.''
	   Samaranch ruled out any possibility of taking the 2002 Winter
Olympics away from Salt Lake City as a result of the scandal over
scholarship funds benefiting relatives of IOC members.
	   Salt Lake officials apologized Sunday for the ``embarrassment''
caused by the controversy.
	   Samaranch spoke at a news conference at the close of another
extraordinary day at IOC headquarters. Senior Swiss official Marc
Hodler _ the man who made the bombshell corruption allegations
Saturday _ claimed he was ``muzzled'' by Samaranch and might be
kicked out of the IOC.
	   Samaranch ruled out expelling Hodler, but said he was taken
aback by his allegations and disappointed that he had made them to
the media and not the IOC.
	   ``For me, I was really surprised,'' Samaranch said. ``If he has
names and evidence, he must go to the executive board.''
	   Hodler cited alleged irregularities in the election of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia;
and Salt Lake.
	   Samaranch said Hodler's allegations would be considered by a
special panel investigating the Salt Lake case.

Animal rights activist ends hunger strike after 68 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An animal rights activist serving a prison
sentence for a firebombing campaign, ended a 68-day hunger strike
Sunday.
	   Barry Horne started his hunger strike Oct. 6, saying he would
end it if the government announced a date for the setting up of a
royal commission into the use of animals in experiments.
	   Horne had been studying documents relating to the government's
position on animal experimentation before he gave up the hunger
strike.
	   A spokesman for the Animals Betrayed Coalition, to which Horne
belongs, had said earlier Sunday that Horne's sight had
deteriorated so badly he could only see silhouettes and that the
fat around his liver had wasted away.
	   Horne was returned to York's Full Sutton prison on Thursday
after spending two weeks in hospital because he was refusing
treatment and the normal running of the hospital was being
``seriously disrupted'' by protesters outside.
	   A spokeswoman for York's district hospital said Horne had been
moved back there following his decision to resume eating.
	   The Home Office said Sunday night there had been no negotiation
or compromise with Horne or his supporters.
	   ``Mr. Horne's decision to go on hunger strike was always his own
and he was the only one who could have ended it. It has been a
futile protest because not one life of an animal has been saved by
his actions,'' said a Home Office spokesman, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Horne's local member of Parliament, Tony Clarke said he had
acted as an intermediary to help bring the hunger strike to an end.
	   He said he had been in constant contact with animal rights
activists and the government to try to clarify their positions over
animal testing, and had chaired a meeting between the two.
	   Although no concessions had been made there was now better
understanding of the government's position, he said.

Salt Lake regrets embarrassment from alleged rules violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Olympics-IOC-Bribes
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout, TRIMS; No Pick Up &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Salt Lake City Olympic organizers
hope to get allegations of bribery behind them as quickly as
possible so that they can concentrate on preparations for the 2002
Olympic Games.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the organizing committee, apologized
publicly for the controversy caused by a scholarship fund that
aided relatives of some International Olympic Committee members
when Salt Lake City was competing against other cities for IOC
votes to host the winter games.
	   A high-level IOC panel is investigating.
	   The program gave nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other aid to
13 people _ including six relatives of IOC members, mostly from
Africa _ while the IOC was deciding which city was to host the 2002
games.
	   ``With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been
part of the bid campaign,'' Joklik said. ``I apologize to the
Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment
caused by the bid committee program.''
	   Joklik said he still supported giving academic aid and athletic
training to young people from developing countries.
	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibly
appear to influence improperly the voting of IOC members,'' he
said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was surprised and
disappointed to learn of the scholarships, but didn't regard them
as grounds for taking the games away from Salt Lake City.
	   ``We trust the organizing committee of Salt Lake City. They
presented to us an excellent report,'' said Samaranch.
	   Utah's largest health care provider, meanwhile, has said it gave
free surgical services in 1994 to at least two people associated
with the IOC, one a relative of a committee member and the other
possibly a committee member.
	   ``We did this in a sincere effort, and in the spirit of being a
good community citizen,'' said Daron Cowley, spokesman for
Intermountain Health Care.
	   Cowley denied IHC did the free work to bolster its chances to
become primary medical provider for the 2002 Winter Olympics, which
it subsequently became.
	   Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler described the fund
as a ``bribe,'' but he didn't blame the city.
	   ``Salt Lake is a victim,'' Hodler said, adding that the bid
committee felt compelled to offer the scholarships rather than
collude with ``agents'' promising to deliver votes in exchange for
large cash payments.
	   Both Joklik and IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading
the investigating panel, said Salt Lake City won the bid on its own
merits, not because of the scholarships.
	   Pound said the IOC executive board, which met with the
organizing committee, or SLOC, Sunday, expressed ``complete, I
repeat complete, confidence'' in the organizing committee.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with the IOC for an update
on preparations, Joklik said SLOC would cooperate fully with the
IOC panel investigating the case.
	   ``I will not hesitate to implement whatever steps are necessary
... to maintain the integrity of the games,'' Joklik said.
	   The commission is expected to finish its investigation by the
end of January.
	   ``We'd like to put this behind us as quickly as possible,'' said
Robert Garf, chairman of the organizing committee. ``We would not
like to be distracted. It's imperative that we don't fall behind in
the preparation of the games.''
	   Pound said the Salt Lake inquiry might be broadened to include
investigation of other allegations that agents have solicited
bidding cities for bribes of up to dlrs 1 million to procure votes
of IOC members.
	   At Sunday's meeting, the IOC board approved SLOC's dlrs 1.43
billion budget, which already has been approved by Salt Lake City
and Utah officials.
	   The board also approved the long-delayed designs for the 2002
mascots. They remain top secret until the official unveiling Feb.
8.
	   Pound, who as top IOC marketing official is responsible for
sales of Olympic-related products, described the mascots as
``cute''. IOC Director-General Francois Carrard said they were
``refreshing.''
	   SLOC also received approval for accommodation plans for the
biathlon and cross-country skiing competitions in Soldier Hollow in
Wasatch Mountain State Park near Midway.
	   Joklik said SLOC expects to decide within three months whether
any sports will be added to the program. Possible addition are
women's bobsled and skeleton, a head-first version of the luge.

Chechen reservists prepare for anti-crime campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thousands of army reserves reported to duty Sunday
after Chechnya's president ordered them recalled to help fight a
crime wave in the breakaway Russian region, a news agency reported.
	   At the Khankala army headquarters near the capital, Grozny,
1,100 men showed up after President Aslan Maskhadov's order
Saturday night, and several thousand reservists showed up at other
mobilization centers, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev told Interfax the men
would be divided into teams to help police protect strategic sites
throughout Chechnya.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been plagued by turf wars between
feuding gangs. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped, most for
ransom.
	   On Saturday, Russian security forces rescued a Frenchman who
worked for the U.N. refugee agency and was kidnapped more than 10
months ago.
	   Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov was also released
Saturday after apparently being taken captive Thursday.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of three Britons and a New
Zealander kidnapped in Grozny in October. They were found beheaded
last week, reportedly after a botched attempt by Russian security
services to free them.
	   Appearing on state television Saturday, Atgeriyev claimed that
renegade warlord Arbi Barayev had masterminded the kidnapping and
killing of the four men, who were in Chechnya to install a cellular
phone system.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to incorporate comments by Le Pen, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The ``bete noir'' of French politics, the
extreme-right National Front, is on the verge of imploding in a
vicious public spectacle, and mainstream parties are quietly
exulting in the name-calling and low blows.
	   The demise of the National Front in its current form would
amount to a small earthquake on the French political landscape,
pummeled for nearly 15 years by the divisive power of the party
accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   A week after the National Front erupted in crisis, with bitter
feuding between its top two figures _ charismatic leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen and former No. 2 man Bruno Megret _ the schism appeared all
but complete.
	   ``There cannot be two chiefs,'' Le Pen said Sunday night on
French television. ``The commander is at the helm.''
	   He invited Megret to start his own party, adding, ``I don't give
six months for (it) to disappear.''
	   Le Pen fears Megret is out to unseat him and has publicly called
his followers ``traitors'' and accused them of ``racism'' and
``extremism'' _ labels usually pinned on Le Pen.
	   Megret shares the same ideological ground as Le Pen, but has
strived to dilute the stigma attached to the party.
	   ``This is blessed bread,'' said Yves Verwaerde, on the electoral
commission of Liberal Democracy, a new rightist party. ``It's a
real calamity for the left.''
	   The question was who, if anyone, might profit from an eventual
splintering of the far right, without committing political suicide.
	   The anti-immigration National Front has long been considered a
political pariah but proved a magnet for voters dissatisfied with
the traditional right.
	   The party has for years garnered 15 percent of the vote in
elections, bolstering the left while robbing votes from the right,
which was brought to its knees in 1997 legislative elections.
	   With European Parliamentary elections seven months away, a
splintered National Front could shake up the electoral cards.
	   It is widely assumed the National Front will split into two
groups. According to the scenario laid out in the press, Le Pen
would head a reduced party, keeping the National Front name. Megret
would start up a new party.
	   French media relished recounting the divorce between the
flamboyant, silver-haired Le Pen, at 70 still a fiery orator, and
Megret, an understated technocrat of 47. Some of the meanest scenes
were played out before television cameras.
	   At a rally Friday in Metz, Le Pen compared himself to Julius
Caesar and Megret to Brutus, the adopted son who slew the Roman
emperor.
	   ``But what differentiates me from Caesar,'' Le Pen said, ``as
Brutus approaches, knife in hand ... is that I pull out my sword
and kill Brutus before he kills me.''
	   Le Pen fired Megret from his post of general delegate after the
crisis exploded 10 days ago, and, on Friday, suspended him and four
allies from the party after they called for an extraordinary
congress to unify ranks.
	   On Thursday, Serge Martinez, a Megret loyalist also suspended,
was refused access to a post office box used to gather votes for
the special congress. Megret loyalists accuse the Le Pen camp of
conducting an illegal search of one of their offices in Marseille.
	   The National Front crisis ``is good news'' for the right, the
secretary general of President Jacques Chirac's conservative Rally
for the Republic party said in an interview published Friday.
	   ``If (National Front) voters or activists want to turn away from
this party to join us, we will accept them,'' Nicolas Sarkozy was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Le Figaro.
	   Others were more cautious.
	   ``Rightist parties would be well inspired not to consider that
this rupture ... will profit them,'' counseled former conservative
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua.
	   Regional elections in March underscored the stigma attached to
dealings with the National Front. Seven rightist politicians
elected with National Front votes were banished or resigned from
their party.
	   The fear is that extreme-rightist theses will creep into other
parties' programs, becoming acceptable political fare.
	   The National Front, founded in 1972, first got noticed in 1984
with an 11 percent score in European parliamentary elections.
Conservatives accuse the late Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand of endowing the party with lasting clout by switching to
a proportional voting system in 1986 legislative elections. The
National Front got 35 seats.
	   Since then, the party has stalked the political scene.
	   ``We must let them kill each other, and count the pieces when
it's over,'' said Pascal Clement, a Liberal Democracy lawmaker.

Astronauts set station loose and fly away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with shuttle circling station
then flying away. Picks up 7th graf pvs, `For NASA's ...' &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After successfully joining and
outfitting the first two pieces of the international space station,
Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story complex loose Sunday and
then flew away.
	   They were sorry to go.
	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   The winged, cylindrical station glistened in the sunlight as the
shuttle circled from a distance of 450 feet for a final photo
survey. Once that was done, Sturckow fired Endeavour's thrusters
and the shuttle pulled away for good.
	   For NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle, it was ``a
tremendous relief'' and he was finally ready to declare the
assembly part of the 12-day shuttle mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber on Dec. 6, then
conducted three spacewalks to wire the components together, install
and fix antennas, and attach a tool box to the outside. They also
spent a full day inside the station, sprucing it up for the first
permanent crew, due to arrive in just over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.

U.S. president ushers in Jewish festival of lights in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL124,127 &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton joined Israeli
children Sunday in ushering in the eight-day Jewish festival of
Hanukkah, expressing hope that the first candle would kindle peace.
	   Taking a break from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
Clinton clapped and swayed as a children's choir sung the Hanukkah
hymn ``Rock of My Redemption'' at a Hanukkah party hosted by
Israeli President Ezer Weizman at his official residence in
Jerusalem.
	   An 11-year-old boy, Moshe Mit Babo, whose family immigrated to
Israel from Ethiopia, wore a white skull cap and sang Hebrew
blessings as he lit the first candle on the Menorah, an
eight-branched candelabra.
	   Hanukkah, also known as the festival of lights, commemorates the
Jewish uprising in the second century B.C. against the Greek-Syrian
kingdom, which had tried to impose its culture and adorn the Jewish
Temple in Jerusalem with statues of Greek gods.
	   Jewish legend says that when a small group of Jewish warriors
tried to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found only
enough oil for one day. But the oil lasted eight days and is
believed to have been a miracle.
	   Commemorating the good fortune of their ancestors, Jews light an
additional candle at sundown each day until the candelabra is full.
They also eat traditional foods fried in oil, such as jelly
doughnuts and potato pancakes.
	   Clinton compared the miracle of Hanukkah to the miracle of the
state of Israel. He expressed the hope that the first candle would
``kindle a spark of peace touching all the peoples and places of
the Holy Land.''
	   During his trip to the Mideast, Clinton is trying to repair the
tattered land-for-peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Earlier, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton lit a Hanukkah
candle, a Christmas tree and a Ramadan lantern as she promoted
Jewish-Arab coexistence as the basis for a lasting peace.
	   In synagogues, rabbis read from the Book of the Maccabees, which
tells the story of the ancient uprising. In Israel, it has become a
tradition during Hanukkah for orchestras and choirs to perform
Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabaeus, which also tells the story of
the rebellion. The victory anthem from the oratorio has become a
popular children's song and has been set to Hebrew.
	   Toy stores did a brisk business as the festival approached, with
parents buying holiday gifts for children. Dunkin Donuts also sold
thousands of jelly-filled doughnuts.
	   Later Sunday, viewers around the world witnessed a simultaneous
lighting of the Hanukkah candles on the Internet at 3:15 EST, when
the ultra-Orthodox Habad movement opened the holiday with
ceremonies in Jerusalem, Moscow, Paris and New York.

	   ROME (AP) _ A former president of the U.S. ski team on Sunday
corroborated charges that the Fiat auto family offered bribes to
sway votes for Sestriere, Italy, to hold skiing's 1997 world
championships.
	   Howard Peterson at the time was the senior U.S. delegate and
member of the International Ski Federation. He said two Fiat
executives _ chief executive officer Vittorio Vellano and public
relations manager Angelica DiSilvestri _ offered him two cars
before the vote. The competition was awarded to Sestriere.
	   ``I told them that I was going to vote for the city in
Switzerland that they were competing with because (that city) had
done a lot for youth and athletes, and secondly (that) I didn't
sell my vote,'' Peterson said from his home in Francis, Utah.
	   Peterson's comments followed charges Saturday by Marc Hodler, an
executive board member of the International Olympic Committee and
former head of the International Ski Federation. He claimed that
Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free vans to influence votes
for the Italian resort.
	   On Saturday, Fiat called Hodler's claims ``completely false''
and threatened legal action.
	   Holder's comments were part of a series of explosive accusations
in which he charged the Olympics selection process is riddled with
corruption, with agents demanding up to dlrs 1 million to deliver
votes.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has promised to expel
any IOC members found guilty of corruption, empathized with Fiat.
	   ``We are extremely sorry if these statements have caused pain
and embarrassment to the Agnelli family and Fiat,''
	   Italian media rallied around Fiat, dismissing the bribery
accusations as an attempt to derail Turin's candidacy for the 2006
Winter Games.
	   ``Low blow to Turin,'' read the headline in the Rome-based
Corriere dello Sport newspaper.
	   The Agnelli family owns Fiat and holds major interests in hotels
and real estate in Sestriere, which is also the centerpiece of
Turin's 2006 bid. The family also controls the company that runs
the ski lifts and cable ways in the area west of Turin that
neighbors France.
	   ``Hodler did not provide a stitch of proof,'' wrote La Gazzetta
dello Sport editor Candido Cannavo in a front-page column under the
headline, ``A low blow to Turin 2006 ... the most vile
accusations.''
	   Gazzetta, like other newspapers and television reports,
portrayed the attack by Hodler, who is Swiss, as an effort to help
Sion, Switzerland, land the 2006 Olympics.
	   ``Even the dirty tricks that, unfortunately, come along for
every Olympic candidacy should have limits of decency,'' Cannavo
wrote. ``In this case, though, the limit was barbarically crossed
by Marc Hodler ... who, in the name of his Sion, slings mud on the
Sestriere World Championships to hurt the Turin candidacy.''

Astronauts set station loose and fly away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with shuttle circling station
then flying away. Picks up 7th graf pvs, `For NASA's ...' &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After successfully joining and
outfitting the first two pieces of the international space station,
Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story complex loose Sunday and
then flew away.
	   They were sorry to go.
	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   The winged, cylindrical station glistened in the sunlight as the
shuttle circled from a distance of 450 feet for a final photo
survey. Once that was done, Sturckow fired Endeavour's thrusters
and the shuttle pulled away for good.
	   For NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle, it was ``a
tremendous relief'' and he was finally ready to declare the
assembly part of the 12-day shuttle mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber on Dec. 6, then
conducted three spacewalks to wire the components together, install
and fix antennas, and attach a tool box to the outside. They also
spent a full day inside the station, sprucing it up for the first
permanent crew, due to arrive in just over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.

Angola withdraws troops from western Congo

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Angolan forces, apparently responding to
an upsurge in rebel attacks at home, have withdrawn at least one
battalion from western Congo where they have deployed troops in
support of embattled President Laurent Kabila, Congolese rebel and
Rwandan sources said Sunday.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the Congolese rebels fighting
to oust Kabila, said at least 1,000 Angolan troops and tanks had
left the air base at Kitona, about 250 miles (400 kilometers)
southwest of Kinshasa. Rwandan officials also reported the
withdrawal.
	   The claims could not be immediately confirmed.
	   A rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, former government soldiers
and opposition politicians launched an insurgency in the vast
Central African nation on Aug. 2, accusing Kabila of corruption,
failing to bring about democratic reforms and stirring up ethnic
hostilities.
	   With rapid advances early in the campaign, the rebels closed in
on the capital, Kinshasa, until several other African nations
intervened on Kabila's side.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad have thrown their support
behind the president, while Rwanda and Uganda support the rebels.
	   Angola, which sent troops, tanks and fighter jets into Congo,
has been involved in escalating clashes in its own country against
UNITA rebels. UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, refuses to hand over
strongholds as required under a 1994 peace pact to end a two-decade
civil war.
	   ``My understanding is it has something to with the situation
inside Angola,'' Wamba told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from Kisangani, Congo's third largest city. ``About one
battalion has been withdrawn from Kitona to reinforce units
battling the rebels in Angola.''
	   Efforts to broker a cease-fire in Congo have failed over
Kabila's refusal to negotiate with the rebels, whom he accuses of
being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The next round of peace talks has been scheduled for Dec. 28 in
Lusaka, Zambia, to give parties time to consult about a cease-fire
proposal agreed in principle last month in Paris by leaders of
Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo.
	   But Wamba, who did not take part in Paris talks, remained
adamant that no agreement will be possible without the rebels.
	   ``It is not going to take place without us,'' he said.

Giants 20, Broncos 16
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ The Denver Broncos' dreams of
becoming the first U.S. National Football League team since the
Dolphins to go undefeated ended Sunday when Kent Graham threw a
37-yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer with 48 seconds left, giving
the New York Giants a shocking 20-16 victory.
	   The game-winning catch came in the back of the end zone with
Toomer outleaping Tito Paul for the ball. For a second, the
officials looked at each other and discussed whether Toomer's feet
were inbounds before back judge Kirk Dornan signaled touchdown.
Replays showed the call was correct.
	   Until the late heroics by the Giants (6-8), the Broncos (13-1)
seemed headed for their 14th straight win and an NFL-record 19th
straight over two seasons, thanks to yet another John Elway-led
comeback. He engineered a 76-yard drive that was capped by Terrell
Davis' 27-yard run, which put the Broncos ahead 16-13 with 4:08
left.
 &UR; Cardinals 20, Eagles 17, Overtime &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, the Arizona Cardinals needed a little longer
than expected to keep their playoff hopes alive.
	   After missing a 34-yard field goal at the end of regulation,
Chris Jacke kicked a 32-yarder 4 1/2 minutes into overtime, giving
the Cardinals a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
	   Rob Moore, who had a controversial 9-yard TD catch that tied it
17-17, had receptions of 30 and 16 yards from Jake Plummer on the
winning drive. Arizona (7-7) stayed in the running for the NFC wild
card, but needs to win its final two games against New Orleans and
San Diego _ both at home.
	   Adrian Murrell rushed for 174 yards on 32 carries for the
Cardinals. Plummer, who had a horrible game in a loss to the New
York Giants last week, was 18-for-26 for 234 yards and a
touchdown.
 &UR; Packers 26, Bears 20 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Dorsey Levens rushed for 105 yards and
the injury-riddled Green Bay Packers overcame strong performances
by former teammates Edgar Bennett and Glyn Milburn.
	   Levens, in his third game back from a broken leg, helped the
Packers beat the Bears for the ninth straight time, the longest
dominance of the NFL's oldest rivalry. The Bears won eight in a row
from 1985-88.
	   The Bears (3-11) get another shot at ending the skid when the
Packers (9-5) visit Soldier Field in two weeks.
 &UR; Colts 39, Bengals 26 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, Peyton Manning passed for 210 yards and three
touchdowns as Indianapolis handed Cincinnati its ninth straight
loss.
	   The victory snapped a three-game slide for Indianapolis (3-11),
which blew double-digit leads in its previous two games. This time,
with Manning and Marshall Faulk providing the offense, the Colts
never let up.
	   Faulk, the NFL leader in yards from scrimmage, had a pair of
first-half touchdown runs, and his 115 yards rushing and 39 yards
receiving pushed his total yardage this season to a Colts-record
2,090.
	   Manning was 17-for-26 and set NFL rookie records with 502
attempts and 286 completions for the season. He also extended his
own rookie records to 3,179 yards passing and 11 straight games
with at least one touchdown pass.

Palestinians appear to be softening stance on charter vote

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders said Sunday there will be a
show of hands to affirm the revoking of PLO charter clauses seeking
Israel's destruction, a move that could help solve the key dispute
overshadowing President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   Israel has insisted that the top Palestinian decision-making
body take a formal vote Monday and not simply affirm the move to
remove the charter clauses.
	   The Palestinians have said repeatedly that a vote is not
required in the Palestine National Council. The Wye River peace
accord says only that the council must ``reaffirm'' a letter to
Clinton in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat lists the charter
clauses considered revoked.
	   However, on Sunday, the Palestinians appeared to soften their
position. Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Arafat will ask
the delegates at the end of his speech whether they support the
peace process and the letter to Clinton.
	   ``Then we will raise our hands and stand up and applaud,''
Asfour said. Despite the show of hands, this should not be
considered a formal vote, Asfour said.
	   Monday's Palestinian National Council session is the most
sensitive stop of Clinton's three-day trip and could lead to a
showdown between Israel and the United States if Clinton and
Netanyahu disagree over whether the body has completed its task.
	   Senior advisers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday
that even if there is a vote in the Palestine National Council it
is unlikely Israel will withdraw troops in the West Bank by Friday,
as required under the Wye peace agreement.
	   Uzi Arad, political adviser to Netanyahu, said the Palestinians
had to meet a number of other conditions as well. Asked if there
would be a pullback this week, he said: ``Not unless they do
miracles, and in the course of one week finish all their
obligations.''
	   Israel also wants Arafat to publicly back off his intentions to
unilaterally declare a state in May and to accept Israel's terms
for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a dispute that has
triggered daily clashes in the West Bank.
	   Clinton has staked his political prestige on getting the Wye
agreement back on track and will address the Palestinian council on
Monday. His trip would be considered less than successful if he
returns to Washington on Tuesday without at least an Israeli
promise to pull back troops, even a few days behind schedule.
	   In the West Bank, new violence erupted Sunday despite efforts by
the Palestinian Authority to lower tensions during the Clinton
visit. Palestinians threw stones at Israeli troops in several West
Bank towns, including Ram, north of Jerusalem. An Israeli teen-ager
was hurt near the Shavei Shomron settlement in a stabbing attack.
	   Two U.S. flags were burned at a rally attended by 2,000
followers of a radical PLO faction, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, which opposes the peace accords.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said a vote would likely pave
the way for a meeting between Arafat, Clinton and Netanyahu on
Monday afternoon. The United States has been trying to arrange such
a meeting, but the Israelis have not yet committed to it.
	   The Israeli Cabinet will meet Thursday or Friday to decide
whether Israel would carry out the next troop withdrawal, said
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon. ``As it looks now, I think
it will be very hard for the government to approve it,'' he said.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans voted Sunday on
whether to petition Congress to become the 51st state, in a
divisive election aimed at resolving a century-long debate over the
Caribbean island's status.
	   The nonbinding referendum pitted statehood advocates against
defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth, in which
islanders are U.S. citizens but have no vote in Washington. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the referendum.
	   Voters could choose statehood, the commonwealth option,
independence or a ``free association'' form of independence with
U.S. treaty ties. They also could choose ``none of the above'' _ an
option Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano has said would give Congress
little to work with.
	   With 74 percent of votes counted Sunday, the elections
commission reported 50.1 percent of votes for the ``none of the
above'' position backed by the commonwealth party and and 46.7
percent for statehood. Other options garnered the remaining few
votes.
	   Puerto Rican Senate President Charlie Rodriguez indicated
statehood backers intended to press forward, even if they lost.
	   ``Puerto Rico is on an irreversible path toward statehood,'' he
told The Associated Press, insisting that ``None of the above'' was
a vote against the current commonwealth arrangement.
	   Some 70 percent of 2.2 million registered voters participated,
the elections commission said.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot
soon after voting stations opened.
	   At a polling station in southern Ponce city, an election
volunteer confronted the 95-year-old founder of the statehood
party, Luis A. Ferre. ``I know my people, and Americans don't want
Puerto Rico to be a state,'' said Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old
engineer from South Carolina who has married and settled on the
island.
	   In San Juan, thousands of voters gathered at political parties'
headquarters, dancing, eating and drinking at huge street parties.
On the highways, people drove cars with U.S. and Puerto Rican flags
and campaign banners flapping from windows.
	   ``We have seen over the years a decrease in support for
commonwealth status,'' pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello said when
he voted. In the last nonbinding referendum in 1993, commonwealth
edged out statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.
	   Rossello called Sunday's referendum in hopes of persuading
Congress to end a colonial relationship that dates from the 1898
U.S. occupation of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War.
	   The opposition Popular Democratic Party sought to frustrate
those plans, supporting a ``none of the above'' option because it
objected to the ballot's description of commonwealth. Written by
Rossello's party, it suggests Congress could revoke Puerto Ricans'
U.S. citizenship under commonwealth.
	   ``We are very happy with our commonwealth, and we want to keep
it,'' the party's San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon said when she voted.
``Today, we Puerto Rican people are asserting our identity, our
love for commonwealth, our love of our U.S. citizenship.''
	   Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with local autonomy. Its 3.8
million residents can't vote for president or Congress.
	   Legislation calling for a binding series of votes to resolve the
debate died in the U.S. Senate this year.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The full House will take up the four articles
of impeachment against President Bill Clinton on Thursday in what
is expected to be a long and contentious debate. House Republican
aides say final votes could spill into Friday.
	   The Judiciary Committee, which passed the articles, first must
write a final report on its inquiry. House rules call for a waiting
period of two legislative days _ Sunday doesn't count _ before the
articles can come to the floor.
	   That means the articles will be available Wednesday, the same
day that Speaker Newt Gingrich has notified lawmakers to return to
Washington. Republican and Democratic leaders plan party caucuses
that day, with debate on impeachment to begin Thursday morning.
	   Incoming Speaker Bob Livingston has tapped Rep. Ray Lahood,
R-Ill., to preside over the debate. Judiciary committee chairman
Henry Hyde of Illinois will act as GOP floor manager, and ranking
Democrat John Conyers of Michigan is expected to manage the debate
for his party.
	   Hyde said Sunday that he expects a ``prolonged debate ... I
would be for expanding the time considerably so everyone can talk
who wants to.''
	   Republican leaders plan separate, yes-or-no votes on each of the
articles, said two GOP House aides who spoke on condition of
anonymity. They do not plan a vote on the Democratic alternative of
censure.
	   Democrats cannot amend the articles but they are entitled to a
motion to recommit the matter to the committee with instructions.
And House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri could use
that motion as a vehicle to seek a vote on censure.
	   The House parliamentarian already has decided that censure is
not germane and would rule the Democratic motion out of order, the
aides said. At that point, Gephardt could demand a vote appealing
such a ruling. That, in effect, would then become the vote on
whether censure should be considered.
	   Democrats have few other options to try to force a vote on
censure. But they do have many other procedural ways to delay the
impeachment votes, such as moving repeatedly that the House should
adjourn. That could push the final votes to Friday or even later,
the House aides said.

	   Transcript of a news conference with President Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem Sunday:
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: Thank you. Mr.
President, I want to welcome you and your entire delegation, the
secretary of state, the national security adviser and your
exceptional team for coming here on this mission of peace. And for
your understanding of our concerns with Wye River. And there and in
our conversation this morning, I've come to appreciate and admire
your extraordinary ability to empathize and the seriousness with
which you examine every issue. Your visit here is part of the
implementation of the Wye River Accords.
	   Now this was not an easy agreement for us. But we did our part.
And we are prepared to do our part based on Palestinian compliance.
When I say that we did our part, you know that within two weeks we
withdrew from territory, released prisoners, and opened the Gaza
Airport, precisely as we undertook to do. The Palestinians in turn
were to live up to a series of obligations in the sphere of
security, and ending incitement and violence, and the repeal of the
Palestinian Charter, and in commitments to negotiate a final
settlement in order to achieve permanent peace between us. I regret
to say that none of these conditions have been met.
	   Palestinians proceeded to unilaterally declare what the final
settlement would be. Coming out of Wye they said again and again
that regardless of what happens in the negotiations, on May 4 of
1999 they will unilaterally declare a state, divide Jerusalem, and
make its eastern half the Palestinian capital. This is a gross
violation of the Oslo and Wye Accords, which commit the parties to
negotiate to a mutually agreed final settlement. Mr. Arafat and the
Palestinian Authority must officially and unequivocally renounce
this attempt. I think no one can seriously expect Israel to hand
over another inch of territory unless and until such an unambiguous
correction is made.
	   I said that there were other violations. The Palestinians, I'm
afraid, began a campaign of incitement. At Wye, as those who are
here well know, we agreed to release Palestinian prisoners. But not
terrorists with blood on their hands or members of Hamas who are
waging war against us. No sooner did we release the agreed number
of prisoners in the first installment, that the Palestinian
Authority refused to acknowledge what they agreed to at Wye.
Falsely charging Israel with violating the prisoner release clause,
Palestinian leaders openly incited for violence and riots which
culminated in a savage near-lynching of an Israeli soldier. And the
Palestinian Authority organized other violent demonstrations.
	   Therefore, the Palestinian Authority must stop incitement and
violence at once, they must do so fully and permanently. There has
also been some downgrading on parts of the security cooperation
between us and the Palestinian Authority must restore this
cooperation. Again, fully and permanently. They must live up to
their other obligations in the Wye agreements in the field of
weapons collection, illegal weapons collection, reducing the size
of their armed forces, and the like. Now I stress that none of
these are new conditions. All are integral parts of the Wye and
Oslo agreements to which we are committed. We hope that tomorrow
the Palestinian Authority will once and for all live up to at least
one of their obligations.
	   And if the PNC members will vote in sufficient numbers to annul
the infamous Palestinian Charter, that will be a welcome
development. And it's important. Five years after the promise to do
so Oslo, to see this happen would be a welcome and positive
development. I think this is _ it's just as important to see strict
adherence to the other obligations in order to reinject confidence
into the peace process and to get this process moving again, where
Israel will also do its part. Mr. President, I'm sure that we can
achieve peace between Palestinians and Israelis if we stand firm on
Palestinian compliance. I very much hope that you will be able to
persuade the Palestinians, what I know you deeply believe and I
believe, that violence and peace are simply incompatible. Because
ultimately what is required is not merely a checklist of correcting
Palestinian violations but, I think, a real change of conduct by
the Palestinian leadership.
	   And they must demonstrate that they have abandoned the path of
violence and adopted the path of peace. For us to move forward,
they must scrupulously adhere to their commitments under the Wye
Agreement on which we have all worked so hard. And may I say, on a
personal and national note, and international note, that if there's
anyone who can help bring the peace process to a satisfactory
conclusion, it is you, President Clinton. Your devotion to this
cause, your perseverance, your tireless energy, your commitment,
have been an inspiration to us all.

	   Netanyahu: May it help us restore peace and hope to our land and
to our people.
	   President Clinton: Prime Minister, I thank you for your
statement and for your warm welcome. I would say to the people of
Israel, I was told before I came here that no previous president
had ever visited Israel more than once and this is my fourth trip
here. I may be subject to tax assessment if I come again in the
next two years. But I am always pleased to be here. I want to thank
you also and the members of your team for the exhausting effort
which was made at Wye over those nine days.
	   The time we spent together, the sleepless nights, and the
extraordinary effort to put together a very difficult, but I think
sound, agreement. Let me begin by talking about some of the things
that we have discussed today. We've had two brief private meetings.
One a breakfast meeting with our wives this morning, and then a
brief private meeting, and then our extended meeting with our two
teams. I want to begin where I always do. America has an unshakable
commitment to the security of the state and the people of Israel.
We also have an unshakable commitment to be a partner in the
pursuit of a lasting comprehensive peace.
	   I have told the prime minister that I will soon submit to the
Congress a supplemental request for $1.2 billion to meet Israel's
security needs related to implementing the Wye River agreement.
Only if those needs are met can the peace process move forward. At
the same time, I am convinced, as I think we all are, everyone who
has dealt with this problem over any period of time, that a lasting
peace, properly achieved, is the best way to safeguard Israel's
security over the long run. Last month at the conclusion of the Wye
talks, the prime minister and Chairman Arafat and I agreed that it
would be useful for me to come to the region to help to maintain
the momentum.
	   And to appear tomorrow before the PNC and the other Palestinian
groups that will be assembled. I also want to commend the prime
minister for the steps he has taken to implement the Wye Agreement,
which he just outlined. He has secured his government's support for
significant troop withdrawal from the West Bank, and begun the
implementation of that withdrawal, reached an agreement that
allowed for the opening of the Gaza airport. And he began the
difficult process of prisoner releases. The Palestinian Authority
has taken some important steps with its commitments, deepening
security cooperation with Israel, acting against terrorism, issuing
decrees for the confiscation of illegal weapons and dealing with
incitement, taking concrete steps to reaffirm the decision to amend
the PLO Charter, which will occur tomorrow.
	   Have the Palestinians fulfilled all their commitments? They
certainly could be doing better to preempt violent demonstrations
in the street, which is a terribly important matter. I also agree
that matters that have been referred consistent with the Oslo
Agreement for final status talks should be left there, and should
be the subject to negotiations. But in other areas, there has been
a forward progress on the meeting of the commitments. Now, I know
that each step forward can be excruciatingly difficult. And that
now real efforts have to be made on both sides to regain the
momentum. We just had a good discussion about the specific things
that the Israelis believe are necessary for the Palestinians to do
to regain the momentum.

	   Clinton: And we talked a little bit about how we might get
genuine communication going again so that the necessary steps can
be taken to resume the structured implementation of the Wye River
Agreement which is, I think, a part of what makes it work. At least
it made it work in the minds of the people who negotiated it, and
it can work in the lives of the people who will be affected by it.
If both sides meet all their commitments, and only if they do. Each
side has serious political constraints. I think we all understand
that. Provocative pronouncements, unilateral actions can be
counterproductive given the constraints that each side has. But in
the end, there has been a fundamental decision made to deal with
this through honest discussion and negotiation. That is the only
way it can be done.
	   It cannot be done by resorting to other means when times get
difficult. But again I say, the promise of Wye cannot be fulfilled
by violence, or by statements or actions which are inconsistent
with the whole peace process. Both sides should adhere to that. Let
me also just say one other word about regional security. I think
Israelis are properly concerned with the threat of weapons of mass
destruction development with the threat of missile delivery
systems. We are working with Israel to help to defend itself
against such threats in particular through the Arrow antiballistic
missile program. We've also just established a joint strategic
planning committee as a forum to discuss how we can continue to
work together on security matters.
	   Now we're going to take a couple of questions I know, but again
I would like to say in closing, Mr. Prime Minister, I appreciate
the courage you showed at Wye. Your farsightedness in seeking peace
and in taking personal and political risks for it which should now
be readily apparent to anyone has followed the events of the last
six weeks. Your determination, your tenacity to build an Israel
that is both secure and at peace is something that I admire and
support. And I think if we keep working at it, we can keep making
progress. Thank you very much.
	   Q: Mr. President, what is your reaction to the decision of the
judiciary committee of the house yesterday? Do you intend to resign
as did President Nixon? And with your permission, one question to
Prime Minister Netanyahu in Hebrew. Mr. Prime Minister, you have to
some extent appointed Mr. Clinton to ask as a referee between the
Israelis and the Palestinians. He will appear tomorrow in Gaza
where the decision of the committee will be to revoke its objection
to the existence of Israel. What will you do if this decision is
taken and how will you react to your issues facing you with the
cabinet regarding a no-confidence vote?
	   Clinton: My reaction to the committee vote is that I wasn't
surprised. I think its been obvious to anyone who was following it
for weeks that that vote was foreordained. And now it is up to the
members of the House of Representatives to vote their conscience on
the Constitution and the law which I believe are clear. And I have
no intention of resigning. It's never crossed my mind.
	   Netanyahu: An end to the Gaza ... as though we had agreed to
release Palestinian prisoners who are terrorists.

	   Netanyahu: This is not the case. There was a commitment
regarding weapons and to the police force, so that if there is a
positive development tomorrow and there is a serious vote by the
Palestinians tomorrow, which makes the whole world understand that
they intend to abolish the covenant, we shall welcome that. It will
be proof that it has been correct for us to adopt a firm policy as
we have done. We also expect them to comply with their other
agreements. If they do so, we too will meet our commitments. That
is and will be our policy. We will wait to see what they're going
to do.
	   I have no fear whatsoever of the results reflecting the
coalition. Whatever happens will take place. We expect a clear
policy of the Palestinians complying with their undertakings. The
rest is not relevant. If you can translate all of that, you're a
genius.
	   Translator: In essence, we expect to see the Palestinian side
revoke the Palestinian charter. We also expect the Palestinians to
meet their commitment to stop incitement. If in fact tomorrow the
Palestinian charter is revoked, we will view it as a success of our
policy. What we merely expect is that the Palestinians honor their
commitments, and that's our expectation.
	   Netanyahu: I would say that's a pretty good abbreviation of what
I said.
	   You have a great future as an editor.
	   Clinton: We all need one.
	   Q: Mr. President, How confident are you that you can avoid
impeachment in the full House next week. Are you planning any
particular kind of outreach additional to lawmakers or the public?
	   Clinton: Well, I think it's up to _ the question of whether each
member will simply vote his or her conscience based on the
Constitution and the law. And I don't know what's going to happen,
that's up to them. It's out of my hands.
	   If any member wishes to talk to me or someone on my staff, we
would make ourselves available to them, but otherwise I think it's
important that they be free to make this decision and that they not
be put under any undo pressure from any quarter.
	   Many of them have said they feel such pressure, that is, but I
can't comment on that because I haven't talked directly to many
members of the House caucus _ the Republican Caucus _ and I have
talked to those, a few who said they wanted to talk to me.
Otherwise, I have not. I don't think it's appropriate for me to be
personally calling people unless they send word to me that there's
some question they want to ask or something they want to say. I
don't think it's appropriate.
	   Q: Mr. President, you said it's now up to the members of the
House to decide ...
	   Netanyahu: May I ask a favor, just a question. You're free to
ask any one of your questions, but I think the president has come
here on a very clear message, on a very clear voyage of peace and I
believe it would be appropriate also to ask one or two questions on
the peace process I would like to know the answers to.
	   Q: This will be exactly my second question. The first one is
about what will happen Thursday if the members of the House will
decide about the impeachment, if in this case whether you will
consider resignation and second question about the peace process.
After all, what you see now after you hear the prime minister,
don't you think you were wrong in the Wye memorandum. Don't you
think that you get an agreement which both sides cannot comply?
	   Clinton: Well, the answer to both questions is no. And let me
amplify on your second question. No, I don't think it was wrong.

<TEXT>
	   Clinton: Look, if this were easy it would have been done a long
time ago and we knew that in the Wye it would be difficult for both
sides to comply. Actually the first two weeks were quite hopeful.
In the first phase I think there was quite good compliance on both
sides, and I think the prime minister feels that way as well.
	   A number of things happened with which you are very familiar
which made the atmosphere more tense in the ensuing weeks, and one
of the things that I hope to do while I am here in addition to
going and meeting with the Palestinian groups, including the PNC,
is to do what I did this morning. To listen very carefully to the
prime minister and to his government about what specific concerns
they have in terms of the agreement and compliance with it and then
try to resolve those and listen to the Palestinians as I will, so
that we can get this process going again.
	   I find that when the parties are talking to each other and
establish an atmosphere of understanding of the difficulty of each
others' positions and deal with each other in good faith we make
pretty good progress. But there's a long history here and nine days
at Wye or two weeks of implementing or all of _ you know it can't
overcome all that history, plus which there are political
constraints and imperatives in each position, which make it more
likely that tensions will arise.
	   But the fact that this has been hard to implement doesn't mean
it was a mistake. It just, it means it was real. It, look ... we
had made an agreement that was easy to implement, it would have
dealt with no difficult circumstances, and so we'd be just where we
are now except worse off.
	   We have seen in the first phase of implementation that good
things can happen on the security side from the point of view of
the Israelis and on the development of the territory on the point
of view of the Palestinians and the airport, if there is genuine
trust and actual compliance. And so what we have to do is to get
more actual compliance and in the process rebuild some of that
trust.
	   Q: Mr. President, some Republicans want you to go further than a
statement of contrition. They say that they want an admission of
perjury. Are you willing to do that and what do you think about
Chairman Hyde and the Republican leadership opposing a vote in the
House, in the full House on censure?
	   Clinton: Well, on the second question, I think you ought to ask
them whether they are opposed to it because they think that it
might pass, since apparently somewhere around three-quarters of the
American people think that's the right thing to do.
	   On the first question, the answer is no, I can't do that because
I did not commit perjury. We had, if you go back to the hearing, we
had four prosecutors, two Republicans, two Democrats, one the head
of President Reagan's criminal justice division who went through
the law in great detail and explained that, that it was not _ this
is not a perjury case and there was no credible argument on the
other side. So, I have no intention of doing that.
	   Now, was the testimony in the deposition difficult and ambiguous
and unhelpful? Yes it was. That's exactly what I said in the grant
jury testimony myself and I agree with what Mr. Roth said about it.
Mr. Roth answered questions, you know, for hours and hours and
hours and tried to deal with some of the concerns the committee had
on that and I thought he did an admirable job in acknowledging the
difficulty of the testimony.
	   But I could not admit to doing something that I'm quite sure I
did not do, and I think if you look at the law, if you look at the
legal decisions and if you look at what the Republican as well as
the Democratic prosecutor said, I think that's entitled to great
weight and I have read or seen nothing that really overcomes the
testimony that they gave on that question.
	   Moderator: Thank you very much. Please remain seated.
	   Q: (Off-mike)
	   Clinton: Yes I can. I have instituted the review that I pledged
to the prime minister and my, we've never done this on a case
before, but I told him I would do it and we did it and my counsel,
Mr. Roth, has invited the Justice Department and all the law
enforcement agencies under it and all the other security and
intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the government and
interested parties to say what they think about the Pollard case,
to do so by sometime in January.

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, rookie Az Hakim and June Henley each scored two
touchdowns and St. Louis (4-10) overcame three first-half turnovers
and the loss of starting quarterback Tony Banks.
	   The Patriots (8-6) wasted a big game from rookie running back
Robert Edwards, who gained 196 yards on 24 carries, and hurt their
playoff chances by losing for the first time in four games.
	   Banks tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee with
4:36 left in the first quarter and is out for the season. Backup
Steve Bono had a slow start with an interception and fumble in the
first half, but was 7-for-12 with no mistakes after the break.
 &UR; Falcons 27, Saints 17 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Terance Mathis caught touchdown passes of 63 and
62 yards from Chris Chandler as Atlanta stayed ahead of San
Francisco in the NFC West.
	   Jamal Anderson ran for 148 yards on 27 carries for the Falcons,
who can claim the NFL West crown and a first-round bye if the 49ers
lose to Detroit Monday night. It was Anderson's 10th 100-yard
rushing game this season
	   Chandler's 62-yard TD pass to Mathis followed an interception by
Ray Buchanan and made the score 14-0 after Eugene Robinson's fumble
recovery set up Bob Christian's 1-yard TD run. Chandler and Mathis
connected again with 6:50 left in the game.
 &UR; Bills 44, Raiders 21 &QC; 
	   In Orchard Park, New York, the Buffalo Bills scored on six
straight possessions and beat Oakland to stay in the AFC East
championship race.
	   Buffalo (9-5) has won four of its last five games and nine of 11
after an 0-3 start. The Bills are hoping to become only the fourth
team in league history to reach the playoffs after an 0-3 start.
	   Doug Flutie completed 17 of 26 passes for 174 yards and two
touchdowns for the Bills. Wade Wilson, starting for the first time
since 1996, went 16-for-26 for 131 yards for Oakland (7-7).
 &UR; Bucs 16, Steelers 3 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers appear to be peaking
at the right time.
	   Back in the playoff race after appearing all but eliminated
three weeks ago, the Bucs (7-7) beat Pittsburgh (7-7) for their
first three-game winning streak of the season.
	   Mike Alstott scored on a 3-yard run and a defense that's
regained its bite the past month forced the Steelers into five
turnovers. Pittsburgh has not scored a touchdown in nine quarters.
 &UR; Oilers 16, Jaguars 13 &QC; 
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, Al Del Greco kicked a 41-yard field
goal with four seconds remaining to lift Tennessee over
Jacksonville.
	   The win pulled the Oilers (8-6) within two games of Jacksonville
(10-4) in the AFC Central with two games remaining and the
tiebreaker in their favor.
	   The Jaguars, forced to use third-string quarterback Jonathan
Quinn in the second half because of injuries, still need one
victory to clinch their first division title. They play at
Minnesota next week, followed by a Monday night contest against
Pittsburgh.
 &UR; Redskins 28, Panthers 25 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, rookie Skip Hicks rushed for 55
yards and two touchdowns and the Washington Redskins extended their
late-season surge by beating Carolina.
	   Hicks helped the Redskins gain a season-high 160 yards on the
ground against one of the NFL's worst rushing defenses, even though
Terry Allen was sidelined with continuing ankle problems in the
first quarter.
	   Trent Green threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns as Washington
(5-9) won for the fifth time in seven games and secured its first
three-game winning streak since 1996.
	   Things got so ugly for Carolina (2-12) that linebacker Kevin
Greene attacked assistant coach Kevin Steele on the sidelines in
the second quarter. Greene grabbed Steele and began shoving him
backwards before coaches and players separated the two.

<TEXT>
	   Clinton: And I will review all that, plus whatever arguments are
presented to me on the other side for the reduction of the sentence
and I will make a decision in a prompt way, but we have instituted
this review which, as I said is unprecedented. We are giving
everyone time to present their comments and I will get comments on
both sides of the issue evaluated and make a decision.
	   Moderator: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please
remain seated until the president leaves, and the prime minister.
	   CLINTON: What did you say. They're demanding equal time, three
and three.
	   He wants to ask you a question. That's good.
	   Q: Can you explain, perhaps to the American people, why you
think Mr. Pollard is worthy of the release at this point.
	   Netanyahu: Jonathan Pollard did something bad and inexcusable.
He spied in the United States. He collected information on behalf
of the Israeli government. I was the first prime minister, and this
is the first government, to openly admit it. We think that he
should have served his time and he did. He served for close to 13
years, and all that I appealed to President Clinton for is merely a
humanitarian appeal.
	   It is not based on exonerating Mr. Pollard. There is no
exoneration for it. It is merely that he has been virtually in
solitary confinement for 13 years. It's a very, very heavy sentence
and since he was sent by us on a mistaken mission, not to work
against the United States, but nevertheless to break the laws of
the United States, we hope that on a purely humanitarian appeal,
the way it will be found to release him. That is all I can tell
you. It is not political. It is not to exonerate him. It is merely
to end a very, very sorry case that has afflicted him and the
people of Israel. Thank you.
	   Moderator: Thank you.

Palestinian radicals vow armed struggle against Israel

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hard-line Arab activists on Sunday vowed
to preserve their armed struggle against Israel, saying that to
recognize the Jewish state's right to exist would lead to the
``destruction of Palestinian unity.''
	   The hard-liners also announced the formation of a committee to
devise a new strategy for future action.
	   The announcement came in a statement issued at the end of a
two-day conference of 300 Palestinian and other delegates from the
Arab world. The statement gave no details of the proposed
committee.
	   The conference was called to discuss a strategy in light of a
scheduled meeting in Gaza City on Monday of the Palestinian
National Council, the highest decision-making body, to expunge
parts of the Palestinian National Charter that call for the
destruction of Israel.
	   But aside from the blustery rhetoric of the speeches and the
final communique, the radicals offered no suggestions or plans on
how they would counter the mainstream Palestinian Authority.
	   ``The annulment of the charter is an annulment of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and a destruction of Palestinian unity,''
said the statement. ``Our people's right to continue the resistance
until we regain all our national rights is a holy right guaranteed
by international laws.''
	   The statement was read out by Maher Taher, spokesman of the
Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   Earlier, speaker after speaker gave fiery speeches denouncing
Israel, the United States and the Palestinian Authority, which is
led by Yasser Arafat.
	   The mainstream Palestinian leadership is committed to remove
anti-Israeli portions from the charter under the Wye River accord
that Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed in
October. U.S. President Bill Clinton, who arrived in Israel on
Saturday, is scheduled to attend the PNC meeting.
	   ``I say that the authority of Yasser Arafat and those with him
should be taken away from them,'' said Ahmed Jibril, leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
	   ``We will fight for the safeguarding of the Palestinian National
Charter and protect it with blood,'' Saeed Mousa, leader of the
Fatah Uprising said, adding that Arafat has ``betrayed a century of
(Palestinian) struggle.''
	   The conference, which included leaders who figure high on
Israel's list of people wanted for violence, was the largest
gathering of Palestinian opposition leaders in many years.
	   Among those who took part were Ramadan Abdullah Shallah of
Islamic Jihad, Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, George Habash, chairman of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
leader of the Lebanese Haezbollah guerrilla group.

Guyanese parties agree to power-sharing on government boards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ In an effort to ease racial friction,
Guyana's ruling party has agreed to power-sharing guidelines on
appointed boards, the government news service said Sunday.
	   President Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party, backed by
Guyanese of East Indian descent, has agreed to allow the People's
National Congress, which is supported by people of African descent,
to name its own representatives to such bodies.
	   The deal was reached with the help of a mediator from the
15-member Caribbean Community trade group, which has its
headquarters in Georgetown, according to Guyana Information
Services.
	   Earlier this year, race riots swept through this South American
country to protest the victory of Jagan's party in the December
1997 election. As part of a Caricom-brokered truce, the government
agreed to rewrite the constitution to better balance political
power among the races.
	   Under the agreement, Jagan's party will invite the opposition
party to submit nominations three months before each board's term
ends. If it disapproves of the choice, the People's National
Congress must be notified and negotiations begun so that a
representative can be chosen before the end of the term.

`The Blue Room': The perfect body in a not-so-perfect play
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL KUCHWARA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Drama Critic &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Let's get right down to what most people really
want to know about ``The Blue Room,'' the vehicle which has brought
Nicole Kidman to Broadway.
	   Yes, Kidman, in various stages of demure undress, is just about
perfect, physically and otherwise. The play, unfortunately, is not,
despite director Sam Mendes' highly kinetic production that races
through 10 short scenes of seduction.
	   Arriving Sunday at the Cort Theater on a tidal wave of burblings
from the British press, ``The Blue Room'' is a chilly, neon-lit
meditation on sex that playwright David Hare has freely adapted
from Arthur Schnitzler's ``La Ronde.''
	   The production has a stainless-steel heart despite Kidman's
magnetic presence. The actress at least makes the evening
watchable, although you won't care very much for the people Kidman
and her able co-star, Iain Glen, portray.
	   Each of them plays a quintet of characters in an unnamed city
that seems suspiciously like present-day London. We first meet a
young hooker, new to the trade, trying to pick up a cocky taxicab
driver.
	   The prostitute is Hare's most appealing creation, probably
because she is the most vulnerable, a quality that is absent from
the others who populate Hare's round-robin of a drama.
	   The cab driver then moves on to an au pair who, in turn, finds
herself in bed with her employer's son, a nervous and
underachieving student.
	   Those moments of sex are done in blackout, accompanied by an
audible crackle of electric current and, in the production's
funniest gimmick, subtitles that announce the duration of the
experiences. These range from zero minutes on up to more than two
hours.
	   Hare sketches the couplings and uncouplings with blandness and
surprisingly little joy or romance. These people are not having
much fun. What's worse, you don't care about them, and the author's
attempts at humor _ including another tired go at the musicals of
Andrew Lloyd Webber _ are lame.
	   Hare can be a remarkable playwright, adept at portraying passion
or at least commitment. That passion came through last season in
``The Judas Kiss,'' his compelling take on an incident in the life
of a gracefully resigned Oscar Wilde. Here, disappointment is the
order of the day.
	   Yet his actors in ``The Blue Room'' work furiously at not
letting him down. Kidman has an unaffected, direct manner and a
strong voice. She is especially good as a married woman, nervously
meeting the hapless student. She has a particularly malleable face,
a countenance that can change completely just with the help of a
new hairstyle.
	   Kidman is less convincing as the actress, an older woman who
carries on with a playwright and then a younger man, an uptight
aristocrat. Her youthful demeanor works against the woman's
worldliness as a grand lady of the theater.
	   The character and costume changes are marvels of lightning
ingenuity. Glen, a square-jawed, serious-looking fellow, transforms
himself with astonishing speed. His student exudes insecurity,
while the politician and the playwright are models of
self-absorption.
	   The talk of sex is surprisingly coy as the couples maneuver each
other into bed. Not that you get to see Kidman in the altogether.
Her nude scenes are discreet _ and cleverly lighted by Hugh
Vanstone _ compared to the undrapings of Glen who even gets to do a
cartwheel in the buff.
	   These sexual entanglements are played out on designer Mark
Thompson's spare, almost minimalist settings, which trundle on and
off stage with conveyer-belt precision.
	   Precision is the hallmark of Mendes' production. Everything
works with an unemotional and uninvolving efficiency. And despite
the considerable allure of Kidman,''The Blue Room'' makes for a
particularly frosty evening of theater.

Royal Dutch-Shell expected to announce major cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group is expected to unveil
a sweeping cost-cutting program reducing the value of its assets by
billions of dollars when it meets with analysts Monday.
	   Other possible actions by the Anglo-Dutch oil giant include a
profit warning and an announcement of plans to sell parts of the
business.
	   The company would not comment on the meeting but said it planned
to issue a statement Monday afternoon.
	   Like other oil groups, Shell has been hit by a double blow of
12-year lows in the price of oil and falling demand in crisis-hit
Asia.
	   The group said Thursday that it has restructured its management
ranks, giving more responsibility to the heads of the company's
five business divisions in an effort to ensure it suffers less in
the troubled oil market.
	   Analysts predict Shell will write down up to nearly dlrs 5
billion from previous valuations of the company's assets.
	   ``Shell has been somewhat behind its rivals in cutting costs. It
has a famously bureaucratic management structure,'' said Jim
Wood-Smith, head of research at stockbrokers Greig Middleton.
``This means there is plenty of room for efficiencies and job cuts
are inevitable.''
	   The group has already announced the likely closure of its
92,000-barrels-a-day Shell Haven refinery in Britain.
	   One analyst said Shell would be looking to sell parts of its
chemical and coal divisions, while there may also be further
European refinery cuts to come.
	   Industry experts have said 15 percent of the production capacity
in Europe's refineries needs to be cut to bring stability to the
market.
	   Some Shell watchers warned the announcement may not include much
detail. They said the company may choose to tell staff of its plans
before it tells analysts.
	   The Sunday Times reported that analysts predict the company may
be planning to dispose of about dlrs 6.6 billion in assets in the
next three years and that it will announce a reduction in capital
spending for next year from almost dlrs 16.5 billion to dlrs 11.6
billion.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton joined Israeli
children Sunday in ushering in the eight-day Jewish festival of
Hanukkah, expressing hope that the first candle would kindle peace.
	   Taking a break from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
Clinton clapped and swayed as a children's choir sung the Hanukkah
hymn ``Rock of My Redemption'' at a Hanukkah party hosted by
Israeli President Ezer Weizman at his official residence in
Jerusalem.
	   An 11-year-old boy, Moshe Mit Babo, whose family immigrated to
Israel from Ethiopia, wore a white skull cap and sang Hebrew
blessings as he lit the first candle on the Menorah, an
eight-branched candelabra.
	   Hanukkah, also known as the festival of lights, commemorates the
Jewish uprising in the second century B.C. against the Greek-Syrian
kingdom, which had tried to impose its culture and adorn the Jewish
Temple in Jerusalem with statues of Greek gods.
	   Jewish legend says that when a small group of Jewish warriors
tried to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found only
enough oil for one day. But the oil lasted eight days and is
believed to have been a miracle.
	   Commemorating the good fortune of their ancestors, Jews light an
additional candle at sundown each day until the candelabra is full.
They also eat traditional foods fried in oil, such as jelly
doughnuts and potato pancakes.
	   Clinton compared the miracle of Hanukkah to the miracle of the
state of Israel. He expressed the hope that the first candle would
``kindle a spark of peace touching all the peoples and places of
the Holy Land.''
	   During his trip to the Mideast, Clinton is trying to repair the
tattered land-for-peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Earlier, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton lit a Hanukkah
candle, a Christmas tree and a Ramadan lantern as she promoted
Jewish-Arab coexistence as the basis for a lasting peace.
	   In synagogues, rabbis read from the Book of the Maccabees, which
tells the story of the ancient uprising. In Israel, it has become a
tradition during Hanukkah for orchestras and choirs to perform
Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabaeus, which also tells the story of
the rebellion. The victory anthem from the oratorio has become a
popular children's song and has been set to Hebrew.
	   Toy stores did a brisk business as the festival approached, with
parents buying holiday gifts for children. Dunkin Donuts also sold
thousands of jelly-filled doughnuts.
	   Later Sunday, viewers around the world witnessed a simultaneous
lighting of the Hanukkah candles on the Internet at 2015 GMT, when
the ultra-Orthodox Habad movement opened the holiday with
ceremonies in Jerusalem, Moscow, Paris and New York.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After successfully joining and
outfitting the first two pieces of the international space station,
Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story complex loose Sunday and
then flew away.
	   They were sorry to go.
	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   The winged, cylindrical station glistened in the sunlight as the
shuttle circled from a distance of 450 feet for a final photo
survey. Once that was done, Sturckow fired Endeavour's thrusters
and the shuttle pulled away for good.
	   The astronauts could still see the station from more than eight
miles out and excitedly beamed down pictures.
	   ``It's the brightest new star on the horizon,'' Cabana said as
the station grew smaller and smaller, its two components resembling
the head and body of a snowman lying sideways.
	   With Endeavour's flawless departure, NASA's lead flight
director, Bob Castle, was finally ready to declare the assembly
part of the 12-day mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber in the shuttle cargo
bay on Dec. 6, then conducted three spacewalks to wire the
components together, install and fix antennas, and attach a tool
box to the outside. They also spent a full day inside the station,
sprucing it up for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in just
over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.

MIDEAST NOTEBOOK: Wounded Israeli soldier moves Clinton

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite an ugly bandage over his upper lip and
all the way around his head, Ben Skalker, an Israeli soldier
wounded on duty in Lebanon, smiled brightly Sunday when he shook
U.S. President Bill Clinton's hand.
	   Skalker, 25, came to Israel from England alone several years ago
and joined the Israeli army. In August, 1997, he was critically
burned when his patrol was caught in a fire in south Lebanon that
killed five soldiers in his unit.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman invited Skalker and another
soldier to his residence for a Hanukkah celebrations with Clinton,
and introduced the young men to Clinton at the end of the
festivities. Clinton walked over to the soldiers, no longer on
active duty because of their wounds, and shook their hands. Laying
his left hand on Skalker's shoulder, he talked with the two for
several minutes, smiling warmly, emotionally.
	   Skalker, dressed in a gray, checkered flannel shirt, looked up
at Clinton and smiled back, below the bandage over his lip, one of
the last signs of the burns that ravaged most of his body after the
fire.
	   ____________
	   More than a thousand Israeli teenagers stood and cheered as
Clinton entered Jerusalem's convention center. They cheered Clinton
louder and longer than they cheered their own prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   As the two leaders stood on the stage, teenagers waved at them.
Netanyahu waved back, but the youths seemed not to notice. When
Clinton waved back, they cheered louder. Clinton had to wave to all
sections of the auditorium before the master of ceremonies could
get them to calm down.
	   Tanya Ben-Nun, 17, a 12th-grade student at Ramat Gan Religious
High School near Tel Aviv, called Clinton ``a light onto the
nations,'' a phrase Jews usually use to describe themselves.
	   Calling the event with Clinton ``exciting,'' she said everyone
in her school wanted to attend. Instead, they drew numbers to
select only five representatives from each class.
	   _____________
	   The Hebrew language was good for some laughs Monday.
Mispronouncing a word in his native tongue, Netanyahu, who spent
much of his youth in the United States, called Israeli teenagers
``sons of the mailman'' instead of ``The future generation,''
setting off a wave of guffaws from the youngsters.
	   Clinton tried his hand at two Hebrew phrases, ``You have no
choice'' and ``You have a choice,'' making a point about what kind
of future Israeli youth see for their country. They greeted his
effort to speak their language with a lively round of applause.
	   _____________
	   Impeachment may have been on Clinton's mind when he appeared to
lose his concentration during a dinner hosted by Netanyahu.
	   Several times during his address, Netanyahu turned to Clinton
and addressed him personally. Clinton stared off toward the middle
of the room, as if he hadn't heard the Israeli leader.
	   When Netanyahu offered the customary toast at the end of his
speech, Netanyahu and the other 400 people picked up their glasses
of white wine--everybody but Clinton.
	   A few seconds of near-embarrassment passed before Clinton seemed
to rejoin the event, raised his glass and clicked it with the one
held by Netanyahu's wife Sara, seated next to him at the head
table.
	   ______________
	   Clinton did pick up on one remark from Netanyahu's dinner
speech. Netanyahu said he had heard that Clinton's minister was
influential in the president's obvious affinity with Israel.
	   Clinton told the rest of the story. He said his pastor had
visited the Holy Land more than 40 times over a period of 50 years
until his death in 1989.
	   Clinton recalled that before he thought about running for
president, his pastor told him, ``You might be president one day.
You will make mistakes and God will forgive you. But God will never
forgive you if you forget the state of Israel.''
	   Turning to Netanyahu, Clinton smiled, ``I hesitate to tell it
because then you will use it against me.''

Old Believer's role as policeman spans two worlds

<TEXT>
	   WOODBURN, Ore. (AP) _ Growing up as a Russian Old Believer,
Kalin Ayhan learned that preserving his religion came above all.
	   The centuries-old Christian orthodox rituals and other aspects
of their way of life transported from pre-Communist Russia to
Turkey to the United States were sovereign.
	   It often meant working on a farm or in furniture factories. It
meant socializing and marrying within the Old Believer community.
It meant men didn't shave.
	   It certainly didn't mean becoming a police officer. But 41/2
years ago, Ayhan became the first Old Believer on the force. Today,
the 29-year-old patrols the streets of Woodburn, an ideological
world away from where he grew up.
	   The simple choice of shaving his beard has made him something of
an outcast.
	   He cannot be an active member of his church because of it. And
only because his supervisors gave him permission to temporarily
grow his beard, he was able to marry in his church.
	   ``Some people just hate the idea that one of their own is
policing,'' Ayhan said.
	   From a community that started settling here in the 1960s and
remains largely closed to retain its identity, Ayhan chose a job
that put him in the thick of one of Oregon's most diverse
communities.
	   The town is part agricultural, part retirement community and
part growing freeway interchange with strong Latino and Russian
influences.
	   There are longtime Pentecostal Russians and newer Soviet
Russians as well. They have a language in common but differ in
their religious beliefs and on whether to ``Americanize.''
	   In January, Ayhan will receive one of six Woodburn Human Rights
Commission's annual awards for people who bridge cultures in the
community.
	   Ayhan was born here but spoke little English when he showed up
for first grade in 1976. He and the other Russian-speaking children
were grouped in a classroom with a bilingual teacher.
	   At home, he was admonished not to speak English by parents
worried he would forget his language.
	   Ayhan's father unknowingly first sparked his interest in police
work.
	   ``My dad had a lot of respect for the police and whenever we
would travel, my dad would point out that the police are good
people and they're there to help,'' Ayhan said.
	   As a teen-ager, Ayhan landed a job pumping gasoline at a
convenience store owned by former Marion County Sheriff Robert
Prinslow, who was running for office. He encouraged the teen to
pursue his interest in police work.
	   At 18, Ayhan enlisted in the U.S. Army with a plan: He would be
a military policeman.
	   A recruiter picked him up at his house. His parents cried. Ayhan
hugged his mom and rode away. That night, for the first time, he
shaved. There wasn't much to shave, some peach fuzz and a little
mustache.
	   After four years in the military, traveling to 25 countries,
Ayhan returned to Oregon.
	   He put himself through community college while working as a bank
security guard the applied to the Woodburn Police Department.
	   ``As hard as it is to be a police officer, it's probably twice
as hard in Woodburn because of cultural and language barriers,'' he
said.
	   The department loves him and figures it will be hard to keep him
because of his bilingual and bicultural background.
	   He figures his parents are proud, although ``they would more
likely to be more happy with me in a career that would allow me to
practice the religion.''
	   Once he returned to Woodburn, he renewed an acquaintance with
Mary Lisoff, an Old Believer. When they decided to marry, she
wanted a wedding within the culture. That required Ayhan to be an
active member of the church. That required a beard.
	   The department, which bans beards so they cannot be grabbed by
suspects, let him grow one, and the day before the October 1995
wedding, he was let back into the church.
	   About four months later, he shaved it again.
	   ``That was the hardest time for me,'' he said. ``My parents were
really, really disappointed. It started all over again, as far as
getting away from the religion and such.''
	   Mary Ayhan, a former volunteer firefighter, decided she wanted a
career. Now, she's a parole-probation officer with the Marion
County Juvenile Department.
	   Kalin Ayhan long ago abandoned traditional Russian dress. His
Russian accent is barely detectable.
	   He still loves his culture. But what he hopes to pass along to
his children will be the language and what he knows about his
family's struggle to preserve a religious way of life.
	   ``I'm not accepted in the church because of my appearance,'' he
said. ``Appearance seems to be more important than conduct.''

 &UR; Eds: Updates with government condemning strike. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The government on Monday condemned a
48-hour strike by the nation's coal miners, which has brought
mining in Australia to a halt.
	   Coal producers were likely to ask the Australian Industrial
Relations Commission on Monday to declare the strike illegal and
stop it.
	   Mining companies estimate the strike will cost the industry 56
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 34 million) in lost
production.
	   The government slammed the strike, called by the Construction,
Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) to protest a deal which
will cut the price of coking coal.
	   ``This union is infamous for taking industrial action,''
Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Reith said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of
strikes, undermining Australia's reputation as a reliable and
consistent supplier.
	   ``The CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national
interest, they undermine the interests of their own workers, they
run a political agenda,'' he said.
	   ``Now they want the Australian government to control the
international price of a major commodity, obviously something
outside our control,'' he said.
	   But CFMEU mining division general president Tony Maher said the
government had failed to address a general coal crisis that had
sparked major job losses and are threatening more.
	   He said the government had refused to protect Australia's
national interest after companies Mount Isa Mines (MIM), Shell and
the North Goonyella Mine offered a major cut in coking coal prices
to overseas buyers.
	   They had agreed to a U.S. dlrs 9 a metric ton, or 18 percent,
price cut in coking coal, which is used to make steel. Steaming
coal is used for electricity production.
	   ``Coal is Australia's biggest export earner -- it earns 10
billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country so a 20 percent
drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect -- that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrap heap.''
	   Maher believes the problems in the coal industry stem from an
oversupply of coal.
	   ``There's 20 million ton excess capacity coming out of
Australia,'' he said.
	   ``We're allowing too many new mines to come on stream and the
government just sits back and lets them open up new mines.''
	   In accepting the price cut, mine owners had made a ``blind
grab'' for market share instead of price, Maher said.
	   Australian Coal Association spokesman Denis Porter said the
association was still waiting for confirmation of the deal on a
price cut for coking coal.
	   He said the world market for coal remained tough and recent job
losses were a sad but necessary part of the industry adapting and
surviving in a very competitive world market.

Forestry, Mining and Energy Union to protest a deal which will cut
the price of coking coal.
	   ``This union is infamous for taking industrial action,''
Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Reith said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of
strikes, undermining Australia's reputation as a reliable and
consistent supplier.
	   ``The CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national
interest, they undermine the interests of their own workers, they
run a political agenda,'' he said.
	   ``Now they want the Australian government to control the
international price of a major commodity, obviously something
outside our control,'' he said.
	   But CFMEU mining division general president Tony Maher said the
government had failed to address a general coal crisis that had
sparked major job losses and is threatening more.
	   He said the government had refused to protect Australia's
national interest after companies Mount Isa Mines, Shell and the
North Goonyella Mine offered a major cut in coking coal prices to
overseas buyers.
	   They had agreed to a U.S. dlrs 9 a metric ton, or 18 percent,
price cut in coking coal, which is used to make steel. Steaming
coal is used for electricity production.
	   ``Coal is Australia's biggest export earner _ it earns 10
billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country so a 20 percent
drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect _ that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrap heap.''
	   Maher believes the problems in the coal industry stem from an
oversupply of coal.
	   ``There's 20 million ton excess capacity coming out of
Australia,'' he said.
	   ``We're allowing too many new mines to come on stream and the
government just sits back and lets them open up new mines.''
	   Australian Coal Association spokesman Denis Porter said the
association was still waiting for confirmation of the deal on a
price cut for coking coal.
	   He said the world market for coal remained tough and recent job
losses were a sad but necessary part of the industry adapting and
surviving in a very competitive world market.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Statehooders who want to make
Puerto Rico the 51st U.S. state refused to concede defeat in
divisive elections Sunday that gave an edge to supporters of the
Caribbean island's commonwealth ties to the United States.
	   With 95 percent of votes in, statehood had 46.5 percent of votes
to 50.2 percent for the ``None of the above'' option adopted by the
commonwealth party. In a similar non-binding referendum in 1993,
commonwealth beat statehood by 49-46 percent.
	   President Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the referendum _ but it was unclear what kind of message a ``none
of the above'' victory could send to Congress. Most likely is a
bitter and prolonged argument over interpreting the result.
	   Pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello insisted he won anyway,
arguing that almost all the people who voted for an actual status
definition supported statehood. He said he would use that
interpretation to petition Congress to make Puerto Rico a state.
	   ``Today the people spoke and they said statehood is the future
of Puerto Rico. The people spoke, and I will obey,'' Rossello told
thousands of cheering supporters at a victory-type rally as
spectacular fireworks lit the sky above his party's headquarters.
	   Pro-commonwealth Sen. Eudaldo Baez Galib countered, ``If they go
to Washington with a petition for statehood ... they would be
violating the right to vote of the majority.''
	   Some 70 percent of 2.2 million registered voters participated in
the nonbinding referendum that pitted statehood advocates against
defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth, in which
islanders are U.S. citizens but have no vote in Washington.
	   Voters could choose statehood, the commonwealth option,
independence or a ``free association'' form of independence with
U.S. treaty ties.
	   But the majority chose ``none of the above'' _ an option
Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano of New York has said would give
Congress little to work with.
	   Commonwealth supporters disagreed with the way commonwealth was
defined on the ballot, especially the suggestion that Congress was
empowered to revoke islanders' U.S. citizenship.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot
soon after voting stations opened.
	   At a polling station in southern Ponce city, an election
volunteer confronted the 95-year-old founder of the statehood
party, Luis A. Ferre. ``I know my people, and Americans don't want
Puerto Rico to be a state,'' said Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old
engineer from South Carolina who has married and settled on the
island.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton tried Sunday to
repair the tattered Wye River peace accords, appealing to
Palestinians to prove their peaceful intentions ``in word and
deed'' and Israel to acknowledge the ``legitimate expectations'' of
their longtime foes. ``The violent past and the difficult present
do not have to be repeated forever,'' Clinton said, exhorting
Israelis and Palestinians to carry out their land-for-peace deal
and go on from there to an overall settlement. But Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu linked any further Israeli withdrawal
on the West Bank to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat renouncing his
plans to declare statehood and taking steps to squelch violence.
And he urged Clinton to take that message to Arafat in Gaza on
Monday. Clinton's appearance at a special session of the Palestine
National Council Monday is the centerpiece of his three-day trip
aimed at salvaging the crisis-plagued land-for-security peace
accord. (MIDEAST-CLINTON)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president called Sunday
for religious tolerance, while his military chief defended a plan
to establish a civilian militia to help maintain order at a time of
widespread social and religious unrest. About 40,000 young people
will be recruited beginning in January and receive three months of
basic military training, military commander Gen. Wiranto said.
Then, they will be equipped with sticks, riot shields, handcuffs
and be empowered to make arrests. ``The level of disturbances has
reached a level that's beyond tolerance,'' Wiranto said, adding
that the resources of the 500,000-member military and police force
no longer are enough. Social turmoil has increased in Indonesia
since last year, when the southeast Asian nation was hit hard by a
regional financial crisis. In recent weeks, students demanding
greater democracy have staged huge anti-government protests in the
capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere. Mob and religious violence outside
the capital have added to the troubles. (INDONESIA-MILITIA,
INDONESIA-RELIGIOUS RIOTS)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors visited 25 sites Sunday on
the last day of their current round of searches for Iraq's illegal
weapons, Iraqi and U.N. officials said. Ten groups of experts from
the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, and the International
Atomic Energy Agency carried out surprise as well as scheduled
checks, the official Iraqi News Agency said. U.N. officials have
not specified when the next round of inspections will begin,
although monitoring of inspected sites will continue in the
meantime. UNSCOM and the IAEA are responsible for dismantling
Iraq's banned programs for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles. Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is
rid of the weapons, U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted. (IRAQ-UN)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans voted Sunday on
whether to petition Congress to become the 51st state, in a
divisive election aimed at resolving a century-long debate over the
Caribbean island's status. The nonbinding referendum pitted
statehood advocates against defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a
U.S. commonwealth, in which islanders are U.S. citizens but have no
vote in Washington. U.S. President Bill Clinton has asked Congress
to abide by the result of the referendum. Voters could choose
statehood, the commonwealth option, independence or a ``free
association'' form of independence with U.S. treaty ties. They also
could choose ``none of the above.'' With 74 percent of votes
counted Sunday, the elections commission reported 50.1 percent of
votes for the ``none of the above'' position backed by the
commonwealth party and and 46.7 percent for statehood. Other
options garnered the remaining few votes. (PUERTO RICO-REFERENDUM)
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Angolan forces, apparently responding to
an upsurge in rebel attacks at home, have withdrawn at least one
battalion from western Congo where they have deployed troops in
support of embattled President Laurent Kabila, Congolese rebel and
Rwandan sources said Sunday. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the
Congolese rebels fighting to oust Kabila, said at least 1,000
Angolan troops and tanks had left the air base at Kitona, about 250
miles (400 kilometers) southwest of Kinshasa. Rwandan officials
also reported the withdrawal. The claims could not be immediately
confirmed. Angola, which has sent troops, tanks and fighter jets
into Congo, has been involved in escalating clashes in its own
country against UNITA rebels. (CONGO-ANGOLA)

Body of missing Iranian writer found, daughter says

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian writer missing since last week
has been found dead, his daughter said. He is the fifth critic of
the hard-line clerical regime to die in mysterious circumstances in
recent weeks.
	   Iran's judiciary, controlled by the hard-liners, blamed unnamed
foreigners for the killings while a group of lawmakers accused an
exiled Iranian opposition organization.
	   The latest victim is Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old
writer and translator, who had been missing since last Wednesday.
	   His body was found Thursday, apparently strangled, Pouyandeh's
daughter, 17-year-old Nazanin, said Sunday. No personal belongings
were missing, she said.
	   Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, said the
killings are aimed at tarnishing the image of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who is locked in a power struggle with
conservative clergymen opposed to his political and social reforms.
	   Khatami's efforts had emboldened many free-thinkers in Iran such
as Pouyandeh.
	   But that has also angered the hard-liners, who control nearly
all key institutions, including the security forces, the
intelligence network and the office of the supreme leader, who has
the last say on all matters.
	   The president of the National Council of Resistance of Iran,
Massoud Rajavi, condemned Pouyandeh's death.
	   ``The recent events once again prove that Khatami's claims about
'the rule of law' and civil society' are only a deception,'' Rajavi
said in a news release faxed from the group's office in Washington.
	   The daily Akhbar newspaper quoted Tajzadeh as saying that a
number of arrests had been made and ``some clues'' have been found.
He said a special committee is investigating. He did not elaborate.
	   He described the killings as a conspiracy to make ``things
bitter for the people, at a time that the system is moving toward
political development.''
	   Pouyandeh's daughter said the family identified his body late
Saturday after being notified by the police.
	   ``I have lost all hope. I don't know who will die next, but I
hope that my father was the last victim of these slayings,'' she
told The Associated Press.
	   Ali Abbasi-Fard, the spokesman of Iran's judiciary, said Sunday
it appears that a ``sinister and organized movement is using agents
affiliated to foreign elements to undermine social stability and to
create fear throughout the society.''
	   In a joint letter to Khatami, 140 of Iran's 270 Parliament
members accused the Iraq-based opposition Mujahedeen Khalq and
unspecified foreign intelligence services of carrying out the
killings.
	   ``Those masterminding such conspiracies are trying to suggest
that insecurity is prevailing in Iran,'' the letter said.
	   In the past three weeks, four other government critics,
including two writers, have been found dead.
	   One of them, Mohammad Mokhtari, was possibly strangled,
according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Majid Sharif,
another writer also went missing and was found dead. The head of an
Iranian opposition group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh,
were found stabbed to death in their home last month.
	   Over the past year, the hard-liners have resorted to increasing
violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. Nobody has been
charged in any of the attacks.

Have yourself a fake but merry Christmas in Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Talking Teletubbies, Rolex watches and Calvin
Klein boxer shorts will fill many Christmas stockings across Asia
this year.
	   But watch out if the goodies are from Hong Kong: They may turn
out to be Telotubbies, Roluxes and Gioven Kelvins.
	   As Asia's financial crisis persists, more holiday shoppers are
turning to cheaper counterfeit products.
	   ``People don't have as much money now,'' said Calvin Leung, head
of intellectual property protection of the Customs and Excise
Department. ``Do you know how much it is to buy a designer suit for
your wife? And do you know how much you can save if you buy a
copy?''
	   Shoppers from around the world know the answer.
	   ``They're terribly fake,'' said Peter Schmidt, a German banker
living here, who bought three counterfeit Ralph Lauren polo
T-shirts from a hawker. Schmidt paid 30 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 3.80) per shirt _ compared with 430 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 55) for the real thing.
	   ``You can throw them away after one day,'' Schmidt said.
	   In the Temple Street night market, tourists, trendy teen-agers
and middle-aged shoppers browse at stalls selling clothing, toys,
electronics, watches, inflatable couches and CDs.
	   At one stall, cheap speakers blasted out ``My Heart Will Go
On,'' the theme song for Hollywood blockbuster ``Titanic.'' But the
``Celine Dion'' was conspicuously singing a couple of keys too low
with a cold-stricken voice.
	   ``This is the real thing,'' the vendor insisted.
	   Some of the goods look real enough to fool almost anyone. The
140 Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 18) counterfeit Prada wallets smell
like leather. Each carries a bogus ``certificate of authenticity.''
	   Other products are outright fakes, like the boxer shorts in
boxes emblazoned with the initials CK. The fine print says ``Gioven
Kelvins.''
	   A digital watch resembling the Casio G-Shock, popular among
Asian teen-agers, was actually an ``S-Shock.''
	   Kim Jae Kyong and You Jong Dae, businessmen from Seoul, South
Korea, haggled with a woman selling fake designer bags.
	   She displayed nothing more than photographs of her goods taped
to a folding table. She recited some numbers on her mobile phone,
and two assistants emerged minutes later with the products.
	   The woman wouldn't identify herself but had a good reason to
keep her products off the street. ``It's quite dangerous here, and
we don't want to run into trouble,'' she said.
	   Despite the heavy penalty _ counterfeit dealers can face fines
or up to five years in prison _ plenty of retailers are getting
into the lucrative trade. Some of the newly unemployed are also at
work selling fakes.
	   ``I wouldn't do this if I could find a job,'' said a man selling
bogus designer bags who gave only his first name, Rodrigo. ``You go
to jail if you get caught.''
	   Rodrigo, 18, lost his job as a waiter and now gets 3,500 Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 449) a month selling fakes.
	   The counterfeits in Hong Kong are mostly from mainland China,
South Korea and Southeast Asia, said Leung at the customs
department. Hong Kong is also a conduit for shipping the goods into
other markets including Taiwan and Singapore, he said.
	   Singapore officials, fearing hard times will prompt people to
buy fakes, launched a pre-Christmas campaign featuring the slogan:
``Stop piracy! Be original! Buy original!''
	   In the first 10 months of 1998, Hong Kong customs officials
arrested 619 people and seized countefeits worth 45 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.8 million).
	   But cracking down on piracy is difficult, Leung said.
	   Because Hong Kong is a relatively small market, many copyright
holders won't spend the money to sue pirates here. The government
can do little without their help, Leung said.
	   ``It is extremely easy to take a person to court. But how to
prove to the court that the goods are fake is extremely
difficult,'' Leung said.
	   At least one company is fighting back.
	   Wave Licensing International, which handles British Teletubbies
products in Hong Kong, hired investigators to find people selling
bogus products resembling the pudgy characters from the BBC kids
show.
	   Visiting Belgian exporter Bart Pillart was excited to find some
talking ``Telotubbies'' on Temple Street _ despite their low
quality.
	   ``Hey, it's shaped like a Teletubbie, it makes noises and it
looks like a Teletubbie,'' Pillart said. The toy is now headed to
his 3-year-old daughter's Christmas stocking.

Grenada calls elections for Jan. 14

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Mitchell, details on when
vote is legally required. &QL;

	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenadian Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell on Sunday called elections for Jan. 14 and urged
supporters to rescue his embattled leadership, which is mired in
charges of corruption.
	   He said the deadline for filing as candidates will be Dec. 20.
Elections are not legally due until June 2000.
	   ``Go into the highways and byways and bring your members out to
vote,'' he urged party leaders.
	   Mitchell made the announcement during a rally of his New
National Party in rural St. Andrew's Parish, where he outlined the
main achievements of his party's 3 1/2 years in office.
	   The New National Party lost its majority in parliament on Nov.
29, when his foreign minister and former health minister defected
to the rival Grenada United Labor Party.
	   During the rally, Mitchell touted public works projects
including a dlrs 53 million national stadium, a new government
office building and several road projects.
	   ``Make a choice between curse and blessing,'' Mitchell said.
``Choose the blessing of national development over chaos.''
	   But opposition officials say the projects have failed to create
many new jobs and are inflating the island's national debt.
Political analysts say the election could hinge on a corruption
investigation involving Communications and Works Minister Gregory
Bowen.
	   Before resigning and reversing Mitchell's majority, former
foreign minister Raphael Fletcher claimed an audit by accounting
firm KPMG Peat Marwick showed wrongdoing.
	   The report pointed to contracts being given to contractors
without a public bidding process. It also found that the ministry
was paying ``exorbitant fees'' to these contractors. Bowen has
denied any wrongdoing.
	   Fletcher was named leader of the Grenada United Labor Party
within days of his resignation from the government.
	   Meanwhile, the opposition National Democratic Congress unveiled
its slate of candidates in St. George's, the capital, and announced
that party leader George Brizan will hand leadership of the party
to his deputy, Joan Purcell.
	   If the National Democratic Party wins the election, Purcell
would become Grenada's first female prime minister.
	   Brizan, a former prime minister, is recovering from a torn
retina and complications from diabetes.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A car crash in a southern state
has killed two top Brazilian athletes, TV Globo reported Sunday.
	   Long-jumper Douglas de Souza, 26, and triple-jumper Gustavo Lima
Pinto, 21, died Saturday when the car they were travelling in
smashed into a pillar, the TV station said.
	   Souza, who competed in the 1996 Olympics, holds the South
American long-jump record of eight meters and 40 centimeters.
	   The crash happened on an interstate near Porto Alegre, the state
capital of Rio Grande de Sul, which is 960 miles (1,550 kms)
southeast of Rio, said the station.
	   According to recent figures some 50,000 people die each year on
Brazil's roads, despite government moves to clampdown on speeding
and drink-driving.
	    &UR; ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A correspondent for an American newspaper was
listed as missing Sunday, two weeks after he set out to hike into
the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Mexico.
	   Philip True, a Mexico City-based correspondent for the San
Antonio Express-News, headed into the mountains in western Jalisco
state Nov. 29, with dehydrated food, water, a camera and sleeping
bag, hoping to photograph the rough terrain and write about the
Huichol Indians who live there.
	   True intended to hike for 65 miles (105 kilometers) through
neighboring Nayarit state until Dec. 10. He was last seen around
Dec. 1 at Tuxpan, Jalisco, 370 miles (600 kilometers) northwest of
Mexico City.
	   Jalisco state officials sent a helicopter Sunday to sweep the
route True was to have followed through mountains and deep canyons.
Federal authorities were also alerted and are cooperating in the
search.
	   The region is extremely remote with few roads and telephone
service only in some larger towns.
	    &UR; ___
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Three unidentified men
opened fire on a pickup truck Sunday on a rural road in the
southern state of Chiapas, killing a 10-year-old boy and injuring
six other people.
	   The attack occurred about 90 miles (140 kms) north of this
Chiapas city in an area known as El Bosque where supporters of
leftist Zapatista rebels have clashed with police and army troops
in the past.
	   Sebastian Sanches Hernandez was killed in the attack, the
Chiapas State Attorney General's Office reported. The office had no
immediate information on the condition of the wounded.
	   The assailants reportedly wore quasi-military uniforms of the
type used by the Zapatistas. Pro-government paramilitary groups
have also been identified as wearing similar garb.
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in January 1994,
demanding greater democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks between
the government and rebels have been stalled since 1996.
	    &UR; ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Former police officials of the Caribbean
coast state of Quintana Roo _ including the brother-in-law of Gov.
Mario Villanueva _ are being investigated in relation to drug
trafficking, local media reported Sunday.
	   Prosecutors have focused increasing attention on the state of
Quintana Roo _ and have announced an investigation of Villanueva
himself _ after evidence mounted that the Caribbean coast is
increasingly being used a transit point for cocaine shipments.
	   Jose Luis Alamilla, Villanueva's brother-in-law and former head
of security for the governor, is being investigated for drug
trafficking and has disappeared, the newspaper Reforma quoted local
law enforcement as saying.
	   The attorney general's office was not immediately able to
confirm the report.
	   Villanueva has denied any links to drugtrafficking and claims
the accusations are politically motivated. His term as governor of
Quintana Roo ends in April.

	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ It's a brisk autumn night, but
The Pelican is red hot.
	   Salsa, soca, calypso and reggae fill the air, energizing a
diverse crowd of locals and visitors.
	   ``They say we are the rainbow country,'' says a smiling Opal
Douglass, who has come to ``lime'' _ the ubiquitous ``Trini'' verb
meaning ``to hang out.''
	   She's with her friends Ron, who is of African descent, Terence,
whose roots are in India, and others. ``I myself am so mixed I can
only say I'm Trinidadian!'' the 33-year-old insurance company
worker shouts above the music, then downs the rest of her Carib
beer.
	   Hers is a happy, booming society where things are looking up.
	   ___
	   Leroy Clarke's dark, lined face breaks into a rueful grin at
such talk.
	   ``People existed here for a long time on this lie _ that we were
some kind of `rainbow society,''' the respected Afro-Trinidadian
poet and painter says. ``But I tell you: This rainbow has teeth.
Trinidad as a unified society is what we can only dream of.''
	   With eloquent anger Clarke recounts how successive Spanish,
French and British masters imported shiploads of African slaves to
harvest sugar. How after the abolition of slavery in 1834, the
British brought indentured servants from India.
	   After their terms, many Indians were given land, and that, says
Clarke, is the source of their widely perceived _ but difficult to
quantify _ economic domination of Trinidad.
	   Today, 40 percent of the 1.3 million Trinidadians are of Indian
descent, and an equal share are of African heritage. The rest are
either mixed or hail from Portugal, Syria and other places.
	   Clarke, 60, sits on a wood bench surrounded by dozens of his
mural-sized paintings in a display that occupies half the national
museum building.
	   His words are harsh, but measured, and coming from a national
institution they carry some weight.
	   ``The Afro-Trinidadian's disenfranchisement has never been
redressed,'' he says. ``We are on the brink of something tragic, a
tidal wave of psychic disorder. Any little thing could spark such a
convulsion, such a catastrophe. So we cannot afford to go out in
public and be ridiculous as some people have been.''
	   ___
	   He's talking about Prime Minister Basdeo Panday, the longtime
political firebrand who was finally elected to head the government,
by a whisker, in 1995.
	   After 32 years of nearly all-black government in Trinidad,
Panday's victory was a cathartic coming of age for the Indians, and
they intend to keep what they have gained.
	   For many blacks, the loss of political power on top of their
economic woes was an almost unbearable humiliation.
	   Panday can't understand what the noise is all about.
	   In a recent speech he noted unemployment is down from 19 percent
in 1995 to about 13 percent and an economy that was shrinking then
will grow around 5 percent this year.
	   The economy ``has never been more prosperous; it has never been
more stable,'' he said.
	   And the potential is tremendous. With natural gas reserves of
more than 20 trillion cubic feet (about 600 billion cubic meters)
and probably more, Trinidad has attracted dlrs 4 billion of
investment by dozens of U.S. companies the past five years. Every
week seems to bring a new factory opening.
	   Yet in its zeal to bring him down, Panday charged, the
black-dominated People's National Movement and the black-dominated
news media have tried ``to whip up racist sentiments when any
Afro-Trinidadian was fired or removed from office, even though it
was for corruption or other wrongdoing.''
	   At a rally marking three years in power, Panday enraged his
critics by openly declaring war on the press: ``They are out to
destroy us. We must do them first ... they must not be allowed to
attack this government unfairly and escape unscathed.''
	   What Panday recommended was an advertising boycott, but many of
his supporters weren't splitting hairs. They began shoving,
verbally abusing and throwing drinks at reporters and cameramen on
the scene.
	   ___
	   The next day, Therese Mills was a very worried woman. The editor
of the highly successful daily Newsday had just ordered security
beefed up in the newspaper's downtown building.
	   ``There are lots of crackpots out there who could be
influenced,'' she said. ``I'm afraid the result will be severe
attacks on journalists and maybe even on press houses.''
	   ``The country has become radically polarized,'' she added.
``This never would have happened before Panday. The prime minister
seems out of control.''

	   Beri Singh is a man who speaks so quietly, with such meticulous
enunciation, that almost anything he says sounds reasonable and
correct.
	   ``Racism in this country has always existed, but we didn't let
it out. It's too dangerous. After all, you always have in every
office black people and Indian people working together. But now
people are talking and talking all the time.''
	   Then Singh, 60, offers this: ``For years a black government
ruled this country, and that is why we were in decline. Now, with
the Indian government, we have had a few achievements.''
	   Voicing a stereotype that is widely accepted among
Afro-Trinidadians as well, Singh adds: ``The Negro people _ when
they get a bit of money they just spend it! The Indian people, they
try to put together every coin, so that they will be able to buy a
little business or something.''
	   That doesn't make Singh an Indian nationalist, though. He, too,
feels Trinidadian, and a recent trip to India drove that fact home.
``My wife was pleased to be investigating her roots,'' he says.
``But as for me, to be perfectly truthful, I did not like it. Too
many people. Too many poor people. I was very pleased indeed to be
returning back home.''
	   ___
	   It's more than Africans and Indians only. About 15 miles (25
kilometers) east of Port-of-Spain lives the Akaloo clan _ a group
of most embittered farmers.
	   About 15 years ago, they say, they were encouraged by government
officials to cultivate rice on 2,000 acres (800 hectares) of remote
swampland near the island's eastern coast. They invested in roads
and drainage, but because of environmentalists' objections they
were never given a formal lease.
	   The 16 farmers _ all Indo-Trinidadians _ voted for Panday in
1995, and hoped his victory would pave the way for their
legalization.
	   Instead they were soon expelled by police.
	   ``We were employers, and now we are unemployed,'' laments Hashem
Hussein, 29, who relies on welfare to feed his family of four.
	   The issue was taken up by the media, and became something of a
national scandal, with allegations of corruption and unfairness
raising a vocal lobby for the farmers.
	   The Akaloos have little faith they'll get their land back,
though. They're convinced the problem is ethnic: They say fellow
Indians want to ruin them because they are Muslims, members of a
minority within the Indo-Trinidadian group.
	   ``There's a conflict between the Muslim and Hindu,'' says Phiw
Akaloo, his colleagues nodding in consensus.
	   ___
	   ``This is a place divided along lines of race,'' says Satnarine
Maharaj, a leading spokesman for the Indo-Trinidadian cause,
sitting in the ramshackle offices of his weekly newspaper, The
Bomb.
	   ``At the heart of the matter, it is a fight for space. But the
tension must be controlled. Otherwise it certainly could get very
dangerous, very unpleasant.''
	   He glances at a mirror strategically aligned in the corner of
his office to afford him a view of the guard and of anyone
entering.
	   ___
	   On a hilltop about 1,000 feet (300 meters) above Port-of-Spain,
a calypso band quickly forms around an American who stops to admire
the panorama.
	   Strumming on a rickety steel guitar, the bandleader improvises:
	   ``Welcome, friend, to my beautiful land,
	   ``I bet that you are a business man!
	   ``And when I conclude my song and my dance
	   ``We hope you'll please this calypso man!''
	   No tension here on this green hillside. Just dlrs 5 changing
hands in a flurry of smiles.

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A new sign on a Lucknow street points to
the future, as India's Hindu nationalists see it.
	   By renaming the road Kothari Brothers Street, India's governing
Hindu party honored two Hindus from this north-central state
capital who were shot to death by police in 1990 as they led a mob
trying to tear down a Muslim mosque in nearby Ayodhya.
	   Two years later, another mob succeeded in destroying the mosque,
setting off nationwide Hindu-Muslim rioting that killed 2,000
people. Today, India remains divided over Ayodhya, but the
Bharatiya Janata Party envisions a day when a Hindu temple will
rise on the mosque's rubble.
	   With steps like the October ceremony naming a street after the
Kothari ``martyrs'', suggesting education be ``spiritualized'' and
challenging India's commitment to separation of church and state,
the ruling party signaled its determination to put an assertively
Hindu stamp on India.
	   The country has embraced ecumenism since the violence of
partition in 1947, when Muslims splintered away from colonial India
to form the Islamic state of Pakistan.
	   Navin Raj's yarn shop looks out at the end of Kothari Brothers
Street, where a small park is dominated by a black-marble obelisk
inscribed in gold with a short history of the ``ultimate
sacrifice'' by Ram Kumar and Sharad Kothari. Raj says everyone in
the neighborhood embraces the new name because they want a temple
at Ayodhya.
	   Not so. Dr. Dinesh Darpan, who has his clinic and home just a
few blocks from Raj's store, says politicians were wrong to erect a
monument that recalls violence and divisiveness.
	   ``They should not resurrect the issue. They should work toward
Hindu-Muslim unity,'' he said.
	   Since Bharatiya Janata came to power at the federal level in
March, its progress in remaking this vast and varied country has
largely been confined to the symbolic _ and to reopening a spirited
debate among Indians about religion and power.
	   It's not a new debate. Soon after the break from Britain,
revered independence leader Mohandas Gandhi was assassinated by a
Hindu militant who objected to his calls for religious tolerance.
	   Since then, India has again and again grappled with questions
about the nature of Hinduism and of how best to order a society
woven of many beliefs. Bharatiya Janata's ascendancy has added new
urgency to these issues.
	   A party pronouncement on the need to protect cows, for instance,
can set two Hindu coworkers arguing about the extent to which cows
are worshipped in India _ some Hindus do eat beef.
	   That's because Hinduism as many Indians know it is not so much
free of rules as having such a bewildering variety that no one
authority can claim the last word.
	   Any homogenization of Hinduism would be ``something very
disturbing, because it destroys the creative force within the
religion,'' said K.N. Panikkar, a Hindu and a historian who has
studied the Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   Separating church and state is the only way of both protecting
Hinduism and ensuring Muslims, Christians and other minorities can
live in India without fear, Panikkar said in an interview.
	   That idea is nonsense, sociologist T.N. Madan writes in one of a
shelf-full of new books on secularism, a publishing phenomenon that
underlines the intensity of the debate sparked by the coming to
power of the Hindu party.
	   Madan notes India has officially Islamic and officially Buddhist
neighbors and accuses secularists of trying to impose a Western
idea in a region where religion is crucial.
	   ``In an open society, the state will reflect the character of
the society,'' Madan says.
	   That society is predominantly Hindu. Eighty percent of India's
nearly 1 billion people are Hindu, while 12 percent are Muslim.
Christians, who are 2 percent of the population, say violent
attacks on members of their community have increased since the
Hindu party came to power.
	   India's constitution declares the country secular and forbids
religious discrimination. Article 30 seeks to protect adherents of
minority religions by granting them the right to establish their
own schools _ a provision some Hindu militants consider
discriminatory because it does not also specifically grant that
right to Hindus.
	   Bharatiya Janata has called for amending Article 30, but the
party lacks the two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to change
the constitution.
	   Sushma Swaraj, a national party leader, says it doesn't seek a
Hindu state, rather one in which citizens of all faiths live in
harmony, acknowledging common values shaped by Hinduism. The party
says its philosophy is ``Hindutva,'' loosely translated as Hindu
culture, which it insists is not a religion.
	   ``We have never prayed as the Christians pray, `we the
Christians,' or as the Muslims say, `we the Muslims.' When Indians
pray, we pray in terms of all,'' Swaraj said in an interview,
seemingly forgetting that Indians are Christian and Muslim as well
as Hindu.
	   Bharatiya Janata won the most seats _ 179 out of 545 _ in
springtime elections, but not the simple majority needed to govern
alone. To attract its 19 coalition partners, which include secular
socialists and regional parties with little interest in
nation-changing ambitions, the party has toned down some of its
more extreme positions.
	   In October, Education Minister Murli Manohar Joshi circulated a
document drawn up by an anonymous committee that called for
education to ``be Indianized, nationalized and spiritualized.'' It
caused such an uproar that Joshi meekly withdrew the paper from
discussion at a national conference of state education ministers.
	   Election losses in three key states in late November further
weakened the party. Though the state balloting had no direct affect
on the federal government, the perception that voters rebuffed
Bharatiya Janata after only eight months in power will make it
harder for national leaders to push through policies.
	   Opponents say any moderation voiced by the party's leaders is a
mask.
	   Joshi may have backed down at the education conference, but he
also has quietly named conservative Hindus to various academic
research posts, the critics note. The step may have little
immediate impact, but ensures textbooks in coming years will have a
new slant.

Ancient hymn causes modern political controversy

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Every morning, the blue-skirted, pigtailed
students at Niral Nagar Senior Secondary School line up on the
dusty playground to send a childishly tuneless request to
Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning.
	   ``Show us the way, guide us on the right path, light up our
souls,'' they sing in Hindi.
	   Teachers at the girls school say their students have been
opening the day with the hymn for years, more out of respect for
tradition than religious fervor.
	   But the hymn familiar to many Indians became a controversy this
fall. The Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist movement
that controls the state government in Uttar Pradesh, ordered that
the hymn be sung every morning in all public schools.
	   Primary Education Minister Ravindra Kuma Shukla's announcement
in late October set off an angry debate. Muslim leaders told
parents to withdraw their children from public schools. The
Bharatiya Janata youth wing responded by burning Muslim scholars in
effigy.
	   Shukla, who accused political rivals of encouraging the
protests, said Muslim students could remain silent while their
classmates sang the Saraswati hymn.
	   But the order was quietly withdraw in early December. A
statement from the Education Ministry said only that it had been
improperly issued.
	   The furor over a hymn came while many Indian public schools lack
blackboards, libraries and teachers _ let alone the traditional
instruments that Shukla said should accompany the Saraswati hymn.
	   Shortly before the order was rescinded, the head teacher at
Chandganj Primary School, G.D., Singh watched his 6- to
11-year-olds trickle into a classroom equipped with little more
than the blankets they sit on. Singh said the two other teachers
had been assigned to help with the municipal census, leaving him
with all of the school's 125 students.
	   ``We have received the order to recite the Saraswati hymn, but
... there's no one to teach the children the hymn,'' he said.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For centuries, Baghdad billed itself as the city
of ``1,001 Nights,'' an almost mythical capital whose very name
spoke of grandeur and glory. Today, after two wars, countless
crises and the most sweeping U.N. sanctions ever imposed on a
country, Baghdad lives on little more than its memories, a shadow
of its proud past.
	   ___
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ On a meandering bend in the Tigris, where
the mighty river flows near the Euphrates, the Muslim caliph Abu
Jaafar al-Mansur spent a summer night at the home of a priest.
	   When he awoke from ``the sweetest and gentlest night on earth''
_ as one medieval historian put it _ everything that the emperor
saw pleased him. The Tigris watered lush fields, canals stitched
the countryside like latticework, and the two rivers promised to be
arteries to distant lands for his armies and merchants.
	   That morning, in 762, he laid the first brick of Baghdad on a
site of cultures already ancient. Soon, his capital became the seat
of an empire that stretched from Spain through North Africa and the
Middle East to Persia, the Caspian Sea and beyond.
	   A bust of al-Mansur sits today in a dreary square of his city.
	   Like much of Baghdad, its brick pedestal is crumbling, its blue
tiles fallen amid the plastic bags and cigarettes that litter the
square. Al-Mansur's eyes glower beneath his turban, staring out
over a jumble of car garages, a gas station and shuttered shops.
	   Almost every car circling the square has a cracked windshield.
	   Just a generation ago, Baghdad seemed destined for a
renaissance, a crossroads of the Middle East blessed with the
bounty of the world's second-largest oil reserves. Like its brash,
glittering counterparts in the Persian Gulf, the capital
flourished, its boom drawing artists, writers and workers from an
Arab world mired in strife and poverty.
	   Then war erupted with Iran in 1980, dragging on eight years.
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, only to be crushed by a host of armies
led by the United States.
	   Since then, U.N. sanctions barring its oil exports barring its
oil exports and banning air travel to or from Iraq further battered
an already miserable city.
	   Now, it stands isolated, a trip abroad too costly for nearly all
Iraqis. Its artists are steeped in nostalgia for the city's
imperial past or even the heyday of the 1970s. Medieval leaders who
brought the city glory have given way to architects of its
destruction.
	   To its people, Baghdad is a memory.
	   ___
	   Then, as now, it was location, location, location.
	   The capital of the Abbasid Empire sat on strategic routes to
northern Iraq where grain was grown, to neighboring Iran and its
rich culture, and to restive provinces like Syria and Egypt.
	   Its sailors brought spices, fine cloth, jewels and porcelain
from India and China, giving rise to the legends of Sindbad in
``1,001 Nights.'' Its camel caravans left Baghdad for Arabia and
Central Asia, laden with coral, textiles and ivory.
	   Few people come to Baghdad today. Fewer leave.
	   Only Iraqi businessmen are permitted to cross into Syria, a
border only recently opened. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, still
seething over Iraq's 1990 invasion, would never give a visa. Iran
is off limits. The Turkish border, running along a U.N.-protected
region inhabited by ethnic Kurds, is beyond the government's
control.
	   That leaves Amman, Jordan, a trip that was once an hour away by
plane, but now requires 12 hours or more across the desert by car.
	   ``Before you could go anywhere in the world,'' said Ali Sadeq,
who set up a taxi service for Jordan trips soon after the sanctions
were imposed. ``Now Amman's the only way out.''
	   Not quite.
	   A ferry from the port of Umm al-Qasr goes once a week to the
gulf city of Dubai. But it takes 32 hours and costs dlrs 330 for a
two-way trip _ 110 times the monthly salary of a bureaucrat.
	   The trip to Jordan is not cheap, either.
	   It costs about dlrs 125 (225,000 Iraqi dinars) for a
four-wheel-drive car best for the treacherous road. The cheapest
ticket _ by public bus _ is about dlrs 6 (10,000 Iraqi dinars), but
takes six more hours or so because of delays at the border.
	   Add to that dlrs 225 (400,000 Iraqi dinars) for an official exit
permit. And in a twist that defies logic, the government allows
Iraqis to take out no more than a handful of dinars and dlrs 50 in
cash _ probably not enough to pay for the trip home.
	   ``Baghdad was once open to the rest of the world,'' said Samir
Ali, a businessman waiting to board an overnight bus to Amman. ``We
saw new things _ culture, new ways of life, the developed world.''
	   ``Can you see that world through one door?''

BAGHDAD: door?''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ___
	   When Europe was still in the Dark Ages, Baghdad flowered, its
artistic and intellectual creativity celebrated around the world.
	   The city housed one of the Muslim world's greatest libraries,
the House of Wisdom. Its literature drew on the spoken traditions
of Arabian oases and Persian styles already centuries old.
	   In its streets, Abu Nawas, a friend of the caliph, scandalized
and tantalized its residents with sultry poetry of wine and women.
	   ``When all the world was black, Baghdad was the capital of
culture, of art, of civilization,'' said Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, one
of Iraq's greatest sculptors. ``You have to respect Baghdad.''
	   To Hikmat, like many in the Arab world, the 1970s provided a
taste of the city's former Abbasid glory.
	   Palestinian students received scholarships to study here, and
Arab writers fleeing the anarchy of Lebanon's civil war flocked to
the city. Egyptian intellectuals still recall the free plane
tickets _ and ample whiskey _ they received to come to conferences.
	   The ferment of those years gave rise to the Arab saying, ``Cairo
writes, Beirut publishes and Baghdad reads.''
	   No longer.
	   Dar al-Mamoun, one of Iraq's main publishing houses, once put
out 20 titles a year. Now, it produces two, maybe three, said
Khudeir al-Duleimi, its director-general. Its 96 translators in
English, French, Spanish, German and Russian now number 10, he
said.
	   The Saddam Art Center, a modern eight-story complex that once
served as a hub of artistic life with its poetry readings,
lectures, music and exhibitions now stands largely vacant.
	   Its cavernous halls are dimly lit, with the smell of urine
wafting through the rooms. Its skimpy exhibitions are overshadowed
by a more permanent feature, huge portraits of President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The artists themselves are demoralized and dejected.
	   Hikmat, 69, complains he can no longer find or afford the
bronze, teak or mahogany to sculpt his works, a plight shared by
the shrinking ranks of artists across the city.
	   ``I go around Baghdad and people know to look for old pieces of
wood for me,'' he said. ``I work with that.''
	   ``This,'' Hikmat said, ``is Baghdad.''
	   ___
	   Few figures played more prominently in ``1,001 Nights'' than the
caliph Haroun al-Rashid, the grandson of Baghdad's founder.
	   His 23-year reign over the Abbasid Empire was a golden age of
Baghdad, when its markets overflowed with goods from across the
empire and its thinkers and poets had esteemed places in the court.
	   Al-Rashid was famous, too, for his subtlety.
	   With little trust of his advisers, the caliph would dress in
disguise as a merchant or beggar, prowling the streets to gauge the
feelings of his people. Some would learn later they had spoken to
the ruler; others never knew.
	   In Baghdad today, everyone recognizes Saddam.
	   His statues tower over squares. His paintings show him in black
beret, in suit and tie, in Arab headdress or sitting with children
in a Norman Rockwell-like take on Iraqi life. Kiosks in the street
sell his pictures for the equivalent of 8 cents, portraits of him
smiling, praying, waving, saluting or chatting on the phone.
	   Those paintings adorn the neighborhood of al-Mansur, named for
Baghdad's founder, and stand along streets like Abu Nawas,
al-Rashid and Caliphs, all thoroughfares recalling a better time.
	   The lack of finesse in the portraits has defined, in a way,
Saddam's two decades of rule: too much for too long.
	   The war with Iran was a disastrous gamble, the invasion of
Kuwait even more of a blunder. Crises over U.N. weapons inspections
occur like clockwork. And eight years later, sanctions grind away,
making Baghdad pitiful.
	   Yet testaments to his authority persist.
	   Salam Abid is a 42-year-old portrait painter of Saddam.
	   His mission, he said, is to make sure his subject can be viewed
by everyone in Baghdad _ never in disguise, never hidden.
	   ``Not everyone sees the president, so they need to see him
through the paintings,'' Abid said in his studio across from the
Sindbad Theater. ``With my paintings, people feel he lives with
them, that he is with them always, inside our spirit and inside our
feelings.''
	   ``In our dreams,'' he said, ``we see the president.''

 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Islanders vote on their century-old U.S. ties &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Statehooders who want to make
Puerto Rico the 51st U.S. state refused to concede defeat in
divisive elections Sunday that gave an edge to supporters of the
Caribbean island's commonwealth ties to the United States.
	   With 95 percent of votes in, statehood had 46.5 percent of votes
to 50.2 percent for the ``None of the above'' option adopted by the
commonwealth party. In a similar non-binding referendum in 1993,
commonwealth beat statehood by 49-46 percent.
	   President Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the referendum _ but it was unclear what kind of message a ``none
of the above'' victory could send to Congress. Most likely is a
bitter and prolonged argument over interpreting the result.
	   Pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello insisted he won anyway,
arguing that almost all the people who voted for an actual status
definition supported statehood. He said he would use that
interpretation to petition Congress to make Puerto Rico a state.
	   ``Today the people spoke and they said statehood is the future
of Puerto Rico. The people spoke, and I will obey,'' Rossello told
thousands of cheering supporters at a victory-type rally as
spectacular fireworks lit the sky above his party's headquarters.
	   Pro-commonwealth Sen. Eudaldo Baez Galib countered, ``If they go
to Washington with a petition for statehood ... they would be
violating the right to vote of the majority.''
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Mixed identity, insecurity affect vote
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Papillon Garces thinks Puerto Rico
should be independent, but is voting for it to remain a U.S.
commonwealth.
	   ``It's a vote for security,'' he explained with resignation.
	   Maria Santiago, who lived in the United States for 40 years,
likes her native land the way it is _ a U.S. territory that's
almost like a country. But in Sunday's nonbinding referendum, she's
voting to make it the 51st state _ just in case things take a turn
for the worse down the road.
	   ``I'm voting for security,'' she said.
	   Across party lines and political positions, Puerto Ricans voted
for what they thought would be the safest choice for the island's
future _ though their hearts and minds were not always in synch.
	   The chief success of the statehood movement may be in having
planted a seed of insecurity _ a fear that the U.S. citizenship
Puerto Ricans prize, and its benefits, may somehow be in danger
unless something is done.
	   Whatever the real or imagined slights of a century of U.S. rule,
many voters recognized the economic and political security the
United States brings.
	   This compounds a century-old identity crisis.
	   Puerto Ricans have numerous metaphors and jokes to describe
their mixed identity. Every Puerto Rican is an independentista
after three beers, says one.
	   Another says Puerto Ricans who talk up an independentista storm
and then vote for remaining a commonwealth are like watermelons:
Green _ the color of independence _ on the outside, and
commonwealth red inside.
 &UR; GRENADA: Prime minister calls elections for Jan. 14
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenadian Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell on Sunday called elections for Jan. 14 and urged
supporters to rescue his embattled leadership, which is mired in
charges of corruption.
	   He said the deadline for filing as candidates will be Dec. 20.
Elections are not legally due until June 2000.
	   ``Go into the highways and byways and bring your members out to
vote,'' he urged party leaders.
	   Mitchell made the announcement during a rally of his New
National Party in rural St. Andrew's Parish, where he outlined the
main achievements of his party's 3 1/2 years in office.
	   The New National Party lost its majority in parliament on Nov.
29, when his foreign minister and former health minister defected
to the rival Grenada United Labor Party.
	   During the rally, Mitchell touted public works projects
including a dlrs 53 million national stadium, a new government
office building and several road projects.
	   ``Make a choice between curse and blessing,'' Mitchell said.
``Choose the blessing of national development over chaos.''
	   But opposition officials say the projects have failed to create
many new jobs and are inflating the island's national debt.
Political analysts say the election could hinge on a corruption
investigation involving Communications and Works Minister Gregory
Bowen.
 &UR; GUYANA: Parties agree to power-sharing on government boards
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ In an effort to ease racial friction,
Guyana's ruling party has agreed to power-sharing guidelines on
appointed boards, the government news service said Sunday.
	   President Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party, backed by
Guyanese of East Indian descent, has agreed to allow the People's
National Congress, which is supported by people of African descent,
to name its own representatives to such bodies.
	   The deal was reached with the help of a mediator from the
15-member Caribbean Community trade group, which has its
headquarters in Georgetown, Guyana Information Services said.
	   Earlier this year, race riots swept through this South American
country to protest the victory of Jagan's party in the December
1997 election. As part of a Caricom-brokered truce, the government
agreed to rewrite the constitution to better balance political
power among the races.
	   Under the agreement, Jagan's party will invite the opposition
party to submit nominations three months before each board's term
ends. If it disapproves of the choice, the People's National
Congress must be notified and negotiations begun so that a
representative can be chosen before the end of the term.
 &UR; BAHAMAS: Stars, extravagance christen resort in Bahamas
	   PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) _ With a gold-gilded beauty queen
atop an ice sculpture and Grace Jones rising from a cloud billowing
smoke, celebrities christened Atlantis, billed as the biggest
island resort in the world.
	   ``The Bahamas has been catapulted to the point of dominance in
the tourism business in our region,'' Prime Minister Hubert
Ingraham said after cutting the ribbon of a dlrs 20 million,
three-lane bridge to Paradise Island.
	   He said the dlrs 400 million hotel and its dlrs 450 million
second phase was the island's largest private investment.
	   Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones and his 45-piece
orchestra, Bebe Winans and Natalie Cole performed Saturday night.
Billionaire real estate magnate Donald Trump and media queen Oprah
Winfrey mingled with guests beneath the hotel's 70-foot (21-meter)
domed lobby as fireworks soared over the Atlantic Ocean.
	   Actress and signer Grace Jones rose from a billowing cloud of
smoke as the Goddess of Atlantis, presiding over an aquatic routine
performed by the U.S. synchronized swim team.
	   Sol Kerzner, the South African entrepreneur and owner of Sun
International Hotels Ltd., said the weekend launch cost dlrs 7
million at Atlantis, named for the mythical sunken city.

Bank of Japan survey shows worsening business sentiment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Business confidence at Japan's recession-hit small
and medium-sized manufacturers has fallen to a record low, a
quarterly central bank survey released Monday shows.
	   Sentiment surpassed the level recorded in September, which was
the worst since the Bank of Japan's widely watched ``tankan''
survey was begun in 1967.
	   The index for those companies came to minus 60, worse than the
previous record low of minus 57 in the last survey released in
September. The September figure had exceeded the prior record low
of minus 51 in May 1975.
	   Confidence at major manufacturers also continued to worsen,
falling to minus 56, the worst since February 1994 when it reached
the same level, according to the central bank. The September survey
registered a minus 51.
	   The survey's main index measures the percentage of firms seeing
business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions
worsen.
	   The Bank of Japan surveyed 9,129 companies.
	   Japan is stuck in its worst recession in half a century, its
economy dragged down by massive bad loans in its financial sector
and sales dampened by the Asian currency crisis as well as by
pessimism among consumers at home.
	   Bankruptcies among companies have risen. Smaller companies are
hit the hardest because they are more dependent on bank loans to
finance their businesses.
	   ``We have seen the economy worsen in the past year, but we
cannot expect a dramatic turnaround because consumption remains
quite weak,'' said Naomi Hasegawa, senior economist at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities, in reaction to the survey results.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lew Grade, the cigar-chomping, legendary
entertainment tycoon who founded Britain's first commercially
funded television company, died Sunday. He was 91.
	   Lord Grade, whose projects included the TV series, ``The
Saint,'' and the movie ``On Golden Pond,'' died of heart failure at
the London Clinic which he entered two weeks ago for surgery, his
spokesman Dennis Michael said.
	   His wife, Kathie, who he married 56 years ago, and their adopted
son, Paul, were at his bedside.
	   Grade, the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in
London's East End. He gave up an early career as a dancer to start
a small showbiz agency office in 1934.
	   Twenty-one years later _ and a lineup of contracts with stars
who included Edith Piaf, July Garland, Mario Lanza and Bob Hope _
Grade founded Associated Television, the first commercially funded
channel launched to face the formidable competition of the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Grade, who was knighted in 1963 and given a life peerage in
1976, never stopped working. He was often quoted as saying that he
had no plans to retire before the year 2000. His last movie, a
weepy called ``Something To Believe In,'' was made this year _ and
panned by most critics.
	   For more than 70 years, Grade rode showbiz rapids _ with a
string of TV hits, some movie flops, fantastic deal-making skills,
and memorable one-liners.
	   Of perhaps his most expensive box-office flop, ``Raise the
Titanic'' which cost 18 million pounds (dlrs 30 million) to make in
1980, he quipped, ``It would have been cheaper to lower the
Atlantic.''
	   Through ATV and later companies, Grade brought to millions a
string of TV shows that became household names.
	   They included ``Jesus of Nazareth,'' directed by Franco
Zeffirelli in 1975. His current company, The Grade Company,
co-produced ``Starlight Express'' on Broadway in 1985.
	   Louis Winogradsky was born Dec. 25 1906 in Tokmak, Ukraine, and
came to London at the age of six.
	   The family became a British showbiz dynasty.
	   His brother, Bernie, later made a peer as Lord Delfont, was the
first was head of EMI, a music and electronics business that is now
Thorm-EMI Plc. His nephew, Michael Grade, the son of another
brother, Leslie, is the chief executive of Britain's Channel 4
television network.
	   After school, as Louis Grad he took up dancing, becoming in 1926
the World Charleston Champion in 1926. In 1929 a French journalist
misspelt his name _ and Lew Grade stuck.
	   Tributes poured in to his populist zeal, his colorful
personality, his rapid-fire decision-making, and his sheer love of
entertainment.
	   ``He was part of the great entrepreneurial group of Jewish
entrepreneurs who went to Hollywood, or in his case, stayed in
England of course, and ran the show immensely (well) privately and
personally,'' British film producer Michael Winner said Sunday.
	   His expansion in the agency business included taking over
Leslie's agency in 1943. Two years later it was the biggest in
Europe after William Morris.
	   ATV dominated much of British popular television through the
50s, 60s and 70s. Shows included ``Robin Hood,'' ``Emergency Ward
10,'' _ Britain's first twice-weekly soap, ``The Saint'' starring
Roger Moore, ``The Prisoner,'' ``Coronation Street'' and the
``Muppets.''
	   At the age of 71 he lost control of ATV (now Independent
Television) _ and turned to movies.
	   He is survived by his wife, the former Kathleen Moody, his son,
and two grandchildren.
	   Funeral arrangements were not announced immediately.

Report: National Grid to take over New England Electric System
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ National Grid, the English and Welsh electricity
operator, is expected to announce Monday the acquisition of New
England Electrical System for dlrs 3 billion in cash, the Financial
Times reported.
	   National Grid is expected to also assume dlrs 1 billion of the
New England company's debt, the London-based newspaper said in its
Monday editions.
	   National Grid, which operates a monopoly in England and Wales
with more than 5,000 km (3,100 miles) of high voltage transmission
lines, had been looking to expand outside of Britain, the Financial
Times reported. Shareholders were told last month that the company
expected to complete a U.S. purchase by March and it planned to
generate at least 20 percent of its sales from outside the
highly-regulated British industry within three years.
	   Through its four utilities _ Massachusetts Electric,
Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric and Nantucket
Electric _ New England Electric System provides electricity to more
than 1.3 million customers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island.
	   The possible deal follows the announcement last week of
ScottishPower's dlrs 7.9 billion takeover of the U.S.' PacifiCorp,
which serves seven Western states.
	   If that acquisition goes ahead, it will be the ever first
purchase of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company. The
combined company would have 7 million customers in Britain and the
United States with 23,500 employees worldwide.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Supporters of making Puerto Rico
the 51st U.S. state refused to concede defeat in a referendum, won
by backers of the Caribbean island's existing commonwealth ties to
the United States.
	   With 95 percent of votes counted Sunday evening, 50.2 percent
voted for the ``none of the above'' option adopted by the
commonwealth party, while statehood had 46.5 percent. In a similar
non-binding referendum in 1993, commonwealth status beat out
statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the
result of the referendum, but it was unclear what kind of message a
``none of the above'' victory would send to Congress. Most likely,
there will be a bitter and prolonged argument over interpreting the
result.
	   The commonwealth party had urged a ``none of the above'' vote
because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth description, which
was written by the statehood party and suggests Congress could
revoke Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship.
	   Regardless of the numbers, pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello
insisted his cause had won, arguing that almost all people who
voted for an actual status definition supported statehood. He said
he would use that interpretation to petition Congress to make
Puerto Rico a state.
	   ``Today, the people spoke and they said statehood is the future
of Puerto Rico. The people spoke, and I will obey,'' Rossello told
thousands of cheering supporters at a victory-type rally while
spectacular fireworks lit the sky above his party's headquarters.
	   Pro-commonwealth Sen. Eudaldo Baez Galib countered, ``If they go
to Washington with a petition for statehood ... they would be
violating the right to vote of the majority.''
	   Under commonwealth status, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with
local autonomy. Its 3.8 million residents can't vote for president
or Congress, which alone can change Puerto Rico's political status.
	   Voters trying to resolve the century-long debate on whether that
status ought to be changed also had the choices of independence or
a ``free association'' form of independence with U.S. treaty ties.
Those options and a commonwealth as defined on the ballot garnered
less than 4 percent of the vote.
	   Seventy percent of 2.2 million registered voters participated,
the elections commission said.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot
soon after voting stations opened.
	   At a polling station in southern Ponce city, an election
volunteer confronted the 95-year-old founder of the statehood
party, Luis A. Ferre. ``I know my people, and Americans don't want
Puerto Rico to be a state,'' said Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old
engineer from South Carolina who has married and settled on the
island.
	   In San Juan, thousands of voters gathered at political parties'
headquarters, dancing, eating and drinking at huge street parties.
On the highways, people drove cars with U.S. and Puerto Rican flags
and campaign banners flapping from windows.
	   ``We have seen over the years a decrease in support for
commonwealth status,'' pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello said when
he voted.
	   Rossello called Sunday's referendum in hopes of persuading
Congress to end a colonial relationship that dates from the 1898
U.S. occupation of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War.
	   The opposition Popular Democratic Party sought to frustrate
those plans, supporting a ``none of the above'' option because it
objected to the ballot's description of commonwealth. Written by
Rossello's party, it suggests Congress could revoke Puerto Ricans'
U.S. citizenship under commonwealth.
	   ``We are very happy with our commonwealth, and we want to keep
it,'' the party's San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon said when she voted.
``Today, we Puerto Rican people are asserting our identity, our
love for commonwealth, our love of our U.S. citizenship.''
	   Legislation calling for a binding series of votes to resolve the
debate died in the U.S. Senate this year.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After successfully joining and
outfitting the first two pieces of the international space station,
Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story complex loose Sunday and
flew away.
	   They were sorry to go, but at the same time pleased to leave
behind ``the brightest new star on the horizon.''
	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   The winged, cylindrical station glistened in the sunlight as the
shuttle circled from a distance of 450 feet for a final photo
survey. Once that was done, Sturckow fired Endeavour's thrusters
and the shuttle pulled away for good.
	   The astronauts could still see the station from more than eight
miles out and excitedly beamed down pictures.
	   ``It's the brightest new star on the horizon,'' Cabana said as
the station grew smaller and smaller, its two components resembling
the head and body of a snowman lying sideways.
	   With Endeavour's flawless departure, NASA's lead flight
director, Bob Castle, was finally ready to declare the assembly
part of the 12-day mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber in the shuttle cargo
bay on Dec. 6, then conducted three spacewalks to wire the
components together, install and fix antennas, and attach a tool
box to the outside. They also spent a full day inside the station,
sprucing it up for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in just
over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.
	   The lingering uncertainty over Russia's role failed to dampen
the festive mood Sunday inside Mission Control.
	   ``We've got a lot more to come, more challenges,'' said Frank
Culbertson, deputy program manager for space station operations,
``but we've set a tremendous standard with this mission.''

	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   The winged, cylindrical station glistened in the sunlight as the
shuttle circled from a distance of 450 feet for a final photo
survey. Once that was done, Sturckow fired Endeavour's thrusters
and the shuttle pulled away for good.
	   The astronauts could still see the station from more than eight
miles out and excitedly beamed down pictures.
	   ``It's the brightest new star on the horizon,'' Cabana said as
the station grew smaller and smaller, its two components resembling
the head and body of a snowman lying sideways.
	   With Endeavour's flawless departure, NASA's lead flight
director, Bob Castle, was finally ready to declare the assembly
part of the 12-day mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber in the shuttle cargo
bay on Dec. 6, then conducted three spacewalks to wire the
components together, install and fix antennas, and attach a tool
box to the outside. They also spent a full day inside the station,
sprucing it up for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in just
over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.
	   The lingering uncertainty over Russia's role failed to dampen
the festive mood Sunday inside Mission Control.
	   ``We've got a lot more to come, more challenges,'' said Frank
Culbertson, deputy program manager for space station operations,
``but we've set a tremendous standard with this mission.''

Report: National Grid to take over New England Electric System
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 5-7 with details of Massachusetts regulatory
environment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ National Grid, the English and Welsh electricity
operator, is expected to announce Monday the acquisition of New
England Electrical System for dlrs 3 billion in cash, the Financial
Times reported.
	   National Grid is expected to also assume dlrs 1 billion of the
New England company's debt, the London-based newspaper said in its
Monday editions.
	   National Grid, which operates a monopoly in England and Wales
with more than 5,000 km (3,100 miles) of high voltage transmission
lines, had been looking to expand outside of Britain. Shareholders
were told last month that the company expected to complete a U.S.
purchase by March and it planned to generate at least 20 percent of
its sales from outside the highly-regulated British industry within
three years.
	   Through its four utilities _ Massachusetts Electric,
Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric and Nantucket
Electric _ New England Electric System provides electricity to more
than 1.3 million customers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island.
	   New England Electrical System, Massachusetts' largest
electricity supplier, was likely an attractive company because of
the state's new electricity deregulation law, which passed March 1.
The law has created strong incentives for electric companies to
sell off their generating plants and related assets. Separating the
generation of electricity from its delivery is supposed to create
greater competition among utilities and lower rates for customers.
	   So far, the legislation has resulted in dlrs 3.9 billion worth
of New England utility acquisitions.
	   Massachusetts and California are the only two states with
comprehensive electricity deregulation plans.
	   The proposed deal between National Grid and New England
Electrical follows the announcement last week of ScottishPower's
dlrs 7.9 billion takeover of the U.S.' PacifiCorp, which serves
seven Western states.
	   If that acquisition goes ahead, it will be the first ever
purchase of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company. The
combined company would have 7 million customers in Britain and the
United States with 23,500 employees worldwide.

Calls for surf safety awareness program for tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A surf safety awareness program
targeting international tourists is urgently needed in the wake of
recent drownings, a tourism industry body said Monday.
	   Tourism Task Force chairman John Brown said Australia had a duty
of care to its visitors and it was the joint responsibility of
governments and the tourism industry to educate travelers about
surf safety.
	   ``Many foreign tourists arrive in Australia with little or no
experience in surf and get themselves and their rescuers in
trouble,'' Brown said.
	   An elderly Russian tourist on an outing with a tour group at
Bondi Beach drowned after being swept up in a rip about 200 feet
(60 meters) from the shoreline on Saturday afternoon.
	   The man, aged in his 60s, had been swimming outside the flagged
safety zone, where beach life savers patrol the waters. Areas
beyond the flags could have rip tides, undertows, and other
hazards.
	   On Friday a young South Korean man died in what lifesavers
described as a freak accident in knee-depth water at Bronte Beach.
	   Three men were dragged under the surface and two of them
resurfaced quickly but they were unable to locate their friend.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks slip in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen early
Monday, while Japanese stock prices fell following the release of a
central bank business outlook survey.
	   The dollar bought 116.62 yen in early trading, down 0.66 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
116.42 yen Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 198.72 points,
or 1.38 percent, to 14,206.92 in the 30 minutes of trading. On
Friday, the average closed down 402.16 points, or 2.72 percent.
	   The Bank of Japan announced that business confidence at the
nation's recession-hit small and medium-sized manufacturers has
fallen to a record low.
	   In a quarterly survey of companies across Japan, the central
bank said sentiment exceeded the level recorded in September, which
was the worst since the Bank of Japan's widely watched ``tankan''
survey was first taken in 1967.
	   Confidence at major manufacturers also continued to worsen,
falling to minus 56, the worst since February 1994 when it reached
the same level, according to the central bank. The September survey
registered a minus 51.
	   The survey's main index measures the percentage of firms seeing
business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions
worsen. The central bank surveyed 9,129 companies.
	   Friday's slip on Wall Street also negatively affected the Tokyo
market, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped
19.82 points to 8,821.76 on Friday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 11.00 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,107.16
points. The TOPIX closed down 21.62 points, 1.90 points, on Friday.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar edged up against the Japanese
currency from its late New York level after the release of the
tankan report.
	   Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo, said
the quarterly survey came out as most people expected so there was
not much of a surprise.
	   ``People seem to be buying back the dollar a bit now,''
Muramatsu said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield and price on the benchmark No. 203 10-year
Japanese government bond were unquoted in early trading. On Friday,
the yield settled at 1.160 percent and its price finished at 105.47
yen.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans rejected statehood
Sunday, giving supporters of the ``commonwealth'' status quo a
narrow majority of the votes in a non-binding referendum on the
island's ties to the United States.
	   Final results gave 50.2 percent of votes for the ``none of the
above'' option adopted by the commonwealth party, while statehood
had 46.5 percent. In a similar non-binding referendum in 1993,
commonwealth status beat out statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Supporters of making Puerto Rico
the 51st U.S. state refused to concede defeat in a referendum

	   At a polling station in southern Ponce city, an election

Puerto Rico to be a state,'' said Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans rejected statehood,
according to final referendum results, giving supporters of a
commonwealth status a narrow majority in a non-binding referendum
on the island's ties to the United States.
	   Final results showed 50.2 percent of voters choosing the ``none
of the above'' option adopted by the commonwealth party, while
statehood had 46.5 percent. In a similar non-binding referendum in
1993, commonwealth status beat out statehood by 49 percent to 46
percent.
	   Under commonwealth status, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with
local autonomy. Its 3.8 million residents can't vote for president
or Congress, which alone can change Puerto Rico's political status.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the
result of the referendum, but it was unclear what kind of message
the ``none of the above'' victory would send to legislators. Most
likely, there will be a bitter and prolonged argument over
interpreting the result.
	   The commonwealth party had urged a ``none of the above'' vote
because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth description, which
was written by the statehood party and suggests Congress could
revoke Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship.
	   Regardless of the numbers, pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello
insisted his cause had won, arguing that almost all people who
voted for an actual status definition supported statehood. He said
he would use that interpretation to petition Congress to make
Puerto Rico a state.
	   ``Today, the people spoke and they said statehood is the future
of Puerto Rico. The people spoke, and I will obey,'' Rossello told
thousands of cheering supporters at a victory-type rally while
spectacular fireworks lit the sky above his party's headquarters.
	   Pro-commonwealth Sen. Eudaldo Baez Galib countered, ``If they go
to Washington with a petition for statehood ... they would be
violating the right to vote of the majority.''
	   ``We have gone to the ballot boxes and said: `No, this country
is ours,'' said San Juan mayor Sila Calderon, the key statehood
opponent. ``We continue being Puerto Ricans forever. We want to
live as Puerto Ricans and die as Puerto Ricans.''

Micromedical sells cardiac monitors to US Airways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ Micromedical Industries Ltd. will
supply one of the world's largest airlines, US Airways, with
electrocardiogram monitors, the hi-tech company said Monday.
	   The deal agreed to last week will see US Airways, which is part
of a global alliance with Qantas and British Airways, install
Biolog 3000 hand-held heart monitors on each of its 379 aircraft.
	   The monitor measures heart rate and displays the
electrocardiogram, which can be used to diagnose cardiac problems.
	   It received a clearance from the United States Food and Drug
Administration for sale in the United States in April.
	   Micromedical chief executive Dr. John Woodward said the sale to
US Airways was a major breakthrough into the world emergency
services market, estimated to be worth U.S. dlrs 425 million a
year.
	   He said Biolog 3000 was becoming the standard for cardiac
aviation medicine, having been sold to Varig Airlines and also
carried on the U.S. space shuttle.
	   Until now the monitor was generally sold to physicians,
emergency services and hospitals.

Hero or killer? Roles mixed in Berlin Wall shooting trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: trial scheduled to begin at 0800 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In 1962, with the Cold War at its frostiest, a
young baker risked his life to get his family out of communist East
Germany by tunneling under the newly built Berlin Wall.
	   In the West, he was hailed as a hero. On the other side of the
wall, however, Rudolf Mueller was called a killer because he made
his getaway by shooting point-blank at a startled young border
guard.
	   The Wall is gone now, as is East Germany, but the case has been
revived and Mueller, now 67, faces a murder charge at a trial that
was to begin Monday in Berlin.
	   His case is believed to be the first to reverse the pattern
since German unification in 1990: hundreds of convictions of former
East German border guards and officials on charges related to
shooting those trying to flee to the West.
	   The apparent one-sidedness has prompted many in eastern Germany
to complain of ``victor's justice.'' Berlin officials hope the
Mueller trial will help them refute that charge.
	   ``Whatever is there to be pursued, prosecutors have to pursue it
and they do so, no matter which political side the perpetrator and
victim were on,'' Justice Ministry spokesman Matthias Rebentisch
said. ``It's solely about clearing up crimes.''
	   Rebentisch denied prosecutors had dragged their feet in bringing
charges against Mueller, blaming the heavy workload borne by the
agency responsible for sorting through the miles (kilometers) of
secret files kept by East Germany's security apparatus.
	   Mueller was held briefly after being charged in June 1997, then
released on 100,000 marks (dlrs 60,000) bail. He no longer lives in
Berlin, and he and his lawyer declined to comment before the trial.
	   Muller had made it out of East Germany before the Wall went up,
then spent weeks digging a 22-meter (72-foot) tunnel with plans to
rescue his family.
	   On June 18, 1962, he crossed to the East to bring his family to
the building near the Wall where his tunnel led. As they
approached, they were stopped by the guard, 20-year-old Reinhold
Huhn, who was armed with a machine gun.
	   Muller later told West Berlin police Huhn asked to see their
papers. Huhn was looking through a bag when Mueller said he punched
him, knocking him down. Before Huhn could get up, another border
guard opened fire, hitting the guard, Mueller claimed.
	   The family fled and made it to the West.
	   The East Germans told a different story _ one that prosecutors
now believe.
	   Citing witnesses, they say Mueller was stopped, pretended to
reach into his breast pocket for his identification card and pulled
out a gun, shooting Huhn point-blank before the guard had time to
react.
	   Mueller himself muddied the case during a celebratory
post-escape news conference at one of West Germany's biggest
publishing houses, Axel Springer, which had allowed him to dig the
tunnel from its basement.
	   With whiskey flowing, Mueller was asked about how many times he
had to ``pull the trigger.'' He was quoted as saying: ``Once. The
man fell down immediately.'' He seemed to contradict his earlier
statement, though in the jovial atmosphere it was not clear if he
was being serious.
	   East Germany demanded Mueller be handed over. West Germany
refused, insisting, with Cold War dogmatism, that the guard was
shot by one of his own comrades during the frenzied escape.
	   Mueller soon left Berlin and eventually became a union official
and businessman. His case slipped from memory in the West.
	   But the border guard, Huhn, became a martyr for the East German
propaganda machine, a symbol of the threat from the West for a
regime seeking to justify its erection of the Wall less than a year
earlier and to draw attention away from its own citizens being
killed on the border _ nearly 1,000 in all by last official count.
	   Huhn, who earned his living milking cows, had helped build the
Wall while doing his military service. East Berlin named a street
after him near the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing and hung a
plaque pledging to bring his killer to justice.
	   The tablet is gone today, but the street name remains.
	   Mueller's trial is scheduled to last until Feb. 26.

Nagano mayor denies wrongdoing

 &UR; RECAPS to CORRECT spelling of name in 9th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of
the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegations that city officials
bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to win the
right to host the games.
	   Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by
Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, of
systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games.
	   ``I have never heard of such a thing,'' Tsukada told the
Associated Press Sunday.
	   ``As far as Nagano is concerned, we haven't done anything wrong.
We were selected as host of the Olympics through our efforts. We
can't believe that Mr. Hodler has made such a statement,'' he said.
	   Tsukada was vice chairman of the Japanese committee to invite
the Olympics to Nagano.
	   Nagano has been criticized for spending a large amount of money
to win the games.
	   Sports Nippon, a leading Japanese sports newspaper, said more
than 2 billion yen (dlrs 17 million) of the money Nagano spent to
bring the games there has not been accounted for.
	   Japan Olympic Committee has warned cities seeking to host the
games in the future that they should not entertain IOC members
excessively, the newspaper said.
	   Hodler's accusation might effect the invitation activities for
the 2008 summer Olympics by Osaka, Japan's second largest city, the
paper said. Osaka is competing with Beijing, China and other cities
for the right to host the games.
	   Nagano became the first Asian city to host the Winter Games
since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 games.
	   Eighty-eight IOC members took part in a secret vote in 1991 to
decide who would host the 1998 games. Nagano led in each of the
five rounds, beating out Salt Lake city 46 votes to 42 in the final
ballot.

Guinean president expected to win in West African vote

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Soldiers were on guard throughout Guinea
on Monday to prevent violence in Monday's election, which was
widely expected to be won by President Lansana Conte, who first
took control of this West African country in a military coup.
	   Even Conte's opponents were expecting that he would win the
vote, noting his government funding, military support, control of
the broadcast media and a political party that is tightly entwined
with the government.
	   Soldiers have been deployed throughout the country for the
voting in case of violence. Polls were scheduled to open at 8 a.m.
(0800 GMT) and close at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT). It was unclear when
results would be released.
	   Government officials promised free and transparent elections,
dismissing demands by the opposition that the elections be put off
for a month because only 40 percent of the electorate had received
voter cards.
	   Kader Sangari, an Interior Ministry official handling logistical
planning for Monday's vote, said between 95 percent and 98 percent
of voters had received their cards to vote.
	   The opposition also criticized the 1993 presidential elections,
the first multiparty presidential vote since the country gained
independence from France in 1958, saying they had been rigged in
Conte's favor.
	   Conte, who seized power in 1984 after the death of Guinea's
former dictator, Sekou Toure, faces four opponents in Monday's
vote.
	   Alpha Conde, one of two prominent opposition candidates, faced
Conte in the 1993 elections and recently returned from a
self-imposed exile in Senegal. He heads the Rally of the Guinean
People.
	   The other prominent candidate, Mamadou Ba, the leader of the
Union for Progress and Renewal, is believed to have widespread
support in part of the country's interior.
	   The other two candidates are not believed to have much support.
	   Guinea, which has an average per capita income of just a few
hundred dollars a year and an illiteracy rate of up to 80 percent,
is still recovering from Toure's brutal, 26-year regime. Thousands
of people died in Toure's prison camps, and 2 million people fled
the country.
	   While Conte's regime allows much more political freedom than
Toure's, critics say Conte turned more autocratic after a 1996
military revolt.

Report: National Grid to take over New England Electric System
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS company name thruout to New England Electric sted New
England Electrical &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ National Grid, the English and Welsh electricity
operator, is expected to announce Monday the acquisition of New
England Electric System for $3 billion in cash, the Financial Times
reported.
	   National Grid is expected to also assume $1 billion of the New
England company's debt, the London-based newspaper said in its
Monday editions.
	   National Grid, which operates a monopoly in England and Wales
with more than 3,100 miles of high voltage transmission lines, had
been looking to expand outside of Britain. Shareholders were told
last month that the company expected to complete a U.S. purchase by
March and it planned to generate at least 20 percent of its sales
from outside the highly-regulated British industry within three
years.
	   Through its four utilities _ Massachusetts Electric,
Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric and Nantucket
Electric _ New England Electric System provides electricity to more
than 1.3 million customers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island.
	   New England Electric System, Massachusetts' largest electricity
supplier, was likely an attractive company because of the state's
new electricity deregulation law, which passed March 1. The law has
created strong incentives for electric companies to sell off their
generating plants and related assets. Separating the generation of
electricity from its delivery is supposed to create greater
competition among utilities and lower rates for customers.
	   So far, the legislation has resulted in $3.9 billion worth of
New England utility acquisitions.
	   Massachusetts and California are the only two states with
comprehensive electricity deregulation plans.
	   The proposed deal between National Grid and New England Electric
follows the announcement last week of ScottishPower's $7.9 billion
takeover of the U.S.' PacifiCorp, which serves seven Western
states.
	   If that acquisition goes ahead, it will be the first ever
purchase of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company. The
combined company would have 7 million customers in Britain and the
United States with 23,500 employees worldwide.

Brother affected by scandal, Steve Waugh says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Batsman Mark Waugh has been affected
by the bookmaker scandal more than he has let on, his brother and
Australian vice captain Steve Waugh said Monday.
	   Steve Waugh said his twin seems to be weathering the storm after
admitting he provided information to an illegal Indian bookmaker
during Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   Mark Waugh and legspinner Shane Warne were fined in February
1995 by the Australian Cricket Board in action kept secret until
last Tuesday.
	   ``Being his twin, I believe it has affected him more than he has
let on,'' Steve Waugh wrote in his column in an English newspaper.
	   ``Many people seem to think Mark is the laid-back twin and I'm
the serious, determined type, which is a fair assumption if you
judge us by our performances on the field.
	   ``Many of the newspaper reports and critical analyses have hurt
deeply and the wounds will take time to heal.
	   ``But if I were a betting man, which I'm not, I'd be backing
Mark to come back a tougher, more determined character and
cricketer.''
	   Steve Waugh said his brother and Warne should not be further
punished.
	   ``I don't know of anybody being fined or punished a second time
for an offense or crime so why should this be a ground-breaking
scenario?''
	   He said the scandal had made the Australian cricket team
stronger.
	   ``We all realize it was a mistake and that these two would bleed
for Australia on the park,'' he said.
	   ``That's why we will all become stronger for this upheaval.''

Bribery allegations could be catalyst for change
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic officials say the worst
bribery scandal in the 104-year history of the International
Olympic Committee could be just what the organization needs to
clean up its act.
	   ``After the black day, the sun will come again,'' IOC president
Juan Antonio Samaranch said Sunday
	   A day after one of the IOC's highest-ranking officials rocked
the Olympic world with claims of organized vote-buying, Samaranch
said the allegations could be the catalyst for reform.
	   He promised to remove any crooked IOC members and consider
changing the way Olympic host cities are selected in order to
remove the risks of bribery.
	   ``If we have to clean (things up), we will,'' Samaranch said.
``If it is necessary, we will expel members. ... After, the IOC
will be even stronger than before.''
	   Added IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz of the United States:
```We ask athletes to compete with integrity _ our members must
also act with integrity.''
	   Samaranch, who has headed the International Olympic Committee
since 1980, compared the crisis to political boycotts of the 1980s
and Ben Johnson's drug scandal at the 1988 Seoul Games.
	   ``They were difficult moments, and now we are facing another
difficult moment,'' he said. ``I am sure that we will solve this
problem.''
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading a top-level
investigation into alleged misconduct, said the inquiry could be
the impetus for the IOC to stop corruption.
	   ``I don't like this to be out there, but I'm glad it is because
it gives us the opportunity to deal with it _ to put a chapter that
appears to be somewhat disagreeable behind us,'' he said.
	   For many years there have been rumors about payoffs and favors
to sway the votes of IOC members. But nothing could have prepared
the IOC for the events of this weekend.
	   For the first time, an IOC member publicly came forward with
stunning bribery allegations.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior IOC executive board member, said four
people _ including one IOC member _ were involved in vote-buying
over the past 10 years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia;
and Salt Lake.
	   Hodler said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _
currently numbering 115 _ were open to bribery.
	   Samaranch said he was ``surprised'' at the allegations but said
they would be investigated by the special panel looking into
alleged violations by the bid committee which won the 2002 Winter
Games for Salt Lake City.
	   Samaranch ruled out any possibility of Salt Lake City losing the
games as a result of the scandal, which from a scholarship fund
which benefited six relatives of IOC members.
	   Hodler has described the program as a ``bribe'' to sway IOC
votes.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,
apologized Sunday for the ``embarrassment'' caused by the case.
	   ``With hindsight, I believe this program should not have been
part of the bid campaign,'' he said, while stressing that Salt Lake
still won the games on merit.
	   Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider Hodler's proposal
to institute new procedures in the selection of host cities. Under
current rules, all IOC members have a vote. Samaranch said the
procedure was too long, complicated and expensive.
	   ``Maybe we have to think in the future to study another system
for picking the Olympic city,'' he said.
	   Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the formula used by sports
federations such as FIFA, world soccer's governing body, which
assign their executive boards to select sites.
	   But he ruled out any change before the next IOC session in
Seoul, South Korea, next June, when the site for the 2006 Winter
Olympics will be awarded.
	   Pound said the IOC has heard ``rumors'' of corruption in Olympic
votes but will now seek to substantiate Hodler's specific
allegations.
	   ``This is not a complete ivory tower here,'' he said. ``We say,
`Please give us some ammunition and we will investigate if there's
something there.' Now we have it, now we will.''
	   Pound said the IOC has been aware of a ``professional class of
Olympic people who offer their services to bid committees.''

Viduka unsettled by Croatian problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian soccer star Mark Viduka
said Monday he had been unable to sleep or eat following his
transfer to Glasgow Celtic because of the stress he endured at his
former club.
	   He told a media conference that he had been under intense
pressure at his previous club Croatia Zagreb where the fans had
turned on him.
	   Viduka has so far refused to comment on when he will return to
Glasgow.
	   ``The last four months have been the worst four months of my
life,'' he said.
	   Viduka said he felt well during a training stint at Celtic but
soon realized he was not ready to play again.
	   ``I was not eating at all and was not sleeping,'' Viduka said.
	   Viduka fled Glasgow, returning to Zagreb only days after
arriving, leaving the Scottish champion stunned.
	   He said he just needed a rest leaving his future in the clouds
while the Parkhead club was reluctant to pay the transfer fee to
Croatia Zagreb.
	   After a brief spell in Croatia he returned to his native
Melbourne early on Friday morning again stressing he just needed a
rest.
	   However he said then he was committed to returning to Celtic,
but did not reveal when.
	   ``It was an intense feeling that ultimately made me make this
decision,'' Viduka said. ``I feel sorry that everything could not
have gone as planned.''
	   ``It's hard to explain to Australians and Scots what it's like
being in a country that just emerged from a period of war, but my
every move was analyzed with negative and untrue conclusions drawn.
There was no balanced view.''
	   He said that even when playing at his best for Croatia Zagreb
the fans gave him a hard time.
	   ``I faced a hostile home crowd the majority of 40,000 Croatian
Zagreb booing, whistling and verbally abusing me even after I
scored a goal for our team,'' Viduka said.
	   He said the pressure flowed over into his everyday life and when
he was in restaurants and shops and was stalked by an abusive fan.
	   He believed that transferring to Glasgow was a smart move.
	   ``I thought that once I escaped to a new country with similar
values to Australia and a new club that welcomed me with warmth and
support that I would be able to once again to excel at the game I
live for and love.''
	   Viduka denied that the move had been stalled because he had
insisted on his share of the transfer fee being paid directly to
him and not to Croatia Zagreb.
	   Viduka said he had always been a Celtic fan since he was a child
and looked forward to playing for the side against rivals Glasgow
Rangers. (djp)

Unsung heroes lead Internationals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Maruyama, Parry and Nobilo. Hardly
golf's big-name attractions.
	   But that trio _ along with a few guys named Norman, Elkington
and Price, combined to win the Presidents Cup on Sunday from an
American team that never seemed to be in the picture.
	   While the Internationals partied hard at a Melbourne casino on
Sunday night, many of the Americans packed their bags and left
early Monday for the U.S.
	   It was always going to take an extraordinary effort to beat the
Americans _ guys like Woods, O'Meara, Janzen and Couples _ which
had the top four players in the world rankings and eight of the top
15.
	   But the Internationals came up with one, and then some, so much
so that a much anticipated match between Tiger Woods against Greg
Norman was only for show _ two hours before the final putt was
conceded, the champagne already was pouring for the International
team.
	   ``They played some of the most unbelieveable golf,'' said U.S.
captain Jack Nicklaus. ``Wow.''
	   Not even Woods' 1-up victory over Norman could keep the United
States from its worst loss in the history of match play _
International 20 1-2, United States 11 1-2.
	   ``We creamed them,'' said Steve Elkington, who downplayed
American comments that their putts didn't drop and that the
Internationals had holed too many impossible shots.
	   ``We didn't say that about Freddie Couples when he made it from
two counties last time to win it,'' Elkington said of the birdie
putt that beat Vijay Singh two years ago in the deciding match.
	   ``We're down here trying and we made those shots, they didn't.''
	   Craig Parry, who pulled off one of ``those shots'' on Saturday,
steamrolled past Justin Leonard for a 5 and 3 victory on Sunday.
Thirty minutes later, Nick Price polished off David Duval 2 and 1,
and the celebration was on.
	   ``We had a sour taste in our mouths from last time,'' Parry
said. ``We wanted to have champagne in our mouths tonight.''
	   Pour the biggest drink for Shigeki Maruyama, the might mite from
Japan who won the hearts of the Australian gallery and carried the
International team by winning all five of his matches. Only Mark
O'Meara in 1996 has gone 5-0 in the Presidents Cup.
	   ``It wasn't a question of beating America,'' Price said. It was
a question of winning that Cup. We want that trophy.''
	   Some of the best matches of the day didn't even matter _ Woods
holding off a late charge by Norman, Fred Couples and Vijay Singh
playing to a draw and O'Meara winning 1-up over Stuart Appleby.
	   International captain Peter Thomson described the U.S. team as
the ``greatest collection of golfers in the world'' during the
opening ceremonies.
	   Not this week. And particularly not at Royal Melbourne.
	   Until Sunday, the worst loss in U.S. history was 16 1-2 to 11
1-2 to Europe in the 1985 Ryder Cup at The Belfry, which turned out
to be the start of European domination in those matches. Could the
Presidents Cup be headed down the same path?
	   ``We came in here as underdogs and came out showing the force of
International golf,'' Norman said.
	   It was vindication for an International team that had lost the
first two Presidents Cup events, and proof that moving outside the
United States does make a difference.
	   ``We used to think golf was only played in the United States,''
Nicklaus said. ``We didn't even invent it. I'm not even sure how
well we play it anymore.''
	   From the time Frank Nobilo sank a 40-foot birdie putt on the
18th to give the International team its first point of the matches
on Friday, the Americans were never in the game. (djp)

Palestinians may meet Israeli demands, vote on charter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Meeting of Palestinian National Council convenes at 1345 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leaders may soften
their position and vote on the annulment of clauses in the PLO
charter Monday if U.S. President Bill Clinton can secure Israeli
guarantees that a vote will mean the end to the charter dispute for
good.
	   Clinton's appearance at the special session of the Palestine
National Council Monday was to be the centerpiece of his three-day
trip aimed at salvaging the crisis-plagued land-for-security peace
accord he helped broker in October.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
go forward with the latest Mideast peace accord and withdraw troops
from the West Bank unless the PNC votes to annul the clauses which
calls for Israel's destruction.
	   Both Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were to
address the PNC in Gaza City Monday at the Shawa convention center
beginning at 3:45 p.m. (1345 GMT).
	   Palestinian officials have said the current peace accord does
not obligate them to hold a formal vote. But after prodding from
the United States on the sensitive issue, officials said Sunday
they would either stand or raise their hands to affirm the
abrogation of the offending clauses.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Arafat will ask the
delegates at the end of his speech whether they support the peace
process and a letter he sent to Clinton in January declaring the 28
of the 33 clauses written in 1964 either void or amended.
	   ``Then we will raise our hands and stand up and applaud,''
Asfour said. Despite the show of hands, this should not be
considered a formal vote, Asfour said.
	   Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's Cabinet, said any vote
``will be based on a guarantee that we won't deal with this issue
any longer, that it will be gone and done with,'' he said.
	   In April 1996, the PNC convened and voted on annulling the
charter sections. Israel's then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres and the
United States applauded the move. However when Netanyahu came to
power one month later, he said the Palestinians had not completed
the task of changing the charter.
	   Only a vote would convince Netanyahu's government that the
Palestinians have forfeited the idea of armed struggle and accepted
the existence of the Jewish state.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Sunday that
``a respectable majority, a decisive majority, was necessary.''
Israeli officials were reluctant to discuss acceptable voting
technicalities but suggested that a show of hands should suffice.
	   Monday's PNC session was the most sensitive stop of Clinton's
three-day trip and could lead to a showdown if Clinton and
Netanyahu disagree over whether the PNC has completed its task.
	   The fate of a possible three-way summit following the PNC
session depended on whether or not a vote is cast, Bar-Illan said.
	   The Israeli Cabinet was to meet Thursday or Friday to decide
whether Israel would carry out the next troop withdrawal, said
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon. ``As it looks now, I think
it will be very hard for the government to approve it,'' he said.
	   Even if the PNC votes to Israel's satisfaction, Netanyahu said,
the Palestinians will have to meet several other conditions before
he will redeploy troops.
	   Netanyahu wants Arafat to withdraw publicly from intentions to
unilaterally declare a state in May and to accept Israel's terms
for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a dispute that has
triggered daily clashes in the West Bank.
	   Under the Wye River agreement, Israel promised to release 750
prisoners by the end of January. Last month, Israel freed 250, but
most of them were criminals.
	   The Palestinians said they were given to understand that those
released would be prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities, but
Israel has denied making such a promise.
	   In a nod to Clinton, Palestinian prisoners will suspend their
week-long hunger strike to lower tensions, said Hisham Abdel Razek,
a Palestinian Cabinet minister for prisoner affairs.
	   The Palestinian Authority has already canceled a commercial
strike in the West Bank and Gaza planned for Monday. Instead of the
strike, church bells will ring in the biblical town of Bethlehem,
one of the stops on Clinton's itinerary.

Japanese business sentiment deteriorates to record low

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by a severe credit crunch and prolonged
economic slump, business confidence at Japan's recession-hit small
and medium-sized manufacturers has fallen to a record low, the Bank
of Japan said Monday.
	   In a closely-watched quarterly report on business sentiment, the
central bank said sentiment had deteriorated in the past three
months to minus 60, down from minus 57 in September and the lowest
level since its ``tankan'' survey was begun in 1967.
	   The influential survey measures the percentage of firms seeing
business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions
worsen.
	   Confidence at major Japanese manufacturers also continued to
erode, falling to a lower-than-expected minus 56 _ the worst since
February 1994 when it hit the same level, the Bank of Japan said.
	   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a slight
deterioration, to minus 53, in the central bank's latest poll of
9,129 companies.
	   The previous survey, released in October, had registered a minus
51.
	   Investors appeared unnerved by the news, sending down Japanese
share prices. The benchmark stock index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
slid 1.03 percent to 14,256.96 as of midday.
	   The nosediving survey numbers come as Japan has slid into its
worst recession since World War II. Unemployment has risen to
all-time highs, bankruptcies have soared and consumer spending has
shriveled.
	   Less than two weeks ago, the government said the world's
second-largest economy shrank at an annualized pace of 2.6 percent
in the most recent quarter, marking the longest slump in more than
four decades.
	   The Bank of Japan survey showed that major manufactures expect
export sales _ a mainstay for their businesses _ will likely
decline in the second half of the current fiscal year through
March.
	   That appears to reflect concern about slowing growth in the
United States and continued doubts about the outlook for a recovery
in Asian neighbors suffering from a regional crisis.
	   Amid growing pressure both at home and from abroad to jump start
domestic-led growth, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
government has drawn up a stimulus package worth a record 24
trillion yen (dlrs 206 billion).
	   Yet some economists say a full recovery remains a distant
prospect.
	   ``We have seen the economy worsen in the past year, but we
cannot expect a dramatic turnaround because consumption remains
quite weak,'' said Naomi Hasegawa, senior economist at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities Co.
	   Over the next three months, major manufactures expect a modest
improvement in their businesses. The tankan showed they forecast
the main index for these companies will reach minus 48.
	   But small and mid-sized companies, which have had increasing
difficulty obtaining financing from risk-averse banks, expect
little to change. They predicted the next survey in March will hold
steady at a worst-ever minus 60.

Clinton carries appeal for reconciliation to Arafat in Gaza

 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton is carrying an
appeal for reconciliation with Israel to Yasser Arafat in a
ground-breaking trip to Palestinian-held territory.
	   Landing at Gaza airport, the first-ever visit by an American
president could provide a morale boost to Palestinians in their
drive for an independent state.
	   Clinton's appearance at a special session of the Palestine
National Council on Monday was to be the centerpiece of his
three-day Middle East trip aimed at salvaging the crisis-plagued
land-for-security peace accord he helped broker in October.
	   The main dividend for Israel is the expected confirmation by the
PNC that clauses in its 1964 charter proposing the destruction of
the Jewish state are nullified.
	   ``That will be a welcomed development,'' Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Sunday.
	   For the nearly 3 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank
and in Gaza, the president's visit has symbolic significance,
beginning with his arrival by helicopter at their own international
airport at Rafah.
	   Arafat, other top officials of the Palestinian Authority and an
honor guard were to extending their greetings, while on the eastern
edge of strip U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley was to open
an industrial zone.
	   A U.S.-Palestinian commission, designed to improve economic
ties, also was due to meet, and Clinton was to address the PNC much
as he would a national legislature.
	   Still, Clinton and his senior aides say their intention was not
to encourage Palestinian statehood aspirations and the issue
remains to be considered in negotiations with Israel.
	   Clinton appealed to Palestinians Sunday in Jerusalem to prove
their peaceful intentions ``in word and deed.'' He also urged
Israel to acknowledge the ``legitimate expectations'' of their
longtime foes.
	   ``The violent past and the difficult present do not have to be
repeated forever,'' Clinton said,
	   Netanyahu assured Clinton that Israel was ``prepared to do our
part,'' but he linked any further Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank to Arafat renouncing his plans to declare statehood and taking
steps to squelch violence.
	   ``I'm sure that we can achieve peace between Palestinians and
Israelis if we stand firm on Palestinian compliance,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   He urged Clinton to take that message to Arafat in Gaza.
	   Clinton credited the Palestinian Authority with taking some
``important steps,'' including deeper security cooperation with
Israel and confiscating illegal weapons, but he also was critical.
	   ``Have the Palestinians fulfilled all their commitments?'' he
asked. ``They certainly could be doing better to preempt violent
demonstrations in the street. This is a terribly important
matter.''
	   Clinton renewed his pledge to ask Congress to provide dlrs 1.2
billion to help Israel take new security measures to carry out the
Wye accords. This is in addition to the dlrs 3 billion a year in
annual U.S. economic and military assistance that Israel gets.
	   At the same time, he cautioned that Israel needed to reach out
and not be preoccupied with security or live in a permanent state
of siege.
	   The Palestinians, he said in a speech to a mostly young audience
at the Jerusalem Convention Center, ``feel you should acknowledge
they too have suffered and they, too, have legitimate expecations
that should be met.''
	   ``And they are right, too,'' Clinton said.
	   Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during
Clinton's visit.
	   Abdallah Shami, leader of the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza, said
in an interview with APTN that he would kill Clinton if he could
``with every method I can muster.''
	   ``I would not hesitate,'' Shami said.
	   But, he said, ``I don't know of anybody in Gaza who is thinking
of killing Clinton now.''
	   Later, he was detained by Palestinian police as he walked home
from a junior high school in Gaza City, a Palestinian police
official said.

Slater's century extends Australian lead to 417
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A brilliant Michael Slater century
has left England's Ashes hopes in tatters as Australia continued to
bat the visitors out of the third test at the Adelaide Oval on
Monday.
	   Slater's 103, the sixth against England, helped Australia to a
second innings 253 for four and an imposing 417-run lead at lunch
on the penultimate day.
	   Slater got into the groove by hitting medium paceman Darren
Gough's first two balls of the day for boundaries after resuming on
74.
	   With a subdued partner in Justin Langer, 52 in almost four
hours, Slater put on 134 runs for the second wicket after skipper
Mark Taylor was dismissed on the third day.
	   Mark Waugh was unbeaten on 35 and Ricky Ponting eight not out at
lunch.
	   Slater clipped off-spinner Peter Such (2-66) off his legs for
two to bring up his century off 191 balls, including a six and
eight other boundaries.
	   He celebrated his ninth test century with his trademark salute
to the Australian dressing room and kissing the badge on his green
helmet.
	   He was finally dismissed by a Gough yorker, trapped plumb in
front.
	   England also got rid of Langer and Steve Waugh (seven), who fell
to Dean Headley.

U.S. envoy Holbrooke makes small steps on Cyprus as problem reaches
</HEADLINE>
critical juncture &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ With the Cyprus problem reaching a
critical juncture, U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke tried to make a
few small steps to bring the hostile Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities closer together.
	   Meeting Sunday with business leaders from the war-divided
island, Holbrooke expressed hope that the little things needed to
make life easier for the nearly one million people living on Cyprus
would give them the impetus to reconcile their differences.
	   ``Not everything that we agreed here will happen, but some will.
It is better to try and fail that not to try at all,'' Holbrooke
told the 20 entrepreneurs.
	   But Holbrooke's real job will come Monday, when he travels to
Athens for meetings with Greek leaders and talks on the future of
Russian S-300 missiles destined for Cyprus.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on Sunday insisted the
planned deployment of the missiles later this month will go ahead
as scheduled.
	   Turkey has said it will use force to stop them, which would
probably lead to a war with Greece. Athens has a defense accord
with Cyprus and has nearly fought two wars with NATO ally Turkey in
the past 11 years over territorial disputes over the Aegean Sea.
	   The difficulty was evident in the meeting between the business
leaders, who once again ran afoul of the bitter disputes that have
kept the eastern Mediterranean island separated since 1974, when
Turkish troops invaded its northern third after an abortive
Athens-backed coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with
Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in a northern breakaway state
recognized only by Ankara.
	   Holbrooke, architect of the Bosnian peace agreement and the
recent Kosovo ceasefire, has refused to comment publicly on the
S-300 issue, indicating that developments may be at a crucial
point.
	   He did say it was positive that Greek and Turkish Cypriot
entrepreneurs at least agreed to try and solve a water shortage
problem on the island and launch projects to have their languages
taught in each others schools, to establish an agreement to have
cellular phones work on both sides, and make efforts to restore
historic monuments.
	   It was a small step considering that U.N.-sponsored talks have
been deadlocked since late 1997, after Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash insisted on recognition and an end to negotiations for
Cyprus' accession to the European Union.
	   But it was apparent at the meeting that Holbrooke may also have
had other problems on his mind. Sources said he was preparing for a
trip to Belgrade after Athens.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was quoted by Newsweek in
its Dec. 21 issue as saying that any attempt by a French-led NATO
force in Macedonia to move into Kosovo if fighting endangers
international monitors in the province would be considered an act
of aggression.

Reports: North Korea drops demand for compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea has dropped its demand for
dlrs 300 million in ``reparations'' for a U.S. inspection of a
suspected nuclear weapons site in exchange for food and other
economic benefits, Seoul newspapers reported Monday.
	   Quoting unidentified sources in Washington, two major South
Korean newspapers _ JoongAng and Dong-A _ said the agreement was
reached in a recent series of negotiations between the United
States and North Korea in New York and Washington.
	   Washington has rejected Pyongyang's demand for cash
compensation.
	   The two sides are expected to start discussions on detailed
terms of the inspection at their next round of talks, the papers
said.
	   Tension has risen over North Korea's refusal to accept a U.S.
demand for inspection of a suspected underground nuclear facility
under construction at Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northeast of the North's main nuclear complex of Yongbyon.
	   While claiming that the facility is for civilian use, North
Korea had demanded that the United States pay it dlrs 300 million
for making ``false'' accusations concerning the site. The U.S. had
rejected the demand.
	   ``The next negotiations are likely to be held in Geneva in late
January when four-nation Korean peace talks are held there,''
JoongAng said.
	   The two Koreas, with the United States and China as mediators,
are scheduled to meet in Geneva Jan. 18-24 to work out a durable
peace on the Korean peninsula. It will be the fourth such meeting
since late last year.
	   The reports come after South Korean President Kim Dae-jung last
week proposed a ``package deal'' under which the United States
would provide economic and diplomatic benefits in exchange for an
outside inspection of the suspected facility.
	   Kim made the proposal during a meeting in Seoul with William
Perry, Washington's point man on North Korea.
	   U.S. officials have openly warned that North Korea's continued
refusal to allow an inspection would lead to a collapse of a 1994
accord with the United States, under which Pyongyang has promised
to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   The Korean Peninsula, divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945, are technically at war, having signed no
peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   The United States fought against North Korea on South Korea's
side during the Korean War. It keeps 37,000 troops in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty.

In Gaza refugee camp, Hillary Clinton is a heroine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Not everyone who lives in the Shati
refugee camp is a big fan of America. But that doesn't keep anyone
from hailing Hillary Rodham Clinton as a heroine.
	   ``She's a strong woman with a strong mind, and she's coming here
just to visit all of us,'' said Maha Lissa, a Palestinian refugee
whose home is just across the street from a women's center the U.S.
first lady was to visit Monday.
	   The roof of the house has been commandeered by Palestinian
security but Lissa, a 41-year-old mother of eight, said she
wouldn't let that stop her from getting a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton
during what is to be a brief stop.
	   ``I'll go up on the roof and wave,'' she said. As for the
security team, ``I'll tell them not to worry, that I'll look out
for her myself. She's coming here to our home, after all.''
	   Like Gaza's seven other refugee camps, Shati, also called the
beach camp, is crumbling, crowded and poor. The center Mrs. Clinton
is to visit is on the only paved street in the area; most of the
camp's roadways are dirt and sand.
	   The Beach Women's Program Center, which provides job training
and counseling for Palestinian women, is also a break from the
camp's otherwise grim environs, with cheerful murals and
whitewashed walls.
	   ``We are very happy that she is coming here to see with her own
eyes how people live in Gaza,'' said Lillian Tarazi, a social
service officer at the center. ``We want her to know about our
lives, that we need peace, and our own state.''
	   She, like other Palestinians, took special note of Mrs.
Clinton's expression of support for Palestinian statehood in a
speech in Europe. In May, Mrs. Clinton told high school students in
Geneva that she thought a Palestinian state would make for a
stabler Mideast. Many are more cool in their view of President
Clinton, perceiving him and the United States as tilting too
strongly toward Israel.
	   Mrs. Clinton also drew warm expressions of support from women in
the refugee camp for her handling of the storm over her husband's
affair with a young White House intern.
	   ``We admire her for standing by her husband in difficult
times,'' said Tarazi. ``She has great courage.''
	   Lissa, the across-the-street neighbor, said if she could talk to
the first lady, she would tell her how difficult it was for young
men from the camp to find work. Her two sons are unemployed, she
said.
	   ``That's the biggest problem for us,'' said Lissa. ``We want the
men to be able to find a job, and our daughters to go to school _
we want life to be as good as it is in America!''
	   During the Clintons' three-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian lands, Mrs. Clinton has had her own itinerary,
including stops that reflect her interest in children's issues.
	   On Sunday, she visited a kindergarten in Newe Shalom, a village
tucked into a hillside west of Jerusalem where 36 Arab and Jewish
families live together.
	   And at a stop to a children's ward in Jerusalem's Hadassah
hospital, she praised the facility for treating all patients
equally, regardless of their backgrounds, and made a point of
meeting with both Jewish and Arab children.

No. 13 proves golden for Thais at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thirteen has proved a lucky number for
Thailand, where millions swear by the numbers.
	   At the 13th Asian Games Sunday _ Dec. 13 _ the hosts reached
their record number of gold medals _ 13.
	   Thailand's best previous performance at Asia's version of the
Olympics was 12 gold at the 1966 Games in Bangkok. Before the
current event started, Thai sports officials had targeted just 10
golds.
	   The Thais, including political leaders, are great believers in
numerology and frequently make decisions based on numbers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TRASHY ART: Spectators at the Asian Games are being asked to
throw trash into art.
	   To recycle some of the 70 tons of rubbish discarded daily at one
of the major sports complexes, four plastic sculptures are being
used as mega-garbage cans.
	   Encouraged by free gifts, fans at the Thammasat Sports Complex
are urged to toss empty aluminum cans into the sculptures for
recycling. Additionally, the Asian Games rubbish contractors employ
600 people just to keep the one complex clean.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TUK-TUK THREAT: Drivers of Bangkok's noisy, fume-belching but
beloved ``tuk-tuk'' taxis are threatening to strand athletes and
officials at the Asian Games.
	   Some 70 drivers of the three-wheeled, open-sided vehicles were
hired to shuttle games' participants at the Thammasat Sports
Complex, one of the major games centers.
	   They first went on strike before the games started Dec. 6
because they had not been paid their promised daily allowance of
300 baht (dlrs 8) even though they had been working since November.
	   Now, about 20 of the drivers have gone home while the rest are
threatening to strike again. They don't trust organizers to honor
the contract since the last payment is not due until Dec. 23 when
the games will have finished.
	   Negotiations are under way.
	   --- &QC; 
	   TICKETLESS THAIS: Thais scouring for hard-to-get tickets to
watch their soccer team play at the Asian Games have turned to
touts, who in turn are being rounded up by police.
	   Authorities arrested about 70 people selling black market
tickets to Saturday's match between Thailand and Qatar, sometimes
asking for 300 percent over the official price.
	   Ticketless Thais scaled fences and hurled bottles, cans and
shoes at police when they could't buy tickets to Saturday's game,
which Qatar won 2-1. Despite the loss, the Thais reached the
quarterfinals anyway.

Coal companies seek injunction to halt 48-hour strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous, updates with legal ban on strike sought. &QL; 
 &UR; Unions face court action over strike &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Coal mining companies on Monday
began legal action to end a nationwide miners' strike called to
protest lower coal prices for Japan's steel industry.
	   A coalition of companies sought the intervention of the
Australian Industrial Relations Commission, applying for an order
against the Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU).
	   Union members walked off the job Monday, angered at miners MIM,
Shell and the North Goonyella Mine accepting an 18 percent, U.S.
dlrs 9 a metric ton, cut in the Japanese price of coking coal, used
for making steel.
	   Federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith described the
strike call as ``totally unauthorized'' because union members have
breached no-strike agreements under the Workplace Relations Act.
	   Companies now have the option of seeking compensation from union
members for any losses from the strike, he said.
	   According to CFMEU spokesman Paddy Gorman, the union was
prepared to test the government's claims the strike action was
illegal.
	   ``This is a test for the current government ... I think it is
the first time they've had a national strike against them, so if
they think it's illegal, let's see them in court,'' he said.
	   Mining companies estimate the strike will cost the industry 56
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 34 million) in lost
production.
	   ``This union is infamous for taking industrial action,'' Reith
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Reith said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of
strikes, undermining Australia's reputation as a reliable and
consistent supplier.
	   ``The CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national
interest, they undermine the interests of their own workers, they
run a political agenda,'' he said.
	   ``Now they want the Australian government to control the
international price of a major commodity, obviously something
outside our control,'' he said.
	   But CFMEU mining division general president Tony Maher said the
government had failed to address a general coal crisis that had
sparked major job losses and are threatening more.
	   ``Coal is Australia's biggest export earner -- it earns 10
billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country so a 20 percent
drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect -- that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrap heap.''
	   Maher believes the problems in the coal industry stem from an
oversupply of coal.
	   ``There's 20 million ton excess capacity coming out of
Australia,'' he said.
	   ``We're allowing too many new mines to come on stream and the
government just sits back and lets them open up new mines.''
	   In accepting the price cut, mine owners had made a ``blind
grab'' for market share instead of price, Maher said.

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After successfully joining and
outfitting the first two pieces of the international space station,
Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story complex loose Sunday and
flew away.
	   They were sorry to go, but at the same time pleased to leave
behind ``the brightest new star on the horizon.''
	   ``Wish we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said,
``but we'll get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come
back and add more to it.''
	   It will be spring before the next construction crew arrives.
	   With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding them
together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot,
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls,
slowly backed away.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the
245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between space
shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations.
	   The winged, cylindrical station glistened in the sunlight as the
shuttle circled from a distance of 450 feet for a final photo
survey. Once that was done, Sturckow fired Endeavour's thrusters
and the shuttle pulled away for good.
	   The astronauts could still see the station from more than eight
miles out and excitedly beamed down pictures.
	   ``It's the brightest new star on the horizon,'' Cabana said as
the station grew smaller and smaller, its two components resembling
the head and body of a snowman lying sideways.
	   Later, in an interview with The Associated Press, Cabana
described the space station as a magnificent sight.
	   ``All of us looked out at it and couldn't believe what had
transpired in the last few days,'' he said. ``Just seeing it all
come together, all those years of hard work ... it was truly
amazing.''
	   With Endeavour's flawless departure, NASA's lead flight
director, Bob Castle, was finally ready to declare the assembly
part of the 12-day mission a success.
	   ``I'm very, very, very gratified,'' Castle said.
	   The undocking capped an intense week for Endeavour's six
astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday.
	   They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and
stacked it on the American-made Unity chamber in the shuttle cargo
bay on Dec. 6, then conducted three spacewalks to wire the
components together, install and fix antennas, and attach a tool
box to the outside. They also spent a full day inside the station,
sprucing it up for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in just
over a year.
	   Working quickly, they accomplished everything they set out to do
and more.
	   ``This has been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said.
``Words can't express how excellent this has all been. This is
going to be one heck of a space station when we get it done.''
	   NASA plans four shuttle flights to the space station next year,
starting in May, to haul up more equipment. Ten spacewalks will be
conducted during those missions to attach more parts.
	   The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in
2004.
	   Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result of
Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60
million to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having
a permanent control module flying by the end of next summer, more
than a year late.
	   Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.
	   The lingering uncertainty over Russia's role failed to dampen
the festive mood Sunday inside Mission Control.
	   ``We've got a lot more to come, more challenges,'' said Frank
Culbertson, deputy program manager for space station operations,
``but we've set a tremendous standard with this mission.''

Statehood loses in Puerto Rican vote on century-old U.S. ties

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans rejected statehood
Sunday, giving supporters of the existing commonwealth status a
narrow majority in a non-binding referendum on the island's ties to
the United States.
	   Final results gave 50.2 percent of votes to the ``none of the
above'' option adopted by the commonwealth party, while statehood
had 46.5 percent. In a similar non-binding referendum in 1993,
commonwealth status beat out statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.
	   Under commonwealth status, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with
local autonomy. Its 3.8 million residents can't vote for president
or Congress, which alone can change Puerto Rico's political status.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the
result of the referendum, but it was unclear what kind of message
the ``none of the above'' victory would send to Congress.
	   Most likely, there will be a bitter and prolonged argument over
interpreting the result.
	   On the Dos Hermanos Bridge, the gateway to the old part of San
Juan, dozens of people hung out of their gridlocked cars waving
U.S. and Puerto Rican flags. Others set off firecrackers, both
sides celebrating, both sides claiming victory.
	   The commonwealth party had urged a ``none of the above'' vote
because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth description, which
was written by the statehood party and suggested Congress could
revoke Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship.
	   Papillon Garces, 42, chose ``none of the above.''
	   The electrician said representation in Congress came at a price.
``If you want votes in Congress you have to pay federal taxes, and
that's a price I'd rather not pay.''
	   But pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello dismissed ``none of the
above'' votes, arguing his cause had won because statehood
supporters made up the vast majority of those who chose among one
of the four defined options _ statehood, commonwealth as listed on
the ballot, independence or a ``free association'' form of
independence with U.S. treaty ties.
	   The latter three choices combined received less than 4 percent
of the vote.
	   Rossello said he would use his interpretation to petition
Congress to make Puerto Rico a state.
	   ``Today, the people spoke and they said statehood is the future
of Puerto Rico. The people spoke, and I will obey,'' Rossello told
thousands of cheering supporters at a victory-type rally while
fireworks lit the sky above his party's headquarters.
	   Pro-commonwealth Sen. Eudaldo Baez Galib countered, ``If they go
to Washington with a petition for statehood ... they would be
violating the right to vote of the majority.''
	   Seventy-one percent of 2.2 million registered voters
participated in the attempt to resolve the century-long debate.
	   ``We will be protecting the future of our children,'' said
Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked statehood on his ballot.
	   Rossello called Sunday's referendum in hopes of persuading
Congress to end a colonial relationship that dates from the 1898
U.S. occupation of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War. He
can call another referendum at any time.
	   Rossello, whose New Progressive Party controls the local
legislature, sought to present Congress with a mandate to pursue
statehood _ and eliminate what he calls Puerto Ricans' second-class
U.S. citizenship.
	   Noting that Congress has begun to question spending dlrs 10
billion a year in a territory that pays no federal taxes, he
insisted that statehood would raise the island's standard of living
and allow it to pay its fair share. Puerto Rico's per capita income
of dlrs 8,000 a year is half that of the poorest U.S. state,
Mississippi.
	   Commonwealth advocates countered that statehood would destroy
Puerto Rico's culture and that English would supplant the Spanish
language. They argued that Puerto Ricans already have the best of
both worlds: U.S. citizenship and a fierce cultural independence.
	   Some in Congress have warned that commonwealth status, adopted
in 1952, must eventually give way to either statehood or
independence.

Report: National Grid to take over New England Electric System
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Changes dollar signs thruout to conform with AP style and

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ National Grid, the English and Welsh electricity
operator, is expected to announce Monday the acquisition of New
England Electric System for dlrs 3 billion in cash, the Financial
Times reported.
	   National Grid is expected to also assume dlrs 1 billion of the
New England company's debt, the London-based newspaper said in its
Monday editions.
	   National Grid, which operates a monopoly in England and Wales
with more than 5,000 km (3,100 miles) of high voltage transmission
lines, had been looking to expand outside of Britain. Shareholders
were told last month that the company expected to complete a U.S.
purchase by March and it planned to generate at least 20 percent of
its sales from outside the highly-regulated British industry within
three years.
	   Through its four utilities _ Massachusetts Electric,
Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric and Nantucket
Electric _ New England Electric System provides electricity to more
than 1.3 million customers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island.
	   New England Electric System, Massachusetts' largest electricity
supplier, was likely an attractive company because of the state's
new electricity deregulation law, which passed March 1. The law has
created strong incentives for electric companies to sell off their
generating plants and related assets. Separating the generation of
electricity from its delivery is supposed to create greater
competition among utilities and lower rates for customers.
	   So far, the legislation has resulted in dlrs 3.9 billion worth
of New England utility acquisitions.
	   Massachusetts and California are the only two states with
comprehensive electricity deregulation plans.
	   The proposed deal between National Grid and New England Electric
follows the announcement last week of ScottishPower's dlrs 7.9
billion takeover of the U.S.' PacifiCorp, which serves seven
Western states.
	   If that acquisition goes ahead, it will be the first ever
purchase of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company. The
combined company would have 7 million customers in Britain and the
United States with 23,500 employees worldwide.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Koala Foundation has
asked U.S. President Bill Clinton to include koalas on America's
endangered species list, as a tactic to shame Australia into
protecting its marsupial mascot.
	   In a letter to Clinton, the head of the foundation, Deborah
Tabart, said if President Herbert Hoover had not banned koala pelt
imports in 1929 ``the koala would have been shot to extinction for
the fur trade.''
	   Tabart said the deadline for submissions to Washington is Dec.
21.
	   She said a listing in the United States would help convince the
Australian government the koala had global significance.
	   If listed in America, Tabart said the Australian Koala
Foundation would then employ a U.S. attorney to draft a National
Koala Act modeled on the U.S. Endangered Species Act, for
submission to Australian authorities.
	   The foundation estimated earlier this year that koala numbers
have dwindled to between 45,000 and 80,000 from several million at
the turn of the century.
	   As much as 80 percent of the koala habitat has been destroyed
since white settlement in 1788, and little of the remaining 20
percent is protected, she said.

Explosive fire hits hotel in small Swedish town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire raced through a hotel in the
western Sweden town of Kvaenum following an explosion early Monday
the Swedish news agency TT reported. There was no immediate word on
casualties.
	   The fire broke out about 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) and the building was
completely ablaze within minutes, the report said.
	   Kvaenum is near Karlstad, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) west
of Stockholm.
	   On Oct. 29, 63 young people died when a fire broke out in a
crowded upstairs dance hall in Goteborg, Sweden's second-largest
city.

Japanese stocks fall in early trading, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with midday stocks, late morning
dollar and bond prices; ADDS trader comment in 11th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell Monday morning amid
concern about the health of the banking system after the
nationalization of a major lender. The U.S. dollar fell against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 148.68 points,
or 1.03 percent, to 14,256.96 as of midday. On Friday, the average
closed down 402.16 points, or 2.72 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.74 yen in late morning trading, down 0.54
yen from late Friday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
116.42 yen Friday.
	   Led down by bank shares, Japanese stocks slid amid rekindled
fears of instability in the bad debt-ridden banking system after
the government took over ailing lender Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. on
Sunday, traders said.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marked the
second time a top lender has come under state control in less than
two months. The government took over the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   Investors were also spooked by a spurt in the yen's value and a
drop in U.S. stock prices on Friday, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 19.82 points to
8,821.76 on Friday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 9.55 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,108.61
points. The TOPIX closed down 21.62 points, 1.90 points, on Friday.
	   Investors appeared unfazed by the release early Monday of
worse-than-expected results in a closely-watched quarterly Bank of
Japan survey tracking business sentiment at companies.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar lost ground
against the yen amid mounting concern over an impending vote in the
U.S. Congress on articles of impeachment against President Bill
Clinton, traders said.
	   Worry over the direction of the American economy also weighed on
the U.S. currency, they said.
	   ``The uncertainty surrounding the impeachment proceedings will
depress the dollar,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. ``And the outlook for
the U.S. economy is getting worse because of falling commodity
prices,'' he added.
	   The U.S. House or Representatives was scheduled to begin debate
Thursday on four impeachment articles.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.170 percent from 1.160 percent on Friday,
pushing its price down to 105.38 yen from Friday's 105.47 yen.

Three children drown; official calls for surf safety awareness
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: Updates with drowning of three local children. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Just hours before three local children
drowned Monday at a New South Wales beach, a tourist official
called for a surf safety awareness program targeting international
tourists.
	   The children were from a church group in western Sydney, on an
outing at Cellito beach south of the mid-north coast town of
Forster, some 135 miles (220 km) north of Sydney.
	   The accident happened when six children were caught in a rip
tide after being swept off a sandbar by a wave.
	   An ambulance spokesman said a rescue helicopter airlifted a
12-year-old child to Manning Base hospital in Taree in a serious
but stable condition.
	   The other two other children were uninjured, the ambulance
spokesman said.
	   Meanwhile, Tourism Task Force chairman John Brown said Australia
had a duty of care to its visitors and it was the joint
responsibility of governments and the tourism industry to educate
travelers about surf safety.
	   ``Many foreign tourists arrive in Australia with little or no
experience in surf and get themselves and their rescuers in
trouble,'' Brown said.
	   An elderly Russian tourist on an outing with a tour group at
Bondi Beach drowned after being swept up in a rip about 200 feet
(60 meters) from the shoreline on Saturday afternoon.
	   The man, aged in his 60s, had been swimming outside the flagged
safety zone, where beach life savers patrol the waters. Areas
beyond the flags could have rip tides, undertows, and other
hazards.
	   On Friday a young South Korean man died in what lifesavers
described as a freak accident in knee-depth water at Bronte Beach.
	   Three men were dragged under the surface and two of them
resurfaced quickly but they were unable to locate their friend.

Austrians have best _ and worst _ weekend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's skiers swept three of four
World Cup races on the weekend but still experienced their worst
moment in the nation's ski history.
	   Alexandra Meissnitzer kicked off the annual First Criterium with
commanding victories in the women's super-G and giant slalom while
Hermann Maier completed the hat-trick with an emphatic win in the
men's super-G on Sunday.
	   But sandwiched in between their successes, the Austrians posted
their worst collective result ever when they failed to place a
skier among the top-10 in Saturday's men's downhill.
	   Unheralded Norbert Holzknecht posted the top Austrian result
crossing 15th while double Olympic champion Maier was 36th and
World Cup downhill Andreas Schifferer was 29th.
	   While the Austrians fell victim to changable weather conditions
that favoured late starters, Norway's Lasse Kjus, the 24th skier
onto the OK course, claimed his eighth career victory.
	   The 1996 overall World Cup champion was followed by Italians
Luca Cattaneo and Erik Seletto, both posting career bests.
	   Under much more consistent conditions Sunday, the Austrians
returned to their dominant form as Maier and teammate Stefan
Eberharter took the top two places in the men's super-G.
	   For Maier the victory ended an early season slump, the
26-year-old Austrian returning to the top of the podium for the
first time since October when he won the inaugural giant slalom in
Soelden, Austria.
	   The victory lifted Maier to fourth in the overall standings,
while Eberharter's second place was enough to give him the lead
with 368 points, ursurping teammate Christian Mayer, who dropped to
second with 302.
	   Kjus, who capped off a productive weekend with a third place
finish in the super-G, remained third with 281, a spoint ahead of
Maier.
	   On the women's side, Meissnitzer collected a pair of wins,
increasing her season's total to four victories in 10 races.
	   The wins further strengthened 25-year-old's lead atop the
overall World Cup rankings, which she leads with 625 points, a
whopping 242 clear of her nearest challenger, Germany's Martina
Ertl.
	   Ever in the shadow of her illustrious teammate, World Cup
overall champion Katja Seizinger, Ertl is taking advantage of her
compatriot's season-long absence due to knee injury to pursue her
long-time dream.
	   But after a second in Thursday's super-G, Ertl crashed out in
the final leg of Friday's giant slalom, her strongest discipline,
giving away valuable points.
	   The World Cup giant slalom champion last season, Ertl has set
her sites on the overall title this year, hoping to dethrone
Seizinger.
	   ``Of course I'm going for the overall,'' said Ertl. ``I'm
astonished at my results in the downhill,'' said Ertl, who finished
fourth and seventh in the season's two downhills. ``I hope my
skills in the slalom will give me an edge in the overall.''
	   Concerns that French police would raid athletes' rooms in search
for banned drugs as they did during the Tour de France last summer
proved unfounded.
	   Maier, at the center of doping accusations earlier this season,
encouraged the International Ski Federation to toughen up its
testing, suggesting officials perform controls on blood samples
rather than simply urine tests.
	   ``It's not so important in skiing to do doping tests but if
you're going to do them they should be thorough,'' said Maier, who
felt technique was more important than physique in skiing.

Giants end Broncos dreams of perfect season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES from previous cycle with late games. Will be UPDATED
with Dolphins-Jets game. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Rest easy, '72 Miami
Dolphins. The Denver Broncos are no longer perfect.
	   The Broncos' dreams of becoming the first NFL team since those
Dolphins to go undefeated ended Sunday when Kent Graham threw a
37-yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer with 48 seconds left, giving
the New York Giants a shocking 20-16 victory.
	   The game-winning catch came in the back of the end zone with
Toomer outleaping Tito Paul for the ball. For a second, the
officials looked at each other and discussed whether Toomer's feet
were inbounds before back judge Kirk Dornan signaled touchdown.
Replays showed the call was correct.
	   Until the late heroics by the Giants (6-8), the Broncos (13-1)
seemed headed for their 14th straight win and an NFL-record 19th
straight over two seasons, thanks to yet another John Elway-led
comeback. He engineered a 76-yard drive that was capped by Terrell
Davis' 27-yard run, which put the Broncos ahead 16-13 with 4:08
left.
 &UR; Cardinals 20, Eagles 17, OT &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, the Arizona Cardinals needed a little longer
than expected to keep their playoff hopes alive.
	   After missing a 34-yard field goal at the end of regulation,
Chris Jacke kicked a 32-yarder 4 1/2 minutes into overtime, giving
the Cardinals a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
	   Rob Moore, who had a controversial 9-yard TD catch that tied it
17-17, had receptions of 30 and 16 yards from Jake Plummer on the
winning drive. Arizona (7-7) stayed in the running for the NFC wild
card, but needs to win its final two games against New Orleans and
San Diego _ both at home.
	   Adrian Murrell rushed for 174 yards on 32 carries for the
Cardinals. Plummer, who had a horrible game in a loss to the New
York Giants last week, was 18-for-26 for 234 yards and a
touchdown.
 &UR; Packers 26, Bears 20 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Dorsey Levens rushed for 105 yards and
the injury-riddled Green Bay Packers overcame strong performances
by former teammates Edgar Bennett and Glyn Milburn.
	   Levens, in his third game back from a broken leg, helped the
Packers beat the Bears for the ninth straight time, the longest
dominance of the NFL's oldest rivalry. The Bears won eight in a row
from 1985-88.
	   The Bears (3-11) get another shot at ending the skid when the
Packers (9-5) visit Soldier Field in two weeks.
 &UR; Colts 39, Bengals 26 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, Peyton Manning passed for 210 yards and three
touchdowns as Indianapolis handed Cincinnati its ninth straight
loss.
	   The victory snapped a three-game slide for Indianapolis (3-11),
which blew double-digit leads in its previous two games. This time,
with Manning and Marshall Faulk providing the offense, the Colts
never let up.
	   Faulk, the NFL leader in yards from scrimmage, had a pair of
first-half touchdown runs, and his 115 yards rushing and 39 yards
receiving pushed his total yardage this season to a Colts-record
2,090.
	   Manning was 17-for-26 and set NFL rookie records with 502
attempts and 286 completions for the season. He also extended his
own rookie records to 3,179 yards passing and 11 straight games
with at least one touchdown pass.
 &UR; Rams 32, Patriots 18 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, rookie Az Hakim and June Henley each scored two
touchdowns and St. Louis (4-10) overcame three first-half turnovers
and the loss of starting quarterback Tony Banks.
	   The Patriots (8-6) wasted a big game from rookie running back
Robert Edwards, who gained 196 yards on 24 carries, and hurt their
playoff chances by losing for the first time in four games.
	   Banks tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee with
4:36 left in the first quarter and is out for the season. Backup
Steve Bono had a slow start with an interception and fumble in the
first half, but was 7-for-12 with no mistakes after the break.
 &UR; Falcons 27, Saints 17 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Terance Mathis caught touchdown passes of 63 and
62 yards from Chris Chandler as Atlanta stayed ahead of San
Francisco in the NFC West.
	   Jamal Anderson ran for 148 yards on 27 carries for the Falcons,
who can claim the NFL West crown and a first-round bye if the 49ers
lose to Detroit Monday night. It was Anderson's 10th 100-yard
rushing game this season
	   Chandler's 62-yard TD pass to Mathis followed an interception by
Ray Buchanan and made the score 14-0 after Eugene Robinson's fumble
recovery set up Bob Christian's 1-yard TD run. Chandler and Mathis
connected again with 6:50 left in the game.
 &UR; Bills 44, Raiders 21 &QC; 
	   In Orchard Park, New York, the Buffalo Bills scored on six
straight possessions and beat Oakland to stay in the AFC East
championship race.
	   Buffalo (9-5) has won four of its last five games and nine of 11
after an 0-3 start. The Bills are hoping to become only the fourth
team in league history to reach the playoffs after an 0-3 start.
	   Doug Flutie completed 17 of 26 passes for 174 yards and two
touchdowns for the Bills. Wade Wilson, starting for the first time
since 1996, went 16-for-26 for 131 yards for Oakland (7-7).
 &UR; Bucs 16, Steelers 3 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers appear to be peaking
at the right time.
	   Back in the playoff race after appearing all but eliminated
three weeks ago, the Bucs (7-7) beat Pittsburgh (7-7) for their
first three-game winning streak of the season.
	   Mike Alstott scored on a 3-yard run and a defense that has
regained its bite the past month forced the Steelers into five
turnovers. Pittsburgh has not scored a touchdown in nine quarters.

Jail guard slain in Macau's latest apparent gangland shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ A lone gunman has shot dead one prison guard and
injured another in the Portuguese enclave of Macau, the fifth
apparent slaying of a government worker by gang members so far this
year, police said Monday.
	   The two Portuguese officials were struck by a hail of bullets
late Sunday, just three months after they arrived from Portugal as
part of a professional prison guard team brought in to tighten
security.
	   An unknown assailant, armed with two guns, fired several shots
at the pair as they and three other colleagues ate at an outdoor
cafe in a small alley, police said.
	   Luis Afonso, 26, who was shot in the head, died instantly.
Carlos Ribeiro, 36, shot in the neck and abdomen, was hospitalized
in serious condition early Monday.
	   The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
	   But the Hong Kong Standard, quoting unnamed prison sources, said
the gunman may have been hired by local gang members who were
unhappy with the imprisonment of their leaders.
	   Several alleged top gang leaders are in jail awaiting trial,
including reputed gang boss Wan Kuok-koi, nicknamed Broken Tooth
Koi, the newspaper said.
	   Macau, a popular gambling and tourist spot on the tip of south
China with a population of 450,000, has been hit by a spate of
gangland-style shootings, arson and other attacks that have killed
a total of 24 people so far this year.
	   The violence has prompted China to announce that it will send an
elite detachment of soldiers to try to halt the violence in the
territory after Macau reverts to Chinese rule in December 1999.

 &UR; Oilers 16, Jaguars 13 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, Al Del Greco kicked a 41-yard field
goal with four seconds remaining to lift Tennessee over
Jacksonville.
	   The win pulled the Oilers (8-6) within two games of Jacksonville
(10-4) in the AFC Central with two games remaining and the
tiebreaker in their favor.
	   The Jaguars, forced to use third-string quarterback Jonathan
Quinn in the second half because of injuries, still need one
victory to clinch their first division title. They play at
Minnesota next week, followed by a Monday night contest against
Pittsburgh.
 &UR; Redskins 28, Panthers 25 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, rookie Skip Hicks rushed for 55
yards and two touchdowns and the Washington Redskins extended their
late-season surge by beating Carolina.
	   Hicks helped the Redskins gain a season-high 160 yards on the
ground against one of the NFL's worst rushing defenses, even though
Terry Allen was sidelined with continuing ankle problems in the
first quarter.
	   Trent Green threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns as Washington
(5-9) won for the fifth time in seven games and secured its first
three-game winning streak since 1996.
	   Things got so ugly for Carolina (2-12) that linebacker Kevin
Greene attacked assistant coach Kevin Steele on the sidelines in
the second quarter. Greene grabbed Steele and began shoving him
backwards before coaches and players separated the two.
 &UR; Vikings 38, Ravens 28 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Gary Anderson kicked six field goals, Randall
Cunningham threw two touchdown passes and Minnesota forced six
turnovers to get its franchise-record 13th victory.
	   Minnesota (13-1) scored 26 points off the turnovers and remained
a game ahead of Atlanta in the race for best record in the NFC and
homefield advantage in the playoffs.
	   Anderson has kicked 34 straight field goals, breaking the NFL
record of 31 set by the Vikings' Fuad Reviez in 1994 and 1995.
	   The teams also set an NFL record with three kickoff returns for
touchdowns, including two by the Ravens (5-9), who used a 95-yard
return by Corey Harris and a 97-yarder by Patrick Johnson to go up
14-6.
 &UR; Seahawks 38, Chargers 17 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, the Seahawks intercepted a franchise-record seven
passes, including two apiece by Shawn Springs, Darryl Williams and
Jay Bellamy, and kept their remote playoff hopes alive.
	   Seattle (7-7), which lost last week when the officials
incorrectly ruled that the New York Jets scored a touchdown in the
closing seconds, returned an interception and a fumble for
touchdowns to set an NFL record for most TDs (12) off turnovers in
a season.
	   The Seahawks intercepted five passes by Chargers starter Craig
Whelihan and two by rookie Ryan Leaf, who played for the first time
in five games.
	   It was San Diego's first game since interim coach June Jones
announced he was leaving at the end of the season to become the
coach at the University of Hawaii.
 &UR; Chiefs 20, Cowboys 10 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Bam Morris rushed for 137 yards and a
touchdown as Kansas City handed Dallas its third straight loss.
	   The loss prevented the Cowboys (8-6) from clinching their
seventh NFC East crown in eight years. The victory by the Chiefs

Coal companies seek injunction to halt 48-hour strike

 &UR; Eds: Updates with court ordering Rio Tinto miners back to work. &QL; 
 &UR; Unions face court action over strike

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Coal mining companies on Monday
began legal action to end a nationwide miners' strike called to
protest lower coal prices for Japan's steel industry.
	   A coalition of companies sought the intervention of the
Australian Industrial Relations Commission, applying for an order
against the Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU).
	   Union members walked off the job Monday, angered at miners MIM,
Shell and the North Goonyella Mine accepting an 18 percent, U.S.
dlrs 9 a metric ton, cut in the Japanese price of coking coal, used
for making steel.
	   Later Monday, coal company Rio Tinto won a New South Wales
Supreme Court order against strike action at its Hunter Valley
mines, who had joined in a sympathy strike along with all other
coal miners nationwide.
	   Federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith described the
strike as ``totally unauthorized'' because union members have
breached no-strike agreements under the Workplace Relations Act.
	   Companies now have the option of seeking compensation from union
members for any losses from the strike, he said.
	   According to CFMEU spokesman Paddy Gorman, the union was
prepared to test the government's claims the strike action was
illegal.
	   ``This is a test for the current government ... I think it is
the first time they've had a national strike against them, so if
they think it's illegal, let's see them in court,'' he said.
	   Mining companies estimate the strike will cost the industry 56
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 34 million) in lost
production.
	   ``This union is infamous for taking industrial action,'' Reith
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Reith said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of
strikes, undermining Australia's reputation as a reliable and
consistent supplier.
	   ``The CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national
interest, they undermine the interests of their own workers, they
run a political agenda,'' he said.
	   ``Now they want the Australian government to control the
international price of a major commodity, obviously something
outside our control,'' he said.
	   But CFMEU mining division general president Tony Maher said the
government had failed to address a general coal crisis that had
sparked major job losses and are threatening more.
	   ``Coal is Australia's biggest export earner -- it earns 10
billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country so a 20 percent
drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect -- that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrap heap.''
	   Maher believes the problems in the coal industry stem from an
oversupply of coal.
	   ``There's 20 million ton excess capacity coming out of
Australia,'' he said.
	   ``We're allowing too many new mines to come on stream and the
government just sits back and lets them open up new mines.''
	   In accepting the price cut, mine owners had made a ``blind
grab'' for market share instead of price, Maher said.

Japan's Tachibana wins solo synchronized swimming gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Miya Tachibana, the world
championship bronze medalist, won gold by a solid margin Monday in
solo synchronized swimming at the Asian Games.
	   Tachibana scored 98.400 in her free routine, worth 65 percent of
the total score, and was given a final score of 97.933.
	   South Korea's Choi Yoo-jin won the silver with 95.850 after a
free routine scored at 96.200.
	   China's Li Yuanyuan took bronze with 94.229. She was awarded
94.533 for her free routine.
	   At the world championships in Perth, Australia, in January,
Tachibana was third with 97.600, behind the 99.467 of Russian Olga
Sedakova and the 97.667 of France's Viorginie Dedieu.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire raced through a small hotel in the
western Sweden town of Kvaenum following an explosion early Monday,
injuring at least two people, the Swedish news agency TT reported.
	   The fire broke out about 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) and the building was
completely ablaze within minutes, the report said. Kvaenum is south
of Lidkopeing, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) west of Stockholm.
	   Two people were taken from the burning building and it was
possible that one other person was in the building at the time of
the fire, Birger Engstroem, deputy fire chief in Lidkopeing was
quoted as saying.
	   The small hotel, which was under renovation, has a restaurant on
the ground floor and an apartment above, TT said.
	   On Oct. 29, 63 young people died when a fire broke out in a
crowded upstairs dance hall in Goteborg, Sweden's second-largest
city.

Another slow day in NBA lockout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs and UPDATES in final 4 grafs with report from
Newsweek on racial angle. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They've tried almost everything to end the NBA
lockout, from secret negotiating sessions to private breakfasts to
``unofficial'' offers in stuffy back rooms.
	   They even tried going casual Saturday at the union's law office,
showing up in some of the nicest leather jackets imaginable.
	   But that didn't work either.
	   Now, it might be several more days before the league and the
union meet again.
	   ``There's no meeting today,'' NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said
Sunday, one day after a small negotiating session lasted less than
30 minutes and included the union informing commissioner David
Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik where it was willing to
make some movement.
	   The offer wasn't enough, and the parties soon walked off into
the cold December air, their hopelessness plainly evident as they
trudged through the cheery, bustling throngs of shoppers outside
the famous FAO Schwartz toy store.
	   ``No one knows what their schedule is,'' said union attorney
Jeffrey Kessler, who had enough of a sense of humor left to note
that at least they hadn't ruined too much of a Saturday.
	   There was room for a little levity because there still is enough
time to save the season. The top negotiators could decide to meet
this week, or they could decide to put the process back on the slow
track and settle in front of their television sets Friday night to
watch agent David Falk's exhibition game from Atlantic City.
	   No one is quite sure which choice they'll make.
	   ``It's very clear we don't have the basis for a deal between us,
or anything even close,'' Granik said. ``It's clear we have very
different ideals of what an appropriate deal should look like.''
	   The quick departure from Saturday's session by Stern and Granik
surprised many around the league, especially some on the ownership
side who had been told after Thursday's secret negotiating session
that a deal was close.
	   The union contingent seemed to think the same thing as it walked
into Saturday's meeting hopeful that the sides would make enough
progress to call back the full negotiating teams Tuesday or
Wednesday to perhaps close the deal.
	   But the league's bargaining team took a different tack, arriving
in a gloom and doom mode.
	   ``Get a life,'' Stern said to the handful of reporters who had
learned of the secret site.
	   ``Get a settlement,'' one said in reply.
	   Stern didn't laugh then, and he wasn't smiling afterward.
	   The union's offer, which was believed to include an absolute
limit on the top salary for any player with less than seven years'
of experience, wasn't good enough to keep Stern at the table.
	   The commissioner has said he is planning to lay off employees at
the NBA office, which draws its budget from a 6 percent cut of gate
receipts. He also says the season will cancel itself if a deal
isn't reached in the not-too-distant future.
	   The union still thinks Stern is bluffing. Stern insists he's
dead serious.
	   ``Right now it does not look good,'' he said.
	   There isn't much time for it to start looking better.
	   Also Sunday, Newsweek reported that some players believe race is
playing a factor in negiotiations. The union's leadership and all
but two of the players on the negotiating committee are black,
while all the owners and the league's top two officials are white.
	   ``I think there is a perception from the owners to even some
fans that we're blacks who should be happy with what we've got _
fair or not,'' said Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat. ``There's a
lack of respect given us in large part because we're athletes. I'm
not saying it's all about race because it's not _ but it plays a
factor.
	   In response, Stern denied that race is an issue and pointed out
that the league has successfully promoted a sport whose player
population is nearly 90 percent black.
	   ``This is a collective bargaining dispute _ no more, no less,''
he said.

Oilers 2, Flyers 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Boris Mironov scored the tying goal with 6.5
seconds left in regulation as the Edmonton Oilers took over first
place in the Northwest Division with a 2-2 tie against the
Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday night.
	   Philadelphia's Eric Desjardins scored the apparent game-winner
with 23.9 seconds left, only to have Mironov put in a rebound in a
late flurry in front of John Vanbiesbrouck.
	   The Flyers outshot Edmonton 4-2 in overtime, but still managed
only a season-low 19 on a night when Mikael Renberg returned after
a year in Tampa Bay. An apparent winning goal by Philadelphia's
Keith Jones was disallowed in overtime because Jones pushed
goaltender Mikhail Shtalenkov into the net.
 &UR; Blackhawks 2, Stars 2
	   In CHicago, Pat Verbeek scored a power-play goal in the third
period and the Dallas Stars stayed unbeaten through their last five
games, tying the Chicago Blackhawks.
	   Chicago's Ethan Moreau scored from in front on a rebound of a
miss by Doug Smolek at 10:14 of the final period to give the
Blackhawks a 2-1 lead.
	   But three minutes later, the Stars used their effective power
play _ fourth best in the NHL _ to get even. Verbeek took a nice
centering pass from Joe Nieuwendyk and beat Mark Fitzpatrick to
make it 2-2. The Stars nearly scored again moments later but Dave
Reid's backhander clanked off the pipe.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 3, Kings 0
	   In Anaheim, California, Teemu Selanne broke open a scoreless
game with a pair of second-period goals and Paul Kariya ended a
seven-game scoring drought as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the Los
Angeles Kings.
	   Guy Hebert made 35 saves to earn his 20th career shutout and the
first recorded by either team in this 29-game Southern California
rivalry, which was born when the NHL expanded to Orange County in
1993.
	   The Ducks have never held the edge over the Kings in the overall
series, which they evened up at 12-12-5. It is the third time the
Ducks have tied the series, after losing the first four meetings in
1993-94.

Policeman: Malaysia's former No. 2 could have faced trial last year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Former No. 2 Malaysian leader
Anwar Ibrahim would have been prosecuted for sexual misconduct as
early as last year had he not forced police to coerce retractions
from two people who lodged accusations against him, a police
officer testified Monday.
	   Anwar, the Southeast Asian country's deputy premier before being
sacked in September, currently faces abuse of power charges and
will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged in illegal
sex acts.
	   Officer Musa Hassan testified police detectives were unaware
last year that the retractions had been drafted and obtained by
colleagues in the police department's special branch _ allegedly on
Anwar's orders.
	   Otherwise, charges would have been brought against the former
deputy prime minister on the basis of initial allegations made by
Ummi Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar, the prosecution witness
said.
	   ``I suggested no further action because I was influenced by the
retraction letters,'' Musa told the court on Monday.
	   Azizan, the former driver of the jailed politician's wife, has
testified that Anwar repeatedly sodomized him in 1992, while Ummi
has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's wife.
	   The original allegations were contained in a letter Ummi, the
sister of Anwar's former secretary, sent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Last week, Musa said regular police officers were prevented from
interrogating Ummi and Azizan. Musa, who belongs to the criminal
investigation department, this year conducted a probe against Anwar
after the accusations resurfaced in a book.
	   Azizan's sodomy accusations form the core of the 10 charges
against Anwar, who was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 on grounds of
immorality.
	   Anwar is being tried for four counts of allegedly using his
influence with the police to force the two accusers to sign
retractions. He also faces trial on five illegal sex charges and
one more count of corruption.
	   But his sacking and subsequent arrest and beating while in
police custody have led to demands for political reforms and
anti-government protests.

Australians ask U.S. President Clinton to put koalas on endangered
</HEADLINE>
list

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Koala Foundation has
asked U.S. President Bill Clinton to include koalas on America's
endangered species list in a tactic designed to shame Australia
into protecting its marsupial mascot.
	   In a letter to Clinton, the head of the foundation, Deborah
Tabart, said if President Herbert Hoover had not banned koala pelt
imports in 1929 ``the koala would have been shot to extinction for
the fur trade.''
	   Tabart said the deadline for submissions to Washington is Dec.
21.
	   A listing in the United States would help convince the
Australian government the koala has global significance, she said.
	   If listed in America, Tabart said the Australian Koala
Foundation would then employ a U.S. attorney to draft a National
Koala Act modeled on the U.S. Endangered Species Act, for
submission to Australian authorities.
	   The foundation estimated earlier this year that koala numbers
have dwindled to between 45,000 and 80,000 from several million at
the turn of the century.
	   As much as 80 percent of the koala habitat has been destroyed
since settlement by Europeans in the late 18th century, and little
of the remaining 20 percent is protected, she said.

Shark academic about early years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A day after he and the International
team swept golf's Presidents Cup, Greg Norman swapped his golf
spikes for academic robes to tell a university graduation ceremony
he wished his old high school teachers could see him now.
	   Norman, who admitted he was ``not a great school student'' in
Townsville, Queensland, was presented with an honorary doctorate
from Brisbane's Griffith University for his business achievements.
	   The university said those achievements included interests in
golf course design, a yacht company, sportswear, restaurants,
Internet golf lessons and endorsements for Boeing Corporation and
General Motors Holden.
	   ``I've been very, very, lucky . . . golf has been the catalyst
to do all this,'' he said.
	   Despite being ``burgled a bit'' in the course of his career, he
believed that being ``street smart'' had got him to where he was
today.
	   ``You learn by your mistakes and you capitalize on your good
fortune,'' Norman said. ``That's the bottom line.''
	   Norman said that although getting education should be a young
person's first priority, he said his degree had been attained
without books and exams.
	   ``I took 23 years to get my degree, you took three to four
years, so you guys are well ahead of the ball game,'' he said.
	   Later he told reporters he would not be going by the name ``Dr.
Norman.''
	   ``But I'm extremely proud (of this degree),'' Norman said.
``Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would get an award like
this.
	   ``Who would have thought when I was an assistant pro at the
Royal Queensland Golf Club making 23 dollars a week that I'd be
sitting here doing this.'' (djp)

China sets target for stemming losses at state companies next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China aims to make at least one-third of its
money-losing state-owned companies profitable next year by stepping
up the pace of reforms, government-run media on Monday quoted a top
official as saying.
	   At a senior-level government conference held over the weekend,
Vice Premier Wu Bangguo urged further streamlining of China's state
enterprises in 1999 to cut losses, the official China Daily
reported.
	   Wu called for tough measures to stop duplicate investments and
for closing inefficient small mines, oil refineries and steel mills
that waste energy and spew heavy pollution, the report said.
	   China also plans to draft new measures on writing off bad loans
that will improve the efficiency of capital flow in state banks and
channel funds to where they can be used best, the report said.
	   The country is in the midst of an effort to turn its debt-ridden
state companies that have long survived on easy credit from
government banks into corporations that can compete on world
markets. Millions of excess workers in the huge state sector are
being laid off.
	   Analysts estimate that about 40 percent of China's state
companies are unprofitable.
	   Enterprises should improve technology, step up quality control
and make products that are suited to market demand, Wu said.
	   He also said managers of companies that continue to lose money
should be replaced and cautioned against hasty sales of small- and
medium-sized state enterprises.
	   Wu estimated that China's value-added industrial production will
continue to accelerate, with 9 percent growth in 1998 compared to
last year.
	   Separately, a China Daily commentary said a revision of the
nation's bankruptcy laws is needed because current measures have
not been effective in halting the slide in state sector profits.
	   Officials have written off tens of billions of yuan (billions of
dollars) in bad loans for companies without assessments or strict
supervision of the overseers, said the commentary by Li Shuguang of
the China University of Political Science and Law.
	   Government-mandated mergers of weak companies into strong
companies will likely drag profitable companies into losses and
represent a reversion back to a planned economy, Li warned in his
commentary.
	   Current measures, such allowing certain companies to write off
debt, have also encouraged companies to stay unprofitable, he
added.

Henderson deal, Padres-Blue Jays deal and anger at winter meetings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 24th graf to CORRECT Cobb's runs total to 2,245, sted

 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The New York Mets got ready to run
with Rickey Henderson and the Toronto Blue Jays traded a starting
pitcher _ no, it wasn't Roger Clemens.
	   There also was angry talk from the Houston Astros about Clemens'
trade demand, but the main topic Sunday at the winter meetings
continued to be the dlrs 105 million deal Los Angeles gave Kevin
Brown a day earlier and the increasing split between teams from big
and small markets.
	   ``People say it's monopoly money. That's wrong. When we were
kids we never had that much monopoly money,'' new Florida manager
John Boles said.
	   ``Parity is not the American way,'' countered Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson. ``The American way is to dominate somebody else.''
	   The Mets, one of the busiest teams this offseason, made another
move to improve their lineup by signing Henderson to a one-year
deal worth dlrs 2.3 million.
	   Henderson, 40 on Christmas Day, led the majors with 66 steals
last season for Oakland and is baseball's career leader in stolen
bases. The Mets, meanwhile, were last in the majors with 62 steals.
	   ``I'd say the Mets have the best team in New York now,'' he
said. ``The Yankees have carried the crown for a while, now it's
the Mets' turn to take over.''
	   In the first trade of this five-day session, the Blue Jays sent
pitcher Woody Williams to San Diego for pitcher Joey Hamilton in a
four-player deal. The Padres also get pitcher Carlos Almanzar and
outfield prospect Peter Tucci.
	   The Blue Jays got an outstanding report on Hamilton from Dave
Stewart _ the Padres' pitching coach last season and recently hired
by Toronto as an assistant general manager.
	   ``Being in the Padres organization, I knew there was a
possibility to get Joey,'' Stewart said. ``In my new job, they're
leaning on me for my input from the field, and I told them I
thought Joey would help us.''
	   Hamilton, 28, was 13-13 with a 4.27 ERA in 34 starts. Williams,
32, was 10-9 with a 4.46 ERA in 32 starts.
	   The Astros know that Clemens would help them, too. But the NL
Central champions dropped out of the pursuit for the five-time Cy
Young Award winner, though they did not go quietly.
	   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker had harsh words for Randy
and Alan Hendricks, Clemens' agents and brokers for a potential
deal.
	   ``Quite frankly, we are stunned and outraged at the demands of
the agents,'' Hunsicker said. ``The talent we would have to
potentially give up would leave us with a team that Roger Clemens
would not want to play for.''
	   Clemens wants to play for either a contender or a team near his
Houston home.
	   ``They are free to make their own decision,'' Blue Jays GM Gord
Ash said of the Astros. ``There are other teams we can still make a
deal with.''
	   Randy Hendricks called Astros owner Drayton McLane on Saturday
and proposed that if Houston wanted to acquire Clemens, it extend
his contract for one year at dlrs 25 million, which would leave him
with what amounts to a new dlrs 41 million, three-year contract.
	   ``The Astros front office is jealous of the fact that I've been
dealing directly with their owner,'' Hendricks said, ``so they took
the opportunity to call a news conference to try to trash me
because their feelings were hurt, that they weren't part of the
loop. Their owner has already called me and apologized for their
unacceptable conduct.''
	   At least the Astros were able to be involved in the Clemens'
talks. Some teams were never in that position.
	   In all, more than dlrs 1 billion has been spent on this year's
free-agent class. Six of the richest clubs _ Anaheim, Arizona,
Baltimore, Los Angeles and the New York Yankees and Mets _ have
shelled out dlrs 718 million for only 26 players.
	   ``It's a big paradox,'' said Montreal manager Felipe Alou, who
chose to remain with baseball's most frugal club rather than move
to the Dodgers. ``A number of players made more money last season
than our entire payroll.''
	   The Yankees remain in contention for Clemens, as do the Texas
Rangers, who met with the Blue Jays on Sunday night.
	   ``I think it would be depressing to go to spring training
knowing you had no chance to win your division and the goal was not
to finish last,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I'm very
fortunate to be with a team that is willing to spend money.''
	   Henderson ranks sixth on the runs list with 2,014, with Ty Cobb
leading at 2,245. He is much closer to the walks record with a
total of 1,890, trailing leader Babe Ruth (2,056).
	   Despite batting a career-low .236 last season for Oakland, he
led the AL with 118 walks and increased his career steals total to
1,297.
	   Henderson scored 101 runs, had a .376 on-base percentage, hit 14
home runs and drove in 57 runs for the Athletics in his fourth
stint with the team. He also has played for the New York Yankees
(1985-1989), Toronto, San Diego and Anaheim.

Locked out NBA players hear cheers again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ There were NBA players like Kenny Anderson,
Chris Mills and Eddie Jones. There was a clock, referees, slam
dunks, fancy passes and best of all, fans.
	   But this was no NBA game.
	   Sunday's action at Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus was for
fun and to raise money for the Chris Mills Foundation.
	   About 2,000 fans _ a mix of families with young children,
teen-agers and older folks who probably couldn't afford NBA ticket
prices _ shelled out dlrs 10 and dlrs 25 to watch the locked out
pros put on a show.
	   ``It was just for the fans,'' said Anderson of the Boston
Celtics. ``This was not a structured game, so you really don't get
too much accomplished. It's really for the cause and that's a
plus.''
	   How unlike an NBA game was it?
	   Cedric Ceballos of the Dallas Mavericks chatted on a cell phone
from the bench during the game. Several players wore diamond stud
earrings (no jewelry allowed in pro games), smiled at impressive
plays and waved at fans in the middle of the action.
	   Some fans yelled, ``Defense,'' but, of course, there wasn't any.
	   ``Guys aren't going to go hard out there because they don't
really want to get hurt,'' Jones said. ``We got too much at risk.''
	   The Mid Valley team, including Mills of the New York Knicks,
Tracy Murray of the Washington Wizards, Charles O'Bannon of the
Detroit Pistons and NBA rookie Paul Pierce, defeated the NBA
All-Stars 128-119.
	   Although he was advertised as a participant, Shaquille O'Neal
didn't show. Signs at the ticket windows advised fans he wouldn't
be here.
	   Several players were just happy to be in front of a crowd. Their
daily pickup games around Los Angeles don't attract more than a
curious few.
	   ``It feels good to get out there and entertain some people,''
Murray said. ``That's the only thing that drives me. We're taking
this game for granted. It's a fun game and I miss playing it.''
	   The rosters were heavy with players who have local ties, either
through their pro teams or colleges. Among others playing were
Brent Barry, Darrick Martin, Jalen Rose, Lamond Murray, Bryon
Russell, Pooh Richardson, Stacey Augmon, Derek Fisher and Jack
Haley.
	   Tracy Murray expressed impatience with negotiations to end the
lockout. Talks broke off Saturday after only 30 minutes.
	   ``The owners and David Stern need to start acting like
businessmen and get in there and negotiate,'' he said. ``Just
because things don't go right in the first half-hour doesn't
necessarily mean that we can't get anywhere. Lock the door, get
something done.''
	   Augmon agreed that a lock-in might end the lockout.
	   ``We need to maybe spend the night in there and get the season
going,'' he said.
	   Jones, of the Lakers, easily received the loudest cheers.
Familiar chants of ``Edd-ie, Edd-ie'' rang out as he dunked with
abandon. But he doesn't see the fans rushing out to NBA games if
the season ever gets going.
	   ``I definitely think they're going to get back at us,'' he said.
``They're going to support a charity event, of course, but you're
talking about an NBA game where people are paying actual money
that's going into somebody's pocket. I don't think they're going to
support that at all.''
	   Russell of the Utah Jazz is ready to forget this season.
	   ``I hope it ain't a season,'' he said. ``What's the use of
starting halfway? If they're going to do something, they need to do
it now. But it doesn't look like it. People can go make money
overseas.''
	   Like many of his collegues, Russell suggested a compromise is in
order.
	   ``I'm just disappointed to see grown men fighting. There's got
to be some point where somebody's got to give,'' he said. ``We
don't want to give. They don't want to give, so we'll never play.''
	   Proceeds will be shared with three local charities to provide
holiday toys for disadvantaged children, a foundation spokeswoman

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Three local children drowned Monday at
a New South Wales beach just hours after a tourist official called
for a surf safety awareness program targeting international
tourists.
	   The children were from a church group in western Sydney, on an
outing at Cellito beach south of the mid-north coast town of
Forster, some 135 miles (220 km) north of Sydney.
	   The accident happened when six children were caught in a rip
tide after being swept off a sandbar by a wave.
	   An ambulance spokesman said a rescue helicopter airlifted a
12-year-old child to Manning Base hospital in Taree in serious but
stable condition.
	   The other two other children were uninjured, the ambulance
spokesman said.
	   Meanwhile, Tourism Task Force chairman John Brown said Australia
had a duty of care to its visitors and it was the joint
responsibility of governments and the tourism industry to educate
travelers about surf safety.
	   ``Many foreign tourists arrive in Australia with little or no
experience in surf and get themselves and their rescuers in
trouble,'' Brown said.
	   An elderly Russian tourist on an outing with a tour group at
Bondi Beach drowned after being swept up in a rip about 200 feet
(60 meters) from the shoreline on Saturday afternoon.
	   The man, in his sixties, had been swimming outside the flagged
safety zone, where beach life savers patrol the waters. Areas
beyond the flags could have rip tides, undertows, and other
hazards.
	   On Friday a young South Korean man died in what lifesavers
described as a freak accident in knee-depth water at Bronte Beach.
	   Three men were dragged under the surface and two of them
resurfaced quickly but were unable to locate their friend.
