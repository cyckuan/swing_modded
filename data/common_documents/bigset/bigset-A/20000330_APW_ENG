<HEADLINE> Avalanche 3, Oilers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Eric Messier scored his first goal in 34 games and
Joe Sakic extended his point streak to a career-high 14 games with
a pair of assists as the Colorado Avalanche beat the Edmonton
Oliers 3-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Avalanche moved six points ahead of the Oilers
in the Northwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque got his seventh goal since being acquired from
Boston and Alex Tanguay added a goal in his first game after
missing six with a strained neck for Colorado, 10-2-1 in March.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic has 16 goals and 11 assists in his last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Weight had a goal and an assist and Alexander Selivanov got
his second goal in as many games for the Oilers, 3-3-0 in six
games. Tommy Salo stopped 17 shots before being replaced by Bill
Ranford at the start of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton appeared to have the division race in control on Feb.
29 when the Oilers built a six-point lead. Since then, the Oilers
are 4-10-1 while the Avalanche have gone 10-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Although outshot 10-9, the Oilers dominated play in the opening
period, but trailed 1-0. Edmonton failed to convert two quality
scoring chances, first when Patrick Roy, who had 20 saves in
recording his 442 win, smothered a shot off a faceoff by Ryan Smyth
midway through the period and then when he made a stick save on
Weight on a 3-on-2 break.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque got his 17th goal with two seconds left in the period
and Colorado on its second power play. Sakic set up the play with a
pass just inside the blue line and Bourque deflected a slap shot
off Edmonton left wing Ethan Moreau and past a diving Salo.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche extended its lead to 3-0 in the second period on
goals by Messier and Tanguay. Messier sent a blast over Salo's
right shoulder from the left point at 6:33.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic set up Tanguay's 15th goal at 16:58. After having the puck
poked away, Sakic skated it down and fed Tanguay with a cross-ice
pass to the lower left circle. Tanguay rammed the puck into an open
net.
</P>
<P>
   Two third-period goals on the power play got the Oilers within
3-2. Selivanov converted a pass from Weight at 6:21 then Weight
sent a wrist shot past Roy's glove at 10:23.

<HEADLINE> NBC To Invest in WWF Football  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- How badly does NBC want football?
</P>
<P>
   The network has struck a deal to broadcast games from the World
Wrestling Federation's new ''extreme'' football league and take a
50 percent stake in the XFL venture.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Wednesday comes after NBC lost the
rights to broadcast NFL games two years ago, then tried and failed
to start a separate league with Turner Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will broadcast XFL games on Saturday evenings, leading into
''Saturday Night Live,'' in the latest bid by a major broadcaster
to capture the ever-elusive young male audience that advertisers
covet so badly.
</P>
<P>
   While the new league may not be considered genuine football by
purists, NBC is hoping that teaming up with the marketing prowess
of the WWF will win back the viewers that have flocked to
''Smackdown!'' on UPN and ''Raw is War'' on USA.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Vince McMahon, we're getting the best marketer in
America,'' said Dick Ebersol, the head of NBC sports. ''We're very
interested in riding the success wave of the WWFE.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies insist that the eight-team XFL will be a real
sport, not entertainment programming like WWF wrestling, where
chair-smashing, outrageous antics and bizarre story lines are the
preferred tools for luring in viewers.
</P>
<P>
   There will be several changes to traditional football to soup up
the game, however, including eliminating the ''fair catch'' rule,
shortening half-time to 10 minutes, and placing microphones in
huddles, in locker rooms and on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, NBC is taking a 50 percent stake in XFL
for an undisclosed amount and will separately pay $30 million to
acquire a 3 percent stake in the WWFE.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marks a break from traditional sports broadcasting
deals, under which networks place bids for the rights to show
games. Prices for those rights have escalated sharply in recent
years, leading NBC to opt out of the $18 billion deal the NFL
negotiated two years ago with the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors originally balked at the idea of the XFL when McMahon
announced it in early February, put off by the estimated
development costs of about $100 million. McMahon, in typicaly
brusque fashion, quipped that Wall Street could kiss him where the
sun didn't shine. The company's stock fell 25 percent that day.
</P>
<P>
   This time, with a major media company in as a 50-50 partner, the
reception to the XFL project was far more friendly. WWF shares got
a boost and Merrill Lynch analyst Seth Weber, who downgraded WWF
stock in February, called the NBC deal ''good for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But several doubts about the project remain. There have been
numerous efforts in the past, all of them unsuccessful, to launch a
new football league to rival the NFL. NBC itself flirted with the
idea in 1998 with Turner Broadcasting as a potential partner.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also looked into the idea after losing the NFL contract six
years ago, but found the proposition too risky because of high
costs, cold weather and difficultly in attracting top talent.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Pilson, who oversaw CBS's sports operations at the time and
now heads his own consulting firm, said he remains ''skeptical''
about the XFL plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand what NBC is trying to achieve. I appreciate the
power of their promotional ability, and what you may have here is a
test of whether promotion can create demand,'' Pilson said. ''I
guess we're going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC and WWF officials say they expect to find enough talent from
college players and amateurs to fill their ranks. They pointed to
Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner, who started as a grocery stocker, as an
example of the kind of talent pool that could be available.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are thousands and thousands of players in America who
want to and can play professional football,'' said Ebersol. ''We
don't expect problems finding players.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue had no comment on the XFL.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tobacco Co. Faces $1.05B Payout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- U.S. Tobacco Co., the nation's largest snuff
tobacco company, will have to pay $1.05 billion to its top rival
after a federal jury ruled it had violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   After a monthlong trial, the jury deliberated for almost four
hours on Tuesday before setting damages at $350 million against
Greenwich, Conn.-based U.S. Tobacco. Under federal antitrust laws,
the damages were automatically tripled.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Tobacco said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Conwood Co., based in Memphis, Tenn., had sought $500 million
when it filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court two years ago. It
holds about 13 percent of the snuff market with its top-selling
Kodiak brand.
</P>
<P>
   Conwood alleged that U.S. Tobacco, which controls about 79
percent of the smokeless tobacco market with such products as
Copenhagen and Skoal, used illegal tactics to monopolize an
industry in which profit margins are as high as 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies accused each other of removing display racks from
stores, making under-the-table cash rebates to win retailers and
holding strategy sessions to plot out how to eliminate the other
from the lucrative retail-checkout market.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors found that U.S. Tobacco monopolized the market by
controlling prices or excluding competition or both.
</P>
<P>
   Snuff users place a pinch of shredded tobacco between their lip
and gum. They tend to be young and middle-aged white males.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the nation's smokeless tobacco is grown in western
Kentucky, where the trial took place. Conwood has a plant in
Bowling Green, and U.S. Tobacco has one in Hopkinsville.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are extremely disappointed by the jury's verdict,'' Vincent
A. Gierer Jr., chairman and chief executive of U.S. Tobacco, said
in a prepared statement. ''We believe that the plaintiff failed to
prove its case under applicable law, especially in light of the
voluminous evidence which clearly shows that U.S. Tobacco and
Conwood compete in a highly competitive marketplace. We also
believe that the size of the award was completely unjustified given
the evidence presented at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   David Simpson, Conwood's general counsel, would not comment
other than to issue a statement confirming the verdict. The company
issued a statement Wednesday saying, ''The jury's findings were
fully and completely supported by the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Conwood attorneys accused U.S. Tobacco of spreading rumors that
Conwood's snuff contained stems and was stale. Conwood also alleged
that U.S. Tobacco controlled point-of-sale advertising and often
inserted its ads over Conwood's own sales displays in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Point-of-sale advertising is vital to the tobacco industry
because of heavy state and federal limitations on media
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for U.S. Tobacco did not deny trying to control the
market but said the company's practices failed to meet the litmus
test of antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the company argued that exclusionary rack
practices were not illegal under other parts of antitrust law and
some allegations merely constituted ordinary business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Experts testified that Conwood made $1 billion in profits during
the 1990s and U.S. Tobacco earned more than $5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Schering-Plough Recalling Inhalers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Schering-Plough Corp. is recalling some of its
prescription asthma drugs because they may not work.
</P>
<P>
   The recall announced Wednesday includes the Proventil and
Warrick brands of inhalation aerosols, generic albuterol inhalers,
and various doses of Vanceril inhalers made from Sept. 30 1997 to
Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that because of manufacturing problems it
identified last year some of the inhalers may not contain any
active medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma patients who are using their Proventil or Warrick brand
of albuterol inhalers with good results do not need to replace
them, regardless of when they were made, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough refused to say how many drugs its was recalling.
</P>
<P>
   The company had $124 million in sales of Vanceril last year in
the United States and $251 million in sales of Proventil. Vanceril
wholesales for roughly $50 per prescription. Proventil wholesales
for about $31 per prescription. Retail prices range 20 percent to
30 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with Proventil or Warrick brands of inhalers that have
never been used and are covered by the recall should return them to
their pharmacies. Patients with affected Vanceril inhalers covered
by the recall also should return them to their pharmacies, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The recall was ordered in conjunction with the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recall, shares of Schering-Plough rose $1.25 to
$36.06\. The company also Wednesday said it had completed a $1
billion share buyback and was starting a new $1.5 billion share
repurchase program.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, patients can call the company at
1-800-621-9760.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Role as OPEC Leader Seen  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- OPEC's latest meeting has confirmed
Venezuela's higher profile in the oil cartel: its oil minister was
named OPEC president and the group approved a Venezuelan proposal
to use frequent output changes to counter price instability.
</P>
<P>
   But Venezuela's share of OPEC's agreed output hike -- about
125,000 barrels a day -- may not be enough to rescue the South
American nation's faltering economy. And President Hugo Chavez is
being criticized by some oil experts who say he's courting Arab oil
producers at the expense of petroleum investment at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are your real partners OPEC or are they the partners that are
investing money with you?'' asked Luis Giusti, former president of
Venezuela's state oil monopoly, Petroleos de Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries and a top supplier of oil to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez was a key negotiator in
helping bring about Wednesday's agreement in Vienna, Austria,
raising oil output to rein in the prices that have reached
nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   After Iran reversed a decision not to raise output, the cartel
is now likely to increase production by around 1.7 million barrels
a day. Taking into account non-OPEC member Mexico's decision to
increase production -- and the probability of continued cheating on
quotas by major producers -- the total increase is likely to reach
the 2 million barrels a day sought by the United States and other
oil-importing nations who have seen a steep runup in gasoline and
heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna gathering appears to have sealed Venezuela's new
international oil policy stressing cooperation with OPEC. Rodriguez
was elected president of the cartel for one year in a move some
said was an attempt to reward Venezuela for reversing its
long-standing position as OPEC's perennial quota buster.
</P>
<P>
   The Chavez administration's decision to reduce output, honor
quotas and persuade other major producers to do the same was partly
behind the recent tripling of world oil prices from near historic
lows a little over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said OPEC had unanimously agreed to Venezuela's
proposal for an informal system of frequent output changes to keep
prices within a set range. He did not give any indication of what
the floor and ceiling of that range might be.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as the present administration is concerned, I would say
this (the Vienna meeting) is a big success for them,'' said Andres
Sosa Pietri, another former president of Petroleos de Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa also said the emphasis on cooperation with OPEC can be
no substitute for expanding Venezuela's production capacity beyond
its current 3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   He called Venezuela's share of the output hike ''window dressing
as far the economy here is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, he said, must capitalize on its comparative
advantages: the largest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere,
relatively low extraction costs and proximity to the United States,
which purchases most of Venezuela's oil.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's economy shrank by more than 7 percent last year,
partly because the country cut back on drilling and investment to
meet its OPEC export limit.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who tried to overthrow
Venezuela's elected government in 1992, has underscored Venezuela's
independence from Washington -- though the South American nation of
23 million people is still considered a moderate within OPEC.

<HEADLINE> College Considers Outdoor Smoking  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Penn State University students weighed
in Wednesday on whether their campus should be tobacco-free, both
indoors and out.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State banned smoking indoors in 1992. On Wednesday,
students voted on whether to ban it outdoors as well -- and they
rejected the idea, barely.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum failed 1,743-1,482. Undergraduate Student
Government representatives were surprised the vote was so close.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon,'' said Matt
Roan, a 20-year-old junior from Ardmore who was elected USG
president on the same ballot. He voted against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The issue isn't second-hand smoke, but the outdoor litter
problem that has grown since indoor smoking was banned. The school
now spends $150,000 annually paying landscapers who pick up butts
and empty outdoor ashtrays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our landscapers keep (the campus) in a pristine condition. The
only sore spot we've got is this cigarette litter,'' said Paul
Ruskin of the Penn State campus maintenance office.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a campuswide ban was broached by student government
leaders following a meeting with school officials last December.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also drew impassioned opposition from many students.
</P>
<P>
   ''I implore all that value their freedom, both smokers and
nonsmokers, to have their voices heard on this,'' one student, Rick
Sollman, wrote in Wednesday's issue of the Daily Collegian
newspaper. ''Today, send the university a message. Tell them that
you are fed up with the attitude that they are our parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students questioned whether the university would be able
to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   At least one school already has such a policy: Harding
University in Searcy, Ark., has long barred the ''use or possession
of tobacco'' among students.
</P>
<P>
   Many other schools are smoke-free inside.

<HEADLINE> Parents, religious group upset by student lecture series onhomosexuality  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- David Nosanchuk loved a good debate to stir
things up. The student-organized lecture series started at Ithaca
High School in his memory has certainly accomplished that this
year.
</P>
<P>
   School officials this week received two petitions signed by more
than 400 people upset with this year's topic, ''Being Gay in
America.'' On Monday and Tuesday, small groups of protesters even
picketed the high school.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Susan Strauss said there were no protesters Wednesday
as the weeklong lecture series continued with a debate on gays in
the military and a critical discussion of Vermont's proposed law to
allow ''civil unions'' between gay couples by Jamiel Terry, the son
of Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry.
</P>
<P>
   It is the 16th year for the lecture series, which was started in
1984 in honor of Nosanchuk, who was senior class president when he
accidentally drowned. Strauss said Nosanchuk was known for his
passion for wanting to explore different perspectives on debated
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the series is designed by a volunteer student
committee that solicits input on topics of interest from other
students. In the past, topics have included the military draft,
AIDS, genetics, civil liberties, the impact of advertising, gender
roles and Latin American affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most controversial thing that's come up. I'm sure
that in past years that some of the others have caused controversy,
just not to this extent,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean and David Owens presented school officials with a petition
Monday containing the signatures of 300 parents. The petition said
only that the signers were opposed to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The Owenses said there should have been discussion with parents
to make sure there was a balance of opinions in the series and that
students understood that they did not have to attend the lectures.
</P>
<P>
   The Owenses have no children presently attending the school,
although they have three children who are graduates and one
daughter who will enter the school next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss said the series clearly offers various viewpoints and
has never been mandatory for students.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people did not take the time to learn about the
preparation and the process. They just reacted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 140 people signed a petition from the Family
Alliance for Cultural Tolerance, a group composed of members from
several area churches. Among their objections, the religious
coalition said it was upset over the ''lack of tolerance of views
and values of many parents, students and taxpayers.''

<HEADLINE> Driver Hurt in Four-Horse Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Harness driver George Brennan
received stitches in his face Wednesday night after being involved
in a four-horse spill during the third race at the Meadowlands
Racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan cut his face and was disoriented after being sent to the
ground when his horse, Kittyhawk, fell in a chain reaction that
started after another horse fell.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated at Hackensack Medical Center. Track spokeswoman
Amy Silver said he would be released Wednesday night. She
attributed his disorientation to the shock of the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trauma of the accident just had him a little confused
right when he went down,'' she said. ''He's conscious and he's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers Luc Ouellette, Ron Pierce and David Miller were also
involved in the accident, which started when Ouellette's horse,
Mega Laugh, threw a shoe and fell.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his pacer, Picasso's Filly, fell, causing Brennan and
Kittyhawk to fall, followed by Pierce and Ah Rumba.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan was the most seriously hurt. Pierce slightly injured his
left heel, while Miller and Ouellette had some scrapes and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four pacers, only Picasso's Filly had a slightly injured
hind leg, which was not considered serious. The other horses were
scraped and bruised.

<HEADLINE> House Stands by Navy Accord  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to stand by
President Clinton's plan to provide $40 million for economic,
health and environmental aid to people who live near the Navy's
firing range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   By a 232-183 vote, lawmakers rejected legislation by Reps.
Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., and James Hansen, R-Utah, that would have in
effect scuttled a compromise over the controversial site where the
Navy has practiced bombing and shelling for decades.
</P>
<P>
   After an errant bomb killed a civilian security guard and
injured four others in April, protesters moved onto the bombing
range, forcing the Navy to suspend its exercises. Navy officials
say training there is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Under a January agreement between Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov.
Pedro Rossello, the $40 million in aid will be provided and
exercises at Vieques would resume, though only with inert bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there would be a referendum -- probably next year --
in which local residents could choose between the resumption of
training with live bombs and exercises with dummy bombs until a
Navy withdrawal in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's amendment would have required the resumption of
training with live ammunition before the aid could be provided. In
addition, Clinton would have to first certify that all protesters
had left the site, and the aid could not be used to pay for the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remarkably, a group of people engaged in civil disobedience
have occupied a critical military installation with no reaction
from the administration,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the provision would unravel the entire agreement
and worsen the chances that Vieques residents would approve a
resumption of full use of the target range.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can stand here and beat our chest,'' said Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., adding, ''If we take the $40 million out, there won't be any
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The $40 million was included in a wide-ranging $13 billion
spending bill the House was expected to approve on Thursday. Fowler
tried attaching her provision to the same measure.

<HEADLINE> Leaders can't agree on where the center of the universe is  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- While they did not pass a state budget this
week, as they are supposed to do under the state constitution, the
two top figures in the state Legislature did address a
philosophical question.
</P>
<P>
   As in: Where is the center of the state?
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver accused Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno of being fixated on his district and local
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Bruno ... thinks this state revolves around places
like Troy and Schenectady and Saratoga,'' Democrat Silver said.
''The reality is, the economic activity which drives this state
happens to be located in downtown Manhattan. A lot of the school
districts are funded as a result of what takes place down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver happens to represent a district located in downtown
Manhattan which includes Wall Street. Republican Bruno is from
upstate Rensselaer County, which includes Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Verbal sparring between Silver and Bruno usually begins this
time of year as the legislative leaders begin rounding into form so
they can throw the real rhetorical haymakers when state budget
negotiations get hot and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver's jab was a little sharper than usual.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it suggests that upstate-downstate frictions are
never far below the surface in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   For another, it hints at some legislators' views of Bruno's
benevolence to his constituents, especially since he became
majority leader in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno has been a tireless advocate for the 43rd Senatorial
District and for the nearby city of Albany, where many of his
constituents work for the state.
</P>
<P>
   He has made sure hundreds of state jobs have been relocated to
Troy, the biggest city in his district. He championed a state
bailout package to bring Troy back from the brink of bankruptcy. He
has provided state grants and other aid programs to encourage
companies to locate or expand in his district. He has aided
colleges, promoted cultural facilities, even championed a boost in
the size of purses offered for thoroughbreds running at the nearby
Saratoga Race Course, which he likes to attend each August.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller ways, Bruno has seen to it that scores of community
groups have benefitted from ''member item'' grants that Legislature
hands out.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Bruno has taken care of the 43rd Senatorial District
in a way that powerful legislators have done since legislative
bodies first formed political blocs and elected representatives to
watch out for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, acquiring the ability to produce for their districts is
one of the chief reasons that legislators strive for jobs like the
majority leader's -- that and the higher stipend, bigger staff,
feeling of power, state car, access to state aircraft, control over
patronage jobs and all the other things that go with being a
legislative leader in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Silver says he wants to deliver a gem of a project
to Manhattan in the form of a Second Avenue subway line. It would
pass through the speaker's 62nd Assembly District.
</P>
<P>
   Silver suggested he will hold up passage of a new state budget
if it does not contain a commitment to build the subway project.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's promotion of the subway had Bruno questioning where the
speaker believes the center of his world is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really laugh when I heard him talk about Troy when he is out
there, literally saying, 'I'm holding up the budget because I want
$13 billion for a Second Avenue subway which terminates in my
district,''' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno insists he is taking Silver's comments in stride as part
of Albany's time-honored spirit of political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just flailing around and saying things,'' Bruno said.
''One day he calls me this, another day he calls me that. I know
Shelly well enough to know he doesn't mean any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, by the way, is in no way apologizing for any of the
things his position as majority leader has helped produce for his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very proud of what we've done in our district,'' he said.
''I'm going to continue to advocate for things in my district, just
as he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's colleagues are well aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   When Troy Mayor Mark Pattison appeared before the Senate's
Cities Committee on Feb. 29 to ask for more state aid, chairman
Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, told the mayor, ''You don't
have any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Troy is one big member item,'' the senator said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 108, Grizzlies 99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Kobe Bryant scored 28 points
to help the Los Angeles Lakers reach the 60-win plateau for the
second time in three seasons, pounding the Vancouver Grizzlies
108-99 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Lakers a 60-12 record and a magic number of
five to clinch home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. It
also was the second-fastest the Lakers have recorded 60 wins,
trailing only the 1971-72 team, which won 69 games.
</P>
<P>
   All five Lakers starters scored in double figures, but it was
Bryant who set the pace. He hit 7-of-10 from the field in the first
half, and ended with four steals and six rebounds to lead Los
Angeles to its 26th win in 27 outings.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal added 19 points and had eight assists,
improving his average of 3.7 assists per contest.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson had 32 to lead Vancouver, which lost for the
14th time in 15 decisions. Teammate Shareef Abdur-Rahim added 30
points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies stayed with Los Angeles early, hitting seven of
their first 10 field goal attempts and finishing the first quarter
trailing 31-30 on 71 percent shooting. However, the Lakers' defense
stymied Vancouver in the second period as the visitors took a 60-46
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the 16th in the last 17 road contests for the
Lakers, who increased their Pacific Division lead to eight games
over idle Portland.
</P>
<P>
Notes: A.C. Green of the Lakers increased his consecutive games
played mark to 1,100. ...The win marked the 56th time in 72 games
the Lakers have held their opponent to under 100 points. ... Rick
Fox got the start at small forward for Los Angeles in place of Glen
Rice, who remained home with the stomach flu. ... With the crowd of
16,780 well short of capacity at GM Place, the Lakers had a 27-game
road sellout streak broken.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates found
their fifth
starters, forcing Mark Portugal and Pete Schourek to look for new
jobs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days after announcing that Portugal was their fifth
starter, the Reds changed their minds and released him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates did the same to Pete Schourek, who thought he had
earned the No. 5 spot in Pittsburgh's rotation with a strong outing
a day before.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face stunned Portugal, rotation replacement Rob Bell
and a clubhouse full of teammates who thought the pitching staff
was set. Portugal's rough outing on Tuesday prompted general
manager Jim Bowden to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bewildered is probably the best word I can come up with,''
right-hander Pete Harnisch said. ''Shocked is probably another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal had a 4.50 ERA when Bowden announced that he'd won the
fifth starter's job. His Tuesday outing raised it to 6.00, still
the second-lowest in a rotation that has struggled this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't really get into some of the reasons, but I just
think the timing of it's kind of weird,'' Portugal said.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Schourek was no longer the pitcher who won 18
games for Cincinnati in 1995, the Pirates released Schourek and
gave rookie left-hander Jimmy Anderson the job.
</P>
<P>
   Only one day earlier, Schourek -- who is guaranteed $2 million --
seemed to have secured a spot in the rotation by limiting a
Minnesota split squad to two runs in six innings, his best start
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident I can pitch,'' said Schourek, 4-7 with a 5.34
ERA last season. ''They told me it was a numbers game. The $2
million apparently didn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Kevin McClatchy gave general manager Cam Bonifay
permission to eat Schourek's contract if he and manager Gene Lamont
felt the Pirates were better with Anderson in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Their spring numbers were nearly identical. Schourek was 2-1
with a 5.40 ERA and eight strikeouts in 20 innings and Anderson was
3-1 with a 5.17 ERA and nine strikeouts in 15 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not real worried about the baseball side of it,'' Schourek
said. ''I thought I threw well this spring and worked out some
things I had problems with last season. I think I'll have a
productive season for somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Mark McGwire was removed with stiffness in his
back in the third inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' 3-1 win over
the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was replaced by a pinch-runner after drawing a walk in
the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just said he felt achy all over and couldn't get loose,''
manager Tony La Russa said. ''He could have scored in the first
inning, but he said he just couldn't run well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder J.D. Drew was hit on his right pinkie by a pitch from
Scott Strickland in the sixth inning. His status was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll know more in the morning,'' La Russa said. ''He seems to
be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:

</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Gary Sheffield hit a pair of home runs,

<HEADLINE> Sanders Repays Part of Signing Bonus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Barry Sanders has repaid the Detroit Lions
$83,333, the balance of his prorated 1999 signing bonus, his agent
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders received an $11 million signing bonus when he signed a
six-year contract in 1997. He played two years before startling the
NFL by leaving football on the eve of last summer's training camp,
just 1,458 yards shy of breaking Walter Payton's NFL career record
of 16,726.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Sam Kagel ruled Feb. 15 that Sanders must repay
one-sixth of the bonus for each year he fails to play under terms
of the 1997 contract, or $1.833 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Schmidt, the Lions' chief operating officer, said at the
time of Kagel's ruling that the club already had withheld $1.75
million of the signing bonus from the check sent to Sanders for
last season. The $83,333 payment Sanders made means the issue of
the 1999 bonus has been settled, the player's agent, David Ware,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders would owe the Lions $1.833 million this year if he does
not report to training camp in July, and Ware said he wouldn't
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how they could fit him in. They've got a running
back,'' Ware said, referring to former Jacksonville running back
James Stewart, signed Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Messages were left Wednesday at the home and office of Lions
spokesman Bill Keenist.

<HEADLINE> Third Child in Train Collision Dies  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNGA, Ga. (AP) -- A deadly train crash that ripped a school bus
off its wheels claimed a third victim Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Pritchett, 9, one of seven students on board the bus when
it was struck at an unprotected rural crossing early Tuesday, died
Wednesday night a spokeswoman for T.C. Thompson Children's Hospital
in Chattanooga, Tenn., said.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla Silvers, 6, and Daniel Pack, 9, were killed when the CSX
freight train smashed into their Murray County school bus at about
50 mph, ripped the bus from its chassis and dragged it 100 feet
down the track.
</P>
<P>
   Four other children and the driver were seriously injured. Two
children remained in critical condition Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes joined hundreds of people on the lawn at the
Murray County courthouse Wednesday night in Chatsworth for a
candlelight vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is to cherish them. You never know how much
you'll miss them till they're gone,'' said David Silvers, Kayla's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he planned to review Georgia laws governing
stoplights and gates at railroad crossings.
</P>
<P>
   School officials rerouted the buses Wednesday to avoid driving
over the railroad crossing where the crash happened. At the site,
eight yellow ribbons were tied to the railroad crossing signs.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board urged
schools around the nation to investigate whether their buses use
railroad crossings that lack lights or signals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very concerned and personally do not believe that any
grade crossing in the United States should be crossed with a school
bus of our children when that crossing does not have lights or
signals,'' NTSB chairman Jim Hall said.

<HEADLINE> As oil prices climb, Long Islanders look to the sun  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- A plan by the Long Island Power Authority
to get solar energy panels installed on 10,000 rooftops in the next
decade is winning praise from at least one longtime nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory
Panel, conceded that his watchdog group has been critical of LIPA
in the past, but said Wednesday he enthusiastically endorsed the
solar energy effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, it's interesting that we're doing this now when
there is a crisis regarding fossil fuel prices,'' he said. ''The
price of sunlight is still free. ... We will not have to rely on
OPEC or anyone else to tap into this resource.''
</P>
<P>
   The LIPA effort is part of the national ''Million Solar Roofs''
initiative that President Clinton began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be the center, the capital, of solar energy in New
York state and one of the places in the nation that can be a model
for this new technology,'' said Richard Kessel, chairman of LIPA.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great opportunity to emphasize renewable
technologies,'' he said. ''The more renewable technologies we can
initiate, the more solar roofs we have on Long Island, the fewer
power plants we have to build, the fewer emissions we have to
poison our environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The solar panels are actually a collection of photovoltaic
cells, made of a semiconductor material -- usually silicon -- that
produce an electric current when exposed to light. The cells can be
created in various sizes and shapes to meet the power requirements
of a specific building.
</P>
<P>
   LIPA officials said the cost of installing solar panels to
create enough electricity for a typical house is between $10,000
and $12,000. LIPA provides low-interest financing and other
discounts and the state offers a partial tax credit to defray
installation costs.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also required by law to buy back any unused
electricity created by the solar panels, LIPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its solar energy promotion, LIPA held a lottery last
year and picked 30 homes from a pool of 5,000 entries to receive
free solar panel systems.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Saul, a homemaker and mother of two from Melville, was
among the winners and has had no complaints since the system was
installed in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really haven't had any problems,'' she said. ''People say
they don't look bad, some people say they look like skylights on
the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul's home was installed with only two panels -- not enough to
power her entire split-level ranch -- but enough to provide her with
an anticipated $120 in annual savings on her electric bill, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think solar energy is an alternate source that we should
definitely take advantage of,'' said Bruce McCauley, a retired
junior high school teacher from East Setauket who also won the LIPA
lottery. He said the cost of the panels will have to come down
before solar energy gains wider acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of like the first computers that came out,'' Raacke
said. ''Prices are still very high because there's still a very
small market. These things are still being assembled by hand. ...
Once that market gets going, mass production is going to bring down
prices considerably. That's when the broad public is going see it
installed on their rooftops.''

Iran, Mexico To Boost Oil Output
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- After first refusing to join its OPEC colleagues in
an agreement to increase oil production, Iran reversed course Wednesday, saying
it will pump more to keep other producers from taking away its market share.
Mexico, one of the leading oil producers not in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, also plans to increase output. At a White House news
conference today, President Clinton said the OPEC agreement should reduce both
home heating costs and gasoline prices over the next few weeks.

Judge Rules Clinton Violated Privacy

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resurrecting an impeachment controversy, a federal judge
ruled Wednesday that President Clinton ''committed a criminal violation of the
Privacy Act'' by releasing personal letters to undermine the credibility of one
of his accusers. Clinton immediately disputed the decision, saying he
reluctantly released the letters two years ago because ''it was the only way I
knew to refute allegations'' by Kathleen Willey of an unwanted sexual advance.
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a Republican appointee, concluded the
president and three top White House lawyers disregarded an earlier court ruling
in making Willey's letters public in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in
1998.

Israel Wants Withdrawal Safeguard

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel wants international intervention to ensure a quiet
border in case its withdrawal from Lebanon is done without an agreement with
Syria, Foreign Minister David Levy said Wednesday. Israel TV reported that
Israel agreed to a U.S. request to delay a campaign to enlist international
support for three weeks, apparently to avoid alienating Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon, in last-ditch efforts to renew peace talks. A summit Sunday
in Geneva between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to
bring about a resumption of the peace talks, stalled since January.

Bush Keeps Focus on Education

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush, reaching out to women and political

for abortion rights wouldn't necessarily disqualify any potential running mate.
Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, toured a charter school that
he said showed how his proposal for alternatives to failing schools could work.
New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, mentioned by some as a possible vice
presidential choice, accompanied him. While saying he had not made any running
mate lists, Bush spoke warmly of Whitman when reporters asked about her chances,
even though he opposes abortion and she favors abortion rights.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Allan Houston led a balanced attack with 19
points and Marcus Camby added 18 points and a career-high 19
rebounds Wednesday as the New York Knicks rolled to a 110-95
victory over the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks dealt the Sonics their fifth straight homecourt loss,
which equaled the third-longest home losing streak in Sonics
history. The Sonics had not lost five straight home games since
December 1968, their second year in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell surpassed the 10,000 point mark in his career
when he stole the ball and drove half the court for a layup and a
102-82 Knicks lead with 4:15 left. He has 10,001 points in his
career after finishing with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton led the Sonics with 21 points. Reserve Rashard Lewis
added 18.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Sonics two games behind the Sacramento
Kings in the loss column in the race for seventh place in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks pounded the Sonics 57-30 on the boards. Camby was
8-for-13 from the field as New York dominated Seattle inside,
outscoring the Sonics 44-32 in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was hounded all night by the Knicks defense. He was
8-for-22 from the field and had 10 assists and three steals. Vin
Baker had 15 points for the Sonics, but only four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's 3-point play trimmed the Knicks' lead to 75-69. The
Knicks closed the quarter with a 9-2 run led by Camby's five points
for an 84-71 lead after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle trimmed the deficit to 71-66, but then failed to score
on four consecutive possessions as Shammond Williams missed three
straight perimeter shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took a 67-54 lead with 7:40 left in the third period
when Vin Baker inadvertently tapped in Larry Johnson's miss while
trying to rebound the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing scored 13 of his 17 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   After Brent Barry's 3-point play trimmed the deficit to 48-46,
Houston scored five of the Knicks' eight straight points for a
56-46 lead. New York led 59-49 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Horace Grant, who was hurt breaking up a fight between
Payton and Vernon Maxwell during practice Sunday, wore a padded
wrap on the top of his left shoulder. ...Ward, who averages 7.5
points per game, had 11 in the opening quarter on 4-for-4 shooting.
...Williams scored a career-best 24 points against the Knicks on
Jan. 24. He couldn't find the range this time, missing all five of
his shots against the Knicks.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton sues RNC for libel  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton says he has no problem
with Republicans calling him bad names -- but ''murderer'' should
not be on that list.
</P>
<P>
   The activist minister filed a $30 million libel lawsuit
Wednesday against the Republican National Committee and its
chairman, Jim Nicholson. Sharpton claims the GOP libeled him by
saying he had incited riots and protests that led to deaths in
Crown Heights in 1991 and Harlem in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton was himself sued for slander for accusations he made in
the Tawana Brawley case years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a right to call me names, they have no right to
accuse me of a crime,'' Sharpton said outside RNC headquarters in
Washington, where he announced the filing of a lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Washington. ''To accuse me of murder is
slander.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans stepped up their attacks on Sharpton after Democrats
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al Gore met privately with him as they
courted black voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said Wednesday that he stands by his statement,
published in the Washington Post on March 11 as a letter to the
editor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Sharpton is no civil rights leader. He is a hatemonger, an
anti-Semite and a racist, and for him to be a political partner of
Al Gore and Hillary Clinton ... is shameful,'' the RNC leader said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sharpton set off four nights of rock and bottle throwing
attacks on Jewish homes culminating in a mob surrounding a young
Talmudic scholar Yankel Rosenbaum and stabbing him to death,''
Nicholson wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is familiar with the libel law. Steven Pagones, a
former Dutchess County prosecutor, sued Sharpton, Alton Maddox and
C. Vernon Mason for naming him as one of Brawley's attackers in
1987. A grand jury determined that the teen had fabricated her
claims that she was abducted and raped by a group of white men.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-month trial, a jury in Poughkeepsie in 1998
ordered Sharpton to pay Pagones $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Wednesday he has not paid Pagones because the
verdict is still being appealed. But he said he might use parts of
Pagones' case against him as a precedent for his own case.
</P>
<P>
   ''So in many ways Steve Pagones may end up a good thing for
me,'' Sharpton said, adding that he could use any money won from
the RNC to pay off Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones said Wednesday that Sharpton should drop his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Sharpton should have learned anything it's that truth is an
absolute defense,'' he said. ''I don't think the RNC said anything
that was inaccurate or false.''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman backs harsher penalties for violations  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The focus in this year's presidential race on
reforming campaign finance laws should convince Congress that the
least it can do is enforce the laws that already exist, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman told fellow lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn, the Connecticut Democrat
is pushing legislation that would make some violations of the
Federal Election Campaign Act felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, violations of the campaign act are misdemeanors. The
bill would also create guidelines for federal judges to sentence
defendants convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are trying to do is provide prosecutors in really
egregious situations -- not run-of-the-mill situations -- with the
tools to do something,'' Thompson told the Senate Committee on
Rules and Administration Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign finance violation would only be a felony if it was
committed knowingly and willfully and the offense involved at least
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is targeted at someone who is more or less in the
business,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, introduced in November, grew out of both senators'
frustration with the outcome of investigations into fund-raising
practices in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those investigations focused on people who had allegedly infused
foreign money into a political campaign or used unwitting straw
donors to hide the true source of money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all of us believed that the people who did those
things in 1996 would be prosecuted and appropriately punished,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, only three of the 12 people who were convicted or
pleaded guilty in those scandals received jail time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic fund-raiser John Huang received fines, community
service and probation after pleading guilty to conspiracy. Huang
brought in $1.6 million in questionable donations that were later
returned.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's friend, Yah Lin ''Charlie'' Trie, was
sentenced to a few months of home detention followed by probation
after pleading guilty to causing others to make false statements to
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Huang, Trie and others were convicted or pleaded
guilty doesn't eliminate the need to make illegal fund-raising a
felony itself, with its own punishment, Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's because when it comes time for sentencing, judges have
to turn to the federal sentencing guidelines, which still often
bring light sentences because there is no guideline on campaign
finance violations,'' Lieberman said.

Report: Women and minorities underrepresented on state boards

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A report from the Secretary of the State
shows women and minorities continue to be underrepresented on
Connecticut boards and commissions.
</P>
<P>
   More than half such panels lack any appointed minority members,
Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of boards and commissions reported no
Hispanic members. White women showed some progress in increasing
their membership on the boards, but women overall remain
underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   ''Progress toward diversity has been uneven at best,'' Bysiewicz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Betancourt, executive director of the Latino and Puerto
Rican Affairs Commission, said he was deeply disappointed by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot conceive of a democratic system that is
disproportionately excluding an important sector of the population
from participating in the development of policies that affect us
all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Dickens, commissioner of the African-American Affairs
Commission, also expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously there is an underrepresentation of African Americans
on state boards,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, who is responsible for some of the
appointments, has a staff member whose job is to recruit people for
such boards, said spokesman Dean Pagani.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a situation the governor takes very seriously,'' Pagani
said. ''The governor agrees that more appointments of women and
minorities have to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not provide specifics of appointments by the
governor and legislative leaders. Pagani said he did not have
statistics either and could not say whether Rowland would take
additional measures in light of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the report reflects the need for more progress,''
Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen, D-Stamford, said he
tries to ensure diversity in making appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially on the more important commissions, I certainly try
to ensure there is female and minority participation,'' Jepsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report covers 1,997 appointed members of 203 state boards,
commissions, committees and councils. The bodies have a wide range
of functions including agriculture, state colleges, economic
development, Indian affairs, mental health and special education.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bodies have regulatory authority and quasi-judicial
functions.
</P>
<P>
   A little over 34 percent of appointed members of the boards were
women; about 51 percent of the state population is female. Blacks
make up 8.8 percent of the population but 6.6 percent of the
appointed members; about 8.5 percent of the population is Hispanic,
but they account for only 2.7 percent of the appointees, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Legislature required appointing authorities to make
a good faith effort to ensure the appointments reflect the gender
and racial diversity of the state, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Including members appointed to boards by virtue of an office
they hold, female appointments increased from 27.7 percent in 1993
to 33.7 percent in 1999, according to the report. But that progress
was limited to white females, according to Leslie Brett, executive
director of the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need all of our voices in state government,'' Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic representation, including ex-officio members, was 2.5
percent in 1999, an improvement over 1.5 percent in 1993 but down
from 3.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not attempt to explain why the inequities exist.
It does note that many positions are unpaid, and that the posts
often have specific membership requirements which significantly
limit the pool of eligible appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Bysiewicz said the legislature should review whether the 1993
law is working. She also suggested posting vacancies on the
Internet because the public is often unaware of the openings.

<HEADLINE> Bill to revise law banning campfires sent to governor  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Doug Krofina couldn't imagine a camping
trip without a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   So he breathed a sigh of relief when the Legislature voted
Wednesday to revise a law that inadvertently banned all open fires,
including ones for roasting marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campfire is a focal point for scouts; you sing songs,
strengthen friendships,'' said Krofina, an executive for the
Connecticut Yankee Council of the Boy Scouts of America in the New
Haven area. ''It would have been devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved unanimously in both chambers, amends a law
designed to protect air quality and ban unsafe burning. The law was
passed last session and took effect Oct. 1, but it was months
before anyone realized its unintentional result.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting groups and campground owners flooded the Legislature
with calls and letters, saying the law would destroy their
activities. They asked for changes before the onset of warm weather
and the height of camping season.
</P>
<P>
   Violators faced fines up to $25,000 per day from the state
Department of Environmental Protection for polluting the air. But
DEP officials had said the law would be nearly impossible to
enforce and unlikely affect any Scout leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Legislature acted quickly to revise the law. The
Senate moved it to the top of the agenda Wednesday and the House
acted on it soon after.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sent to Gov. John G. Rowland, who was expected to
sign it into law today. The measure would take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never any intention on the part of the Legislature
to interfere with scouting or camping,'' said state Sen. Eileen
Daily, a Westbrook Democrat who sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the thing we really wanted to react to immediately,''
said state Rep. Patricia Widlitz, D-Guilford, who raised the bill
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The law also came under fire from farmers, who were prohibited
from burning brush and required instead to dispose of it in wood
chippers or at transfer stations -- both costly and time-consuming
options.
</P>
<P>
   Fire marshals complained because the law required them to issue
all burning permits. Many municipalities had relied on local
burning officials to handle the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill scouts, campers and school groups would be able
to hold campfires and bonfires without permits as long as they are
conducted safely.
</P>
<P>
   Fire marshals would still have to issue permits for commercial
burning, such as at landfills, but municipalities could appoint
local officials to approve fires by farmers and homeowners.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker pulls amendment to derail mall  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Legislative opponents to the proposed New
Haven mall say they will now look to the courts to block the
construction project.
</P>
<P>
   After about 45 minutes of debate Wednesday in the House, Rep.
James Amann yanked an amendment intended to repeal $28 million in
state funding for the Galleria at Long Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris DePino, R-New Haven, who has rallied legislative
support for the mall, said he was confident the measure would have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Amann said he withdrew the amendment after consulting with
lawyers for Westfield America, the corporate owner of malls in
Milford, Trumbull, Meriden and Enfield. Westfield has argued that a
mall in New Haven will suck too much money from their shopping
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Amann said it was ''premature'' to push the amendment with about
a dozen court cases pending against the mall construction project.
Most of the lawsuits are being paid for by Westfield.
</P>
<P>
   Amann and other anti-mall lawmakers said they won't hesitate
bringing out another amendment to stop the project.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Moira Lyons, D-Stamford, said she won't allow
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not bringing it up again,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge ruled last week that the state Office of
Policy and Management cannot issue it's final approval for the
project until he decides whether there should be a new public
hearing on the proposed mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't take a victory in the Legislature, it's just as
sweet to have a victory in the courts,'' Amann said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the state's Freedom of Information Commission last week
said New Haven failed to disclose documents concerning the project.
</P>
<P>
   A measure to repeal the state funding for the mall failed in the
House last year on a 89-59 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the $500 million dollar mall say it will create
about 3,000 construction jobs and generate more tax dollars for the
state and greater New Haven economies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Galleria will give people a chance to work,'' said Rep.
John Martinez, D-New Haven. '' It's an opportunity we must not play
around with. We can't offer people hope and then try to take it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mall opponents say it will hurt business in downtown New Haven
and surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also argue that the mall, which is to be built near
the intersection of Interstates 95 and 91, will create traffic and
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will end downtown New Haven as a vibrant economic
center,'' Amann said. ''We should not be using tax dollars to
benefit one community at the expense of another.''

<HEADLINE> Pat Buchanan campaigns in Connecticut for Reform Party bid  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, the front-runner for the
Reform Party's presidential nomination, says he hopes to follow
Arizona Sen. John McCain's lead in attracting voters to a maverick
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, best known as the conservative co-host of CNN's
''Crossfire'' show, left the Republican Party last year to seek the
Reform Party's nomination. The party founded by Ross Perot has been
plagued by infighting in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in Trumbull Wednesday, Buchanan
said he thinks he can win the party's nomination and go on to mount
a credible campaign to create a competitive three-way race for the
presidency with the Democrats and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our objective, quite frankly, is to win the presidency of the
United States,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes the Reform Party's problems were largely
resolved this week when a federal judge upheld the chairmanship of
Pat Choate, Ross Perot's 1996 presidential running mate. The ruling
ended a tug-of-war that had weakened the party's standing in the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who visited Connecticut as part of a four-day campaign
swing through New England, said he would emphasize the
''re-industrialization'' of America by opposing what he called
unfair trade agreements with China and Mexico that have sent
American jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he thought he would have wide appeal in
Connecticut and other states where McCain won primaries by running
as a non-establishment candidate. But he acknowledged that his
reputation as a conservative would probably not translate well
among some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a liberal Republican and you're doing very well,
you're probably not going to vote for Pat Buchanan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan left the GOP last year after party leaders gave their
early endorsement to Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was scheduled to attend a $100-per-person fund-raisier
in Stratford Wednesday night at Knapp's Landing restaurant.

<HEADLINE> Alaska by Snowmobile an Adventure  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- As an experienced snowmobiler, 79-year-old
Edgar Hetteen didn't give it much thought when he hopped off his
machine and broke through the crusted Alaska snow.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept sinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had stepped off and stepped into this bottomless quagmire. I
was in up to my armpits and I had not reached bottom yet,'' Hetteen
recalled Wednesday. A fellow traveler hauled him out, and he
resumed his 900-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   Hetteen and nine companions spent eight days this month
retracing the route he took 40 years ago in an effort to save his
young company, which was making the first modern snowmobile. The
trip helped transform winter travel in northern climates.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people Hetteen met on the first trip were still
living in the Alaskan wilderness when he returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty years ago, we saw dozens and dozens of dog teams hauling
supplies and people,'' he said. ''This time there was only one dog
team in evidence and I believe that was for recreational purposes
only.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I saw was the people taking their children to school on
the snowmobile, bigger children driving their own machines,
machines going down the river hauling supplies,'' Hetteen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was less work, more production per hour. That was a
highly gratifying thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, when Hetteen and three companions made their first trip
from Bethel to Fairbanks, their early snowmobiles were the first
mechanical surface transportation ever to cross anywhere in the
state of Alaska. Hetteen made that trip to prove the snow machines
worked and save Polaris, the company he co-founded.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hetteen left Polaris years ago, he convinced the
company -- now the world's largest manufacturer of snowmobiles -- to
retrace the trip that proved the snowmobile was more than just a
goofy machine.
</P>
<P>
   This time, David Johnson, 77, Hetteen's brother-in-law and the
inventor of the early snowmobile, also made the trip. Polaris used
the adventure to officially launch its new marketing campaign, and
chief executive Tom Tiller made the trek.
</P>
<P>
   Tiller said he was overwhelmed by the hospitality of the Alaskan
people, who met the group as they arrived in each of the small
villages, fed them and gave them a place to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They treated us like celebrities,'' he said. ''We went into
the schools and talked to the kids about safety in snowmobiling and
afterward they would get our autographs for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children had never seen a snowmobile helmet, Hetteen
said. Polaris is sending helmets to each school the group visited.
</P>
<P>
   People also were curious about how the two elderly men would
fare during the long trip. Very well, thank you, said Hetteen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel any different at the completion of this trip
physically than I did at the end of the trip 40 years ago,'' he
said. ''I had a supply of Tums, Mylanta and Pepsid AC with me. I
forgot to use any of them on the whole trip.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sharpton, Haitian-Americans press Justice for NYPD monitor  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angry at the shooting of another unarmed black
man by New York City police, the Rev. Al Sharpton and leaders of
the Haitian-American community called on members of Congress to put
pressure on the Justice Department to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many people have to die before the federal government
comes in and protects the lives of the citizens of the city of New
York?'' Sharpton asked at a meeting at the Capitol on Wednesday
with more than a dozen members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The group is calling for the Justice Department to speed up its
probe of the New York Police Department, launched more than two
years ago after the brutal attack by police on Abner Louima in the
bathroom of a Brooklyn station house. In the interim, it wants an
emergency federal monitor to oversee the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   The call for federal action comes after the March 16 shooting of
Patrick Dorismond, the fourth fatal shooting of an unarmed black
man by officers in the city in 13 months. Dorismond was shot after
a scuffle with cops who approached the 26-year-old off-duty
security guard outside a Manhattan bar asking if he knew where to
buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city has practically declared war on our community,'' said
Vladimir Rodney, an attorney with the Brooklyn-based
Haitian-American Alliance. Louima is also Haitian-American.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting came amid heightened tensions between
police and minorities in the wake of the acquittal of four officers
who killed unarmed West African immigrant Amadou Diallo in a hail
of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 law allows the Justice Department to sue over an alleged
pattern of civil rights violations by a police department. The
Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Brooklyn are currently in negotiations with the Giuliani
administration over the findings of their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Louima's lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein, said the time lapsed
has made clear ''that these negotiations have not been
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the Justice Department task force to move to the next
step,'' Rubenstein said. If negotiations fail, the Justice
Department can file a lawsuit against a municipality, forcing it to
change police patterns and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Such a lawsuit was recently filed against Columbus, Ohio, after
the city and the police refused to cooperate. The Justice
Department accused police in Columbus of roughing up citizens and
falsely arresting people who witnessed police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the two other cities where the Justice Department has
intervened -- Steubenville, Ohio and Pittsburgh -- consent agreements
have been reached. The cities promised to correct problems in the
training, supervision and discipline of officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gregory Meeks, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus'
task force on police brutality, said Wednesday he would write to
the Justice Department demanding it send in a monitor to oversee
the NYPD and release its findings on the NYPD. The findings of the
Justice probe have been kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, D-Queens, said he also wanted a meeting with Attorney
General Janet Reno. After the Diallo verdict, Sharpton, Meeks and
others met with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, Reno's top
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is considering whether to file federal
civil rights charges against the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Kara Peterman said she could not
comment on the probe into the NYPD but said any requests or views
from members of Congress would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately return a phone
call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Hoteliers Kicking Sand  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE MAY, N.J. (AP) -- At the Heritage Inn, a beach tag is one of
the amenities. It comes with the room, just like the color TV, the
refrigerator and daily maid service.
</P>
<P>
   The tag costs owner Barbara Bednar $13, but she provides one to
every hotel guest. When a guest checks out, the tag is passed to
another guest so that they, too, can use the beaches at the
southern tip of New Jersey without buying a tag.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true at the Marquis de Lafayette Hotel, the
Avondale-by-the-Sea and dozens of other hotels, motels and
bed-and-breakfast inns here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always gave them to our guests,'' says George Loper,
president of the Cape May Hotel and Motel Association. ''It was the
one thing they got free. It gave them a friendlier feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city wants to charge businesses or their out-of-town
guests more money to use the beaches. And, like any break with
tradition in this picturesque Victorian-themed seaside resort, the
proposal is ruffling some feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are not going to be happy when they hear this,'' said
Herb Weiner, who runs the 46-united Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to fill a $100,000 to $200,000 budget gap for
guarding, cleaning and maintaining beaches, city officials
announced in January that they would begin enforcing a little-known
provision of the 1977 ordinance governing beach tags -- to wit: that
the tags are non-transferable.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Mayor Jerry Gaffney says, was to make beachgoers pay
their fair share for upkeep of the beaches, which costs the city
more than $1 million a year and has run at a deficit for the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the beachgoers are out-of-town visitors, and
many of them get beach tags for free when they rent a room, Gaffney
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it fair that you and I buy a tag and use it 10 or 20 times
a year but a hotel buys one and turns it over 100 times?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without some new revenue source, the deficit in the beach fund
would be made up with money from the general fund, he said. If that
happened, full-time residents would, in effect, be paying twice to
bail out beaches that out-of-town visitors are using, Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged hotel and motel owners said enforcing the ban on
transferred tags would force them to stop giving them to guests.
Some hotels include the promise of free beach tags in their
pamphlets and don't want to have to renege.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent $4,000 a year on beach tags. If they make them
non-transferable or raise the price too much, it would be
cost-prohibitive for me,'' said Tracy Holder, general manager of
the Marquis de Lafayette Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The ruckus sent city officials back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they want to establish a special class of tag for
businesses and rewrite the ordinance to make all tags transferable.
The ''commercial tag,'' for any buyer who rents rooms out, would
cost between $18 and $25 and would be transferable.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May residents would still be able to share their tags with
relatives, visitors or other guests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't care if you have 27 cousins and 16 uncles,'' said the
mayor. ''But if you rent three or four rooms out, that's a
different story.''

<HEADLINE> Needle, Syringe Alternatives Sought  </HEADLINE>
By CLIFF EDWARDS, AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Doctors and engineers soon hope to take the
''ouch'' out of vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Devices that can deliver drugs into the skin at the speed of a
supersonic jet, controlled-release microchips and foods genetically
modified to carry medicine were just a few of the approaches being
discussed at a gathering of scientists as alternatives to the
needle and syringe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't people like needles? Very simply, it hurts -- and
people don't like what hurts,'' said Mark Prausnitz, a chemical
engineering professor from the Georgia Institute of Technology.
''The needle's been around for quite a while, but we believe there
are ways of achieving better drug delivery and getting across the
various barriers in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz worked five years with electrical engineer Mark Allen
to develop a prototype device, which looks like a nicotine patch,
of 400 silicon-based microscopic needles, each no wider than a
human hair.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, hollow needles are so small, the researchers say, that
medication can be delivered through the skin without reaching nerve
cells that register pain. Microelectronics within also could
control the time and dosage of the medicine delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of the device in delivering insulin found it significantly
reduced blood sugar levels in diabetic rats, Prausnitz said this
week at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The race to develop alternatives comes amid concern about the
danger of used needles transmitting diseases to health care workers
and their patients. The researchers also noted that youngsters can
develop an aversion to needles after receiving 12 to 19 childhood
vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the devices discussed at the three-day conference are
undergoing human testing but are at least two years away from
coming to market.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the hypospray seen on television's ''Star
Trek'' in the 1960s, PowderJect Pharmaceuticals of Fremont, Calif.,
is testing a device that uses pressurized helium to launch dry
powder medicines through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Another device is an electronic inhaler that would deliver
dosages of tiny liquid particles to the bloodstream by way of the
mouth and small airways.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also are turning to genetically engineered food. More
than 25 papers were expected to be presented on the benefits of
modifying plants and foods to deliver drugs or pack a more
nutritional punch.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say ''molecular farming'' could prove a safe,
cost-effective way of administering vaccines.

<HEADLINE> Beta Blockers May Up Diabetes Risk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A new study confirms that the widely prescribed
blood pressure pills called beta blockers can modestly increase the
risk of diabetes. But the research clears another important variety
of hypertension medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The study published in today's issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine also found that people with high blood pressure are 2{
times more likely to develop adult-onset diabetes -- what doctors
call Type 2 or non-insulin-dependent diabetes -- than are those with
normal blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Like some earlier research, this study found that the risk of
diabetes is 28 percent greater among patients who get beta blockers
than among those whose high blood pressure is left untreated.
However, in contrast to smaller studies, this one found no sign
that thiazide diuretics contribute to diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found no link between diabetes and two other
major classes of blood pressure medicines -- ACE inhibitors and
calcium-channel blockers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, involving 12,550 adults ages 45 to 64, was conducted
by Dr. Todd Gress and others from Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said they do not recommend abandoning beta blockers,
since these drugs are proven to lower the risk of heart disease.
But they said physicians need to monitor their patients carefully
for diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the National Institutes of Health and
the American Heart Association.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Offers Organ Donor Incentives  </HEADLINE>
By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pennsylvania is modifying a novel plan to
offer $300 to the families of organ donors, saying the money can
only cover incidental costs such as food, housing and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   A governor's advisory committee last fall recommended offering
the money for funeral costs in hopes of encouraging organ
donations, because demand for transplants is surging.
</P>
<P>
   But amid concerns the plan amounted to an illegal cash payment
for organs, Health Secretary Robert Zimmerman said he was modifying
the program to cover only incidental costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to look at this in terms of the end rather than the
means,'' Zimmerman told members of the advisory committee
Wednesday. ''The end is to promote and support and provide benefits
to people who make difficult decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1984 federal law prohibits payments or other considerations
for organs and tissue. The law exempts ''reasonable payments'' for
incidental costs associated with recovering and transporting the
organ, but it does not specifically mention funeral expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's three-year pilot program, the first of its kind
in the nation, could begin as early as September after the advisory
committee works out details. Many states, including New York and
Hawaii, have said they will be watching to see if it is worth
pursuing on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Pennsylvania advisory committee said the
program's attempts to comply with laws against organ buying made it
confusing. And other skeptics wondered whether the modest payment
offer would increase donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably legal but it doesn't make a lot of sense,'' said
George Annas, who writes on health law for the New England Journal
of Medicine. ''I can't imagine that throwing in transportation
costs would make a difference.''

<HEADLINE> Atrial Fibrillation Drug Lauded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The drug Cordarone is twice as effective as two
other widely prescribed medicines at treating atrial fibrillation,
a common heart flutter, researchers reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 million Americans are estimated to have atrial
fibrillation, a condition in which the two small upper chambers of
the heart quiver instead of beating effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley was
treated for the condition during his campaign. Its major hazard is
an increased risk of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine, Canadian
doctors found Cordarone holds a ''striking'' advantage over two
other rhythm-protecting medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Denis Roy and others from the Montreal Heart Institute
tested low doses of Cordarone, which is also known as amiodarone,
against the drugs sotalol and propafenone in 403 patients. After 16
months of follow-up, atrial fibrillation had recurred in one-third
getting Cordarone, compared with two-thirds getting the other
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that our results challenge the notion that
amiodarone should be used only in patients whose conditions are
resistant to other drugs,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the Medical Research Council of
Canada. Cordarone is made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Sotalol,
also called Betapace, is made by Berlex Laboratories, while
propafenone, or Rhythmol, is made by Knoll Pharmaceutical Co.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Gephardt Changes Ballot Name  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT CHARTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Mind the name-calling in this race.
</P>
<P>
   It's Gebhardt vs. Gephardt in a Missouri congressional primary
that has House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt accusing Republicans
of dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-term St. Louis congressman, whose name is Richard A.
Gephardt, drew a Democratic primary challenge on the last day of
filing from Richard A. Gebhardt, a 65-year-old political newcomer
from St. Peters near Gephardt's home base of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Gephardt, who hopes to become speaker of the House
if the Democrats regain control, to submit paperwork changing his
ballot name to ''Richard A. (Dick) Gephardt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the name by which I have been known since childhood.
Furthermore, I wish to avoid any confusion caused by others who
wish to mislead and confuse voters,'' Gephardt wrote on his
name-change paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Gebhardt on Monday entered the race for the
Democratic nomination in the Second District. But he switched the
next day to the Third District, giving Gephardt his only opposition
in the Aug. 8 primary. Residency in a congressional district is not
a requirement to run.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday why he changed races, Gebhardt said he would
rather file against Gephardt ''than the people over in the
Second.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt wouldn't answer other questions, saying he hadn't slept
much in weeks and was grieving about two recent deaths in his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Goodbye, have a nice day,'' he told a reporter. ''I'm not
trying to be cute, I'm just trying to get my wits back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and other Missouri Democrats said Gebhardt appeared to
be better known to Republicans than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   GOP activists said Gebhardt often attended Republican meetings
in St. Charles County, and the publisher of a GOP publication said
Gebhardt requested his mailing address be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have faith in the democratic process and think that the
voters will see through the Republicans' dirty tricks,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Republican Party chairwoman Ann Wagner denied the state
GOP engineered Gebhardt's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never spoken with or met or heard of Richard A.
Gebhardt,'' Wagner said. ''We do not file shill candidates.''

<HEADLINE> Blueberries May Get Council  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The watermelon has one. Peanuts do too. Even
the mushroom, a fungus no matter how you slice it, has a national
research and promotion board dedicated to its economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Now the blueberry may gain a national advocate of its own.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,200 blueberry producers and importers were eligible to
vote this month in a referendum on whether to create a new,
industry-funded U.S.A. Blueberry Council. Ballots were due Friday
to the Agriculture Department, which will announce the results
within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan accounts for 41 percent of the U.S. blueberry crop,
according to the North American Blueberry Council. New Jersey is
second with 22 percent, followed by Oregon with 13 percent, Georgia
with 7 percent and North Carolina and Washington with 5 percent
each.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. cultivated blueberry production was an estimated 83,300
tons in 1997, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Blueberry Growers Association and the New Jersey
Blueberry Industry Advisory Council have endorsed creating a
national council.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel there's a whole world out there that may not know the
blueberry story, the health benefits of blueberries,'' said Art
Galletta, a co-owner of Atlantic Blueberry Company in Hammonton,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He cited recent research that indicates eating blueberries may
improve short-term memory, restore coordination and fight a variety
of health problems including heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Many blueberry producers already pay voluntary dues to the North
American Blueberry Council. The national council, if approved,
would charge mandatory assessments to all domestic producers as
well as foreign producers who ship blueberries to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The new council would collect some $1.1 million a year. Its
mission, according to the agriculture department, would be to
''develop and finance an effective and coordinated program of
promotion, research and information to maintain and expand the
markets for cultivated blueberries.''
</P>
<P>
   North America is the world's leading producer of blueberries,
which is one of only three fruits native to the continent, the
others being the Concord grape and the cranberry.

   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Researchers want to know how pesticides
affect the health of Iowa farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this spring, farmers from 12 Iowa counties will be
recruited for medical tests -- such as providing urine samples -- to
help University of Iowa researchers measure their exposure to
pesticides. The farmers' spouses and children may be asked to
provide samples as well.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, who will be paid for their participation, also will be
asked to show researchers how they handle and apply pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the generous cooperation of some local farm families, we
may be able to learn more about how pesticide exposure occurs and
what we can do to prevent it,'' said Steve Reynolds, associate
professor of occupational and environmental health.
</P>
<P>
   The study was created to expand on the Agricultural Health Study
now being conducted in North Carolina and Iowa. More than 50,000 of
the 90,000 or so participants live in Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Schumer says OPEC action may not be enough to lower gas prices  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If crude oil prices don't fall in the next few
weeks, says Sen. Charles Schumer, he'll call for the United States
to dip into its strategic oil reserves to help accomplish that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer warned on Wednesday that oil-producing nations' release
of more crude oil may not be enough to bring down gas prices this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no time for celebration. I don't think we've done the
job yet,'' Schumer, D-N.Y., said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he would wait a few weeks to see how the market
reacts to Tuesday's announcement by The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries that it would increase production by 6.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Spot prices for oil dropped a dollar to $26.17 a barrel
Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, declining from a
high of $34 a few weeks ago in anticipation of the OPEC production
increases. U.S. officials expected crude prices to continue
dropping, perhaps by as much as $2.50 a barrel by August, and said
they expected gasoline prices to follow the price decline.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said crude prices should ideally dip to between $20 and
$25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   He has for months urged the Clinton administration to dip into
the oil reserves, citing concerns over the high costs of heating
oil in New York. Forty-three percent of New York households use oil
for heat -- more than any other state. Prices skyrocketed over the
winter as OPEC cut down on production and cold weather blanketed
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, have introduced
legislation to make it easier to access oil in the reserves. The
Clinton administration has been reluctant to use the reserves,
saying they are intended for emergencies, not price controls.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC agreed Tuesday to increase production by 1.7 million
barrels a day and other producers were expected to expand
production as well to fill a 2-million-barrel-a-day shortfall that
has tripled crude prices in the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, normally a close ally of the president, has been highly
critical of what he sees as the administration's slow action on the
oil-price issue. He said he first contacted the White House and
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in September.

<HEADLINE> Soc. Security Mistakes Common  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Memo to taxpayers: Double-check the Social
Security numbers on those income tax forms. And don't forget the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants and the Internal Revenue Service say mistaken or
missing Social Security numbers are the most common errors people
make, even more likely for taxpayers who are rushing to meet this
year's April 17 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Warren, a tax accounting instructor at Millsaps College
in Jackson, Miss., and Richard Davis, an accounting professor at
Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa., are both former IRS
officials who have compiled lists of the top mistakes and myths
encountered by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Their No. 1 myth: People believe that tax law is an exact
science with yes-or-no answers to every question.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tax law is subject to interpretation based on factual
situations,'' Warren said. ''Always establish the facts first and
then ask the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   To the IRS, Social Security numbers are the coin of the realm --
they establish a taxpayer's identity and those of any dependents.
Taxpayers often transpose numbers or forget to let the Social
Security Administration know when a woman marries and changes her
name, which can lead to a computer mismatch that raises a red flag
at the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   People also frequently fail to put a child's Social Security
number on the forms, which is needed to claim a dependent
exemption, a child care credit or the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, out of roughly 125 million returns, the IRS got
nearly 1.7 million with a Social Security mistake. ''That's the top
math error we see,'' agency spokesman Don Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS will notify taxpayers about the mistake and allow it to
be corrected over the phone, but it can slow down a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Other frequent tax errors:
</P>
<P>
   --Making math miscalculations, particularly among lower-income
people who claim the complicated earned income tax credit. For
taxpayers who are not using a computer or a tax professional, Davis
and Warren say careful double-checking of the math is essential.
</P>
<P>
   --Forgetting to sign and date the tax return. If a joint return
is being filed, both spouses must sign even if one had no income to
report.
</P>
<P>
   --Failing to attach all the proper paperwork, such as a W-2 form.
</P>
<P>
   --Reporting income in the wrong place. For example, many people
report earnings from money market funds as interest when the IRS
can consider them a dividend. ''The IRS computer will think that
you underreported your income in the amount of the missing
dividends -- and you will be receiving unwanted mail,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   --Unnecessarily declaring a state tax refund from last year as
income. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   People also believe a number of myths about tax law and what
happens when they file their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, people frequently delay filing a tax return past
the April deadline because they believe they must have all the
money in hand before the paperwork can go to the IRS. In fact, a
taxpayer should always file the return as soon as possible to avoid
penalties, although interest will be charged on the amount due.
</P>
<P>
   ''Willful failure to file a return is a federal crime,'' Davis
warned.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also has a number of options now for people who cannot
pay, such as payment over the telephone by credit card and easily
approved installment agreements. Sometimes taking out a loan is
better than paying IRS interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some other tax myths:
</P>
<P>
   --''People who owe zero taxes don't need to file.'' Not
necessarily, because workers who had taxes withheld from their
paychecks may be due a refund.
</P>
<P>
   --''The IRS can go back many years to audit my returns.'' The
statute of limitations is three years, unless fraud is involved.
</P>
<P>
   --''I must do whatever the IRS tells me, even if I disagree.''
Taxpayers can request a meeting with IRS managers to contest an
agent's conclusion, take their case to the Taxpayer Advocate or the
agency's appeals process. The U.S. Tax Court is another avenue for
taxpayers to bring disputes with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   --''I got a refund, so I know the IRS won't audit me.'' A refund
is not a sign that the IRS agrees with a tax return, only that the
math is correct. An audit can still occur within three years.
</P>
<P>
   --''Child support payments are tax deductible.'' Not so. Alimony
payments are, however, and the recipient has to declare them as
income.
</P>
<P>
   --''Single people living together can file a joint tax return.''
Couples must be married to file jointly. In fact, if each partner
has roughly the same income filing jointly could trigger the
''marriage penalty'' that forces them to pay higher taxes.

<HEADLINE> Soc. Security, Medicare Benefit  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security and Medicare are benefiting
from the continued strong economy, experts say, resulting in more
optimistic predictions about how long the retirement programs will
be able to support aging baby boomers before running short of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement is expected to be reflected in the annual report
of the Social Security and Medicare trustees, scheduled for release
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cliff will recede,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former head
of the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The good news could wipe out what little drive remains in
Congress to risk changing the nation's popular pension and elderly
health care programs in a hard-fought election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think politically, you will find a lot of people that don't
want big reforms to the programs will latch on to the trustees
report and say 'Aha, we don't need to do anything,''' said Robert
Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, which promotes
federal budget discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger-than-expected economic growth has added new years of
life to the retirement programs in recent years, even as lawmakers
have debated what to do about projections that they will ultimately
be overwhelmed by the huge baby boom generation -- the 77 million
Americans born between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, when Congress was trying to pass
legislation to balance the federal budget, Medicare had been
projected to run short of cash in 2001. The trustees have gradually
pushed that date back, however, and last year pegged it at 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Social Security's insolvency date has been extended
from 2029 in 1997 to 2034 in last year's trustees report. The
trustees have said that in 2014, the program will need to start
drawing on its currently accumulating trust fund when incoming
taxes are no longer sufficient to cover benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the message is that we don't need to be stampeded into
action by imminent financial collapse. We should carefully consider
in what ways the structure (of retirement programs) should be
retained and what ways it should be changed,'' said Henry Aaron, an
economist at the Brookings Institution think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Give or take a few years, however, the bottom line remains,
Reischauer said: ''Sooner or later the nation is going to have to
restructure Social Security and Medicare and the longer we wait to
take on that challenge, the more wrenching those adjustments will
have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic factors contributing to the brighter prospects for
Social Security and Medicare continued last year, including the
lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. With more Americans working,
more are also paying the payroll taxes that support the two
programs, padding their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Low inflation also saves Social Security money because yearly
cost-of-living raises to retirees are smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Medicare spending decreased slightly in 1999, by
about 1 percent -- the first decline in the program's history.
Experts attributed it to restrained inflation, cuts mandated by
Congress in 1997, and a crackdown on fraud and billing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spending is not expected to continue to fall, however,
mainly because the nation's elderly population is growing. Other
factors also could temper the optimism of the traditionally
conservative trustees, who include the secretaries of labor,
treasury and health, plus the Social Security commissioner and
private gurus.
</P>
<P>
   A private advisory panel last fall recommended, for example,
that the trustees boost their current assumptions for Americans'
increasing life expectancy. That would tend to dampen financial
forecasts because people who live longer cost retirement programs
more.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is the largest federal benefit program, sending
checks to 44 million Americans. In addition to payments to
retirees, Social Security also makes payments to disabled people
and to the survivors of workers who die young.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, which provides health coverage for 39 million elderly
and disabled Americans, already is spending money from a dwindling
trust fund to pay hospital benefits. Outpatient benefits provided
by the program are paid for separately, however, with income taxes
and participants' monthly premiums.

<HEADLINE> Counting of Indian Tribes Sought  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Confronting American Indians' historic
feelings of wariness or anger toward the federal government, the
Census Bureau is seeking help from tribal leaders and residents on
reservations to ensure they get a more accurate count of the Indian
population.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring more American Indians to ask questions and get answers
from those living on their own reservations may not completely
erase those feelings, but the Census Bureau and advocacy groups
hope it will give them a clearer picture of their population and
open better lines of communication.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Census Bureau estimates it missed about 4.5 percent
of the American Indian population; the national rate was 1.6
percent. More alarming to the National Congress of American Indians
is that an estimated 12.2 percent of all Indians living on
reservations were missed.
</P>
<P>
   On the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation that sprawls
across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, about one in eight Navajos
were not counted in 1990. And the tribe is determined not to let
that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was
that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps, and may
have been unaware of tribal customs, said Jack Jackson Jr.,
director of governmental affairs for the National Congress of
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've created an alliance with the Census Bureau where the
Navajo nation has profound control over the count, by way of hiring
our own Navajo people to go out and enumerate, and the maps for
enumeration were created by Navajo chapters,'' said Mellor Willie,
spokesman for tribal president Kelsey Begaye.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo government estimates there are about 250,000 Navajos
today. Willie said the Navajos missed out on $110 million in
federal funding in the 1990s because of the undercount.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think a lot of Navajo people within the last census
count knew this was helping in their communities,'' Willie said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, the Census Bureau sought more input from tribal
governments five years ago , said Tom Beavers, partnership
specialist for the regional census center in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we hire now, we want to hire people who live in their own
communities to work in their own communities, and we have told
Indian leaders in our communities that,'' said Beavers, himself an
American Indian, who in his job works with reservations in Oklahoma
and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tribes know how important it is to get a good census,'' he
said. He noted that the temporary census jobs also help with
unemployment rates that tend to be higher on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal programs distributed to American Indians based on census
data include the Native American Employment and Training Programs,
grants to local education agencies for Indian education, and family
violence prevention and services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some tribes are donating money to help promote the
census. The Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe gave a $30,000 grant to
the city of Mount Pleasant, Mich., for such a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Saginaw Chippewa spokesman Frank Cloutier said his reservation
suffered a 33 percent undercount in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''We attribute it to unawareness, and naturally concern with
people of having anything to do with the federal government,'' he
said. ''Now that relationship is very positive and growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has gone smoothly though. Earlier this month,
leaders on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana threatened to
arrest census workers after complaints that local census managers
failed to keep him informed of hiring decisions and other business
on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Grant, census liaison for the Blackfeet tribe, rescinded
that order and said things have worked more smoothly since then.
</P>
<P>
   Others like Brenda Boyd, census liaison for the Mille Lacs Band
of Chippewa in Onamia, Minn., complain that at times, there is too
much red tape in getting simple answers from regional census
officials.	   Everyone agrees, though, that they are better off than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''This census is much better. Last time, the count was way
off,'' Boyd said.

<HEADLINE> Elian Status Revocation Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives and the U.S.
government still at an impasse, Cuban leader Fidel Castro announced
that the 6-year-old's father is ready to travel to the United
States to retrieve him.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, meanwhile, delayed revoking Elian Gonzalez's
temporary status until Friday. Immigration officials and the boy's
great-uncle met for five hours Wednesday and planned to meet again
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's announcement came during a live television broadcast
Wednesday. He said Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''is ready to immediately''
go with a group of Elian's friends and relatives, but he added that
the trip was conditional on guarantees that the U.S. government
would turn Elian over to his father or at least make a maximum
effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time anyone has said the boy's father would be
willing to stay in the United States during the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   ''The passports are ready,'' Castro said. ''And of course the
airplane is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said Wednesday that they had not
received a visa request from the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls placed to Gonzalez's home in Cardenas, Cuba, rang
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is demanding that
Elian's Miami relatives promise in writing to hand him over if they
lose their court battle to keep him in this country. The INS had
said it would revoke the boy's temporary permission to stay in the
United States at 9 a.m. Thursday if the family did not agree, but
it moved that deadline back 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A government source, who asked not to be identified, said the
government believed an agreement could be reached with the family.
</P>
<P>
   If Elian's father comes to Miami, though, that situation could
quickly change, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presence of the father represents a change in
circumstances that would put the INS in a position to be hard
pressed not to turn over Elian to him,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been living in Miami with his great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, since he was found in November on an inner tube off the
coast of Florida. The boy's mother and 10 others died when their
boat sank while they were trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement, the INS will tell the boy's great-uncle
how and when he is to relinquish custody of Elian, said INS
spokeswoman Maria Cardona in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona would not say exactly what timetable would be given.
Officials would not say whether they would pick up Elian or ask the
uncle to deliver him somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez has said he would be willing to release Elian to
his father if Juan Miguel Gonzalez came to Florida from Cuba, but
he said he would not deliver the boy to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boy lives in my house, and they'll have to go find him
there,'' Lazaro Gonzalez told Spanish-language network Telemundo.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's meeting between the Miami relatives and the
INS got under way, the Miami relatives' lawyer, Kendall Coffey,
said: ''We are not going to sign what we consider to be a blank
check that could have a psychological effect on the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, about 1,000 people holding flashlights and
candles filled the Little Havana neighborhood around Elian's house
in a prayer vigil led by Miami religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Elian was brought outside, riding on the shoulders
of a family friend. As he smiled and waved his arms, the crowd
cheered and chanted ''Elian! Elian!''
</P>
<P>
   ''The family will stay with Elian until the last minute,''
family spokesman Armando Gutierrez told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators have talked of forming a human chain and
laying down their lives to prevent the little boy from being taken
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal authorities of INS need to understand that we are
free and this is a country of laws and we are not going to accept
their stubbornness. We are not going to allow them to take the
kid,'' said Oscar Pupo, 56, a Cuban-born U.S. citizen who was in
the neighborhood earlier in the day when about 60 trucks blocked
the streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has said it would not do anything that would traumatize
the boy. INS spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar said her agency has ''gone
to great lengths to bring about a resolution that is carried out in
a manner that creates as little disruption for Elian as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relatives have asked a federal appeals court in Atlanta
to overturn a federal judge's ruling affirming an INS decision to
send Elian back to Cuba. The court has scheduled arguments for the
week of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   --Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas announced that he will not
let the police help federal officials remove the boy from his
great-uncle's home, though police officers would help keep the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas and the mayors of 22 nearby towns warned they would hold
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno responsible for
any violence that breaks out if immigration officials try to return
the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   --In Washington, a group of U.S. lawmakers seeking to block the
deportation of the child introduced legislation to confer permanent
American residency status on Elian and nearly all his Cuban
relatives. But even supporters of the measure -- written by Sen. Bob
Smith, R-N.H. -- suggested its chances of being enacted seemed
slight.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a news conference at the White House,
said: ''I have done my best not to overly politicize this. And I
don't think we should. There is a legal process here; we ought to
let it play out.''
</P>
<P>
   --Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his Cabinet adopted a resolution
Wednesday asking the U.S. government to allow the appeals process
to continue. In a letter, Bush also urged Reno and Clinton to
instruct the INS to remove the pledge requirement.
</P>
<P>
   --ABC, meanwhile, aired footage of the boy saying he didn't want
to be sent to Cuba. On ''Good Morning America,'' Elian said in
Spanish that he didn't want his father to visit him in Miami
''because he'll take me to Cuba and I don't want to go to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would like it if his father stayed in Miami, he
answered: ''He can stay here. I don't want to go.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Dad Said Willing To Come To US  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The father of Elian Gonzalez is willing to travel
to the United States to claim his son and stay with him, while the
boy's Miami relatives continue a legal battle to keep him,
President Fidel Castro said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''is ready to immediately'' to the United
States to take custody of the 6-year-old boy, Castro said during
the surprise announcement made during a live television broadcast.
He said the trip was conditional on guarantees that the U.S.
government would turn Elian over to his father or at least make a
maximum effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''The passports are ready,'' Castro said. ''And of course the
airplane is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gonzalez's American attorney, Gregory Craig, was
seeking U.S. visas for the father and a large entourage, as well as
the guarantees the father had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that all that Gonzalez was waiting for was final
word from his attorney that the guarantees had been delivered. He
did not offer any specifics to what city the plane would fly to
initially, but said Gonzalez would wait out the court process with
his son in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout came at a crucial time -- on the eve of the U.S.
Justice Department's deadline for Elian's Miami relatives to sign
an agreement promising to give up the boy if they lose their legal
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, the Miami great-uncle Elian has been staying
with, has said he would be willing to release the boy to Gonzalez,
if the father personally came from Cuba to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently calling the great-uncle's bluff, Castro said not only
would the father go, but he would stay for the entire court
process.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez in the past has said that he would be willing to travel
to the United States to claim his boy if he could just pick him up
and come back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that anyone has said that Gonzalez was
willing to stay in the United States during the legal process. It
is also the first time that it has been said that Gonzalez is ready
to travel immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez would go with a large group of people, including his
wife, and their 6-month-old son, who is Elian's half-brother. Also
in the entourage would be Elian's first grade teacher, a dozen of
his classmates and a host of Cuban psychologists and psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the family would stay at the home of the chief
of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   He said having Elian's teacher and classmates along would allow
Elian to reinsert himself into his family and school environment
''without losing a moment of the child's readaption.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the international dispute over Elian erupted after the boy
was rescued at sea more than four months ago, Gonzalez has been
reluctant to travel to the United States to claim his child.
</P>
<P>
   He has cited concerns that he would be the subject of legal and
political attacks by anti-communist Cuban exiles who oppose Elian's
return to the island, and that his life could be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that staying at the home of Fernando Remirez de
Estenoz, the Cuban Interests Section chief, would provide the
protections that Gonzalez sought.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said he consulted with Gonzalez before making the
announcement. Phone calls placed to Gonzalez's home went
unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Blames Assad on Peace Terms  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says Israel has offered to
relinquish a ''significant'' portion of the contested Golan Heights
while Syrian President Hafez Assad is simply stonewalling on terms
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough that Assad say, ''I don't like your position''
and demand all the land Syria lost in the 1967 Middle East war,
Clinton said Wednesday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you know what the other side wants and you don't think
you can do it, then you ought to come up with some alternative way
of trying to respond to the underlying concerns that are behind the
position,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who made no headway in a three-hour meeting Sunday with
Assad in Geneva, was sympathetic to Assad's territorial demands.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, if the Syrian president disagreed with Israel's
''quite significant'' territorial proposal, ''then there should be
some other proposal, I think, coming from the Syrians about how
their concerns could be handled.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Israeli Embassy here, spokesman Mark Regev said Israel
''wants to make a deal with Syria and has presented positions to
the Americans that are designed to make the process work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's truly a pity,'' Regev said, ''that the Syrian leadership
up 'till now has not demonstrated a similarly practical approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public criticism of Assad's strategy was unusually
pointed, although he praised the Syrian leader as well as Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak as being committed to reaching a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had suggested ways for Assad to respond to
Israel's offer, but his overtures were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to have a negotiation, it takes two people
coming up with ideas, or three sides in this case,'' Clinton said,
noting the U.S. role as mediator.
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to praise Barak as wanting to resolve the
impasse in peacemaking and said, ''I think President Assad would
like to resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Israel and Syria hosted by the Clinton
administration in Shepherdstown, W.Va., broke down in mid-January.
Through back-channel diplomacy and then in the Geneva meeting,
Clinton and his advisers tried to reopen the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The failure in Geneva wound up an overseas trip in which the
president suffered several setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In South Asia, both India and Pakistan refused to reverse their
nuclear weapons programs, and Pakistan's military leaders refused
even to promise restoration of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The setbacks were then compounded when Clinton was unable to
narrow differences between Syria and Israel and get the talks
reopened.

<HEADLINE> Gov Engler Looks To Boost Influence  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michigan Gov. John Engler has a new political
action committee and has given thousands of dollars to candidates
for federal office, an indication that the Republican is trying to
boost his national profile and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Without fanfare, the Governor Engler Leadership Fund was
established last July. It collected $77,450 from 61 donors in its
first six months, with 46 contributions coming from people living
outside Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The PAC allows Engler to give up to $5,000 to a candidate --
rather than the $1,000 per election he is limited to as an
individual -- and pay for his travel for appearances for various
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Engler has donated only $4,000 from his PAC -- $1,000
each to Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush; former
Virginia Gov. George Allen, who is running for the Senate; Sen.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.; and Michigan state Sen. Mike Rogers, who
is seeking a House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Engler spokesman John Truscott said the governor is looking for
other GOP candidates to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to very carefully scrutinize where we give the
money,'' Truscott said. ''It will be in targeted races. It will be
in close races.''
</P>
<P>
   Engler, whose third and final term as governor expires in 2002,
was an early Bush supporter and is one of the Texas governor's
''Pioneers'' -- individuals who have raised $100,000 for him.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the time Bush entered the race, Engler has been
mentioned as a potential running mate or Cabinet member, and the
PAC's existence raises speculation that Engler wants to boost his
visibility to make himself more appealing to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he raises a lot of money and helps a lot of people and does
a lot of things behind the scenes, that door is always open,'' said
Ed Sarpolus of EPIC/MRA, a Lansing, Mich., polling firm. ''The
question is whether Governor Engler will get a plum position in the
Bush administration or a lemon.''
</P>
<P>
   Truscott repeated the frequent denial that Engler is looking to
join Bush's ticket or serve elsewhere in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how ardently he can say that,'' Truscott said.
''He wants to put Governor Bush in the White House because he knows
he would be a great president, not because he wants to be a Cabinet
member.''
</P>
<P>
   Many governors have created leadership funds for state
candidates, but federal PACs are rare, according to Larry Makinson,
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan group that studies money and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Other governors who have formed PACs that support federal
candidates include New York Gov. George Pataki, former Illinois
Gov. Jim Thompson and former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, all
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   David Rohde, a Michigan State University political science
professor, said leadership PACs began as fund-raising tools for
federal candidates, but are becoming more common for other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is just another way for people who want to be
players at the national level to try to have an influence on
elections and build ties to people who may want to help them later
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engler ''may or may not want to be a candidate for president or
vice president, but he sure wants to be a player on the national
level.''

Elian's Dad Said Willing To Come To U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The father of Elian Gonzalez is willing to travel to the
United States to claim his son and stay with him, while the boy's Miami
relatives continue a legal battle to keep him, President Fidel Castro said
Wednesday night. Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''is ready to go immediately'' to the
United States to take custody of the 6-year-old boy, Castro said during the
surprise announcement made during a live television broadcast. He said the trip
was conditional on guarantees that the U.S. government would turn Elian over to
his father or at least make a maximum effort to do so.

NASA Chief Takes Mars Mission Blame
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA Administrator Dan Goldin is taking the blame
for last year's botched Mars missions, saying he pushed too hard, cut too much
and made it impossible for spacecraft managers to succeed. But Goldin said he
will not abandon the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ''faster,
better, cheaper'' approach. Mission managers will get enough money and people to
do the job, but there won't be a return to the days of big, expensive
spacecraft. ''We're going to make sure they have adequate resources, but we're
not going to let the pendulum swing all the way back,'' he told employees of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate
Orbiter were managed.

Iran, Mexico To Boost Oil Output

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- After first refusing to join its OPEC colleagues in
an agreement to increase oil production, Iran reversed course Wednesday, saying
it will pump more to keep other producers from taking away its market share.
Mexico, one of the leading oil producers not in the Organization of Petroleum

home heating costs and gasoline prices over the next few weeks.

Judge Rules Clinton Violated Privacy

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resurrecting an impeachment controversy, a federal judge
ruled Wednesday that President Clinton ''committed a criminal violation of the
Privacy Act'' by releasing personal letters to undermine the credibility of one
of his accusers. Clinton immediately disputed the decision, saying he
reluctantly released the letters two years ago because ''it was the only way I
knew to refute allegations'' by Kathleen Willey of an unwanted sexual advance.
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a Republican appointee, concluded the
president and three top White House lawyers disregarded an earlier court ruling
in making Willey's letters public in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in
1998.

Israel Wants Withdrawal Safeguard

Syria, Foreign Minister David Levy said Wednesday. Israel TV reported that
Israel agreed to a U.S. request to delay a campaign to enlist international
support for three weeks, apparently to avoid alienating Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon, in last-ditch efforts to renew peace talks. A summit Sunday
in Geneva between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to

<HEADLINE> Flag Amendment Defeated in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate attempt to give the American flag
constitutional protections again fell short, with supporters
failing to move dug-in opponents who said the measure would
undercut basic free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-37 vote Wednesday was four short of the two-thirds
majority needed to amend the Constitution and almost identical to
the 63-36 vote when the Senate defeated the amendment in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the amendment, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, vowed that he would try again: ''We are not
going to quit until we win.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a large majority of Americans want Congress to be able
to punish those who desecrate the flag and that ''this place is
filled with elitism among those who are voting against the
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   But those in opposition, including four Republicans, argued that
attacks on the flag are rare and don't justify what they said would
be the first time in the nation's history that the Constitution is
changed to qualify First Amendment free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''A desecrated flag is replaceable. Desecrated rights are lost
forever to those who experience the loss,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass. He noted that among the nations that ban flag desecration
are Iraq, Iran, Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment consisted of one sentence, that ''Congress shall
have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and others argued that the amendment was needed because
the Supreme Court in 1989 struck down a Texas state flag
desecration law and the next year a law passed by Congress, both
times on the grounds that they infringed on First Amendment rights.
Both votes were 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the high court
had made a mistake. ''In my opinion flag-burning is not speech, it
is conduct of the most offensive kind.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a setback for supporters, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., one
of 14 Democrats to vote for the amendment in 1995 and a leading
constitutional scholar, on Tuesday announced to the American
Legion, primary backers of the amendment, that he was changing his
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shrink from the possibility of providing a tiny minority of
rabble-rousers with the ammunition to fire upon the most important
and beloved document in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada, another supporter in
1995, also switched his vote. Republican Sens. James Jeffords of
Vermont, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Robert Bennett of Utah
again voted against the amendment. Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I.,
voted no, following the example of his late father, Sen. John
Chafee.
</P>
<P>
   The House has approved flag desecration amendments three times
since 1995, the last by a 305-124 vote last year. Constitutional
amendments also must be ratified by three-fourths of state
legislature, which would have been a near certainty in this case
because 49 states have passed resolutions urging Congress to send
them a flag amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents pointed out that there have been 11,000 attempts to
amend the Constitution -- but only 27 -- including the 10 articles of
the Bill of Rights -- have become part of the Constitution. In
recent years Republicans have unsuccessfully pushed amendments for
a balanced budget, school prayer, term limits, line item vetoes and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The last to be ratified, in 1992, limited congressional pay
raises.

<HEADLINE> Florida's Press Worries Tar Heels  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Joseph Forte was shaking his head after
he watched some of Florida's NCAA tournament win over Duke last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just basically hugging their shorts after that
loss,'' the North Carolina freshman said, giving his impression of
the exhausted Blue Devils. Duke, the Atlantic Coast Conference
champions, beat the Tar Heels twice during the regular season, but
lost to the Gators 87-78 in the East Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Duke's a great team,'' Forte added. ''They had problems with
the press, so I know we'll have our problems with Florida as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke was one of the ACC's best at handling the ball, but turned
it over 22 times against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Blue Devils, the Tar Heels have had trouble with ball
security, piling up 110 more turnovers than their opponents. In
seven games, North Carolina has fumbled the ball away at least 19
times.
</P>
<P>
   And while North Carolina (22-13) has lowered its turnovers to an
average of 12 a game in its four NCAA wins, taking care of the
basketball against the pressing Gators in the national semifinals
Saturday night will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to go out there and try to make them pay for pressing
us, try to control the tempo of the game,'' point guard Ed Cota
said. ''If we can get them to stop pressing, then we are going to
feel that we have control of the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cota, one of only three players in NCAA history with 1,000
career assists, realizes this game might be his biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me being the point guard, I definitely need to try to control
this game,'' Cota said. ''But against Florida, where they've got 10
guys that are really good and come in with fresh legs, it is going
to take a toll on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Guthridge's biggest dilemma this week in practice has
been whether to throw as many different presses at his starters,
considering Florida goes 10 deep and North Carolina uses just six
or seven players. Cota has played 159 of a possible 160 minutes in
the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope our players are in good shape and are used to playing
35 or 40 minutes a game and can withstand all the pressure Florida
puts on us,'' said Guthridge, coaching in his second Final Four in
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because some of our guys played extended minutes, we haven't
been able to get a lot of things done in practice. I think it's
more important that they get rest and get their little aches and
pains under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Tar Heels expressed concern about Florida's ability to
strike quickly out of its press, which has forced opponents into an
average of 20 turnovers a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried about how it can really turn a game around, how
they can get two or three steals in a row, and the next thing you
know, you're down 10 points,'' North Carolina center Brendan
Haywood said.
</P>
<P>
   Forte and small forward Jason Capel will play critical roles in
helping Cota with ballhanding, while Haywood knows he and the
team's other big men must help out as midcourt outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't run away from the ball and leave (Ed) back there by
himself,'' Haywood said. ''We need to take the pressure off of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge summed up Florida's press this way: ''They make
everybody a basketball player.''

<HEADLINE> Badgers' Bryant Enjoying Success  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Jon Bryant is thoroughly enjoying every
unlikely event in his unlikely basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin Badgers' success in the NCAA tournament has been
improbable, perhaps even more so because of the man leading them to
victory against college basketball's established powers and
collective wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a Division II transfer who was in the midst of an
inconsistent and low-scoring senior season, has suddenly become a
star.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my dream,'' Bryant said. ''It's incredible that we're
getting ready to play in the Final Four. You think about stuff like
this, but deep down you probably think it will never happen. I'm
just glad I'm helping the team more than I was earlier in the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant helped beat Fresno State with a career-best seven
3-pointers, including four on four straight possessions, then hit
three more and had 12 points in Wisconsin's upset of top-seeded
Arizona in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   He followed those performances with two more good offensive
games, which were complemented by an increasing role in the team's
defense. Bryant scored 16 points in the upset of fourth-seeded LSU
and hit five 3-pointers on the way to 18 points in the Badgers'
West Regional final victory over Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty unlikely, but that's the way our team works,''
Bryant said. ''On any day, any one of us can be the star and take
the big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Expected to be one of the team's offensive leaders before the
season began, Bryant averaged just 7.3 points during the regular
season and shot just 36 percent, prompting coach Dick Bennett to
move him in and out of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   His 3-point shot, Bryant's specialty, betrayed him regularly. He
was 4-of-9 in a 15-point loss at Penn State, then 1-of-6 in a loss
at Ohio State two weeks later. By the time the Big Ten tournament
rolled around, he was getting limited playing time, getting just
five minutes in Wisconsin's quarterfinal victory over Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't what was expected from Bryant, who starred at St.
Cloud (Minn.) State before transferring to Madison because he
thought he would fit well in Bennett's system. It took two years to
convince Bennett of that fact; he turned down Bryant's transfer
request as a freshman in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was probably good for me,'' Bryant said. ''It gave me a
chance to keep working on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Plymouth, Minn., Bryant became a fan of Bennett's
overachieving teams at Wisconsin-Green Bay, where Bennett coached
from 1985-95. When the Phoenix engineered an astonishing upset of
Jason Kidd-led California in the 1994 NCAA tournament, Bryant
cheered them on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as one of Wisconsin's two seniors, Bryant is a part of just
such a substance-over-style affair. He doesn't hesitate to admit he
didn't think the Badgers could get this far.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, had Bryant known how well he would be playing, he
might have had a different opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I could play at Wisconsin and help the team out, but
I never thought we'd get to the Final Four, to be honest with
you,'' Bryant said. ''I guess I can't really describe my
feelings.''

<HEADLINE> Billy Ball Captures Florida  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The casual observers see what they want
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those people say Florida and coach Billy Donovan are all
about running, pressing and hoisting up 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, it's clear that's only half the story.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Donovan believes Florida can succeed only if it sets the
tempo and uses its depth to wear down opponents. But the number of
long-range bombs has gone down, while production in the middle has
risen since 1996, when Donovan took over a team that mentor Rick
Pitino declared ''bankrupt of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Donovan disagrees with the theory that Billy Ball is simply
a matter of the young coach rolling the ball out there and letting
his young, talented players freelance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wish people would take the time to try to understand
our system,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the misperception could be part of the method.
</P>
<P>
   Because, just when a team thinks it's in a 40-minute endurance
contest of racehorse basketball, the Gators can change.
</P>
<P>
   Duke found out last week. After running with the Blue Devils for
35 minutes, Donovan called off the press. He backed the Gators into
a zone, something they executed quite well, and dared Duke to shoot
3-pointers. The result: Florida finished with an 18-4 run and won
87-78. Duke shot 3-for-19 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened in the regional final against Oklahoma
State. When Florida got tired and needed to slow it down and start
pounding inside, it could do so and do so effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perception is that we just hoist up 3-point shots and let
them go from all over the place,'' Donovan says. ''But we're down
in attempts. And that's because of the strength of our guys up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   The centers, sophomore Udonis Haslem and freshman Donnell
Harvey, help the Gators tick from the outside in a way they didn't
when Donovan first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Fail to respect the big men and they have shown they can score.
Double-team them, and they can kick it outside to guards Teddy
Dupay or Brett Nelson, both of whom shoot better than 41 percent
from behind the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of offensive plays that we execute very
well,'' said Harvey, who averages 10 points and seven rebounds.
''We all get touches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators have gone from an average of 23 3-point attempts a
game the last three years to 19 this season. Instead of one true
center last year, the Gators have two.
</P>
<P>
   Haslem averages 11.4 points, and production in the middle has
climbed by about 10 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're more than just a run-and-gun offense,'' Harvey said.
''That's just what people see the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The system, Donovan says, is more difficult to coach than the
slow, plodding styles because there are so many more risks
involved.
</P>
<P>
   If the fast break is run incorrectly, there goes an easy scoring
chance, something not acceptable in this style of play. If the
press breaks down, the other team gets an easy basket when baskets
are hard to come by, especially at this point in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's much more room for error,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, there's something to fall back on. It's called an
inside game, or a zone defense, and it often takes both opponents
and fans by surprise.

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants To Sweeten Tax Relief  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are proposing to sweeten their
remedy for the tax code's penalty on married couples by giving some
extra help to people at the higher and lower ends of the income
scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee was scheduled today to begin
considering the marriage penalty legislation, which would consume
about $250 billion in projected budget surpluses over 10 years if
changes in the original bill are made.
</P>
<P>
   One proposed change, sought by GOP conservatives, would
gradually adjust the 28 percent tax rate so it applies to more of a
married couple's income, making the bracket twice that of single
filers. The original bill did the same thing only to the bottom 15
percent tax bracket, similar to the House-passed version.
</P>
<P>
   In current law, two people who are married pay income taxes at
higher rates in both the 15 percent and 28 percent brackets than
they would if they were single. About 25 million couples nationwide
are hit by the tax code's marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The other proposed change would raise the income cutoff by
$2,500 for lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax
credit, up from $2,000 in the original bill. This change was
suggested by Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont, a leading GOP moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The two changes, described by Senate aides on condition of
anonymity, would add $10 billion to the bill's cost over 10 years.
The House bill, which has drawn a veto threat from President
Clinton over its cost, carries a price tag of $182 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman and chief sponsor of the bill, Sen.
William Roth, R-Del., was expected to incorporate both of the GOP's
changes in an amendment, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Finance Committee were working on an
alternative by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York that would
eventually allow couples the choice of filing their income taxes as
singles or as a married couple. The change would be phased in
slowly to avoid a sudden drain on the budget surplus. It still
would cost an estimated $150 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats were pushing for an amendment that would further
increase the income cutoff for couples who claim the earned income
tax credit and allow the lower-earning spouse to claim a tax credit
of up to $500 as a way of offsetting the marriage penalty.

<HEADLINE> Study: Agent Orange, Diabetes Link  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force has found the ''strongest
evidence to date'' that exposure to Agent Orange is linked to
diabetes, improving the chances that Vietnam veterans suffering
from the disease will receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said Wednesday the connection so far is only
statistical and is yet to be proved by biological study.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force planes sprayed 11 million gallons of Agent Orange in
Vietnam between 1962 and 1971 to destroy jungle cover for communist
supply lines, expose enemy sanctuaries and bases and destroy crops
needed to feed enemy troops. The operation was equated by some
critics at the time to chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences is reviewing the Air Force
study's results and is to report to the Department of Veterans
Affairs, which will decide whether to add diabetes to the list of
diseases presumed linked to Agent Orange exposure. Vietnam veterans
with such diseases, including prostate cancer, are eligible for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Affairs said a decision on whether diabetes will be
''presumptively'' linked to Agent Orange exposure will be made
after a federal review of another study on dioxin and diabetes, due
to be completed in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force study found a 47 percent increase in diabetes
among veterans with the highest levels of dioxin in their
bloodstream. Dioxin is the compound in Agent Orange linked to
health effects in laboratory animals. The result is based on 1997
physical examinations of 1,000 Air Force veterans who were exposed
to Agent Orange during the nine years that it was used as a
defoliant and crop killer in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Michalek, the lead investigator in the study, told a
Pentagon news conference that because studies have not yet
explained a biological relation between dioxin and diabetes, the
Air Force cannot say conclusively that wartime exposure to Agent
Orange is a cause of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the latest results provide ''the strongest
evidence to date'' that herbicide exposure is associated with
diabetes. He said the Air Force knew as far back as 1991 of a
statistical link between dioxin and diabetes and has since hardened
its data based on additional physical exams of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Air Force said it also found a 26 percent
increase in heart disease. The increase was 50 percent among
enlisted airmen who served as ground crew for Operation Ranch Hand,
the military code name for the spraying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ground crew are presumed to have had the greatest exposure
to Agent Orange among 1,200 Air Force veterans who were involved in
the spraying from 1962 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The study found no consistent evidence that Agent Orange is
related to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said Wednesday that the Air
Force's conclusion on diabetes and dioxin was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delayed conclusions like this do not inspire confidence in the
government's willingness or ability to conduct the long-range
health studies needed to assess the true health effects of military
service,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force report compared the health of exposed veterans
with a ''control group'' of 1,300 other Air Force veterans who
served in Vietnam during the same years but had no contact with
Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Airmen were exposed to Agent Orange during their spraying
flights, in the loading process and while doing maintenance on
their aircraft and the spray equipment. The herbicide got its name
from the orange-striped barrels in which it was shipped. It was one
of several types of defoliant used during the war.

<HEADLINE> Students Rally Behind Michigan St.  </HEADLINE>
By DEE-ANN DURBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The party was still going on at
Michigan State, with hundreds of fans rallying behind the
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Izzo already was planning for the next celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get all your homework done, because next Tuesday afternoon I
plan on being here celebrating,'' Izzo told the students crowded
into Jenison Field House for a send-off rally Wednesday, shortly
before the team departed for the NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, making their second straight Final Four
appearance, need to beat Wisconsin on Saturday to make it to their
first national championship game since Magic Johnson led the
Spartans to the title 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' confidence is understandable: Michigan State
already has beaten Wisconsin three times this season and is playing
in its second consecutive Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   During the 45-minute rally, the pep band played the school fight
song, cheerleaders performed and the crowd waved green and white
pompons. Team members threw miniature green-and-white basketballs
into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to tell you that we've tried to represent the
school as best we could,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've been behind us this whole time,'' said guard Mateen
Cleaves, one of the seniors who spoke to the crowd. ''I just want
to ask you to stay behind us two more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Acker, a sophomore studio art major, spent the afternoon
making a large charcoal drawing of Cleaves. Acker could barely
contain his excitement as he thrust the drawing into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm screaming like a little schoolgirl,'' he said. ''My
prediction is Florida and us, and we're taking 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida plays North Carolina in Saturday's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Nicholson, a senior trumpet player with the team's pep
band, said he's certain the Spartans will win this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all seniors, and this is their year,'' said Nicholson,
a history major from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally the team boarded a bus and headed to the airport
for the flight to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration, while scaled down, continued when the Spartans
reached Indianapolis. As they walked into the lobby of the team
hotel, a high school band from Brownburg, Ind., was playing the
Michigan State fight song.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the players seemed to have had enough. Most got their
keys and headed quietly to their rooms.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks Oil at News Conference  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling the inflated price of gasoline ''a
sobering experience for the American people,'' President Clinton
says he hopes Congress will now take seriously his plans for
developing alternative fuels and energy-saving technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Wednesday, Clinton urged oil companies to
quickly convert OPEC's increased oil production into lower prices
at the gas pump, and said he doubts Congress would repeal the
4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax he helped push to passage in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He pressed lawmakers to renew his authority over the oil
stockpile in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which expires Friday.
And while he called for action on his energy proposals, he
deflected criticisms that he hasn't been aggressive enough in
trying to prod Americans to consider alternative fuels either.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, maybe not, but I've done a lot more than the Congress
has,'' Clinton said. ''I hope this has been a sobering experience
for the American people and for all of us, and that we can now do
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke during a wide-ranging news conference in the White
House East Room, his second this year. He discussed serious matters
-- New York police shootings, trade with China -- and irreverent
ones: the possibility of paternity leave for British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, and whether the five Oscars won by the dark satire
''American Beauty'' means Hollywood is ignoring his call to abandon
violent images.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly don't believe that movie glorified violence,''
Clinton said. He even made light of National Rifle Association
President Charlton Heston's TV ads criticizing his stance on gun
control: ''I still think Charlton Heston's a great actor and I
enjoy watching his movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ''as appalled as the next person'' when he
learned his 1996 campaign had accepted illegal contributions from
foreigners. ''We didn't need it to win, it was wrong, and we did
everything we could to try to correct it and set it right,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He railed against a campaign finance system that requires
lawmakers to go out and raise cash, rather than devote that time to
passing laws or spending time with their families. ''It wears them
out, and I worry about them. I really believe that Congress would
function better if they didn't have to spend this much time
(fund-raising).''
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   --His proposal before Congress to allow China entry into the
World Trade Organization is ''a hundred-to-nothing deal for
America'' that, if bypassed, would ensure that the rewards of open
trade go to Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   --Both Syria and Israel should develop ideas and resume talking
peace, especially since Syrian President Hafez Assad ''now knows in
great detail what the Israeli proposals were.''
</P>
<P>
   --Regardless of their ''personal chemistry,'' he hopes to have
the same type of warm relationship with new Russian President
Vladimir Putin that he had with Boris Yeltsin. ''The United States
and Russia have vast national interests that require them to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   --Declined to discuss the police shooting deaths of three unarmed
black men in New York City -- which his wife, Hillary, has made an
issue against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in their Senate campaign. With
better training policies and ''consistent'' effort, he said, crime
can fall and community relations improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two things are not inconsistent,'' Clinton said. ''I think
I should say no more, particularly in view of the latest incident,
which was tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   --Said the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban boy enmeshed in an international custody case, should accept
the decision of federal courts should they order the boy returned
to his father in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Wake Forest Overcomes Adversity  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two months ago, Wake Forest couldn't have
imagined being in this position.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from a midseason slump in which the Demon
Deacons lost nine of 13 games and saw their postseason hopes
slipping away, Wake Forest is one victory from its first National
Invitation Tournament championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Demon Deacons (21-14) play Notre Dame (22-14) in the NIT
final at Madison Square Garden tonight. It will be the schools'
first meeting in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''In January, we were a good team playing bad,'' Demon Deacons
coach Dave Odom said. ''We didn't tailspin. We took a nosedive.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29, Wake Forest was 9-2, including impressive victories
over Temple and Wisconsin. And the team could have easily been 11-0
if not for one-point losses to Georgia and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the team slumped badly and its confidence disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two brutal losses to Georgia and Oregon on last-second
shots deflated the team,'' Odom said. ''I didn't realize at that
time the team couldn't push forward simply because they didn't know
how. They had never been through something like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom cites a 76-67 loss at Virginia on Jan. 30 as the turning
point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was when the team hit rock bottom,'' Odom said. ''At that
point, we had to rebuild the team. We moved Robert O'Kelley off the
point and inserted Ervin Murray. We still struggled, but I could
see improvements in practice. In February, we steadily improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest has won seven of eight, and its last two losses were
to Duke -- including in the second round of the ACC tournament.
During that stretch, the team beat conference rivals Georgia Tech,
Virginia and North Carolina before being invited to play in the
NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would never think these kids could overcome it, but they
did,'' Odom said. ''One door closes and another opens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Demon Deacons won at Vanderbilt, beat New Mexico at home and
defeated defending NIT champion California on the road to get to
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Demon Deacons outrebounded conference rival North Carolina
State 46-31 and held it to 29.5 shooting (18-for-61) in their 62-59
overtime victory in the semifinals Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest's turnaround has come with a young team. There are
only two seniors, and both are reserves. Odom starts one freshman
(forward Josh Howard), two sophomores (Murray and forward Darius
Songaila) and two juniors (O'Kelley and center Rafael Vidaurreta).
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the whole thing about us being young is very
overrated,'' Odom said.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest provides matchup problems for Notre Dame,
particularly inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Demon Deacons use three 6-foot-9 players -- Songaila,
Vidaurreta and backup Josh Shoemaker -- to dominate the boards. They
outrebounded the Wolfpack 46-31. At 6-9, Troy Murphy is the only
Notre Dame starter taller than 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be interesting to see how the game is officiated,
because if they let a lot of things go, the game will go Wake
Forest's way,'' Notre Dame coach Matt Doherty said. ''But if they
call it tight, it will help us. Wake runs a lot of set plays, and
we'll see how that goes against our zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish have used a tough, physical style, combined with its
stifling zone defense to get to their fourth NIT final, and first
since losing to Virginia in 1992. Notre Dame beat Michigan, Xavier
and Brigham Young, all at home, to get to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish got 18 points and eight rebounds from Murphy, the Big
East player of the year and an AP first-team All-America selection,
and held Penn State to just 33 percent shooting in their 73-52 rout
in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing zone on defense helps Murphy on offense because he
doesn't have to run around after the ball, and that allows him to
play offense,'' Odom said. ''He's a great player -- one of the five
best players in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame is hoping to have starting point guard Jimmy Dillon,
who sprained his left ankle Tuesday night, in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''His ankle's pretty bad, and it's being treated,'' Doherty
said. ''But we don't know at this time whether he'll be able to
play or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom acknowledged one thing his team might not be able to
control tonight -- the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every Irish Catholic that can get a ticket will be in Madison
Square Garden,'' Odom said. ''I don't think there are too many
Southern Baptists in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State (20-13) and Penn State (18-16) play in the
third-place game that precedes the final.

<HEADLINE> Glickman Seeks Biotech Seeds Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is seeking
outside advice on what to do with ''terminator'' technology that
was developed by his department's scientists to prevent farmers
from reproducing genetically engineered seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The terminator project shows how science ''can strike a
discordant note with some communities -- and perhaps the public at
large,'' Glickman said in asking an advisory committee Wednesday to
review the technology.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials vigorously defend the technology, which is
intended to help seed companies protect their investment in new
biotech crops. It hasn't been put into use yet, but biotech
opponents worldwide have made it a symbol of what they see are the
evils of genetic engineering. USDA has refused to relinquish its
patent on the process, which renders seeds sterile.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-member panel, which includes farmers, scientists,
consumer advocates and seed company executives, is starting a
two-year review of USDA's role in developing and regulating biotech
crops. Among the issues he wants the committee to focus on is how
to preserve the intellectual property rights of seed developers
while protecting the interests of farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he appointed the committee ''to encourage the kind
of civil and thoughtful discussion that the complexity of these
issues demand -- a break from the shrill debate, where nobody
listens to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech companies, which have genetically manipulated plants to
make fruits and vegetables more attractive and to render crops
resistant to insects, disease and weedkillers, now control the
spread of the technology by patenting the seeds and then leasing
them to growers, rather than selling them.
</P>
<P>
   USDA researchers say the terminator process is misunderstood and
has applications that could benefit farmers around the world. The
same technique that renders seeds sterile by turning certain
genetic traits on and off also could be used to make plants
resistant to drought or pests.
</P>
<P>
   The terminator nickname is a reference to the on-screen robotic
killer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the advisory committee are so sharply divided about
biotechnology that the Agriculture Department has hired
professional facilitators to run the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In introductory remarks Wednesday, committee members disagreed
over whether the government should do more to promote biotechnology
or restrict its growth and use.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we need to do is educate the public'' about the benefits
of biotechnology, said Cal McCastlain, a farmer and lawyer in
Arkansas. ''Going deep into a life form is no different than going
deep into space or deep into the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Hansen of the Consumer Policy Institute said federal
regulatory process is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Burkhardt, an expert in agricultural ethics at the
University of Florida, said the committee needed to consider the
ethical implications of manipulating genes. ''We need to spend some
time talking about our ethical responsibilities as well as keeping
markets open,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Visits Helms Turf  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before the U.N. Security Council paid an
unprecedented visit to one of the world body's most ardent critics
in Congress, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke decided to do a
little ground work.
</P>
<P>
   Would there be ''an ambush by anyone'' during the meeting today
with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Sen. Jesse
Helms?
</P>
<P>
   ''None that I know of,'' the committee's top Democrat, Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, said he tried to assure Holbrooke by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a cordial visit seemed most likely, Biden suggested,
even though many frictions remain.
</P>
<P>
   In January, at Holbrooke's invitation, Helms became the first
U.S. lawmaker to address the Security Council. While he went
through a familiar litany of complaints about the organization,
Helms appeared to win over many delegates with his civility.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 council members later accepted Helms' invitation to come
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very much looking forward to their visit and he's glad
they're all coming,'' said Marc Thiessen, spokesman for the North
Carolina Republican. ''We began a very good dialogue up in New
York. He wanted to continue the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council was beginning the visit with a brief
meeting at the State Department with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Also planned were a ''walking tour'' of the Capitol, a talk by
the Senate historian, an underground trolley ride to one of the
Senate office buildings, a luncheon, and a ''roundtable
discussion'' with Helms' committee.
</P>
<P>
   Council members were to meet with President Clinton at the White
House and attend a dinner with Albright as host.
</P>
<P>
   While ambassadors initially were skeptical about Helms'
invitation, they later seemed to warm up to it -- and see the visit
it as a good way to help mend frayed U.S.-U.N. relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that this is so vital and important for the United
Nations that we cannot just brush this aside,'' said the current
Security Council president, Bangladesh Ambassador Anwarul
Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
   The council, he said, had to take ''the bull by the horns. If
there is a problem, we have to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Council members may use the occasion to try to press for more
installments on U.S. back dues. The United Nations puts the figure
at $1.7 billion but the United States calculates it at closer to $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year voted to pay $926 million of the arrears over
three years. The United States paid a $100 million installment late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But to get the balance, the United Nations must meet about a
dozen conditions drafted by Helms and Biden. Those terms generally
have not been well received in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They include a reduction the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget from the current 31 percent to 25 percent and of the regular
budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has said the United Nations must also trim its spending
and not draw the United States into ''entangling alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday he bought his
plane ticket to Washington only after Albright also extended an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   He and several other ambassadors stressed that the one-day visit
was not an official outing but rather a trip by individual
ambassadors, each invited personally by both Helms and Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''It so happened that each of us decided that as individuals we
can spend a day in Washington and get away from this New York
boring routine,'' Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said Helms' visit to the United Nations in January and the
return visit by council members was part of a ''sea change'' in
attitudes in Congress toward the world body.
</P>
<P>
   ''The staunchest critics of the United Nations are now talking
about wanting to cooperate with the U.N.,'' Biden said. ''And not
just Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The 'black helicopter' guys and the 'one-world government'
guys, all those folks, you're not hearing from them any more,''
Biden said. ''That used to be standard fare in every right-wing
speech.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Rabbis Approve Gay Unions  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Jewish leaders have
overwhelmingly approved a resolution giving rabbis the option of
presiding at gay commitment ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's vote, the Central Conference of American Rabbis
became the most influential U.S. religious group to sanction
same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution applies to the 1,800 members of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, who serve at least 1.5 million
Reform Jews. Reform Judaism is the largest and most liberal of
Judaism's three major branches in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Charles Kroloff, CCAR's president, said the resolution
shows the conference's belief that ''gay and lesbian Jews, and the
committed relationships they form with their partners, deserve the
recognition and respect due to people created in the image of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not sinful to be a gay and lesbian,'' said Rabbi Paul
Menitoff, executive vice president of CCAR. ''It is sinful to have
these prejudices and act out on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Menitoff said he hoped other religions would adopt the
resolution as a model.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kroloff and Menitoff stressed the same-sex ceremonies
weren't civil marriages recognized by law, but Kroloff said some
rabbis who have already been performing the ceremonies call them
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution calls for the rabbinate to develop sample
ceremonies for rabbis who choose to officiate at same-gender
ceremonies. It also said the relationship between two same-gender
Jewish people is worthy of affirmation through Jewish ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a call to all religious denominations to bring the
same prophetic voice to lift our nation from the bonds of prejudice
to embrace all members of the American family,'' said Rabbi Eric
Weiss, executive director of the Bay Area Jewish Healing Center in
San Francisco, speaking on behalf of the Gay and Lesbian Rabbinic
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the issue's volatility, sessions at the group's
annual convention here this week were held privately. The
resolution was approved overwhelmingly by a voice vote during
Wednesday's plenary session, CCAR officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the rabbis delayed voting on a similar proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah condemns male homosexual intercourse, but Reform
Judaism now supports same-sex civil unions and a decade ago
approved openly gay rabbis. Some Reform rabbis have already
officiated at same-sex ceremonies at synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Judaism's rabbinate bases its position on contemporary
understanding of homosexuality and the Jewish values of human
dignity and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents feared the resolution would divide rabbis and alienate
Reform Judaism from Israel, where it seeks stronger recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a coalition of 895
Reform congregations, has approved resolutions supporting civil
unions and nondiscrimination against gays, and the Unitarian
Universalist Association has officially endorsed decisions by its
clergy to perform same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian, United Methodist and Episcopal church leaders are
expected to take up the issue this year.

<HEADLINE> Woman Seeks New Life After Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTINE GONZALEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLACKAMAS, Ore. (AP) -- The higher the weighing scale read, the
lower Donna Treat felt. By last December, she was 575 pounds and at
rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A rare form of lymphedema, a disease that causes fluid to
accumulate in the body, had added 2-foot-long sacs to her hips.
Each weighed 100 pounds and were so heavy she could no longer walk.
Treat already had quit her job as a data-entry processor and sold
her car because she couldn't fit into it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Treat made her first public appearance since a
hospital procedure took 165 pounds off her body. She now weighs 410
pounds and -- for the first time in years -- can see her knees.
</P>
<P>
   While she hopes the change will eventually restore a sense of
normalcy to her life, she realizes she may face a long journey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy, but it was just one step in the process,'' said the
51-year-old woman, whose operation was on March 16. Before she was
taken to the hospital, Treat had not left her home for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 people in the United States have lymphedema,
according to the World Health Organization. Primary lymphedema can
be present at birth, or develop at puberty or in adulthood.
Secondary lymphedema can develop as a result of radiation,
infection or trauma. Women who have been treated for breast cancer
are particularly susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors do not know how Treat contracted the disease, but say
only about 1 percent of lymphedema cases are as severe as hers. The
cause of the disease is unknown, but doctors say it is not related
to eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 30 specialists gathered at Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside
Medical Center to devise a treatment program for Treat, who had
been confined to her bed. They began by draining excess fluid using
body compression and diuretics.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a sling created by a nurse at the medical
center, doctors compressed Treat's hips and posterior until the
liquid gravitated to the center of her body. There it was
reabsorbed by the lymphatic system and excreted as urine. (On one
day, Treat excreted 11 liters of urine. The average person passes
two liters a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Once Treat's weight dropped to 450 pounds, a 10-person team
performed the weight reduction surgery. Vascular and plastic
surgeons spent four hours removing the excess weight, making
incisions about 2 feet long from the back of her knees to her
buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   All told, they took out 40 pounds of lymph tissue, abnormal
skin, and small amounts of fat and blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seventy-five percent of what we did for her was before the
surgery,'' said Dr. Michael Schiedler, a vascular surgeon at the
center. ''The hardest part is next because she won't see a dramatic
improvement -- there's going to be a lot of waxing and waning.''
</P>
<P>
   Treat will spend the next few months in physical therapy to
rebuild muscles she hasn't used in months. Before she can walk,
she'll have to become strong enough to stand for longer periods of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Treat, a divorced mother, said she's up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of hours, she held court Wednesday in her hospital
room for reporters and photographers. On the wall was a banner
reading ''... but a shadow of her former self.''
</P>
<P>
   She showed off her latest accomplishment: Standing for a few
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a highly motivated person,'' she said with a smile. ''You
know, if you don't do it it's not going to get done, so the
question is, 'How bad do you want it?'''

<HEADLINE> Yagudin Ready at Skating Worlds  </HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France (AP) -- After a bizarre start to the pairs
competition, it was time to get back to the original point of the
world championships -- skating, jumping and spinning.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no one better in the world to do that than Alexei
Yagudin.
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin seeks his third consecutive world title tonight in the
men's event at the World Skating Championships. After his virtuoso
performance in the short program on Tuesday, he was a clear
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin and his Russian rival and ex-training partner, Yevgeny
Plushchenko, are in a virtual head-to-head competition for the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   American Michael Weiss was in third with a small chance to win,
but it is essentially a winner-take-all contest between Yagudin and
Plushchenko.
</P>
<P>
   Russians Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov won the pairs title
Wednesday with the most time-tested of methods: skating cleaner
than the competition.
</P>
<P>
   They skated to Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' nearly perfectly,
surpassing China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo, who led after the
short program. However, they had four costly errors in the free,
including two-footing a throw triple-salchow and his double of a
triple toe jump.
</P>
<P>
   French pair Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis overcame the
shock of a razor attack against Bernadis to win the bronze and
France's first world pairs medal since 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadis, who received an injection of pain reliever a half-hour
before the competition, showed no obvious difficulty from the
8-inch cut down his left forearm, inflicted just a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That was just one of a number of unsettling events at the pairs
event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was more pressure than usual,'' Tikhonov said. ''When you
skate, you usually are just in your own world. It was very
different this time because I worried about our team friends and
what happened with Stephane.''
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the sudden withdrawal Sunday of two pairs,
including defending champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze, after samples tested positive for banned substances.
In both cases, the skaters said stimulants were contained in
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bernadis reported that a male assailant wielding a razor
slashed his forearm at the skaters' hotel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the final evening of pairs on Wednesday, Ukrainian skater
Dmitri Palamarchuk banged his head on the ice when his right blade
appeared to catch during a press lift.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, Julia Obertas, was uninjured. Palamarchuk managed
to get off the ice on his own, but then lost consciousness at the
skaters' entrance for about five minutes. An X-ray and scan at a
hospital showed no damage, but he was being kept overnight for
observation, International Skating Union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz were next on the ice,
but were so upset by Palamarchuk's injury they had to stop. It
reminded them of when Wirtz fell four year ago in a similar manner
and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   They were told to continue, and went on unenthusiastically to
finish 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying round of the women's competition seemed almost
boring, even with chief title contenders Michelle Kwan and Irina
Slutskaya skating back-to-back in the first group.
</P>
<P>
   Both performed six triple jumps, and neither fell. But after
Kwan's rather flat program to ''Red Violin,'' and scaled-down
triple-double and double salchow, Slutskaya didn't even bother to
put in either her triple lutz-triple loop, or triple salchow-triple
loop combinations,
</P>
<P>
   Kwan arrived in Nice under pressure to perform a difficult
triple-triple combination, but didn't. ''I was a little upset with
myself. I did it so well in practice, and came here and popped it,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Maria Butyrskaya easily led the weaker second
qualifying group with six triples, but she put her hand down on a
double axel.
</P>
<P>
   The women continue Friday with the short program before
finishing the championships Saturday.

<HEADLINE> EU Cmmissioner, China Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese and EU trade leaders concentrated today
on the ''nitty gritty'' issues of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, and a WTO leader said he was hopeful Beijing
would join this year.
</P>
<P>
   EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy met with his Chinese
counterpart, foreign trade minister Shi Guangsheng this morning
before the talks adjourned for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Lamy met Wednesday with Premier Zhu Rongji to discuss opening
China's long-closed markets. Zhu intervened at critical moments
during China-U.S. negotiations in November, helping forge a
market-opening deal that cleared Beijing's biggest hurdle to
joining the WTO. China still needs to reach separate agreements
with eight WTO members, the 15-nation European Union foremost among
them.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, WTO Director General Michael Moore said
Wednesday he hoped China would gain entry to the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clock is ticking, but I'm hopeful,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamy joined the talks in Beijing this week to help deal with
tough political issues blocking a final agreement that the sides
say they hope to reach during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   He has met with the foreign trade minister three times to
discuss the ''nitty gritty'' of the differences blocking an
agreement, said Lamy's spokesman, Anthony Gooch.
</P>
<P>
   The European delegation said it might extend the talks into the
weekend if a deal looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   EU and Chinese officials have declined to give details on what
differences remain. Europe has been seeking greater access to
China's automobile, insurance and telecommunications markets and
more licenses for insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese newspaper Southern Weekend said today that
telecommunications and insurance were the most crucial areas of
disagreement. It said Europe wanted to be able to have 51 percent
of shares in joint ventures in those industries. But it also said
China considered those areas strategic industries and would not
allow foreigners majority stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since no concession was made on this bottom line to the United
States, the chances of a concession to the European Union also are
not great,'' wrote financial reporter Zhang Tingbin.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of trying, China has made joining WTO this year a
priority. It hopes the rules-based WTO regime will bring in foreign
investment and force long-protected state industries to make
reforms they have resisted.

<HEADLINE> Flight 800 Victims' Kin Can Sue  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has cleared the way for
families of those killed on TWA Flight 800 to seek millions of
dollars in damages for pain and suffering because the crash was not
in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
Wednesday that the 1996 crash eight miles off the coast of Long
Island was not governed by the Death on the High Seas Act, which
limits lawsuit damages.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted that President Reagan in 1988 extended
the territorial sea of the United States from three miles to 12
miles offshore. The appeals court's ruling affirmed a 1998
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747 exploded minutes into a flight from New York to
Paris, falling in pieces to the Atlantic Ocean. All 230 people
aboard were killed. The exact cause of the crash remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims have sought millions from Boeing, TWA
and Hydro-Aire Inc., which made the plane's fuel pumps. The
plaintiffs claim the companies were negligent in the construction
and operation of the plane. A trial in the case is set to begin
next Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pounian, a lawyer for the families, said the ruling meant
families would not be limited to damage awards of as little as
$100,000 to $200,000 for ''pecuniary losses'' or those calculated
from an estimate of future earnings and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they may be able to seek damages for the loss of the
care, comfort and companionship of loved ones as well as the pain
and suffering their loved ones went through when the plane
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Russell Young said the company was studying the
ruling and did not expect to quickly decide whether to appeal
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of where we go, we're continuing with an active
defense of the airplane, its design and its operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Bishop, a TWA spokeswoman, said the airline would leave it
to Boeing to decide whether to appeal ''because it's more Boeing's
issue than ours.'' A message left with a lawyer for Hydro-Aire was
not returned.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court: Families of Flight 800 victims can sue for pain,suffering  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The crash of TWA Flight 800 eight miles off the
coast of Long Island occurred within U.S. territorial waters, so
victims' families can sue for damages that would have been barred
if it happened in international seas, a federal appeals court
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-to-1 decision
Wednesday that the case presented unique questions of law and
revived a long-running debate over where U.S. waters end and
international water begins.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court concluded that the July 17, 1996, crash was
not covered by the Death on the High Seas Act, which limits the
amount of money relatives can seek in court for deaths that occur
in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747 exploded in midair minutes into a flight from
Kennedy International Airport to Paris, falling in pieces to the
Atlantic Ocean. All 230 people aboard were killed. The exact cause
of the crash remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   In its majority opinion, the appeals court noted that President
Reagan in 1988 extended the territorial sea of the United States
from three miles to 12 miles off shore.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Reagan's proclamation ''thus alters the
three-mile boundary that had historically defined the territorial
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted that U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet
in his 1988 ruling correctly found that the proclamation
''effectively moved the starting point of DOHSA from three to 12
miles offshore.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor said it seemed that
the appeals panel was ignoring legislative history and earlier case
law ''in an understandable desire to provide the relatives and
estate representatives ... a more generous recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it was clear that Congress intended the Death on the
High Seas Act to apply to any deaths that happened beyond three
nautical miles from the U.S. coast and that those who drafted the
law wanted to ''provide a remedy, not the most generous remedy.''
The law says that when someone dies in international waters, their
family can sue only for the estimated value mainly of their future
earnings, not for a larger amount meant to cover pain, suffering
and loss of companionship.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims are seeking millions of dollars in
damages from The Boeing Co., TWA and Hydro-Aire Inc., charging they
were negligent in the construction and operation of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pounian, a lawyer for the families, said the relatives
were gratified by the ruling in a case the court noted raised legal
questions it had not seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an exciting development,'' he said. ''The decision
confirms we're not limited by this antiquated statute.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the favorable ruling meant families would not be limited
to recoveries of as little as $100,000 to $200,000, as families of
other crash victims have been when losses are limited to
''pecuniary losses'' or those calculated from an estimate of future
earnings and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they may be able to seek damages for the loss of the
care, comfort and companionship of loved ones as well as the pain
and suffering their loved ones went through when the plane
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Bishop, a TWA spokeswoman, said the airline would leave it
to Boeing to decide whether to appeal the ruling ''because it's
more Boeing's issue than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that there has never been a finding that TWA did
anything wrong despite more than three years of investigation by
the National Transportation Safety Board and other governmental
agencies, including the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Young, a Boeing spokesman, said the company was studying
the lengthy and complex ruling. ''We don't expect any quick
decisions on further action. Regardless of where we go, we're
continuing with an active defense of the airplane, its design and
its operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A message left with a lawyer for Hydro-Aire was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling centered on a legal discussion of
whether the passengers died on the high seas, since both sides
agreed the plane exploded more than three nautical miles from
shore. The defendants contended ''high seas'' and ''three nautical
miles'' were one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   A trial in the case is set to begin next Feb. 1.

<HEADLINE> NFL's Instant Replay Retained  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Either the latest instant replay system
was working, or NFL owners are getting tired of arguing over it.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the message of Wednesday's 28-3 vote to retain
the system installed last year after a seven-season absence. Not
only were proponents of replay thrilled with the overwhelming
passage -- it needed 24 votes -- but they were talking about
something more long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were happy with the system that was in place last year,''
said Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green, a member of the
competition committee, which recommended 6-1 to the owners to
retain replay. ''The feeling is, give it another year, and if it
works well again, then vote next year to have this system for the
future. I don't think we should vote on this one year at a time. If
it's good, let's keep it in the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Replay will be exactly the same: Coaches will get two challenges
per game, and a replay official can stop play on his own for a
challenge in the last two minutes of each half and in overtime.
Will it last?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy where we are,'' Packers general manager Ron
Wolf said, ''but I think we can improve on it. I'm sure we can with
the technology available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why a permanent acceptance isn't likely. While it takes a
three-fourths majority to make a rules change, it takes the same
margin to repeal something permanent. Considering the controversy
surrounding replay, even when it works well, it seems improbable
the owners would go to it long term.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati and Arizona voted against it for the second straight
year. Kansas City replaced the New York Jets as the third
dissenter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Human nature doesn't change, and it's humans who run these
machines,'' said Cincinnati's Mike Brown, who has voted against
replay every time it has been proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for it last year to give a chance,'' said Kansas
City's Lamar Hunt, another consistent antireplay owner. ''I didn't
think it worked any better than it had before.''
</P>
<P>
   On-field celebrations by more than one player have been banned
by a 30-0 vote. The Super Bowl champion Rams, who's celebratory
'''Bob and Weave'' involved several players at once, abstained.
</P>
<P>
   ''The coaches said across the board that players on their teams
regarded it as provocative,'' commissioner Paul Tagliabue said.
''The coaches felt it was very negative to spend time before a game
trying to cool players down. They felt there was no need for it to
be an issue in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Those coaches also were party to a policy change. The league
eliminated the supervisory coaching tag that allowed teams to hire
away assistant coaches from other teams. An assistant coach now can
only be hired away to become a head coach, unless permission is
given by his current team to the team pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussions this week have centered on the Internet,
a topic that keenly interests Tagliabue. The owners voted to
consolidate the Internet presence into NFL.com, with revenue
equally divided among the 31 teams, just as television revenues
are. That decision is for the next two years, then the issue will
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many felt it was as important as in 1961, selling the TV
rights as a national package,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL discussed scheduling for 2002, when Houston enters the
league. Tagliabue said there was some discussion of adding one team
in each conference to the playoffs, expanding it to 14 teams.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Air Force Plane Crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A Sri Lankan air force AN-26 plane
crashed Thursday with at least 36 military personnel onboard, an
air force spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the passengers was not immediately known. The plane
was flying from Palaly, in the war-torn north, to Colombo, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place at Thalawa, 90 miles north of Colombo,
said spokesman Wing Commander A. Wijesundera.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Brig. Palitha Fernando said the pilot complained
of engine trouble shortly before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil Tigers have in the past shot down several aircraft during
their battle with the military, but the cause of Thursday's
accident was not known.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have been fighting since 1983 to carve out a
homeland in the northeast for the minority Tamils. More than 61,000
people have been killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Found To Violate Privacy  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge's ruling against President Clinton
could spawn a lawsuit by presidential accuser Kathleen Willey and
give a boost to the Privacy Act lawsuit of another Clinton nemesis,
Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Wednesday's decision that Clinton committed a
criminal violation by releasing Mrs. Willey's personal letters from
White House files promises to prolong a nasty court battle that the
president is determined to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opinion of our counsel's office and ... and other judges
who've ruled on this is that that act does not apply to this kind
of correspondence in the White House,'' Clinton told a news
conference following the ruling by U.S. District Judge Royce
Lamberth.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to undercut her credibility, Clinton authorized the
release of Mrs. Willey's letters to him the morning after her 1998
TV appearance in which she claimed the president made an unwanted
sexual advance just outside the Oval Office in 1993. Mrs. Willey's
letters showed she remained friendly with Clinton after the alleged
incident.
</P>
<P>
   David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, said, ''A judicial finding of criminal
liability creates a very strong basis for a civil suit'' for Mrs.
Willey. She could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House could face another problem as well.
</P>
<P>
   There is a move afoot to consolidate Mrs. Tripp's Privacy Act
lawsuit with the suit in which Lamberth made his ruling Wednesday
against Clinton. If Lamberth consolidates the cases, Mrs. Tripp
would continue to be represented by Washington lawyer Stephen Kohn,
an expert in whistleblower and privacy act law.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the other case, former Reagan- and Bush-era
political appointees whose FBI background files were collected by
the Clinton White House, would be represented by the conservative
group Judicial Watch, which has filed a series of lawsuits against
the administration. Lamberth, a Republican appointee, is handling
the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence of violations against Willey help prove a general
campaign to discredit opponents of which Tripp was at the high end
of the list,'' Tripp lawyer Stephen Kohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth's ruling ''substantiates our belief that Mrs. Tripp was
a victim of similar actions involving both the Department of
Defense and the Office of the Presidency,'' said Joe Murtha,
another Tripp lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon released information from Mrs. Tripp's personnel
file in which she incorrectly told her prospective government
employer she'd never been arrested. In fact, she was arrested for
grand larceny when she was a teen-ager, a charge later reduced to
loitering.
</P>
<P>
   In planning an appeal of the decision, the Clinton
administration says it will be able to cite precedents
contradicting Lamberth's opinion that ''the White House and
president were aware that they were subject to the Privacy Act, and
yet chose to violate its provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, then-Assistant Attorney General and now Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia recognized that the law does not cover the
entire Executive Office of the President, White House counsel Beth
Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every administration since, Republican and Democrats alike,
the Justice Department has consistently adhered to the view that
the White House Office is not subject to the Privacy Act,'' Nolan
said. ''Judge Lamberth's opinion is inconsistent with that
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth stressed that nine months before Clinton released the
Willey letters, Lamberth had ruled that the Privacy Act does cover
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nolan said the Justice Department advised in 1997 that
despite Lamberth's ruling, the president's aides were not required
to alter their practices regarding dissemination of information.
</P>
<P>
   Groups interested in protecting privacy regard Lamberth's ruling
as a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a growing public concern about the use and misuse of
personal information in government files,'' said Sobel. ''This
decision might be a reflection of that growing concern.''

<HEADLINE> Criminal Referral in E-Mail Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican House committee chairman says
lawyers at the White House and Justice Department may have helped a
government computer specialist file a false statement in the case
of the missing White House e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton said Wednesday he is sending a criminal referral
accusing White House employee Daniel Barry of perjury for his
written declaration last July to a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Barry gave no indication in the four-page document that many
White House e-mails weren't being reviewed to see if they should be
turned over to investigators. ''I am concerned that the lawyers who
assisted Mr. Barry in the preparation of his affidavit, and who
counseled him at the time the affidavit was signed, were aware that
the information was misleading,'' Burton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Burton cited lawyers in the White House counsel's office as
possibly being ''involved in this deception.''
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Beth Nolan was scheduled to testify today
before Burton's House Government Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Burton outlined his plan for a criminal referral in a letter to
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who earlier Wednesday found
President Clinton committed a criminal violation of the Privacy
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth's ruling came in the same lawsuit that Barry filed the
declaration in, a case filed by former Reagan- and Bush-era
appointees whose FBI background files were gathered by the Clinton
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Barry's declaration states that the White House e-mail had been
archived in an automated records management system. In fact, from
August 1996 through mid-1998, computer glitches kept many e-mails
out of the archives. Many aides inside the White House knew of the
problem in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Barry was aware as early as July of 1998 that a large
universe of e-mails had not been archived,'' Burton wrote Lamberth.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources said House investigators are trying to
determine whether there was discussion of the e-mail problem with
Barry by the Justice Department or the White House counsel's office
at the time Barry signed the declaration to Lamberth's court. The
sources spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Trent Lott Criticizes Census Form  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other
Republicans in Congress are attacking what they call the
intrusiveness of the Census Bureau's 53-question long form, saying
people shouldn't answer the questions that invade their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., has received a number of complaints from
constituents about the long form, which was sent to one in six of
the country's 115 million households, spokesman John Czwartacki
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a question that invades their privacy they should
leave it blank,'' Czwartacki said, while at the same time urging
everyone to fill out and return their forms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., urged people to
answer just the first six questions on the long form before sending
it back to the Census Bureau with a letter of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm appalled and outraged by the intrusiveness of this
questionnaire,'' he said. ''It is ridiculous for the Census Bureau
to ask personal questions that have nothing to do with their
constitutional mandate to count the citizens of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau said it has added just one question to the
long form since 1990. Census officials say all of the questions
they ask on the form are approved by Congress ahead of time, and
most are essential for the distribution of federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Questions on the long form cover topics such as income,
employment status and home value, while the short form contains
only 8 questions about basic identifying information.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking Democrat on the House
census subcommittee, said in a letter addressed to colleagues in
Congress that the only new question on this year's long form asks
for information on grandparents as care givers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Census Bureau has gone to great effort within the mandates
of Congress to make both the short and long forms as brief as
possible,'' she said. ''What we should all be doing now is urging
all of our constituents to fill out and send back their completed
forms.''

<HEADLINE> Daily News To Mark 75th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- True to its in-your-face style, the
Philadelphia Daily News will celebrate its 75th birthday Friday
with a commemorative edition that runs 450 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is titled ''75 Reasons We Love Philadelphia,'' with
No. 1, of course, being the Daily News. No surprise there.
Self-promotion is a People Paper trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we made it anything else, people would think that aliens
had taken over the paper,'' says editor Zachary Stalberg, whose
humor and penchant for colorful language has set the tone for the
feisty tabloid since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Knight Ridder-owned newspaper put out its first edition
March 25, 1925. Almost from the start, it found itself in dire
financial straits. In the early years, delivery drivers performed
their own repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the paper has employed legions of colorful
characters. There was the editor who was caught sleeping inside his
large rolltop desk, whiskey bottle in hand. And the 1930s-era
sports editor who saved a reporter from being shot by the husband
of a woman with whom the reporter had been dallying.
</P>
<P>
   Like many newspapers around the country, the Daily News has seen
a steep slide in circulation -- 31 percent since 1988 -- but has
stabilized around 160,000, Stalberg said. It is facing a new threat
from Metro, a daily tabloid distributed free on the region's public
transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   The paper still covers Philadelphia like no one else -- railing
against abandoned cars in dilapidated north Philadelphia, keeping
close tabs on City Hall, needling the city's education
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a paper that deeply loves the city of Philadelphia,''
says Lynn Washington, a former Daily News reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Hopelessly outgunned by The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Daily
News has nonetheless won two Pulitzers, one for editorial writing
and another for editorial cartooning. Its sports section is
beloved.
</P>
<P>
   The two newspapers are still at it. One columnist routinely
calls the Inquirer the ''Morning Yawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing I'd rather do than beat the hell out of the
Inquirer on a story,'' says police reporter Scott Flander, who has
been with the paper 17 years. ''And they can say the same thing
about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although office hijinks have toned down quite a bit, the Daily
News maintains its irreverent attitude. The headlines have included
''Spit Happens'' (pro basketball star Charles Barkley spits on an
8-year-old), ''Side Order of Lead'' (gangland slaying at a south
Philadelphia diner), and ''Cunanan's Best Shot'' (serial killer
Andrew Cunanan commits suicide).
</P>
<P>
   The paper's most famous headline is also the subject of one of
its more enduring stories.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1980, the Phillies had just won the World Series and a
debate was raging in the newsroom over the choice of headlines --
''We Win'' or ''They Did It.''
</P>
<P>
   Editor Gil Spencer finally deferred to a janitor named Ralph
who, after considering the options, pointed to ''We Win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good choice: A famous photo shows Phillies pitcher and
World Series hero Tug McGraw holding the paper aloft during the
team's victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, though, that Ralph wasn't exactly an informed
arbiter. A reporter later told Spencer that the janitor didn't know
how to read.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, that kind of captures the Daily News,'' Stalberg said.

<HEADLINE> NYPD truancy patrol under fire  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Norman Siegel, executive director of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, confessed he played hooky when he was a
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel laughed about the memory Wednesday, but warned that for
the city's students, being a little late for school can land you in
police custody.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel and several police officers are questioning why NYPD
truancy vans and officers are stationed outside high schools and
are taking into custody tardy students clearly on their way to
class.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, said such tactics are dangerous at a time when the police
department's relationship with the city's minority communities is
already frayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned at any time when the police department has
unnecessary contact with innocent civilians in a very aggressive
fashion,'' Adams said. ''It's always potent. It can lead to someone
losing their lives, like Patrick Dorismond.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, was the latest unarmed black man to be fatally
shot by police after he got into a scuffle with a plainclothes
officer who had asked him where he could buy drugs. His death on
March 16 angered many New Yorkers who contend the NYPD is out of
control. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has been roundly criticized for his
handling of the shooting, especially for releasing Dorismond's
sealed juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, four students -- all black girls
-- described run-ins with truancy police, which Adams said occurred
more often in poor neighborhoods than privileged ones. Two of the
students stopped are daughters of NYPD officers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams stressed that the students did nothing wrong, and were in
front of their schools when they were stopped. A videotape, taken
by an unidentified private citizen and given to Adams, shows a
marked police van parked next to Springfield Gardens High School in
Queens on March 3. Students walking alone into the school are not
approached by police, but a large group of kids are, and are herded
into the van.
</P>
<P>
   Adams alleged that the officers have an arrest quota, so they
wait until a group of students come together, and target them.
Police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode said there are no such quotas, and
added that the truancy program is set up for parents' benefit, to
keep students in school.
</P>
<P>
   Truancy is not a criminal offense -- it's a violation of the
state's compulsory education law, which states that children up to
the age of 16 must attend school unless there is prior consent
between their guardian and school officials. Truant students are
taken by police to a Board of Education facility where they are
held until school officials can notify their guardians. They are
given ''youth referrals,'' which are expunged from their records
when they turn 18.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the students -- Janell Boyd, 17, and Tenyae Brazeal,
14, who attend Springfield Gardens -- were criminally charged. Boyd,
a junior, was charged with disorderly conduct, and Brazeal, a
freshman, for assaulting a school safety officer. Both girls denied
the charges, stemming from a Feb. 17th incident.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, both girls were running late. School started at
8:25 a.m., but it was 9:07 a.m., and the girls were hurrying to
class.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother knew I was running late,'' Janell said. Her mother,
Detective Evidelia Boyd, said that was true.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were stopped in front of the school, but Tenyae
managed to get inside the building and was going to call Boyd when
she ''accidentally'' bumped into a school safety officer. Tenyae
was then arrested and charged with assault, she said. Janell was
arrested for disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls were taken to the 113th Precinct in Queens, and their
parents called.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was definitely wrong for the police officers to stop
children on school grounds,'' she said, adding that the experience
frightened her daughter. ''She was crying, she was shaking, she was
visibly upset.''
</P>
<P>
   When Boyd asked the arresting officer why her daughter had been
charged with a crime, she was told: ''She gave me a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   Janell eventually received a desk appearance ticket and was
released to her mother's custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter did not commit a crime,'' said Boyd, who works in
the 88th Detective Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Two other students -- LaToya Ellerby and Kyisha Frazier, both 17
and seniors -- were stopped outside Pacific High School in Brooklyn
twice, last year and in January. The girls were detained for
questioning but not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Kyisha's mother, Officer Lisa Frazier of the 88th Precinct, said
she was very upset her daughter had been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had done nothing wrong,'' Frazier said.

<HEADLINE> Truth Is Hard To Find in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATI SINGHPURA, India (AP) -- Women's anguished wails pour from
every other brick house in this Kashmir village surrounded by apple
orchards, rice fields and sparkling Himalayan snow peaks.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a week since the killers came in the night, ordered
the men from their shops and homes and shot them to death outside
the temple and in front of a hay barn. Hardly a family was not
touched by the March 20 massacre of 35 Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen wore Indian army uniforms. They spoke Urdu, the
language of mostly Muslim Kashmir and neighboring Pakistan. The
government has identified the killers as 17 men, mostly foreigners,
from two Pakistan-based militant groups, Hezb-ul Mujahedeen and
Lashkar e-Toiba, both fighting to separate Kashmir from India.
</P>
<P>
   Home Minister L.K. Advani said the militants carried out the
massacre to publicize India's 52-year dispute with Pakistan over
Kashmir during President Clinton's visit to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and the militant groups denied that, and claimed India
massacred its own citizens to discredit the Kashmir separatist
movement -- a charge India dismissed as ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is swarming with armed groups, each with its own agenda,
creating uncertainty about responsibility for many atrocities.
International watchdogs like Amnesty have accused all of them --
including the Indian army -- of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor is often a substitute for fact and there are several
versions of every event. Residents take sides based on their
religion, race and whether they have been hurt by the army, the
militants, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Sikh leaders and Kashmiri Muslims have called for an independent
inquiry into the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian army said it killed five of the Chati Singhpura
raiders in a gunbattle Saturday in Panchaltan, eight miles east of
the prosperous village.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certain that they were the killers,'' said Gurbachan
Jagat, director general of Kashmir's police.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were burned beyond recognition and handed over to
Muslims in Panchaltan for burial without any forensic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said Indian security forces gunned down six
guerrillas Wednesday who were suspected of involvement in the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The 50,000 Sikhs in the Kashmir Valley had never before been
targeted during the 11-year insurgency that has killed more than
25,000 people. The Indian army says it is fighting about 10
Kashmiri and Pakistan-based militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   A visiting Clinton told India and Pakistan they need to start
talking about the disputed area that has caused two of their three
wars. But he emphasized that he had not come to mediate between the
two nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he understands the complexity of the problem. That is
the reason why he doesn't want to be getting too much involved,''
said Omer Farooq, chairman of the All Party Hurriyet Conference,
which demands Kashmir's independence from India.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still feel that Mr. Clinton has got a role to play in the
region,'' said Farooq, the chief Muslim priest in the Kashmir
Valley. Farooq suggested Clinton follow up with private,
confidence-building measures to ''give some push from the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagat said information about the militants who came to Chati
Singhpura was provided by a man the government said was a resident
of the village and had joined Hezb-ul Mujahedeen. He was arrested
after a witness said he was seen with the attackers, Jagat said.
</P>
<P>
   In the village, only two men saw the gunmen and lived. One is in
the hospital and the other has gone away. The village women said
all they know is that the gunmen were dressed like Indian soldiers
and behaved like Indian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was milking the cow when they came,'' said Jaeet Kaur, 60,
whose husband, two sons and two teen-age grandsons were killed.
When the gunmen ordered her to go inside, she obeyed because she
thought they were soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And when did she come to know they were not?
</P>
<P>
   ''How do we know?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After some time I heard the shots and ran out. I was searching
for our people, shouting here and there for someone to come to the
rescue. But there was no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Sikh men, former soldiers or government servants, became
angry and insulted at questions about whether the killers might
have been affiliated with the army, as many Muslim Kashmiris
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one knows what is the truth,'' said Sana Ullah Bhatt,
editor of the independent Daily Sun, the most widely read newspaper
in the valley with a circulation of 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Bhan, inspector-general of the Kashmir police, said 145
militants have been killed this year. Police and security forces
are bracing for the spring, when the snow melts in the mountains,
and more guerrillas can cross.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there will be an attempt to answer the questions
about all the killings when peace comes, Bhatt hung his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not seen peace since 1947. There will never be peace.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pitch Medicare Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Taking time out of a full day of
Democratic fund raising in New York, President Clinton plans a
pitch for his proposal to reform the Medicare system and add
coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Shoring up Medicare is a major element of the president's
domestic legislative agenda for his final year in office, and
something his aides say has a good chance of passing even in an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance today at a Manhattan senior citizen's
center is meant to help increase public pressure on the
Republican-led Congress, where there is already bipartisan support
for some of the president's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans three fund-raising appearances in Manhattan,
a short commute by presidential helicopter from the Westchester
County home he and Hillary Rodham Clinton bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to New York on Wednesday night, after a
fund-raising dinner in South Carolina that marked his first trip to
that state since a racially charged Republican presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he knew his audience at historically black
Allen University expected him to address the controversy over
display of the Confederate flag atop the Statehouse in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton soft-pedaled the question, and stopped short of
saying outright that the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the waving symbol of one American's pride is the
shameful symbol of another American's pain, we still have bridges
to cross,'' Clinton said during a fund-raising tribute to Rep. Jim
Clyburn, D-S.C., who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was an echo of Clinton's remarks earlier this month
in Alabama, where Clinton went to commemorate the 35th anniversary
of the Selma voting rights march.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
calls the flag a racist emblem and is leading a tourism boycott of
South Carolina until the flag is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his then-challenger, Arizona
Sen. John McCain, refused to take a position on the flag, calling
it a local issue. Democrats accused them of pandering to the far
right of their party.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his then-challenger, former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, both said the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   The flag's defenders say it is a potent symbol of Southern
heritage and honors those who died during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know everyone expects me to say something about that,''
Clinton said of the flag, but he seemed resolved to keep the
rhetoric low at a time when a compromise over the flag may be at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the NAACP offered some support for a plan to remove
the flag from the Statehouse but display other Civil War-era flags
on the building grounds.

<HEADLINE> Approval of Aid for Colombia Near  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is standing by its plan to provide
$1.7 billion to help Colombia's hard-pressed government battle drug
traffickers and the leftist rebels who protect them.
</P>
<P>
   But as lawmakers move toward approving a wide-ranging, $13
billion measure containing those funds, they seem ready to make
half the bill's $2.1 billion for U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo
contingent upon increased contributions there by European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   A vote to do that -- set for today -- would set up a possible
clash with President Clinton. His aides wrote legislators that the
provision ''would put at risk the considerable progress we have
made in this troubled region.''
</P>
<P>
   Language proposed by Reps. John Kasich, R-Ohio, Barney Frank,
D-Mass., and others would free the restricted Kosovo funds if
Clinton certifies that European countries have provided more
economic, humanitarian and policing assistance to the breakaway
Balkan enclave.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the 78-day air war against Yugoslavia began, there
are 37,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo, including 5,300
Americans. Amid recent flare-ups of ethnic violence in the Yugoslav
province, some lawmakers want increased European involvement, in
part to compensate for the large U.S. share of the bombing costs.
</P>
<P>
   As the House worked on the spending bill, which would provide
extra funds for this year, the Senate Budget Committee neared
approval of a $1.83 trillion budget for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That Republican-written measure resembles a budget the House
approved last week for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. It would
cut taxes by at least $150 billion through 2005 and hold spending
for many domestic programs next year to $290 billion, or 2.6
percent more than this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on the budget next week, and
congressional leaders hope for final approval of a compromise
version of the measure by mid-April. The fiscal plan does not need
Clinton's signature and sets overall tax and spending targets,
leaving details for later legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House supporters of the Colombia aid package see it as a major
step toward curbing drug supplies in the United States. U.S.
officials say 90 percent of the cocaine and 65 percent of the
heroin used in the United States comes from Colombian-grown coca.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House voted 239-186 to reject an effort by
Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., that would have delayed, and perhaps
eventually killed, $522 million of the Colombia aid. The roll call
came after House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who rarely joins
floor debate, took to the well of the chamber to ask colleagues for
the full amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said the aid ''is about our children, and whether we
want our children to grow up in a society free from the scourge of
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the package would risk involving the United
States in what has been a long-running, bloody civil war that could
continue for years. They also said U.S. resources should be
directed more toward preventing drug use at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fundamental problem is the addiction that causes people to
crave ... drugs,'' said Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Ramstad later tried killing the entire $1.7 billion Colombia aid
package, losing 262-158.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had requested $1.3 billion for Colombia, on top of $300
million already in the pipeline, but supported the House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The money is for training and equipping Colombian troops and
police -- including 63 helicopters -- along with intelligence
operations, incentives for farmers to grow other crops, and
assisting neighbors Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the House added $4 billion to the overall bill for
the Pentagon, including funds for upgrading helicopters and AWACS
radar warning planes, equipment repair, and military housing and
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The funds, backed by House leaders to satisfy pro-defense
lawmakers who wanted a bigger defense budget for 2001, were
approved 289-130.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's ultimate fate is uncertain. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he wants to shrink it and put the
remnants into spending measures for fiscal 2001 that Congress will
write later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But House leaders have pressed on, hoping to persuade Lott to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes $1.6 billion for rising Pentagon fuel
costs; $858 million for its fiscally ailing health care plan; $2.2
billion for victims of Hurricane Floyd, which battered North
Carolina last autumn, and other natural disasters; and $600 million
to help poor families pay utility bills.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut to take lead role in antitrust investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut's attorney general says he
will take a lead role in a national investigation of the gun
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will center on allegations that the nation's
largest gun maker, Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. of Springfield, Mass., has
been the target of retaliation from the rest of the industry after
entering into a gun-control agreement with the Clinton
administration, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, the company pledged to take a series of
steps in return for protection from lawsuits brought by 29 cities
and counties across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The measures included steps long sought by gun-control
advocates: mandatory trigger-locks on all weapons, investment in
''smart gun'' technology to prevent non-owners and children from
firing a weapon, and marketing restrictions such as waiting periods
and limits on the number of gun purchases made at a single time.
</P>
<P>
   The March 17 agreement was met with protests by gun-owners
groups and Smith &AMP; Wesson's competitors. One group, the Gun Owners
of America, urged its 200,000 members to boycott Smith &AMP; Wesson
products and to ask their local dealers not to stock the company's
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is at this point at least the appearance of an effort
that involved concerted activity targeting Smith &AMP; Wesson by
manufacturers, distributors, dealers and possibly others,''
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said his office will be joined in the probe by
officials from New York and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Courant, citing sources outside the attorney
general's office it did not identify, reported today that officials
from the White House and other federal agencies that regulate
handguns considered joining the effort at a high-level meeting in
Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am aware of the meeting Tuesday in Washington and of the
speculation about an investigation,'' said Ken Jorgensen, director
of public and media relations for Smith &AMP; Wesson. ''Obviously I can
confirm that other companies in our business are quite unhappy with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen said that, in the wake of the March 17 agreement, some
dealers have told Smith &AMP; Wesson that they will no longer carry
their gun models. Others have said that ''they hope all the other
dealers in their neighborhood stop carrying Smith &AMP; Wesson models,
because we love your company and then we'll have the market all to
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of attempts to pressure gun magazines into refusing
Smith &AMP; Wesson advertisements have also reached the company,
Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal cautioned that launching an investigation does not
necessarily guarantee that a lawsuit will be brought.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be specific about the activities his
investigators will be looking into. But he said that investigators
and attorneys from all three states are already interviewing
witnesses and gathering information.

Sri Lankan Air Force Plane Crashes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A Sri Lankan air force AN-26 plane crashed
Thursday with at least 36 military personnel onboard, an air force spokesman
said. The fate of the passengers was not immediately known. The plane was flying
from Palaly, in the war-torn north, to Colombo, the capital. The accident took
place at Thalawa, 90 miles north of Colombo, said spokesman Wing Commander A.
Wijesundera. Army spokesman Brig. Palitha Fernando said the pilot complained of
engine trouble shortly before the crash. Tamil Tigers have in the past shot down
several aircraft during their battle with the military, but the cause of
Thursday's accident was not known.

Flight 800 Victims' Kin Can Sue

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has cleared the way for families of
those killed on TWA Flight 800 to seek millions of dollars in damages for pain
and suffering because the crash was not in international waters. In a 2-1
decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the 1996
crash eight miles off the coast of Long Island was not governed by the Death on
the High Seas Act, which limits lawsuit damages. The appeals court noted that
President Reagan in 1988 extended the territorial sea of the United States from
three miles to 12 miles offshore. The appeals court's ruling affirmed a 1998
decision.

NASA Chief Takes Mars Mission Blame

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA Administrator Dan Goldin is taking the blame
for last year's botched Mars missions, saying he pushed too hard, cut too much
and made it impossible for spacecraft managers to succeed. But Goldin said he
will not abandon the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ''faster,
better, cheaper'' approach. Mission managers will get enough money and people to
do the job, but there won't be a return to the days of big, expensive
spacecraft. ''We're going to make sure they have adequate resources, but we're
not going to let the pendulum swing all the way back,'' he told employees of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate

<HEADLINE> Seismic Activity Increases in Japan  </HEADLINE>
By ITSUO INOUYE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Nearly 10,000 people evacuated from their
homes kept a nervous vigil today as a volcano in northern Japan
rumbled back to life, setting off a series of powerful earthquakes
and threatening to erupt at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warned an eruption of Mount Usu on the northern Japan
island of Hokkaido was imminent. Observers on a military helicopter
found cracks on the volcano's western slope and near its base.
Officials said the crack on the western slope stretched 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For the third day, quakes rocked this normally serene hot
springs resort area at the base of the volcano. And with the
frequency and intensity of the tremors increasing, nerves were
beginning to fray.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it would just erupt and get it over with,'' said
Toshiko Oishi, a 69-year-old housewife who had evacuated to a local
elementary school. ''But I'm worried about my house because it's
near the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Oishi was one of 9,300 people who had been evacuated from the
most dangerous areas by this morning. Most were staying in local
shelters, while others stayed with relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>
   From this town, the snow-frosted volcano appeared ominously
quiet early today, though white plumes of smoke could be seen
rising from its crater before a mist settled over its peak later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the official warnings, the day began with a
jolt -- an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.2. That was
the strongest of thousands of shallow tremors registered over the
past three days around the 2,416-foot mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Takao Kimihira of the local Meteorological Observatory in
Muroran, near Usu, said seismic activity was intensifying because
of the movement of magma underground.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that means the volcano could erupt at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that an eruption would melt the snow on the volcano's
flanks and cause mudslides, authorities ordered the evacuation of
4,137 homes in this town at the volcano's base and two others --
Sobetsu and Abuta. Together, the towns have a population of 51,300.
</P>
<P>
   The area is known for a scenic lake and hot spring resorts, but
hotel owners began turning tourists away Wednesday following the
eruption warnings. Mount Usu is 475 miles north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Police cars were positioned to block roads leading toward the
volcano, and town officials checked for stragglers in evacuated
areas. About 3,000 army troops in Hokkaido were placed on standby,
a prefectural official said.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Sato, a Date resident who evacuated his home Wednesday,
praised town officials for issuing the evacuation orders and
quickly setting up emergency headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the mayor made the right decision with the
evacuations,'' he said. ''I think we are safe, but we're worried
about our property.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, an emergency task force was set up at Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes, according to Japan's meteorological agency.
The agency describes an active volcano as one that has erupted at
least once over the last 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Usu's last eruption, in 1978, left two people dead and
destroyed nearly 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, several eruptions of the 4,459-foot Mount Unzen sent
avalanches of hot rocks sweeping through the outskirts of the town
of Shimabara, in southern Japan, killing 43 people and leaving
nearly 2,300 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe an eruption of Usu would likely be similar to
that of Unzen, meaning that instead of lava flows, the volcano
would eject a large amount of rocks, pumice, volcanic ash and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Such eruptions are particularly dangerous because the mixture --
called a pyroclastic flow -- moves much faster than lava, and can
easily outpace emergency vehicles.

<HEADLINE> House Stands by Navy Accord  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is backing President Clinton's plan
to provide $40 million for economic, health and environmental aid
to people who live near the Navy's firing range on the Puerto Rican
island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   By a 232-183 vote on Wednesday, lawmakers rejected legislation
by Reps. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., and James Hansen, R-Utah, that
would have in effect scuttled a compromise over the controversial
site where the Navy has practiced bombing and shelling for decades.
</P>
<P>
   After an errant bomb killed a civilian security guard and
injured four others in April, protesters moved onto the bombing
range, forcing the Navy to suspend its exercises. Navy officials
say training there is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Under a January agreement between Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov.
Pedro Rossello, the $40 million in aid will be provided and
exercises at Vieques would resume, though only with inert bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there would be a referendum -- probably next year --
in which local residents could choose between the resumption of
training with live bombs and exercises with dummy bombs until a
Navy withdrawal in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's amendment would have required the resumption of
training with live ammunition before the aid could be provided. In
addition, Clinton would have to first certify that all protesters
had left the site, and the aid could not be used to pay for the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 million was included in a wide-ranging $13 billion
spending bill the House was expected to approve later. Fowler tried
attaching her provision to the same measure.

<HEADLINE> EPA Using New Was To Deal With DDT  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL CHAVEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Federal officials say they will toughen
measures to prevent consumption of fish tainted by a huge deposit
of DDT on the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The pesticide has contaminated Santa Monica Bay's Palos Verdes
Shelf for a half-century and earned a Superfund designation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the largest DDT contamination site in the country,''
the Environmental Protection Agency's Keith Takata said Wednesday.
''The first step to protect the public health is to make sure
people aren't eating white croaker contaminated with dangerous
levels of DDT.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the EPA in July will launch a three-month pilot
project to cap 180 acres of ocean floor along the Los Angeles coast
with sand and silt to prevent the spread of the pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million experiment will take place in waters about 200
feet deep, said Fred Schauffler, the EPA's project manager.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminated area has an estimated 100 tons of DDT spread
across 17 square miles of ocean floor. There are also about 10 tons
of PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical manufacturer Montrose Corp. allegedly dumped residue,
including DDT, into the sewage system from 1947 until 1971. The
area was declared a Superfund environmental cleanup site in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   DDT, which was banned in the U.S. in 1973, has been linked to
cancer and reproductive problems in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Because contamination levels of DDT are the highest in
bottom-feeding fish, such as the white croaker, the EPA will call
for more aggressive enforcement of the catch limit and the
commercial fishing ban in the area, Schauffler said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also will launch an educational campaign and monitor
contamination levels of white croaker sold in markets, Schauffler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Montrose and other companies responsible for the pollution have
challenged the EPA's capping plan as being too risky.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ... disagree with the Montrose folks who claim there's no
significant human health risk and the problem is going away on its
own by virtue of biodegradation of DDT,'' Schauffler said. ''Here
we are 30 years after the last significant discharge and we still
have a very major problem on our hands.''

<HEADLINE> Officials say inmate injured by rubber bullets was not fighting  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The wounding of three Connecticut inmates
by guards shooting rubber bullets inside a Virginia prison has
sparked debate at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the inmates were injured Monday when a guard at
Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va. tried to break up
a fight between two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was another inmate who was inadvertently hit,'' said
Christina Polce, a spokeswoman from the Connecticut Department of
Correction. ''He was not involved in the (fight), but was nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Farr, said firing rubber bullets is an effective way
to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very humane way to control your population,'' said
Farr, R-West Hartford. ''It protects the inmates, and it also
protects the corrections officers from having to risk injury by
physically breaking up a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Lawlor, the cochair of the Legislature's Judiciary
Committee disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy didn't do anything wrong, and he got shot,'' said
Lawlor, D-East Haven. ''That doesn't say good things about the
security and safety down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia and Connecticut officials refused to identify the
inmates, but Lawlor said 34-year-old Daniel Westberg of West Haven
was the prisoner who was not fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The brawling prisoners were William Valedon, 32, of New Haven
and Andres Davila, 21, of West Hartford, Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
   Valedon is serving 13 years on a criminal attempt charge; Davila
is serving five years for first-degree robbery; Westberg is serving
eight years for first-degree robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and Virginia officials are investigating the
shootings, and would not say whether Westberg was struck directly
or injured by rubber bullets which may have ricocheted off the
floor or a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Valedon, Davila and Westberg are three of the 480 Connecticut
prisoners who have been transferred to Wallens Ridge. Gov. John G.
Rowland and corrections officials say the transfers are needed to
ease overcrowding in Connecticut prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's contract with Virginia allows 500 inmates to be
housed at Wallens Ridge for $11 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have accused guards at the Virginia prison of
racial intolerance, and the FBI is investigating allegations of
abuse made by New Mexico inmates who were shipped to the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time there is a use of force in our prisons or in
Virginia, we're concerned,'' Polce said. ''We want to investigate
this incident and assure that proper policy and procedure was
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut DOC guards do not carry guns or other weapons in the
enclosed cell blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Traylor, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of
Corrections, said the Wallens Ridge guards acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   He said the shootings happened Monday night after the brawling
inmates ignored verbal commands from prison guards to stop. The
guards also fired blank warning shots before shooting the rubber
bullets, Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates were treated for injuries at the prison infirmary,
Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of the injuries were serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor said the fighting inmates were hit in the lower
extremities with so-called stinger rounds -- hard, rubber balls
about 1/3 of an inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Westberg's mother, Carol Westberg, said her son was hit twice in
the back but did not receive immediate medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something very wrong with the system down there,''
Carol Westberg said. ''My son is not safe. None of the inmates are
safe.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Composite Index has lost another 100
points in early trading today. The Nasdaq lost 189.22 to 4,644
yesterday and is down about 8 percent from its record high close of
March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average is up six points in today's
early going. Advancing and declining issues are evenly split on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 101 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is down four points.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again seem to be taking their profits out of the tech
sector and running for cover as the first quarter comes to a close.
</P>

   High-tech stocks have sold off for three days straight,
including sharp losses the past two.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimistic mood extended to overseas markets today.
</P>

   Analysts say the question remains whether investors will simply
cash out of the technology shares, or whether they will put their
profits to work elsewhere in the market.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 62.98; Nasdaq Down 53.17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today, with
blue-chip stocks once again attracting money away from technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 62.98 at 11,081.70.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which lists most of the world's
leading technology companies, was down 53.17 at 4,591.50 after
tumbling more than 100 points at the start of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 4.82 at 1,503.70.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have been in a protracted slide since March
10, when the Nasdaq closed at a record high of 5,048.62. Investors
are selling off shares of the companies that have performed
especially well in the year to date, hoping to capture profits.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Healtheon/WebMD fell 2 13/16 to 27~, and Cisco Systems
fell 5/16 to 75}.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, United Technologies rose 1{ to 59[ and WalMart rose 1
13/16 to 60 9/16, pacing the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The market was rattled by a report that the U.S. economy soared
to an annual growth rate of 7.3 percent in the final three months
of 1999, the strongest performance in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the gross domestic product -- the country's total
output of goods and services -- was sharper than analysts had
expected, and raised worries that the Federal Reserve will continue
raising interest rates in order to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates five times since last June, but so far
has seen little concrete evidence that the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 136.56 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.90 to 539.10.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes declined sharply. Japan's Nikkei stock average
fell 1.3 percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was
down 2.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.7 percent, and
France's CAC-40 was down 3.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Ally agrees to inform on Merlino  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A former ally of reputed gangland leader
Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino has agreed to provide information to
federal authorities linking Merlino and others to a 1993 shooting
that started a mob war, a newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetano ''Tommy Horsehead'' Scafidi would be the first member of
Merlino's inner circle to cooperate and could help authorities
build a case against top Merlino associates who have thus far
avoided indictment, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the U.S. Attorney's office nor the FBI would comment on
the continuing investigation into the Merlino organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper quoted sources familiar with the case who
asked not to be identified as saying Scafidi's decision to
cooperate was devastating for Merlino, with one describing it as
''the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Scafidi, 35, serving an 82-month sentence after pleading guilty
to racketeering charges in 1995, was scheduled to appear before a
federal grand jury after finalizing a cooperating agreement with
authorities earlier this month, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Scafidi was expected to provide an account of the 1993 attempted
murder of Joseph ''Joey Chang'' Ciancaglini, which started a war
between the Merlino faction of the mob and an organization headed
by then-mob boss John Stanfa. Ciancaglini was a Stanfa underboss.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI document made public in 1996 said Scafidi told another
mob informant the hit was ordered by Merlino and Merlino's top
associate, Michael Ciancaglini, brother of Joseph Ciancaglini.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Merlino and George Borgesi, a Merlino associate
Scafidi was expected to implicate, sharply questioned Scafidi's
credibility, saying he was testifying for his own benefit and his
testimony could not be corroborated.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Study Ethics Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- An AIDS study conducted in Uganda has raised
ethical concerns about whether uninfected sexual partners were put
at risk by researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins University researchers tracked 415 heterosexual
couples in several rural villages in which one partner was infected
with HIV and one was not. Despite receiving free condoms, the
couples rarely used them.
</P>
<P>
   During 30 months of observation, 90 people in the study caught
the virus. The study found that the higher the level of HIV in the
infected person's blood, the higher the risk of passing on the
virus through sex.
</P>
<P>
   The study was presented at a conference in January. The findings
were published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine with
an editorial by Dr. Marcia Angell questioning the study's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people agree that investigators assume some
responsibility for their human subjects, but how much?'' Angell
wrote. ''Our ethical standards should not depend on where the
research is performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell said the manner in which the study was conducted ''meant
that for up to 30 months, several hundred people with HIV infection
were observed but not treated.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, it was left up to the infected member of
each couple whether to inform the uninfected partner of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study was approved by five ethics review boards, including
one in Uganda, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We gave them a better standard of care than is available to
poor people in the U.S.,'' said Dr. Thomas C. Quinn, the study's
lead author and a professor of medicine at Hopkins. ''We would
never have done this story if it was unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ethical concerns, the study results could have
important implications for the future of the AIDS epidemic in the
United States, where drug treatment has lowered virus levels for
many.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS treatments in recent years have saved many lives, and
public health experts speculate that they may have an additional
benefit -- slowing the epidemic by making infected people less
likely to pass the virus to others.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Army Officer Files Complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army's most senior female officer has
accused a fellow general of sexual harassment, The Washington Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the Army's
deputy chief of staff for intelligence, filed a complaint stemming
from an incident in her Pentagon office in 1996. The Times quoted
an unidentified Army source as saying Kennedy accused the fellow
general of ''inappropriate touching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army today refused to comment on the Times report. Col.
Edwin Veiga, an Army spokesman, said that as a matter of standard
practice, ''We're not going to verify whether there's an ongoing
investigation or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Veiga said Kennedy, when informed of the Times article, said she
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper report did not say when Kennedy filed her
complaint, nor did it identify the accused general.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said the Defense Department inspector general's office
is investigating the accusation and has interviewed people who were
on Kennedy's staff in 1996 when she was a major general and held
the position of assistant deputy chief for intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hansen, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the Defense
Department inspector general's office is not investigating the
matter. It is possible that the Army's own inspector general is
handling the matter, but the Army would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said a former officer told its reporter that he was
interviewed by the accused general's defense lawyer, who asked him
about Kennedy's ''demeanor on a certain October date in 1996 and
about her office layout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times said it could not learn the identity of the accused
general. The newspaper said an Army lawyer it believed to be
representing the accused general declined to comment to its
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 52, is not married. She recently told her staff that
she plans to retire this summer.

<HEADLINE> Camden Mayor Milton Milan indicted, surrenders to federalauthoritries  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Camden Mayor Milton Milan has been indicted
on unspecified federal charges and surrendered to federal
authorities this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, 37, a first-term Democrat elected in 1997, has been under
scrutiny by federal authorities in a wide-ranging investigation of
alleged corruption in Camden city government. A grand jury
subpoenaed Milan's payroll records and requested information about
political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the grand jury spent a full day behind closed
doors with federal prosecutors, leading to speculation that an
indictment was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Milan emerged from his City Hall office around 10:30 a.m. and
told reporters outside that he had been indicted and was going to
the U.S. Attorney's office two blocks away to turn himself in.
Milan was accompanied by his lawyer, Carlos A. Martir Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Martir confirmed that his client had been indicted, but said he
did not know the specific charges. He said Milan had a 10:30
appointment to meet with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney scheduled a 1:30 news conference to discuss
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Milan asserted that he was ''absolutely not guilty'' of any
charges and said the entire matter was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political procedure. What could not be done
politically has been turned into a criminal procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan then walked to the federal courthouse surrounded by a
throng of reporters. Traffic stopped and people poured out of
office buildings along the route to watch the procession.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the pace of the federal inquiry had quickened
as city lawmakers were subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury
and questioned about a wide range of issues including city
contracts, organized crime and contractors who performed repairs on
Milan's East Camden home.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's name also was mentioned prominently in the recent
federal trial of two men convicted as leaders of a Camden drug
ring. Several witnesses claimed that Milan sold drugs in Camden in
the 1980s and bought several shipments of cocaine before becoming
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Milan's East Camden home and City Hall office were
raided by FBI agents who carted away boxes of documents.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation dragged on for at least two years, Milan
maintained a high public profile, vehemently denying any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first Hispanic mayor of this desperately poor city of
87,000 located on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine Corps veteran and former contractor, he was elected to
city council in 1995 and became council president a year later. He
parlayed his popularity into a run for mayor to make Camden
political history.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today, with technology
shares dragging the Nasdaq composite lower for a fourth straight
session and weighing on other market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 9.46 at 11,028.18.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which lists most of the world's

<P>
   ''Technology specialists are starting to use the 'v' word --
value,'' said Zane Brown, vice president at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co.
''People are questioning valuations and are less willing to buy
technology stocks at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   The market was rattled by reports that Tiger Management, an
investment company that focuses on hedge funds, will soon close.
Tiger, run by renowned money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr., was
once among the world's largest hedge fund families with $21 billion
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's assets have shrunk to about $6 billion, but investors
still fear its shutdown will create a less liquid market, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were further unnerved by a report that the U.S.
economy soared to an annual growth rate of 7.3 percent in the final
three months of 1999, the strongest performance in 15 years.

<P>
   The Fed has raised rates five times since last June, but so far
has seen little concrete evidence that the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the European Central Bank left key interest rates
unchanged as ebbing inflation, stable exchange rates and moderate
wage contracts calmed policymakers. Most European stock indexes
were lower, however, extending a selloff that began before the
interest rate announcement.
</P>

Study finds religious actions and words equally important to
children
</P>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Challenging the old saying that
''actions speak louder than words,'' a Purdue University study
indicates actions and words are equally important in children's
religious upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Okagaki, an associate professor of child development, said
actions like regular church attendance and service projects shaped
children, but ''it was regular, specific conversations about
religious beliefs that gave students a more accurate perception of
what their parents actually believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not enough for parents to just model beliefs for their
kids,'' Okagaki concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology, was
based on interviews with 58 girls and 36 boys about their parents'
beliefs.

Unusual council formed to restore Pat Robertson's clergy status
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Religious broadcaster and politician
Pat Robertson, who quit the Southern Baptist ministry when he ran
for president in 1988, has restored his clergy status.
</P>
<P>
   An ad hoc interdenominational council gathered to hear Robertson
reaffirm clergy vows at his headquarters on Monday. Normally,
Protestant ministers are ordained by a religious denomination or a
local congregation. Members of the council were:
</P>
<P>
   D.G.S. Dhinakaran of Chennau, India; Jack Hayford of The Church
on the Way in Van Nuys, Calif., a prominent Charismatic movement
leader; John Howe of Orlando, Fla., a bishop of the Episcopal
Church; Frank Hughes, a retired Baptist pastor in Chesapeake, Va.;
Vinson Synan, divinity school dean at Robertson's Regent
University; and Thomas Trask, chief executive of the Assemblies of
God, a major Pentecostal denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The six stood in a semicircle, placed their hands on the
kneeling Robertson's shoulders and prayed as 550 onlookers shouted
''Hallelujah'' and ''Praise the Lord.'' Friends and coworkers
watched on closed-circuit TV.
</P>
<P>
   There was disagreement over the ceremony. The Rev. Donald
Dunlap, who was pastor of Freemason Street Baptist Church in
Norfolk when Robertson asked to have his clergy credentials there
terminated, contends the action has no standing. ''You cannot
reaffirm what no longer exists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson did not speak with reporters after the ceremony. In a
prepared statement, he said he wanted re-ordination to affirm to
''God and man that the focus of what is left of my life will be to
worldwide Christian service.''
</P>
<P>
   Having just turned 70, Robertson said he has no plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Synan said that although Robertson thought it would have been
inappropriate for an ordained minister to be U.S. president,
''there was never a time when he was not anointed to preach the
good news.''

Conservative rabbis mark centennial with optimism
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Rabbinical Assembly, the organization of
1,500 rabbis in Judaism's Conservative branch, heard mainly upbeat
messages at its 100th anniversary meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of Jewish Theological Seminary,
said American Jews in the next generation are ''blessed as never
before'' in a nation that is largely free of anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Conservatism needs a complete overhaul and upgrade
of synagogue education and day schools. A new preschool program is
now being developed.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis' meeting also passed resolutions against ''the
imposition of religious beliefs and practices within the public
sphere,'' including prayers at public school athletic events.
Resolutions also criticized the Republican Congress over its tax
cut plan and failure to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty.

Hastert seeks to put Catholic chaplain flap behind him
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Days after appointing the first Roman Catholic
chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives, Speaker Dennis
Hastert gave a talk at the dedication of a Catholic school, then
told reporters it's time to put to rest allegations of
anti-Catholic bias that have plagued the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tolerate the politics of division,'' said Hastert, who
is Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who steered clear of the bias allegations during his
talk, said he agreed to attend the school dedication months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the dedication was Cardinal Francis George, who had
suggested the new House chaplain, the Rev. John Coughlin, to
Hastert, along with other possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe next time there will be a Jewish rabbi as chaplain,''
the cardinal said. ''I'd like to see that.''

California diocese holds apology liturgy for clergy abuse victims
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- In an emotional ritual, the region's
Roman Catholic diocese made a public apology to victims of abuse by
priests.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop John S. Cummins joined fellow clergy, victims and their
families for the service, during which the diocese expressed deep
regret for the ''grave evil'' of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure of many of the leaders of the Catholic Church to
confront this abuse head-on, to ... remove priest abusers and other
employees from active ministry, or to take the side of the victims,
has been one of the more distressing aspects of the of the church's
recent history,'' Cummins stated.
</P>
<P>
   Some 130 people attended the service, held in a lodge hall
because some victims did not want to enter a church. Several
victims told their stories during the event.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the millennial year, Pope John Paul II has asked
forgiveness for Christians' offenses throughout history and other
Catholic leaders have offered similar pleas for pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston also
apologized for sexual abuse by priests.

Online booksellers agree to caution on anti-Semitic book
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Anti-Defamation League said the online
booksellers Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com have agreed to give
prominent place on their Web sites to an ADL statement identifying
''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' as an anti-Semitic forgery
devised by the secret police of Czarist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and Noble also agreed that its retail stores will shelve
the book under world history rather than ''Judaica.''
</P>
<P>
   The online statement calls the book ''a major weapon in the
arsenals of anti-Semites around the world, republished and
circulated by individuals, hate groups and governments to convince
the gullible as well as the bigoted that Jews have schemed and
plotted to take over the world.''

Mob attack shuts Baptist seminary in Nigeria
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Baptist seminary in Kaduna, Nigeria,
was nearly destroyed and three students and eight others were
killed during late February rioting by a Muslim mob, Baptist Press
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Most buildings on campus were burned down and seminary President
Uche Enyioha said it would cost up to $5.3 million to replace them.
Many books were destroyed in the library, which had just reached
the 10,000 items required for accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 seminary students and nearby residents tried
unsuccessfully to defend the campus against a mob that numbered in
the thousands, missionaries told Baptist Press.
</P>
<P>
   The seminary board has decided to resume classes for graduating
seniors after Easter in a Baptist chapel to the south. The board
hopes the other students can be called back by January, but is
unsure whether to rebuild at the present campus or relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Both mosques and churches were burned, and hundreds killed,
during the four-day conflict between Muslims and Christians.
Trouble began when Christians called public marches to protest a
proposal to impose Islamic religious law on all citizens of Kaduna
province, in northern Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''I started out three, four years ago being very
critical. I felt, I hate these people,'' the author said. But her
hostility lessened as work progressed on a book about religious
fundamentalists in Israel, Egypt, Iran and the United States. ''I
could smell the fear and outrage and despair. I found myself
feeling much more sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   British author Karen Armstrong, 55, was speaking about ''The
Battle for God'' (Knopf, 442 pages, $27.50). It's something of a
sequel to ''A History of God,'' in which she surveyed how Jews,
Christians and Muslims have conceived of the deity over four
millennia.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of that serious work of religious history on 1993
best-seller lists caused a minor sensation and left Armstrong
herself with ''complete astonishment. I felt religious people would
not want to read it and secularists wouldn't be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Battle for God'' might provoke interest, too, since most
everyone seems either thrilled, appalled or puzzled by right-wing
religion's ability to thrive in modern culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentalism'' is a slippery term that is rejected by many
of those commonly grouped under that label. Armstrong admits the
difficulties of defining it, but writes that it's an apt
designation for ''embattled forms of spirituality, which have
emerged as a response to a perceived crisis,'' namely the fear that
modernity will eradicate faith and morality.
</P>
<P>
   Although Armstrong presents fundamentalists as paranoid, she
also writes that ''the idea of a divinely revealed law is
profoundly incompatible with the modern ethos'' and downright
''repellent'' to modern secularists.
</P>
<P>
   The new book focuses on Protestants and skips Armstrong's
childhood faith of Roman Catholicism, which she said is only
partially fundamentalist. Pope John Paul II is pushing ''radical
traditionalism,'' she remarked, but simultaneously ''has a
positive, pluralist outlook against the intolerance of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In true fundamentalism, tolerance is sin.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong begins her tale in 1492, the fateful year in which
Spain expelled the Jews, seized the Muslims' last stronghold and
dispatched Christopher Columbus to spread Christendom to the New
World.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the European Enlightenment began putting intellectual
culture at odds with traditional supernaturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong sees an obvious ''family resemblance'' among the
resulting fundamentalists in Judaism, Christianity and Islam (as
well as parallel movements in world religions the book does not
treat).
</P>
<P>
   The chronological connections are intriguing. Was it mere
coincidence that the Baal Shem Tov established Hasidism, the
ecstatic form of Judaism, in 1735, a year after the similarly
emotional Great Awakening erupted in Protestant Massachusetts? Or
that U.S. fundamentalist Jerry Falwell founded Moral Majority only
months after the Ayatollah Khomeini established Iran's radical
Islamic regime?
</P>
<P>
   But things should not be carried too far. Falwell never thought
of taking part in government and he employed ballots, never
bullets. The tactic that secularists used against Falwellian
fundamentalists was ridicule, says Armstrong, while Muslim
insurgents in Egypt and pre-revolutionary Iran suffered prison, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalist groups are innovative and modern in their
thinking and use of technology, Armstrong observes. As they leave
their purist enclaves to enter politics they often violate the
faiths they claim to preserve. She says this constitutes religious
''defeat,'' no matter what gains the groups achieve.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Iran sent hordes of children into combat, took
American civilians as hostages, and issued a death sentence against
author Salman Rushdie without a formal trial -- all actions that
violated Muslim teaching. Khomeini's Iran also abandoned the
longstanding belief of Muslim Shi'ism that the clergy should be
strictly non-political.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong says she feels more kindly toward the Israel's Haredim
and the Muslim radicals than U.S. Protestant right-wingers because
they've suffered more. That could explain the book's glaring
omissions (e.g., Christian Coalition), superficial analysis and
inadequate contexting when it turns to the Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Readers will find more depth in works on U.S. fundamentalists by
Nancy Ammerman, George Marsden or William Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who just completed a forthcoming brief biography of
the Buddha, has had personal ties with all three faiths she writes
about in ''The Battle for God.'' She is a teacher at a Reform
Jewish seminary in London, belongs to a Muslim scholarly group, and
spent seven youthful years in a strict Roman Catholic convent
without taking final vows as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   After the convent experience, ''I was very opposed to religion.
By study of the faiths I came back to a new sense of the divine,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she does not worship or identify with any religious
community. She calls herself ''a freelance monotheist. I draw
nourishment from all three faiths and can't see one of them as
superior.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Cancels Protested Cartoon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even God gets canceled if he can't pull in the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has pulled the plug on ''God, the Devil and Bob,'' the
cartoon that several network affiliates refused to run because of
its controversial subject matter, the network said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation was because of low ratings, not because of the
boycott by its affiliates, spokeswoman Maria Battaglia said.
</P>
<P>
   The midseason replacement comedy featured God as a character,
drawn to look suspiciously like the late Grateful Dead singer Jerry
Garcia, who meets Bob in a bar and helps him tackle moral dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   But the show ran into another deity -- Regis Philbin. Last week,
''God, the Devil and Bob'' drew just under 6 million viewers, an
audience one-fifth the size of ABC's competing ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Only four episodes of the cartoon were aired.
</P>
<P>
   A religious advocacy group denounced the show for its
''tasteless and trivial portrayal of God.'' Nearly two dozen of
NBC's 220 affiliates decided not to run it.
</P>
<P>
   NBC didn't seem to mind, figuring any attention helps. But the
show received mediocre reviews, and audiences didn't bother seeking
it out.

<HEADLINE> GOP Sweetens Marriage Tax Cut Plan  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican legislation to provide $248 billion
in tax cuts over 10 years to millions of married couples, including
those who pay more than if they were single, was approved today by
the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only does it reduce families' tax burden, it eliminates
some of the most egregious examples of unfairness and complexity in
the tax code today,'' said the panel's chairman, Sen. William Roth,
R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, much larger than a 10-year, $182 billion House-passed
version, is expected to reach the Senate floor by mid-April.
President Clinton has already threatened to veto the House bill
because it would consume too much of the projected budget surplus,
and Democrats said the same fate would meet the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will not be signed into law,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved on an 11-9 party-line vote by the Finance
Committee included a change sought by GOP conservatives to
gradually adjust the 28 percent tax rate so it applies to more of a
married couple's income. filers. The bill would do the same thing
to the 15 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, two people who are married pay income taxes
at higher rates in both the 15 percent and 28 percent brackets than
they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million couples nationwide are hit by the tax code's
marriage penalty, while millions more in which one spouse earns
most of the income get a marriage ''bonus.'' Moynihan said more
than half of the GOP bill's tax relief would go to these bonus
couples, but Republicans countered that all families deserve help.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is meaningful relief to a group of Americans who really
need it,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would raise the income cutoff by $2,500 for
lower-income couples who claim the earned-income tax credit, up
from $2,000 in the original bill and the House measure. This change
was suggested by Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would gradually raise the standard deduction
for married couples to twice that of single filers and permanently
ensure that taxpayers who claim middle-class credits, such as the
$500 per-child tax credit, do not become ensnared in the
alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Finance Committee failed to win approval of an
alternative by Moynihan that would have eventually allowed couples
the choice of filing their income taxes as singles or as a married
couple.

<HEADLINE> Jackson, Others Barred From School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- A judge has approved a permanent injunction
barring the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a white supremacist and numerous
other protesters from demonstrating within 50 feet of any Decatur
high school.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Macon County Circuit Judge James A. Hendrian
extends a temporary injunction he granted in December after Jackson
came to Decatur to protest the expulsions of six black students for
fighting in the stands at a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Kenneth Arndt called the ruling barring Jackson
and white supremacist Matt Hale ''good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Myers Jr., lead counsel for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, said he plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just more of that board building walls rather than
bridges,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Over about 10 days in November, protesters were in Decatur
almost daily, mostly on or near the grounds of Eisenhower High
School.
</P>
<P>
   At that school's football game Sept. 17, students got involved
in a bleacher-clearing brawl that ended with six expelled for two
years. The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition fought to cut the expulsions to
one year and has since rallied against the kind of zero tolerance
discipline policy used in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrian said the controversy could be a detriment to Decatur
education.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no doubt that if PUSH is allowed to continue its
demonstrations, prayer vigils, rallies and press conferences in the
same manner as it has done in the immediate past, there will be
further continuing and irreparable disruptions to the educational
process in the three Decatur high schools,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, a jury found Rainbow/PUSH Coalition supporter
John T. Cunningham guilty of resisting police during a protest on
Nov. 16. He is scheduled to be sentenced May 30 for a brief
struggle he had with an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and another defendant have a hearing Monday in
connection with the demonstration.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Eyes Non-Burger Eateries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) -- McDonald's Corp., is planning to increase
the number of its non-hamburger restaurants this year, a
spokeswoman for the world's largest fast-food chain said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's will open 160 to 180 new restaurants under its
Chipotle Mexican Grill, Donatos Pizza and London-based Aroma Cafe
brands, spokeswoman Anna Rozenich said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are 60 Chipotle, 147 Donatos and 30 Aromas currently
operating. Rozenich could not say how many restaurants will be
added to each chain.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's also plans to add between 1,800 to 1,900 hamburger
restaurants this year, with 90 percent of the expansion taking
place outside the United States, Rozenich said. The Oak Brook-based
chain added 1,790 restaurants last year, bring its total to 26,800.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant giant, which had sales of $38.5 billion last
year, has been receiving stiff competition from other fast-food
chains like Wendy's and Burger King. McDonald's became an investor
in the Chipotle chain in 1998 and acquired the Donatos and Aroma
Cafe chains last year to ensure continued growth of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, McDonald's agreed to purchase 751 Boston Market
restaurants and the franchise rights for an additional 108
restaurants from bankrupt Boston Chicken Inc. The purchase is
expected to close this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Boston Market restaurants will be closed or turned into
McDonald's, Chipotle or Donatos Pizza outlets, according to
Rozenich.

<HEADLINE> Corzine apologizes for jokes about Italian-Americans  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Jon S. Corzine, the former Wall Street
executive seeking the Democratic nomination for Senate in New
Jersey, has apologized for two remarks that played on stereotypes
of Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The two remarks were publicized Wednesday by Manny Alfano,
chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee, who demanded
an apology from Corzine for ''ethnic slurs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I never intended to cause embarrassment. I never intended to
offend,'' Corzine said Thursday. ''I shouldn't have said what I am
reported to have said, and if I did, I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he did apologize to the people offended by the
remarks. He stopped short of admitting that he made them.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who said he is of Italian descent, offered the apology
at a news conference at which he accepted the endorsement of Unite
Garment Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Minority Leader Joseph Doria, who attended the news
conference, said the remarks being attributed to Corzine are a
distraction created by Gov. Jim Florio's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, Doria said he had no direct evidence linking the
comments, which were reported by The New York Times on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The first remark occurred several months ago at a restaurant in
Newark, where Corzine was seeking the support of six prominent
Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano said that upon being introduced to a lawyer named David
Stein, Corzine remarked, ''Who is Dave Stein? He's not Italian, is
he? Oh, I guess he's your Jewish lawyer who is here to get the rest
of you out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Alfano, the second remark occurred two weeks ago
when Corzine met an Italian-American businessman and quipped, ''Oh,
you make cement shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Goldstein, one of Corzine's two campaign managers, said
the candidate ''never, ever'' uttered the alleged reference to the
''Jewish lawyer.'' Stein, the lawyer in question, said he did meet
with Corzine four to six months ago but does not recall the comment
in question.
</P>
<P>
   As for the balance of the statements attributed to the
candidate, Goldstein said, ''Jon Corzine never intended to offend
anyone by his remarks. He believes he should not have said
something like this and he apologizes for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, is locked in a
hard-hitting primary battle with Florio for the Democratic
nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   One in four New Jersey Democrats has Italian roots, including
Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano, who lives in Bloomfield, said Thursday that he is not a
supporter ''yet'' of either Florio or Corzine. He said he went
public with Corzine's statements to defend Italian-Americans, not
to score political points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry, but this constant barrage of mob movies, the
Sopranos (television show) ... people think they can say anything
to Italians and we're not going to be offended,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Five Die in Ohio House Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- A 33-year-old woman and four teen-agers died
when they were trapped inside a burning two-story house.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Bunley, the woman's 41-year-old fiance, escaped the blaze
Wednesday night by jumping from an upstairs window, fire Chief Bob
Brinkman said today. He was hospitalized in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Wright, 33; her children Marshonda, 13, and Marquis, 16;
and Bunley's children Rodnina Bunley, 17, and Ravis Bunley, 14,
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief John Brookman said investigators believe the fire
started on the house's first floor, probably on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   Erin O'Brien, who lives next door, said she heard Bunley playing
and laughing with the children less than half an hour before
hearing an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard this loud crash and then somebody started
screaming,'' O'Brien said. ''It happened so quick and so fast we
couldn't even get the car out of the driveway.''

<HEADLINE> HBO Documentary Studies Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Joseph Lovett would have had enough personal
incentive to make a documentary about cancer had he been thinking
only about his father, dead at age 48 from colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only where his family's sad saga begins. The same
disease killed his brother Raul at 55. His sister, Tricia, died of
ovarian cancer at 61. Lung cancer claimed his brother Bill at 63.
</P>
<P>
   If Lovett didn't have regular screenings of his colon, one of
which detected the beginning stages of cancer, ''I would be dead
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 2{-hour documentary, ''Cancer: Evolution to Revolution,''
Lovett tries to erase the stigma of cancer and empower people who
have been diagnosed with the disease. The show premieres on HBO
Thursday at 8 p.m., and will also be shown next Wednesday and on
April 8, 11 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doing a film on cancer has allowed me to face my own fears,''
he said. ''I've learned that there is a whole new way of thinking
about and dealing with cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of American men and one-third of American women are
diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives. There are 1.2
million new cancer diagnoses each year in this country, and 560,000
people die from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's still a word spoken only in whispers among many people,
if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been such a denial about the disease,'' Lovett said.
''We hear people all the time saying, 'I don't know anyone who has
had cancer.' That's just not possible. It's like saying, 'I don't
know anyone who is Jewish or gay.' Well, you just haven't asked
that many people.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms so simple and expressive to be almost frightening, the
documentary describes the latest theories about how cancer
develops. Instead of being a foreign invader like a virus, cancer
is a traitor -- a good cell that misbehaves and then multiplies,
explains Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer used to be considered a death sentence. Now, however,
most patients diagnosed will not die because of that cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The film introduces Gary Schine, a businessman from Providence,
R.I., who was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia and told that he
was going to die because there was no cure. Schine and his wife did
their own research and located a clinical trial of a potential
cure. He's been cancer-free for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of stories convinced Lilly Tartikoff, widow of
television executive Brandon Tartikoff, to get involved as one of
the documentary's narrators.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's cancer was initially misdiagnosed and -- against
his instincts -- he sought second opinions and more aggressive
treatment. Tartikoff is convinced this added 16 years to her
husband's life.
</P>
<P>
   It's the documentary's most insistent message: Take control of
your own health. Seek second opinions, learn everything you can
about your disease through the Internet, and be aggressive about
treating it. Don't assume the first doctor you see knows everything
about all forms of cancer; things are changing all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's easier and simpler to just believe in your doctor,''
Tartikoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett tells the stories of different cancers through patients
who are living with them. There's Jessica Turri, an 11-year-old
leukemia patient in Memphis, and Vanessa Colbert, a 41-year-old
breast cancer patient in Houston, who uses support groups to help
her cope.
</P>
<P>
   HBO is launching a companion Web site, at HBO.com, together with
leading cancer organizations and specialists to disseminate more
information. In the documentary, phone numbers and Web addresses
are constantly flashed on the screen. It makes the film drier, but
the information might literally be a lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are stunned at how much support is available to them
for free,'' Lovett said.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary stresses the need for early detection and
screening, which Lovett believes kept him alive. Cervical cancer,
for example, is almost totally preventable if the signs are caught
in time. And older men should get their prostates checked
regularly, the film urges.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we wait for the symptoms to bring us to the doctor, it's
generally too late,'' Lovett said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Stitton, a colon cancer patient, travels to France for
drugs that aren't available to him in the United States. Despite
some initial encouraging signs, Stitton dies from the disease -- the
documentary's sobering reminder that despite advances, cancer is
still a formidable adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Also sobering was the experience of Anthony Radziwill, who
worked with Lovett at ABC News. Lovett, a veteran television
producer who reported on the AIDS epidemic for ABC, became involved
in the cancer project partly through Radziwill.
</P>
<P>
   A nephew of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Radziwill wasn't able to
see the project through to completion; he died of cancer last
summer a few days after his 40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to save other lives was the driving force of the
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is an example of how television can be used at
its best,'' Lovett said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Visits D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council took seats in the
historic Old Senate Chamber today for a greeting and a civics
lesson from Sen. Jesse Helms. The ardent critic of the world body
reminded the visiting delegates of the Senate's ''unique role'' in
U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's been suggested to you that the president alone''
speaks on behalf of the United States on foreign policy matters,
Helms, R-N.C., said. ''Not in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates accepted Helms' invitation after he became the
first U.S. lawmaker to address the Security Council last January.
All 15 members came from New York, billing it as an unofficial
visit, and arriving individually.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to the heart of democracy,'' Helms, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a fierce past critic of the
world body, said as he welcomed delegates to his turf.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he had done in his New York speech, Helms mixed
cordiality with a few digs at the world body.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew it was ''difficult for some visitors'' to
understand the ''unique role the Senate plays,'' including the
power to ratify treaties, confirm ambassadors and -- with the House
-- pay for foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my hope that this may be helpful to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms spoke to the delegates in the Old Senate Chamber, used for
Senate sessions from 1810 to 1859 but now chiefly for ceremonial
events.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the delegates joined senators for lunch. In a toast, Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the panel's senior Democrat, said he hope
the daylong visit in addition to promoting better understanding
would show Security Council members ''how disorganized we are -- and
how many different voices we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Security Council president, Bangladesh Ambassador
Anwarul Chowdhury, toasted the Senate in return and said both
organizations ''seek the understanding and realization that the
United Nations is the most-needed organization in today's world.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the State Department, the delegates stood before the
flags of their countries and were greeted by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is truly a unique occasion and one that I think is very,
very important and I thank them all for not only going the extra
mile, but the extra 200 miles to get here,'' said Albright, herself
a former U.N. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Council members arrived for the unprecedented visit on their
own, stressing the individual invitations. Russia's U.N. Ambassador
Sergey Lavrov declined to ride in a bus from the airport with a
group of other ambassadors. Instead he went in a Russian Embassy
car.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would be outspoken, Lavrov said: ''You know that
being in a private capacity means we would be acting on impulses,
not instructions, so we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials were not sure how the day would play out as
the diplomats met with members of the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, doing a little ground work in
advance, called Biden to ask if there would be ''an ambush by
anyone'' during today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''None that I know of,'' Biden said he tried to assure
Holbrooke. In fact, a cordial visit seemed most likely, Biden
suggested, even though many frictions remain.
</P>
<P>
   The day's itinerary called for a tour of the Capitol, a talk by
the Senate historian, an underground trolley ride to one of the
Senate office buildings, a luncheon, and a ''roundtable
discussion'' with Helms' committee.
</P>
<P>
   Council members were to visit the White House and attend a
dinner with Albright as host.
</P>
<P>
   While ambassadors initially were skeptical about Helms'
invitation, they later seemed to warm up to it -- and see the visit
it as a good way to help mend frayed U.S.-U.N. relations.
</P>
<P>
   Council members may use the occasion to try to press for more
installments on U.S. back dues. The United Nations puts the figure
at $1.7 billion but the United States calculates it at closer to $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year voted to pay $926 million of the arrears over
three years. The United States paid a $100 million installment late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But to get the balance, the United Nations must meet about a
dozen conditions drafted by Helms and Biden. Those terms generally
have not been well received in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They include a reduction the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget from the current 31 percent to 25 percent and of the regular
budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Lawyer Makes Pitch to Jury  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Three cancer-stricken smokers seeking $14.4 million
in damages made excuses for smoking years after warning labels went
on cigarette packs, a tobacco industry attorney said today in
closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should these three plaintiffs be paid a lot of money with a
jury verdict that rewards them for choosing to smoke cigarettes for
many years?'' Philip Morris attorney Dan Webb asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Freedom to choose requires acceptance of responsibility for
choices that we make,'' he said, repeating a standard industry
theme in smokers' personal-injury lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Industry attorneys are making their final pitch to avoid paying
anything to the three representatives of an estimated 500,000
ailing Florida smokers represented by the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which already has decided the industry conspired to
make a dangerous product, is expected to begin deliberating early
next week in the nation's first smokers' class action suit to reach
trial.
</P>
<P>
   If any money is awarded, the same panel will be asked to award
punitive damages to the group to punish cigarette makers. The
industry fears such an award could amount to hundreds of billions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the jury will be asked to assess the medical bills,
lost income, cost of household services the smokers are unable to
perform, pain and suffering from lung cancer in Mary Farnan and the
late Angie Della Vecchia and throat cancer in Frank Amodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and outside experts blamed smoking for each case.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has offered evidence that bronchioalveolar cancer --
a form of lung cancer that the jury decided is not linked to
smoking -- caused the cancers. It blamed industrial wood dust as a
possible cause of Amodeo's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors must consider the individual smokers' awareness of bad
conduct by cigarette makers, the choices they made whether to smoke
or quit and their personal responsibility, Webb argued.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, smokers' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt offered
the dollar figure for ''devastating, ravaging injuries'' caused by
the industry's defective products.
</P>
<P>
   Economic losses totaled $4.2 million for the three: $2.1 million
for Amodeo, $1.6 million for Farnan and $523,000 for Della Vecchia,
Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for an additional $2 million to $3 million each to
cover the intangibles -- doubts about whether Farnan will see her
9-year-old daughter graduate from high school, 19-year-old James
Della Vecchia's loss of his mother and the price Amodeo pays for
never being able to eat or drink for the rest of his life. He is
fed through a stomach tube because of throat damage.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
Liggett Group Inc. and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research
and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Boston Bar Charges Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Licensing officials dismissed charges Thursday
against a bar owner accused of mocking Black History Month with a
display of stuffed monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Daniel Pokaski said there was a lack of evidence
that the display at Tom English's Cottage was racist. The charge of
displaying objectionable material could have led to the suspension
or revocation of the bar's license.
</P>
<P>
   The case was provoked by a Boston Herald article that quoted an
unnamed bartender as saying the monkeys were a tribute to Black
History Month.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to bring it to closure,'' Pokaski said. ''What are
we dealing with? We're dealing with a remark made by a bartender.
We're not talking about life or death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bar owner Tom English did not attend the hearing. His lawyers
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   English and two bartenders testified Tuesday that the display
was not intended to demean any racial or ethnic group. He said the
monkeys were part of a tropical scene he displays every January and
February to provide some comfort in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Herald reporter David Wedge said only one bartender was on duty
when he conducted his interviews. Bartender Vincent Salamone
testified he was working when Wedge was in the bar, but denied
making the comments.
</P>
<P>
   Wedge declined to testify and said he stood by his story.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bar were dismayed by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no disputing the existence of that display,'' said
City Councilor Charles Yancey, who is black. ''It's mockery.''

<HEADLINE> House Averts Showdown on Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Averting a showdown with President Clinton,
the House refused today to require him to withdraw U.S.
peacekeepers from Kosovo unless European countries deliver more of
the aid they have promised for the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   By a 219-200 vote, lawmakers rejected a bipartisan effort to use
the threat of withdrawal to pressure the Europeans to deliver
millions of dollars more for economic, humanitarian and policing
assistance. Clinton would have had to begin withdrawing troops in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came a year after the 78-day air war against Yugoslavia
began, during which the U.S. flew about three-fourths of the
bombing missions. There are 37,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo,
including 5,300 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The least they can do after we flew all those sorties ... is
to simply keep their word'' and contribute more of what they
promised, said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the provision would have ended up giving
Europeans the power to make decisions on U.S. troop deployments --
and would have been rejected anyway by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said Kosovo is a
''permanent dilemma'' for U.S. policy-makers. Speaking at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Talbott said the
administration is seeking ''the right mixture of priorities and
values.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States came out flatly for independence, that
could destroy what has been accomplished in the province, which
remains part of Yugoslavia, he said. And the administration could
lose the support it has among European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Talbott said, if the United States appeared to be against
independence and for putting Kosovo back in Yugoslavia, ''we would
be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombing of Serbia last year forced Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to withdraw Serbian forces and special police from
Kosovo, which is dominated by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to threaten withdrawal was offered to a
wide-ranging, $13 billion measure containing $2.1 billion for the
costs of U.S. troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Had the restriction become law, the $2.1 billion would have been
cut in half on June 2 if Clinton had not certified that the
European contributions had been delivered. The remaining money
could have only been used to withdraw the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes $1.7 billion to help Colombia's
hard-pressed government battle drug traffickers and the leftist
rebels who protect them. In several votes Wednesday, the House
refused to cut those funds.
</P>
<P>
   As the House worked on the spending bill, which would provide
extra funds for this year, the Senate Budget Committee approved a
$1.83 trillion budget for 2001 on a party-line 12-10 vote.
</P>
<P>
   That Republican-written measure resembles a budget the House
approved last week for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. It would
cut taxes by at least $150 billion through 2005 and hold spending
for many domestic programs next year to $290 billion, or 2.6
percent more than this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on the budget next week, and
congressional leaders hope for final approval of a compromise
version of the measure by mid-April. The fiscal plan does not need
Clinton's signature and sets overall tax and spending targets,
leaving details for later legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House supporters of the Colombia aid package see it as a major
step toward curbing drug supplies in the United States. U.S.
officials say 90 percent of the cocaine and 65 percent of the
heroin used in the United States comes from Colombian-grown coca.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House rejected, 239-186, an effort by Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., to delay, and perhaps eventually kill, $522
million of the Colombia aid. The roll call came after House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who rarely joins floor debate, took to the
well of the chamber to ask colleagues for the full amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said the aid ''is about our children, and whether we
want our children to grow up in a society free from the scourge of
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the package would risk involving the United
States in what has been a long-running, bloody civil war that could
continue for years. They also said U.S. resources should be
directed more toward preventing drug use at home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had requested $1.3 billion for Colombia, on top of $300
million already in the pipeline, but supported the House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The money is for training and equipping Colombian troops and
police -- including 63 helicopters -- along with intelligence
operations, incentives for farmers to grow other crops, and
assisting neighbors Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the House added $4 billion to the overall bill for
the Pentagon, including funds for upgrading helicopters and AWACS
radar warning planes, equipment repair, and military housing and

<HEADLINE> Leaders can't agree on where the center of the universe is  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- While they did not pass a state budget this
week, as they are supposed to do under the state constitution, the
two top figures in the state Legislature did address a
philosophical question.
</P>
<P>
   As in: Where is the center of the state?
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver accused Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno of being fixated on his district and local
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Bruno ... thinks this state revolves around places
like Troy and Schenectady and Saratoga,'' Democrat Silver said.
''The reality is, the economic activity which drives this state
happens to be located in downtown Manhattan. A lot of the school
districts are funded as a result of what takes place down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver happens to represent a district located in downtown
Manhattan which includes Wall Street. Republican Bruno is from
upstate Rensselaer County, which includes Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Verbal sparring between Silver and Bruno usually begins this
time of year as the legislative leaders begin rounding into form so
they can throw the real rhetorical haymakers when state budget
negotiations get hot and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver's jab was a little sharper than usual.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it suggests that upstate-downstate frictions are
never far below the surface in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   For another, it hints at some legislators' views of Bruno's
benevolence to his constituents, especially since he became
majority leader in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno has been a tireless advocate for the 43rd Senatorial
District and for the nearby city of Albany, where many of his
constituents work for the state.
</P>
<P>
   He has made sure hundreds of state jobs have been relocated to
Troy, the biggest city in his district. He championed a state
bailout package to bring Troy back from the brink of bankruptcy. He
has provided state grants and other aid programs to encourage
companies to locate or expand in his district. He has aided
colleges, promoted cultural facilities, even championed a boost in
the size of purses offered for thoroughbreds running at the nearby
Saratoga Race Course, which he likes to attend each August.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller ways, Bruno has seen to it that scores of community
groups have benefitted from ''member item'' grants that Legislature
hands out.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Bruno has taken care of the 43rd Senatorial District
in a way that powerful legislators have done since legislative
bodies first formed political blocs and elected representatives to
watch out for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, acquiring the ability to produce for their districts is
one of the chief reasons that legislators strive for jobs like the
majority leader's -- that and the higher stipend, bigger staff,
feeling of power, state car, access to state aircraft, control over
patronage jobs and all the other things that go with being a
legislative leader in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Silver says he wants to deliver a gem of a project
to Manhattan in the form of a Second Avenue subway line. It would
pass through the speaker's 62nd Assembly District.
</P>
<P>
   Silver suggested he will hold up passage of a new state budget
if it does not contain a commitment to build the subway project.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's promotion of the subway had Bruno questioning where the
speaker believes the center of his world is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really laugh when I heard him talk about Troy when he is out
there, literally saying, 'I'm holding up the budget because I want
$13 billion for a Second Avenue subway which terminates in my
district,''' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno insists he is taking Silver's comments in stride as part
of Albany's time-honored spirit of political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just flailing around and saying things,'' Bruno said.
''One day he calls me this, another day he calls me that. I know
Shelly well enough to know he doesn't mean any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, by the way, is in no way apologizing for any of the
things his position as majority leader has helped produce for his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very proud of what we've done in our district,'' he said.
''I'm going to continue to advocate for things in my district, just
as he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's colleagues are well aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   When Troy Mayor Mark Pattison appeared before the Senate's
Cities Committee on Feb. 29 to ask for more state aid, chairman
Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, told the mayor, ''You don't
have any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Troy is one big member item,'' the senator said.

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Antitrust Probe Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- An antitrust investigation has begun into
allegations that gun manufacturers are targeting Smith &AMP; Wesson in
retaliation for its agreement to put safety locks on handguns,
Connecticut's attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   The probe is being conducted under state laws in Connecticut,
New York and Maryland, said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. He
said more states were expected to become involved and subpoenas
were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jorgensen, a Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman, said some gun dealers
opposed to the settlement will no longer carry the company's
models. He also said the Springfield, Mass.-based company has
received reports of attempts to pressure gun publications into
refusing Smith &AMP; Wesson advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a gun wholesaler said after the March 17 agreement
it would no longer distribute Smith &AMP; Wesson products.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is, at this point at least, the appearance of an effort
that involved concerted activity targeting Smith &AMP; Wesson by
manufacturers, distributors, dealers and possibly others,''
Blumenthal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, denied the allegations of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not be more confident that these are just independent
actions by businessmen,'' Delfay told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement with the Clinton administration, Smith &AMP; Wesson
said it would include safety locks with all handguns and pistols
within two years and that new firearms would not be able to use
magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. It also agreed to devote 2
percent of firearms revenues every year to developing technology
that limits a gun's use to its lawful owner.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, several cities, states and the federal government
agreed to drop threatened lawsuits over gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   After the agreement, wholesaler RSR Group Inc., a distributor of
Smith &AMP; Wesson products for more than 20 years said, ''we have come
to the difficult conclusion that we cannot continue to do business
with Smith &AMP; Wesson under the problematic terms of their current
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said investigators and attorneys from all three
states were interviewing witnesses but he declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent criticism of Smith &AMP; Wesson by National Rifle
Association President Charlton Heston, the organization said the
company was still welcome at its annual meeting in Charlotte, N.C.,
in May.
</P>
<P>
   After the agreement, Heston said the British owners of Smith &AMP;
Wesson do not place the same value on the Second Amendment's right
to bear arms as do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody is welcome, and I think it is good for the
organization, in this case for this foreign-owned company, to hear
from their American consumers,'' NRA spokesman Bill Powers told The
Charlotte Observer on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson said it planned to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''People within the gun movement have disagreed with each other
before in a civil manner,'' Jorgensen said.

<HEADLINE> Icahn Seeks 100M Shares of Nabisco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn said today he is prepared
to begin a cash tender offer of $13 a share for 100 million shares
of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., and said he would consider selling
the entire company if he gains control of it.
</P>
<P>
   The plans that Icahn outlined in a letter today represent his
most ambitious effort yet to gain control of the company that was
created when RJR Nabisco Holdings spun off its cigarette holdings
in the face of mounting litigation against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Parsippany, N.J.-based Nabisco Group Holdings' sole asset is
an 80.5 percent stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food company
that makes Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies and Planters nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Nabisco Group said Icahn's proposal will be
reviewed by the board and it urged shareholders to take no action
in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nabisco Group surged 29 percent on the news, rising
$2.68} to $12 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn already owns about 31 million shares of Nabisco Group and
said another 100 million shares would give him control of about 40
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is prepared to start the tender offer on April 4
provided that Nabisco drop its poison pill provision adopted
earlier this month to make a takeover by an unwanted suitor
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Nabisco board adopted the poison pill, which allows
shareholders to buy more stock at a big discount if an unwanted
takeover effort begins, after Icahn announced he intended to run a
slate of candidates for election to the board.
</P>
<P>
   In today's announcement, he said owning 40 percent of its stock
would facilitate election of his nominees for the board, and said
the new board's ''first order of business'' would be to consider
the sale of Nabisco Group at a favorable price.
</P>
<P>
   He also set two other conditions for starting the tender offer --
that Nabisco approve his purchase of shares despite a Delaware law
that would otherwise limit him to owning no more than 15 percent of
its shares and setting a new date for the annual meeting so that he
could vote the shares he purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting is currently scheduled for May 9.

<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. (AP) -- Would a Dirty Harry burger make your day?
</P>
<P>
   You may be in luck.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood's watering hole is reopening. The Hog's Breath
Inn closed last April when one of the actor's partners wanted to
get out of the 27-year-old business.
</P>
<P>
   But Palm Springs restaurateur Kaiser Morcus says he has signed a
15-year lease with Eastwood's management company to reopen the
eatery and keep its famous name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever we get the liquor license transferred and the
remodeling done, we'll open,'' Morcus said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't decided if he will keep Dirty Harry burgers on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, who portrayed the rogue detective Harry Callahan in
the ''Dirty Harry'' movies, was a one-term mayor of Carmel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Mick Jagger rolled back to his old grammar school
Thursday to open a $3.6 million community arts center named after
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones frontman graduated in 1961 from Dartford
Grammar School in Kent. Back then, he was better known for his role
in organizing a student strike to demand higher quality student
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the school assembly, Jagger praised the modern
approach taken by the current headmaster. When he was enrolled, he
said, students with an interest in music and the arts were treated
like they had ''an embarrassing illness'' that had to be kept to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, 56, also posed for photos with members of the school
band, who performed their rendition of the Rolling Stones classic
''Brown Sugar.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Brennan's Widow Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mary Fowler Brennan, wife of the late Supreme
Court Justice William J. Brennan, has died at age 83.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brennan died Tuesday at Arlington Hospital in suburban
Virginia. A court spokeswoman said she died of complications while
being treated for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brennan, a 40-year Supreme Court employee, worked for
nearly 26 years as Brennan's secretary. After the death of the
justice's first wife, he and his longtime secretary were married in
1983 -- her last day as a court employee.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wermiel, an American University law professor and
Brennan scholar, said Mrs. Brennan once told him she had been
reluctant to leave her previous Supreme Court job to work for the
justice. But she was urged by Justice Felix Frankfurter, for whom
she had worked briefly, to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan died in 1997 at age 91. He had retired in 1990 after a
34-year tenure on the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brennan's survivors include two sisters.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Charges Van Crash Company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- A company that employed seven young
magazine sellers killed in a van accident has been charged with
homicide, and its owner-manager is accused of supplying drugs to
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The seven were killed March 25, 1999, when a minivan carrying 14
people ages 15 to 22 crashed near Janesville. The driver of the van
pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and is serving seven years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The company -- YES, based in DeWitt, Iowa -- is charged with
homicide by negligent use of a vehicle, physical abuse of a child,
reckless injury and recklessly endangering safety, Attorney General
James Doyle said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   YES owner-manager Choan A. Lane is charged with delivery of a
controlled substance to a minor and contributing to the delinquency
of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says members of the sales crew used marijuana
daily and were encouraged to bring back drugs at the end of a sales
day, calling sales incentive programs ''points for joints'' and
''cash for hash.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from YES or Lane; telephone
numbers are no longer listed for them in DeWitt.

<HEADLINE> GOP Marriage Tax Measure OK'd  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of married couples would get $248
billion in tax cuts over 10 years under Republican legislation
approved Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only does it reduce families' tax burden, it eliminates
some of the most egregious examples of unfairness and complexity in
the tax code today,'' said the panel's chairman, Sen. William Roth,
R-Del. ''This bill is fair, this bill is responsible and this bill
is pro-family.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in those who would get tax cuts are the 25 million
married couples who pay higher taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, much broader than a 10-year, $182 billion House-passed
version, is expected to reach the Senate floor by mid-April, prior
to the federal income tax filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already threatened to veto the House
version because it would consume too much of the projected budget
surplus, and Democrats said the same fate would befall the Senate
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will not be signed into law,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y. ''We surely support the principle. We have serious
reservations about the costs involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Finance Committee approved the measure on an 11-9
party-line vote, including a change from the original version
sought by GOP conservatives that would gradually adjust the 28
percent tax rate so it applies to more of a married couple's
income. The bill would do the same thing to the 15 percent bracket,
as would the House version.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, two people who are married and have roughly
equal incomes pay income taxes at higher rates in both the 15
percent and 28 percent brackets than they would if they were
single. About 25 million couples nationwide are affected by the tax
code's marriage penalty, while millions more get a bonus when one
spouse earns most of the income.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP bill is too broad because it cuts income
taxes for couples in both groups -- more than half the bill's relief
would go to couples who already get bonuses -- rather than focusing
solely on those who pay a marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sadly, this is a political statement,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered that all families deserve help given
the size of the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is meaningful relief to a group of Americans who really
need it,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also would raise the income cutoff by $2,500 for
lower-income couples who claim the earned-income tax credit, up
from $2,000 in the original bill and the House measure. This change
was suggested by Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it would gradually raise the standard deduction for
married couples to twice that of single filers and permanently
ensure that taxpayers who claim middle-class credits, such as the
$500 per-child tax credit, do not become ensnared in the
alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Finance Committee failed to win approval of an
alternative by Moynihan that would have eventually allowed couples
the choice of filing their income taxes as singles or as a married
couple.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dolly Parton will be the host of the
Academy of Country Music Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The May 3 ceremony in Universal City, Calif., to be broadcast

Thursday the no-host format allowed for more performances by
country stars.

<P>
   ''Very few people have the ability to host this kind of show,''
said ACM Awards spokesman Paul Shefrin. ''There are very few Billy

<HEADLINE> GOPer Criticizes E-Mail Witnesses  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House lawyer today suggested that a
court affidavit describing the White House system for archiving
e-mail was literally true, even though it didn't disclose that many
messages were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Angering some House Republicans at a hearing, White House
counsel Beth Nolan and Justice Department lawyer Robert Raben said
they did not know who assisted the White House computer specialist
who filed the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inconceivable you come up here and not have any of the
answers,'' Rep. Dan Burton, the committee chairman, told Raben, who
promised to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Burton sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department
suggesting that the computer specialist, Daniel Barry, committed
perjury in the affidavit for a lawsuit. The affidavit stated that
''e-mail within the EOP (Executive Office of the President) system
... has been archived in the ... Automated Records Management
System.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems -- which White House officials learned of
in June 1998 -- didn't become public until February in a lawsuit
over the Clinton White House's gathering of FBI background files of
Republican appointees from past administrations. As a result of the
computer problems, perhaps hundreds of thousands of e-mails were
never reviewed to determine if they should be turned over to
Congress and prosecutors in various investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It may take 170 days to reconstruct e-mail back-up tapes and
conduct a thorough search, Nolan testified at a hearing of the
House Government Reform Committee. There are 625 back-up tapes for
Vice President Al Gore's office alone, said Nolan. The time
estimate of 170 days was a sharp reduction from an earlier estimate
of one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan suggested that the affidavit is literally true.
</P>
<P>
   ''E-mail was archived, but some e-mail was not captured,'' she
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that is not what the affidavit says,'' Burton retorted,
referring to the omission in the affidavit of any problems with the
e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said the affidavit was written in connection with events
that happened early in the Clinton administration and had nothing
to do with the e-mail problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., suggested Nolan was coming up with a legal
theory to explain away a false affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never said I was providing a legal theory,'' Nolan snapped,
but simply offering ''context.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said ''I am concerned'' that the lawyers who assisted
Barry in the preparation of his affidavit, and who counseled him at
the time the affidavit was signed, were aware that the information
was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Burton cited lawyers in the White House counsel's office as
possibly being ''involved in this deception.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 91.83; Nasdaq Down 118.85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares
dragging the Nasdaq composite index lower for a fourth straight
session and old-fashioned industrial stocks buoying the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 91.83 at 11,110.55. The Nasdaq was down 118.85 at
4,525.82.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 0.05 at 1,508.57.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have been in a slide since March 10, when the
Nasdaq closed at a record high of 5,048.62. At its current level,
the Nasdaq is within market watchers' definition of a correction --
a reversal of an upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are selling off shares of the companies that have
performed especially well in the year to date, hoping to capture
profits. Today, wireless data company Qualcomm fell 7~ to 149|, and
network gear maker Cisco Systems fell 2 11/16 to 73].
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron, a maker of network switches and software, plunged 16~
to 30~ after saying it anticipates a first-quarter loss of $25
million to $45 million as it restructures itself into four
operating companies. Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Cabletron
stock to ''market perform'' from ''market outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, aerospace company United Technologies rose 3] to 61;
3M rose 3 3/16 to 90 13/16; and Coca-Cola rose 2{ to 49], pacing
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology specialists are starting to use the 'v' word --
value,'' said Zane Brown, vice president at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co.
''People are questioning valuations and are less willing to buy
technology stocks at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   The market was rattled by the official announcement that Tiger
Management, a family of hedge funds, will soon shut down. Tiger,
run by renowned money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr., was once
among the world's largest hedge fund families with $21 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's assets have shrunk to about $6 billion, but investors
still fear its shutdown will create a less liquid market, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were further unnerved by a report that the U.S.
economy soared to an annual growth rate of 7.3 percent in the final
three months of 1999, the strongest performance in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the gross domestic product -- the country's total
output of goods and services -- was sharper than analysts had
expected, and raised worries that the Federal Reserve will continue
raising interest rates in order to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates five times since last June, but so far
has seen little concrete evidence that the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the European Central Bank left key interest rates
unchanged as ebbing inflation, stable exchange rates and moderate
wage contracts calmed policymakers. Most European stock indexes
were lower, however, extending a selloff that began before the
interest rate announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 778.66 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by
a 7-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.04 to 536.96.

<HEADLINE> Gore Backs High-Mileage Vehicles  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With high gas prices serving as a backdrop,
Vice President Al Gore announced today that the Big Three
automakers have agreed to mass produce vehicles with ''significant
improvements'' in gas mileage within four years.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles will have hybrid electric-gas engines, a concept
the automakers have been working on through the Partnership for a
New Generation of Vehicles, a government-industry initiative
started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time, we look forward to a date when remarkable
new technologies will be moving from research labs to showrooms and
dealerships across the country,'' said Gore, who did not specify
how much better the mileage would be or how many of the new
vehicles would be produced.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also got his first look today at high-mileage test cars
built by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and DaimlerChrysler
AG.
</P>
<P>
   Through the partnership, the Clinton administration challenged
automakers to develop a family-size sedan that gets at least 80
miles per gallon by 2004. None of the concept cars reached that
goal, but automakers say they show the benchmark is reachable.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the U.S. auto industry leads the world and the
partnership can help it stay on top. He also urged Congress to
extend the $4,000 tax credit now given to purchasers of electric
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we have to use this moment to make the investment
that will keep our progress and prosperity going far into the
future,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By reducing our dependence on foreign oil, by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and by positioning the American auto
industry as the world leader in a crucial new market in this new
economy, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles can help
to keep our economic engine humming for decades to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration this week said average
gasoline prices nationwide had dipped by 2 cents during the past
week to $1.55 a gallon for all grades. The private Lundberg Survey
showed a $1.59 average at 10,000 service stations it monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of gas has been a hot topic in Washington, with
truckers twice jamming city streets in protest and lawmakers
scrambling for a way to bring down prices.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Wednesday, Clinton said he hopes the
high gas prices will promote efforts to become more energy
efficient and develop alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope very much that this is a little bit of a wake-up call
for all of us and that we can put this on the front burner and get
some action,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership got $250 million from the federal government in
1999 -- much of it spent for research at government and university
laboratories -- and $980 million from the Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers unveiled their test cars in recent months. They
use lighter materials, more aerodynamic designs and electric-diesel
hybrid engines to squeeze out better fuel economy. The futuristic
designs include tiny cameras in the place of rearview mirrors,
electric controls instead of door handles and grill vents that open
only when the engine needs extra air.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wood, spokesman for the United States Council for
Automotive Research, which represents the Big Three, said that with
America's dependence on foreign oil becoming so costly, the time is
right to apply the fuel savings technologies developed through the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to wait until later on. As soon as these
technologies are available, they are going to be applied across the
board to our most popular cars,'' he said. ''We're going to work on
things that are applicable to both cars and light trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas-guzzling light trucks -- minivans, pickups and sport utility
vehicles -- are more popular than ever, amounting to 46.3 of
vehicles sold in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups question how devoted the automakers are to
making fuel-efficient vehicles. Katherine Silverthorne of the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group said automakers lobby against higher
fuel economy standards while giving lip service to better gas
mileage through the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're sucking over a billion dollars to make one vehicle
that isn't even available to consumers while Honda and Toyota
haven't spent any government money and they have cars on the
road,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel-efficient Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight get
between 60 mpg and 70 mpg but are considered too small to appeal to
a broad range of American families.

<HEADLINE> 4 Jailed in Date-Rape Drug Death  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Three men were sentenced to up to 15 years in
prison for manslaughter Thursday in one of the nation's first
trials involving a death linked to a ''date rape'' drug.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth man received a shorter term for his part in the death
of 15-year-old Samantha Reid of Rockwood. All four were convicted
March 14.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, Samantha asked for a drink at a party and was
given a soft drink spiked with the drug known as GHB. She became
violently ill, lost consciousness and died the next day. A friend
also ingested the drug and was briefly in a coma, but survived.
</P>
<P>
   GHB has been linked to at least 58 deaths since 1990 and more
than 5,700 recorded overdoses, according to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Cole, 19, of Southgate; Daniel Brayman, 18, of Trenton;
and Nicholas Holtschlag, 18, of Brownstown Township were sentenced
to terms of up to 15 years, the maximum for involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Limmer, 26, of Grosse Ile, was sentenced to up to five
years for being an accessory to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha's mother, Judi Clark, had urged the judge to sentence
the men to the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since her death, people ask me how many children I have and I
don't know how to answer,'' Clark told Wayne County Circuit Judge
Maggie Drake. ''I don't know. I'll have to deal with that
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   A few drops of colorless, odorless GHB mixed into a drink can
render a victim unconscious within 20 minutes. Victims frequently
have no memory of what happens while under the drug's influence,
and it is difficult to trace, often leaving the body within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Its sale has been banned since 1990 by the federal Food and Drug
Administration. Last month, President Clinton signed legislation
toughening federal laws against possessing, making or distributing
GHB.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Medicare Reform  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton said today Republican leaders
in Congress don't care about shoring up the Medicare and Social
Security systems because they want those federal programs to go
private.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to fellow Democrats at a fund-raising lunch in
Manhattan, Clinton attacked Republican tax-cut proposals as
shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wont have any money to help Social Security and Medicare
when the baby boomers retire, but that's OK with them (Republican
leaders) because they want to privatize them,'' Clinton said. ''And
I think it's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also visiting a senior citizens' center in Queens to
tout his plan to reform Medicare and extend its life.
</P>
<P>
   Revamping the federal health care program for the elderly and
disabled is a major element of the president's domestic legislative
agenda for his final year in office, and something his aides have
said has a good chance of passing this year.
</P>
<P>
   A new federal report today shows both Security and Medicare are
benefiting from the continued strong economy, and will remain
solvent for years longer than earlier expected.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger-than-expected economic growth has added new years of
life to the retirement programs in recent years, even as lawmakers
have debated what to do about projections that they will ultimately
be overwhelmed by the huge baby boom generation -- the 77 million
Americans born between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, when Congress was trying to pass
legislation to balance the federal budget, Medicare had been
projected to run short of cash in 2001. The trustees have gradually
pushed that date back, however, and last year pegged it at 2015.
</P>
<P>
   That news could dampen Clinton's hopes of persuading Congress to
risk changing the nation's popular pension and elderly health care
programs in a hard-fought election year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to New York Wednesday night, after a fund-raising
dinner in South Carolina that marked his first trip to that state
since a racially charged Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he knew his audience at historically black
Allen University expected him to address the controversy over
display of the Confederate flag atop the Statehouse in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton soft-pedaled the question, and stopped short of
saying outright that the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the waving symbol of one American's pride is the
shameful symbol of another American's pain, we still have bridges
to cross,'' Clinton said during a fund-raising tribute to Rep. Jim
Clyburn, D-S.C., who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was an echo of Clinton's remarks earlier this month
in Alabama, where Clinton went to commemorate the 35th anniversary
of the Selma voting rights march.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
calls the flag a racist emblem and is leading a tourism boycott of
South Carolina until the flag is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his then-challenger, Arizona
Sen. John McCain, refused to take a position on the flag, calling
it a local issue. Democrats accused them of pandering to the far
right of their party.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his then-challenger, former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, both said the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   The flag's defenders say it is a potent symbol of Southern
heritage and honors those who died during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know everyone expects me to say something about that,''
Clinton said of the flag, but he seemed resolved to keep the
rhetoric low at a time when a compromise over the flag may be at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the NAACP offered some support for a plan to remove
the flag from the Statehouse but display other Civil War-era flags
on the building grounds.

By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Embarrassed by the sight of
neo-Nazis parading through town at the height of tourist season,
city leaders have decided they, too, can use the First Amendment to
their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They are hiring a human rights coordinator with public relations
experience whose job will include publicizing all the good and
decent things people are doing in Coeur d'Alene.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest tactic in a battle that has seen locals first
try to ignore the white supremacist group Aryan Nations, and then
stage counter-demonstrations. The end result was national media
coverage showing pictures of swastika-wearing extremists marching
down the main street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good deeds and positive activities never garner as much
attention as the remarks of a crazy who doesn't represent
anybody,'' said Jonathan Coe of the Coeur d'Alene Area Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Steve Judy will choose the coordinator, who will work with
the news media, advertising agencies and religious groups to
develop programs that promote respect for others. The goal is to
focus media attention on positive activities, rather than hate
marches.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the coordinator will set up a Web site,
organize public meetings and answer queries from the media about
hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the full-time post of coordinator was donated by the
Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University. Founder
Greg Carr is an Idaho native.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, leader of the Aryan Nations, ridiculed the
notion of an Aryan-buster. ''For white people to have to hire
somebody like that because other people want to remain white is
interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Idaho Panhandle is a region of beautiful lakes and forested
mountains that draws thousands of tourists and retirees. The
elegant Coeur d'Alene Resort on the city's lakefront has 18 floors
of rooms to fill, at rates of up to $2,500 a night.
</P>
<P>
   In Kootenai County, tourism in 1999 accounted for 5,800 jobs
paying $66 million in wages. With the region's timber and mining
industries suffering, tourism is a major reason the population of
the county leaped from 69,000 in 1990 to 98,000 in 1997. Many of
the newcomers are moving into $500,000 homes springing up all over
the area.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Idaho has gained a reputation as a hate-group
stronghold. A recent report by the Northwest Coalition for Human
Dignity identified 11 white supremacist groups in Idaho, 10 of them
in the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the Hitler-loving Aryan Nations, which moved to a
ranch in the area in the 1970s and declared it was creating a white
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders fear that marches by the Aryan Nations in 1998 and
1999 are scaring away tourists and business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 parade attracted about 90 Aryan Nations supporters and
1,000 counter-demonstrators. Last summer, about 80 white
supremacists and 200 opponents scuffled in a park. A week later,
after winning a permit on First Amendment grounds with backing from
the ACLU, a few Aryan Nations supporters marched down Sherman
Avenue to the screams of thousands of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, resort owner Duane Hagadone donated thousands of
dollars for legal advice in a fruitless attempt to draft a law that
would ban the Aryans from marching while preserving First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne has proposed spending
up to $100,000 to change Idaho's image as a haven for racists.
''The idea that this soil is now used as a verbal battleground for
hatred and to display swastikas is not Idaho,'' he said at a rally
in Coeur d'Alene last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Coeur d'Alene, some merchants were enthusiastic about the
idea of countering bad publicity with good.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a really bad reputation,'' said Cathy Shortridge,
owner of several stores in the Coeur d'Alene Resort Shopping Plaza.
''Everywhere we go, people mention, 'You live up there with the
Aryan Nations.'''
</P>
<P>
   But others wondered whether fighting back against the white
supremacists might be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ignore them and eventually they will go away,'' said Sandy
Jirovski, manager of a recreational vehicle park.

<HEADLINE> 5 Charged in N.Y. Investment Scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Five members of a Long Island ''boiler
room'' operation bilked investors out of $3.2 million, using the
proceeds for Hawaiian vacations and Atlantic City gambling trips,
state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These defendants were all about greed, pure and simple,''
Spitzer said in a statement. ''They preyed upon unsophisticated
investors to finance a lavish lifestyle. Now that the money has run
out, we are going to vigorously prosecute them.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner, chief salesman and three brokers of Renaissance
Capital Management, Inc., were arrested this week and accused in a
38-count indictment with grand larceny, securities fraud and other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that from October 1997 to June 1999,
Renaissance owner Allen Andrescu and his brokers promised investors
they could double or triple their money within 90 days if they
invested in a company called NNPD textiles, which they said was
about to go public. The setup was a typical of a ''boiler room''
operation, in which brokers make high-pressure, unsolicited phone
calls to people to sell stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was in fact worthless, Spitzer said, and the company
never went public. About 90 investors lost between $10,000 and
$250,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing you can do when someone calls you with promises
of doubling or tripling your money with a hot stock tip is to hang
up the phone,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrescu faces eight counts of second-degree grand larceny, six
counts of third-degree grand larceny, 14 counts of violating New
York securities laws, and other charges. If convicted, he could
face up to 15 years in prison on each count of second-degree grand
larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance's top salesman, Vikram Randhawa, faces six counts
each of second- and third-degree grand larceny, as well as
violations of securities laws and other charges. He also faces up
to 15 years if convicted of the grand larceny charges.
</P>
<P>
   Three others, Pammi Lamba, Zuher Khalfan and Hamir Ramolia, are
charged with one count of scheming to defraud and violating
securities laws. They face up to four years on each count, if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   All the defendants pleaded innocent at their arraignments in
state Supreme Court in Nassau County.

<HEADLINE> Pataki Helps NY Conservative Party  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- At the same time Gov. George Pataki is
backing Rudolph Giuliani's Republican Senate bid against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, he is helping raise money for the Conservative
Party -- even though it might support a vote-splitting alternative
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a fund-raising letter obtained Thursday by The Associated
Press, the Republican governor asks for donations to the
Conservatives ''so they can fight Hillary Clinton's $25 million
campaign machine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long also is courting
potential alternatives to the New York City mayor. Most political
experts believe a separate Conservative Party candidate could drain
votes away from Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also collect votes on third-party ballot lines. No Republican
running for statewide office has won in New York since 1974 without
the support of the small Conservative Party, including Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Long's displeasure with Giuliani stems from the mayor's
acceptance of backing from the state's Liberal Party. Giuliani also
has refused to support a ban on what critics call ''partial-birth''
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Thursday that the governor
has been sending fund-raising letters to help the Conservative
Party ever since he became governor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility that helping the Conservative Party
could help elect Clinton, McKeon said: ''We remain hopeful that the
mayor will be able to work out his issues with the Conservative
Party and that he'll be able to run on the Conservative line.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the Giuliani campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the governor and the mayor have been chilly
since 1994 when Giuliani crossed party lines to back Democrat Mario
Cuomo against Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki endorsed Giuliani's Senate bid last year only after
appeals from national and state party leaders.

<HEADLINE> Sicilian Volcano Spewing Lava Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) -- Mount Etna burst back to life Thursday,
spewing flaming lava visible as far away as the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the fiery eruption posed no danger to tourists or
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks of red-hot lava were clearly visible across the
Straits of Messina in the southern region of Calabria.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano puts on a show every few months, but its last major
eruption dates to 1992.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants To Fight Abortion Law  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is asking the
Supreme Court to let it join a Nebraska doctor's fight against a
restrictive state abortion law.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers asked the nation's highest court this
week to let them participate when the closely watched Nebraska case
is argued before the justices April 27. They said the law violates
some women's constitutional right to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision in the case, expected by late June, may
determine the fate of 30 states' bans on a surgical procedure
opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton twice has vetoed a federal ban enacted by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court has not yet said whether it will let the
administration participate in the argument, but in a
friend-of-the-court brief made public Thursday government lawyers
called the Nebraska law ''unconstitutional for three reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief says the law challenged by Bellvue, Neb., doctor Leroy
Carhart is written so broadly it could be enforced against more
than one abortion procedure and is too vague to let doctors know
just what abortion techniques are outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the law is limited to a single procedure, the brief
says, it unduly burdens a woman's right to abortion because ''it
fails to provide an exception to preserve the pregnant woman's
health. The only exception to Nebraska's ban is if the outlawed
procedure is necessary to save a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute therefore prohibits the ... method even when a
physician concludes that that method is best suited to preserve the
health of a particular woman,'' the brief says. ''The ban therefore
forces at least some pregnant women to forego a safer abortion
method for one that would compromise their health.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgical procedure at issue involves partially extracting a
fetus, legs first, through the birth canal, cutting the skull and
draining its contents. Partial-birth abortion is not a medical
term. Doctors call the method dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nebraska law and legal dispute focuses on the D&AMP;X
procedure, far more may be at stake. Abortion-rights advocates say
the court's decision could broadly safeguard or dramatically erode
abortion rights, depending on what state legislatures can consider
when regulating abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has not issued a major abortion ruling since
1992 when it reaffirmed the core holding of its 1973 decision in a
case called Roe vs. Wade. That landmark ruling said women have a
constitutional right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court struck down the Nebraska law along with
those in Iowa and Arkansas. But nearly identical laws in Illinois
and Wisconsin were upheld by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska case is Stenberg vs. Carhart, 99-830.

<HEADLINE> UN: Watch Horn of Africa Drought  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations warned Thursday that
Ethiopia and its Horn of Africa neighbors may face drought and
famine equivalent to the crisis in the mid-1980s, during which
nearly 1 million people died of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Poor and infrequent rains coupled with fighting in Sudan,
Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia threaten to cause a major
humanitarian catastrophe, said Carolyn McAskie, deputy U.N.
emergency relief coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   She announced that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has named the
head of the World Food Program, Catherine Bertini, to be his
special envoy to draw public attention to the crisis and mobilize
the necessary relief operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are facing the real prospect in two months from now of
another catastrophe which can be averted with the right kind of
donor assistance,'' McAskie told a new conference.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates it will cost $205 million to bring
the needed 409,000 tons of food and other assistance to the 12.4
million people at risk of famine in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia,
Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. officials estimate the crisis may eventually affect 16
million people -- including residents of Tanzania, Rwanda and
Burundi -- requiring 1 million tons of food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia is by far the worst affected and will account for 80
percent of the aid requirement, McAskie said.
</P>
<P>
   During a drought in 1984-85, an estimated 1 million people died
of starvation or related illnesses in Ethiopia. Hundreds of
thousands of others were forced to leave their homes to seek food,
creating sprawling refugee camps that became breeding grounds for
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The images of emaciated Ethiopians in the West prompted an
enormous relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has issued a special appeal for $190 million
to help Ethiopia, about half of which has been met. But there has
been no response to the U.N. appeal for Eritrea, McAskie said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty obvious that the response that will be needed will
be prolonged food aid relief over the next few months,'' McAskie
said, adding that the United Nations wouldn't know until the fall
whether the next planting season would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Bertini plans to travel to the region on April 10, visiting
Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Kenya to try to raise awareness
about the situation and press governments to give aid workers
access to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers have often been prevented from reaching at-risk
groups in countries such as Sudan due to fighting. In southern
Somalia on Thursday, the United Nations stopped its air and ground
operations after unidentified gunmen shot at one of its aircraft.
No one was injured.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 274: Dow Up 28  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks plunged today, dragging the
Nasdaq composite index lower for a fourth straight session.
Old-fashioned industrial stocks rose, keeping the Dow in positive
territory. With less than an hour of trading left, the Nasadaq
composite index was down 274.79 at 4,355.69.
</P>
<P>
   hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Nasdaq was
down 191.22 at 4,453.45, on track for its one of its worst
performances ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 28.31 at 11,047.03, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.05 at 1,490.54.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have been in a slide since March 10, when the
Nasdaq closed at a record high of 5,048.62. At its current level,
the Nasdaq is within market watchers' definition of a correction --
a reversal of an upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are selling off shares of the companies that have
performed especially well this year, hoping to capture profits.
Today, wireless data company Qualcomm fell 11\ to 146\, and network
gear maker Cisco Systems fell 3 5/16 to 72}.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron, a maker of network switches and software, plunged 19]
to 28] after saying it anticipates a first-quarter loss of $25
million to $45 million as it restructures itself into four
operating companies. Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Cabletron
stock to ''market perform'' from ''market outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, aerospace company United Technologies rose 3\ to 60~;
3M rose 3 to 90|; and Coca-Cola rose 2 15/16 to 49 13/16, keeping
the Dow in positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology specialists are starting to use the 'v' word --
value,'' said Zane Brown, vice president at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co.
''People are questioning valuations and are less willing to buy
technology stocks at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco rose 2 5/16 to 11| after financier Carl Icahn said he is
prepared to begin a cash tender offer of $13 a share for 100
million shares. The plans represent his most ambitious effort yet
to gain control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The broad market was rattled by the official announcement that
Tiger Management, a family of hedge funds, will soon shut down.
Tiger, run by renowned money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr., was
once among the world's largest hedge fund families with $21 billion
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson made his name and his fortune by investing in
undervalued industrial or transportation companies. His resistence
to technology stocks contributed to his funds' downfall -- Tiger
recently had about $6 billion in assets -- and subjected him to
criticism from some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with technology stocks sliding, Robertson's parting shot
to the sector contributed to selling pressure, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current technology, Internet and telecom craze, fueled by
the performance desires of investors, money managers and even
financial buyers, is unwittingly creating a Ponzi pyramid destined
for collapse,'' Robertson said in a letter to Tiger's limited
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were further unnerved by a report that the U.S.
economy soared to an annual growth rate of 7.3 percent in the final
three months of 1999, the strongest performance in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the gross domestic product -- the country's total
output of goods and services -- was sharper than analysts had
expected, and raised worries that the Federal Reserve will continue
raising interest rates in order to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates five times since last June, but so far
has seen little concrete evidence that the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the European Central Bank left key interest rates
unchanged as ebbing inflation, stable exchange rates and moderate
wage contracts calmed policymakers. Most European stock indexes
were lower, however, extending a selloff that began before the
interest rate announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 926.71 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners
led by a 7-to-3 margin.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Move Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher in
trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market
reacted to weather conditions in the crop-growing regions.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures surged as forecasts called for little or no rain
over the weekend for parts of the Midwest. National Weather Service
forecasts had called for normal to above-normal rain in the region
that would end a week of dryness.
</P>
<P>
   The corn market also was boosted by improved export sales,
according to analysts. The U.S. Agriculture Department reported
exports of corn totaled about 780,000 metric tons, a 40 percent
increase over the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter rainfall forecast for the weekend also helped boost
soybean futures prices. Improved sales of soymeal and soyoil also
gave a lift to soybean prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures prices were higher on projections by the
International Grains Council of record world wheat consumption this
year. That is expected to spur export sales. Gains were tempered by
poor export figures.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was 4\ cent higher at $2.55 a bushel; May
corn was 6\ cents higher at $2.33\ a bushel; May oats were 2{ cents
higher at $1.21 a bushel; May soybeans were 8{ cents higher at
$5.37{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle and pork futures prices were higher in trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle were .18 cent higher at 71.85 cents a pound;
April feeder cattle were .05 cent higher at 83.80 cents a pound;
April lean hogs were .88 cent higher at 64.15 cents a pound; May
pork bellies were 1.40 cents higher at 97.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> FBI Checking Out Texas Tornado  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- FBI agents picked through paper strewn
across the pavement Thursday, looking for any sensitive files that
may have been blown out of the bureau's sixth-floor office by the
tornadoes that struck Fort Worth this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point we don't know if we lost sensitive files. It's
hard to say if this will jeopardize cases,'' FBI spokeswoman Lori
Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The storms Tuesday killed four people and caused an estimated
$450 million in damage. The building that housed the FBI's office
near downtown will have to be razed, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing disposable gloves, some 20 agents searched through even
the smallest scraps of paper scattered outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did lose some information, some documentation from cases,
possibly some evidence,'' Bailey said. ''Work papers may have been
on desk tops when the storm hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The sensitive files are believed to be safe because cabinets and
other security mechanisms were intact, but the FBI will inventory
its documents to determine for certain whether any confidential
papers are missing, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three FBI squads in the Fort Worth office will be
moved to a federal law-enforcement office near the airport. Those
two squads handle general investigations. The third squad, which
handles violent crimes, will be relocated to the Fort Worth police
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   No FBI employees were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Two tornadoes struck the city of 480,000 on Tuesday. One ripped
through downtown just after the evening rush hour. The second
tornado destroyed more than 100 homes in neighboring Arlington and
Grand Prairie and damaged more than 1,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve blocks remained closed Thursday for a second day to all
but building representatives and construction contractors because
sheets of glass were still falling from the damaged skyscrapers.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Mark Annual Protest Day  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza joined
with Israeli Arabs on Thursday to demonstrate on Land Day, the
annual protest of Israel's confiscation of Arab land. At least 20
people were injured in clashes with Israeli police and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The most violent confrontation came in the Israeli Arab town of
Sakhnin, where police said about 400 demonstrators broke through a
fence surrounding an Israeli army base. Police fired rubber-coated
steel pellets at the demonstrators, wounding 15.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Sakhnin medical center, Dr. Ali Naji, said
12 were lightly wounded, two suffered head wounds and another had a
broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Five Palestinians were wounded in demonstrations in the West
Bank and Gaza. In the traditionally Arab eastern section of
Jerusalem, about 400 Palestinians marched peacefully, protesting
Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank and demolition of Arab
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Land Day commemorates the 1976 killings of six Israeli Arabs
during a protest against Israeli land expropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Observance of Land Day was confined at first to Arabs who live
inside Israel, but in recent years, Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza have joined in.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released to coincide with Land Day showed that Israeli
Arabs, who make up about one-sixth of the country's population, now
identify themselves more often as Palestinians and less as
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, by the Givat Haviva Center for Peace Research,
showed that 46 percent of Arabs with Israeli citizenship consider
themselves Palestinians who live in Israel, 21 percent see
themselves as Palestinians only, and only 11 percent define
themselves as Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Answering the same question just four years ago, 38 percent
identified themselves as Israeli Arabs. The survey was based on a
random sample of about 500 people, with a 4 percent margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between Arabs in Israel and Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza is mostly geographical. Many Palestinians became
refugees during the war that followed the creation of Israel in
1948, fleeing to the West Bank and Gaza, while relatives stayed
behind and became Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees came under Israeli control when Israel captured the
West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Arab leaders complain that their people are treated like
second-class citizens. Their towns and villages top the country's
unemployment lists, municipalities are chronically short of funds,
and city officials charge that they have no land reserves for
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Day clashes came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
returned home from Washington for consultations after a round of
peace treaty talks in Washington. The talks are to resume next
week. The two sides have set a May target date for agreeing on a
framework for the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Funding of Tobacco Case Argued  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Republican lawmakers are fuming that the
Justice Department solicited money from other federal agencies to
pursue a lawsuit against tobacco companies after Congress denied
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ticked off at them for circumventing the clear legislative
intent,'' said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the Commerce,
Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations subcommittee that
oversees Justice Department funding.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and others are looking at ways to block the agency from
using any of the money it has been promised by other departments.
And they may try to repeal the law that Attorney General Janet Reno
used to solicit the money.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year denied the Justice Department's request for
$20 million to pay for litigation to try to recover billions of
dollars spent by Medicare and other federal health programs to
treat people with tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed the lawsuit anyway in September,
then asked other agencies to help pay for it but never alerted
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno recently told Rogers' subcommittee
she received commitments for a total of $8 million from the
departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Reno contends those agencies incurred costs from treating
smokers, and she cited a 1995 law that allows her department to
take money from other agencies to pay for litigation involving
''unusually high costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department previously has used the law to collect
more than $100 million from the Navy to defend it in a lawsuit
worth more than $2 billion brought by defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and other lawmakers say they are trying to determine if
the law is being applied properly in the tobacco case and whether
the Justice Department and the other agencies were supposed to
notify Congress about the funding plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reno testified she did not believe receiving the money from
other agencies required congressional notification.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members of the House Appropriations Committee only learned
of the arrangement last month when reviewing President Clinton's
2001 budget. They say they noticed the three agencies were seeking
$12 million for the tobacco lawsuit, which prompted them to ask
questions. It was then they then learned the agencies had already
agreed to give the Justice Department $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says some lawmakers are so upset they might try to repeal
the 1995 law. Among them are Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who chairs
the Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
another committee member.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will not be tolerated. It will be fixed,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., also an Appropriations Committee
member, wrote a letter to Stevens urging him not to act rashly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Repealing this provision will tie the Justice Department's
hands and make it difficult for the department to recover billions
of taxpayer dollars lost due to preventable tobacco-related
illnesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials also are urging lawmakers not to
get rid of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a serious problem for the department and the
government,'' said a Justice Department official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said she needs between $10 million and $15 million this
year to pursue the lawsuit, and that the department has spent about
$1.5 million of its own money so far.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the suit are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., American Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
Lorillard Tobacco Co., British American Tobacco Ltd., Liggett and
Myers Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research-USA and the Tobacco
Institute.

<HEADLINE> Camden Mayor Milton Milan indicted, vows to fight charges  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The city's mayor was indicted Thursday and
surrendered to federal authorities to face charges that he engaged
in what the U.S. attorney called a ''detailed and systematic reign
of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19-count indictment charges Milton Milan with accepting cash
bribes, vacation trips, automobiles and home improvement work from
individuals and firms seeking to do business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   It also alleges that former Philadelphia-South Jersey mob boss
Ralph Natale and mob associates ''made direct payments of money and
other benefits'' to Milan. Natale has been cooperating with federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milan put the office of mayor up for sale. Whatever you needed
from him, you could buy from him,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert J.
Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, 37, a first-term Democrat elected in 1997, had been under
scrutiny by federal authorities in a wide-ranging investigation of
alleged corruption in Camden city government. The indictment
charges him with criminal activity dating as far back as March
1996, when Milan was still a member of the city council.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Milan pleaded innocent Thursday to all charges and
vowed to clear his name and remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to stay down. I'm going to get back up and
fight. I'm going to continue to be mayor of this city,'' Milan said
Thursday afternoon as he emerged from the federal courthouse after
being freed on $150,000 bail. He said he was going right back to
work because ''I still have time on the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he asserted that the entire matter was
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political procedure. What could not be done
politically has been turned into a criminal procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Ali Sloan-El, a persistent critic of Milan,
termed the indictment ''an embarrassment to this city'' and said
the mayor should have stepped down. He stopped short of calling for
his resignation, however.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon news conference, the U.S. attorney said Milan
''was corrupted from the minute he set foot in City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor designed this pay-to-play system for his own selfish
benefit, and the people of this city be damned,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation is continuing, but would not name
others allegedly involved. He also would not say if additional
arrests were expected.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Milan include mail and wire fraud, extortion
and money laundering. If convicted on all counts, he could be
sentenced to up to 130 years in prison. Each count also carries a
penalty of up to $250,000 in fines, with the exception of the money
laundering conspiracy count, which carries a penalty of up to
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events followed increasing speculation in recent
weeks that an indictment was imminent. On Wednesday, the grand jury
that has been hearing testimony and examining evidence spent a full
day behind closed doors with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the media were camped outside Milan's East Camden
home at dawn Thursday. He greeted reporters casually, calling it
''just a regular day,'' hopped on his red Honda motorcycle and
headed for his City Hall office.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30, he emerged from the building, saying that he had been
indicted and was going to the U.S. attorney's office two blocks
away to turn himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic stopped and people poured out of office buildings to
watch the spectacle as Milan walked up the street, accompanied by
his lawyer, Carlos F. Martir Jr., and a throng of reporters and
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the federal inquiry had quickened in recent weeks as
city lawmakers were subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury and
questioned about a wide range of issues including city contracts,
organized crime and contractors who performed repairs on Milan's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's name also was mentioned prominently in the recent
federal trial of two men convicted as leaders of a Camden drug
ring. Several witnesses testified that Milan sold drugs in Camden
in the 1980s and bought several shipments of cocaine before
becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The charges made public Thursday do not involve narcotics, and
Greg Reinert, a spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor's
Office, said he knew of no pending drug-related case or
investigation involving Milan. The statute of limitations on
narcotics activity is five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan is the first Hispanic mayor of this desperately poor city
of 87,000 located on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine Corps veteran and former contractor, he was elected to
city council in 1995 and became council president a year later. He
parlayed his popularity into a run for mayor to make Camden
political history.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Remove Crown Symbol in Class  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- All symbols of the British
monarchy should be removed from courtrooms in Northern Ireland, a
panel reviewing Northern Ireland's justice system recommended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, set up as part of the Good Friday Agreement, also
called for scrapping the declaration ''God save the queen'' when
judges enter the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are among some 300 recommendations made by the
Criminal Justice Review Group, set up to examine Northern Ireland's
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Panel member Joanna Shapland said the recommendation to remove
all crown symbols was made so that court employees and those called
as witnesses would feel ''comfortable in that environment wherever
they come from, whichever group or section of Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nine-member panel also tried to find a middle ground in
dealing with symbols, one of the most contentious issues in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The group recommended no change in displaying the royal coat of
arms outside courthouses and said the Union Jack flag should
continue to be flown in line with practice on other government
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson called the report a
''major contribution to the debate on criminal justice issues.'' He
ordered a six-month consultation period to discuss the
recommendations with political parties, the Irish government and
employees in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial review did not involve matters related to policing.
Mandelson has already promised to unveil legislation to transform
the predominantly Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary into a new
Police Service of Northern Ireland that would enjoy greater support
from Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Ian Paisley
Jr., justice spokesman for the hard-line Protestant Democratic
Unionist Party, complained that removing the crown symbols from
courtrooms would further erode British identity in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin McNamara, a lawmaker and former Labor Party spokesman
on Northern Ireland, welcomed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Northern Ireland, the trappings of tradition contained a
none too subtle reminder that the Unionist community became
accustomed to claiming ownership of the justice system and the
right to dispense justice,'' McNamara said.

<HEADLINE> GM To Unveil 20 New Truck Models  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will roll out 20
new full-size truck models in the next 2{ years as part of a new
focus on the high-profit market segment.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials said Thursday that the company was also bulking up
its full-size truck capacity to 1.7 million vehicles in 2001, up
300,000 vehicles from current levels.
</P>
<P>
   The new models include Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickups and
GMC and Cadillac full-size sport utility vehicles. GM's redesigned
Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon SUVs have done well in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Full-size trucks carry some of the largest profit margins of any
vehicle an automaker builds. The success of U.S. automakers' trucks
and SUVs have propelled them to record profits in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest automaker also said it would introduce
four-wheel steering on a 2002 model full-size truck. The system
adds a steering rack to the rear axle, and in test models reduced
the turning radius by 20 percent. GM said the system would improve
stability and make pulling a trailer easier.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Injecting Teens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAPILLION, Neb. (AP) -- A man repeatedly injected his teen-age
daughter and two of her friends with methamphetamine, prosecutors
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Avery, 50, is charged with child abuse, drug distribution
and possession. The drug counts alone are punishable by up to 20
years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Avery injected methamphetamine into the arm of
his daughter, now 16, and her two friends, now aged 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Tricia Freeman said Avery injected two of the girls
20 to 30 times, and one possibly 75 times with a substance he
called ''crank,'' which is a slang term for methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments of a four-day trial, defense attorney
Gregory Pivovar said Avery was a methamphetamine addict, but
prosecutors failed to prove he gave the drug to the children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dennis Avery is a cool dad who tried to be a cool guy,''
Pivovar said. ''He tried to impress them with the fact that he did
meth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarpy County District Judge William Zastera will announce a
verdict in the bench trial Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the girls testified that Avery made sexual advances to
them, paged them at school, and one said he wrote her love letters
and made a collage of her photographs.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Chronicle Sale OK'd  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department today approved the sale
of the San Francisco Chronicle to The Hearst Corp., the owner of
its century-long rival, after Hearst agreed to sell its flagship
San Francisco Examiner to owners of a local free-distribution
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Hearst control of the city's dominant newspaper
and ends a joint operating agreement in which the two papers have
split profits evenly for the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both newspaper deals were to close Friday. After a transition of
four months, the papers will operate independently.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in 35 years, San Francisco will have two
independent daily papers,'' said Joel Klein, assistant attorney
general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
''Consumers, such as advertisers and readers, will obtain the
benefits of full competition between two daily morning papers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had been investigating the Chronicle sale
because of concerns the Examiner might not survive without the
joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the same day that losing bidder Clint
Reilly, a former San Francisco mayoral candidate, was to ask a
federal judge in San Francisco to block the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends the Examiner cannot compete with the Chronicle
under the terms of the sale to ExIn LLC, a company formed by Ted
Fang and his family, publishers of the thrice-weekly San Francisco
Independent and Asian Week.
</P>
<P>
   The government's approval did not surprise Reilly's lawyer,
Joseph M. Alioto. ''The antitrust division of the Justice
Department has not enforced the antitrust laws,'' he said, citing
mergers in oil, telecommunications and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst spokesman Paul Luthringer declined comment. Calls to the
Chronicle's publisher and the Independent were not immediately
returned today.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle board voted in June to sell Chronicle Publishing
Co. and two months later Hearst's $660 million bid was accepted.
Critics said the deal would create a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, after months of pressure from the Justice Department
and politicians to improve the terms of the deal, Hearst added
trucks, printing presses and other assets, along with the
Examiner's name and subscriber list.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, after culling through 81 bids, Hearst announced
the sale of the 120-year-old Examiner to Fang, who plans to switch
the afternoon Examiner to morning publication in August and compete
head-to-head with the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, Hearst will subsidize Fang by paying
all costs in the first four months, $16 million in the next eight
months and up to $25 million a year for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement under which the Examiner and Chronicle share
business operations but have separate editorial staffs was not part
of the deal. That agreement was to expire in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's daily circulation is about 456,000 and the
Examiner's is 107,000. They published a joint Sunday edition with a
circulation of almost 579,000. The Independent's circulation is
375,000.

   The unidentified gunmen opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles on
the single-engine nine-seat Caravan as it rolled down the runway
for takeoff from Kismayo airport in southern Somalia, the U.N.
office in Nairobi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the pilot nor the three passengers were injured when a
bullet entered the left side of the aircraft and lodged in a seat.
Another bullet passed through the aircraft's body between the cabin
and tail sections.
</P>
<P>
   Kismayo, 280 miles south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, has
been the scene of sporadic clan-based fighting for the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fortunate that no one was killed, and that no one was
in the seat where the bullet lodged,'' Kevin Farrell, acting U.N.
coordinator for Somalia, said in announcing an indefinite halt to
all U.N. operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gunmen could have seriously damaged the aircraft and
caused a terrible crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred a day after UNICEF's Somalia
representative visited Kismayo to explore the possibility of
resuming humanitarian work in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell declared Kismayo off-limits for all U.N. operations
until the identities of the attackers become clear and until the
threat has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, the European Union and numerous private
non-governmental organizations are conducting a variety of relief
and small development programs in Somalia. But they rarely station
non-Somali personnel in the country because of insecurity and the
threat of kidnappings. Most are based in neighboring Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has not had a functioning central government since
President Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted by rivals in January 1991
and the country was plunged into clan-based warfare.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Mayor Milan Surrenders  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The mayor was arrested Thursday on federal
charges of taking mob payoffs of cash, vacations and automobiles in
what the U.S. attorney called a ''detailed and systematic reign of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Milan, 37, pleaded innocent and was released on $150,000
bail, saying he is ''absolutely not guilty'' and that the case was
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''What could not be done politically has been turned into a
criminal procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release, Milan said he was going right back to work at
City Hall because ''I still have time on the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan was charged in a federal indictment with bribery,
conspiracy, extortion, money laundering and fraud. It alleges Milan
received cash, vacation trips, dinners, automobiles and home
improvements from former Philadelphia mob boss Ralph Natale and his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   Natale has been cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said Natale paid the money in hopes of winning
city contracts for mob-connected businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milan put the office of mayor up for sale. Whatever you needed
from him, you could buy from him,'' U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary
said Thursday, adding it was a ''detailed and systematic reign of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges criminal activity dating as far back as
1996, when Milan was a member of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Milan is the first Hispanic mayor of this desperately poor city
of 87,000 located on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, a first-term Democrat elected in 1997, had been under
scrutiny by federal authorities in a wide-ranging investigation of
alleged corruption in Camden city government.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at the recent federal trial of two men convicted of
running a multimillion-dollar cocaine ring in Camden said Milan
sold the drug in the 1980s and tipped off dealers about raids after
becoming mayor in 1997. The mayor has not been charged with any
drug offenses.

Elian's Father Applies for U.S. Visa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The father of Elian Gonzalez today applied for a visa to
travel to the United States from Cuba to regain custody of his son, as the U.S.
government and the 6-year-old boy's Miami relatives resumed talks to end the
4-month-old legal dispute. Attorney Gregory Craig submitted the visa application
on behalf of Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife and other family members. Craig said
Elian's father would travel to the United States as soon as he is assured that
he will be given custody of his son.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breaking with the Clinton administration, Vice President
Al Gore said today he supports legislation that would allow 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez to remain in the country while his custody case is
resolved in the courts. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee,
urged Congress to pass a law that would grant permanent resident status to the
boy, his father, stepmother, half-brother, grandmothers and grandfather, "so
that the case can be adjudicated properly." GOP rival George Bush supports such
legislation.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index narrowly averted its worst day
in history today, ending a volatile session sharply lower as investors bailed
out of stocks that recently had run up sharply. The Nasdaq fell 186.49 to close
at 4,458.18, a loss of 4.0 percent. Technology stocks have been in a slide since
March 10, when the Nasdaq closed at a record high of 5,048.62. The Nasdaq woes

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is asking the Supreme Court to

Justice Department lawyers asked the court to let them participate when the
Nebraska case is argued before the justices April 27. They said the law violates
some women's constitutional right to end their pregnancies. The court's decision
in the case may determine the fate of 30 states' bans on a surgical procedure

Economy Extends Retirement Programs

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The strong economy has delayed the projected insolvency

by three years to 2037. It marked the third consecutive year that
stronger-than-expected economic growth has added new years of life to the

disabled, had been projected to run out of cash in 2015. And Social Security,
the popular pension plan, had its insolvency date moved.

The men were convicted March 14 in the death of 15-year-old Samantha Reid. In
January 1999, Samantha asked for a drink at a party and was given a soft drink

<HEADLINE> Woman, Four Teens Die in House Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- A fire swept through a two-story house,
killing a 33-year-old woman, her two teen-agers and two of her
fiance's.
</P>
<P>
   The finace, Rodney Bunley, leaped to safety from an upstairs
window. He was treated for a cut to the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said one of the teen-agers discovered the blaze
Wednesday night and alerted Bunley, who awakened the others and
told them to go to the window as smoke poured into the bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Bunley jumped first, then waited for his family to follow.
</P>
<P>
   When he looked up, his fiancee, Marian Wright, was standing in
the window, assistant Fire Chief Bob Brinkman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He saw her disappear in the smoke,'' Brinkman said. ''He
thought they were coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters believe Wright went back to get the teen-agers,
whose bodies were found in three upstairs bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The dead teen-agers were identified as Marshonda Wright, 13,
Marquis Wright, 16, Rodnina Bunley, 17, and Ravis Bunley, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief John Brookman said investigators believe the fire
started on the house's first floor, probably on the front porch,
but were unsure of the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors reported hearing an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard this loud crash and then somebody started
screaming,'' said Erin O'Brien, who lives next door. ''There was no
way they could get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima is about 70 miles southwest of Toledo.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 186; Dow Ends Off 38.16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index narrowly averted its
worst day in history today, ending a volatile session sharply lower
as investors bailed out of stocks that have run up sharply in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 186.49 to close at 4,458.18, a loss of 4.0
percent. With less than 30 minutes remaining in the session, the
Nasdaq was down 289 points before recovering ground as investors
guessed the index had reached rock-bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's plunge carried over to the broader market, dragging
the Dow Jones industrial average into negative territory after it
had risen sharply earlier in the session. The Dow ended down 38.16
at 10,980.56.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 20.56 to 1,487.96.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,563 up, 1,470 down and 450
unchanged. On the Nasdaq, decliners led advancers by a 3-to-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.17 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.04
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.83 to
528.17.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have been in a slide since March 10, when the
Nasdaq closed at a record high of 5,048.62. Today, several factors
derailed the sector, pushing the Nasdaq well into market watchers'
definition of a correction -- a reversal of an upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   At the core, investors were continuing a selloff of stocks that
have performed especially well this year, hoping to capture
profits. Today, wireless data company Qualcomm and network gear
maker Cisco Systems fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, with the end of the first quarter looming on
Friday, mutual fund managers dumped technology stocks so quarterly
reports won't show faltering high-tech names.
</P>
<P>
   The selling pressure knocked the Nasdaq below 4,450 -- a
so-called technical benchmark that prompted a wave of
computer-driven selling. Only as the Nasdaq headed toward 4,400 did
investors step back into the market, bringing the index back from
its nadir.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors' increasing jitters over the highly
volatile technology sector caused the drop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aside from the technical speak on the Nasdaq, the
psychological nerve of the market is slowly beginning to unravel a
bit,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George
K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The technology selloff also followed the announcement that Tiger
Management, a family of hedge funds, will soon shut down. Tiger,
run by renowned money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr., was once
among the world's largest hedge fund families with $21 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson made his name and his fortune by investing in
undervalued industrial or transportation companies. His resistence
to technology stocks contributed to his funds' downfall -- Tiger
recently had about $6 billion in assets -- and subjected him to
criticism from some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's parting shot to the sector contributed to today's
selling pressure, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current technology, Internet and telecom craze, fueled by
the performance desires of investors, money managers and even
financial buyers, is unwittingly creating a Ponzi pyramid destined
for collapse,'' Robertson said in a letter to Tiger's limited
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in technology marred a strong advance by many old-line
industrial companies. United Technologies, 3M and Coca-Cola rose
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology specialists are starting to use the 'v' word --
value,'' said Zane Brown, vice president at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co.
''People are questioning valuations and are less willing to buy
technology stocks at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco rose after financier Carl Icahn said he is prepared to
begin a cash tender offer of $13 a share for 100 million shares.
The plans represent his most ambitious effort yet to gain control
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were further unnerved by a report that the U.S.
economy soared to an annual growth rate of 7.3 percent in the final
three months of 1999, the strongest performance in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the gross domestic product -- the country's total
output of goods and services -- was sharper than analysts had
expected, and raised worries that the Federal Reserve will continue
raising interest rates in order to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates five times since last June, but so far
has seen little concrete evidence that the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the European Central Bank left key interest rates
unchanged as ebbing inflation, stable exchange rates and moderate
wage contracts calmed policymakers. Most European stock indexes
were lower, however, extending a selloff that began before the
interest rate announcement.

<HEADLINE> Gore Praises Granny D  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, N.H. (AP) -- Does money buy access? Just ask Granny D.
</P>
<P>
   Dorris Haddock, who recently walked across the country in a show
of support for changing federal campaign finance laws, said
Thursday she was asked to pay $500 when she tried to talk her way
in to meet with Vice President Al Gore at an August fund-raiser in
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the expected Democratic presidential nominee, is making
the issue a top campaign priority. He even praised the 90-year-old
New Hampshire woman as he unveiled new campaign finance proposals
in a speech this week at Marquette University in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took signs hoping he would notice us, but nothing
happened,'' said Haddock, also known as Granny D. ''So we went in
and said, 'Could we talk to (President) Clinton and Gore? ... But
they said no, we couldn't go in unless we had $500 for the
luncheon.''
</P>
<P>
   She defended Gore, however, and said she wasn't too upset by the
snub.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had nothing to do with it, it was the aides and I can
understand,'' said Haddock, who completed the 3,000-mile walk from
California to Washington on March 1. ''I thought he was missing a
good photo op.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, Gore's likely Republican opponent, seemed more
perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Great Campaign Finance Reformer sounds more like the Great
Pretender,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''From monks who
took vows of poverty to Granny D, Al Gore will raise money from
anyone to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign did not immediately return telephone calls
Thursday for comment.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Former associate agrees to inform on Merlino  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A former ally of reputed gangland leader
Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino has agreed to provide information to
federal authorities linking Merlino and others to a 1993 shooting
that started a mob war, a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetano ''Tommy Horsehead'' Scafidi would be the first member of
Merlino's inner circle to cooperate and could help authorities
build a case against top Merlino associates who have thus far
avoided indictment, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the U.S. Attorney's office nor the FBI would comment on
the continuing investigation into the Merlino organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper quoted sources familiar with the case who
asked not to be identified as saying Scafidi's decision to
cooperate was devastating for Merlino, with one describing it as
''the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Scafidi, 35, serving an 82-month sentence after pleading guilty
to racketeering charges in 1995, was scheduled to appear before a
federal grand jury after finalizing a cooperating agreement with
authorities earlier this month, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Scafidi was expected to provide an account of the 1993 attempted
murder of Joseph ''Joey Chang'' Ciancaglini, which started a war
between the Merlino faction of the mob and an organization headed
by then-mob boss John Stanfa. Ciancaglini was a Stanfa underboss.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI document made public in 1996 said Scafidi told another
mob informant the hit was ordered by Merlino and Merlino's top
associate, Michael Ciancaglini, brother of Joseph Ciancaglini.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Merlino and George Borgesi, a Merlino associate
Scafidi was expected to implicate, sharply questioned Scafidi's
credibility, saying he was testifying for his own benefit and his
testimony could not be corroborated.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani significantly outpaces Clinton in fund-raising  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani continues to
significantly outpace Hillary Rodham Clinton in money-raising for
their U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani raised about $7 million during the first three months
of this year, compared to a little over $4 million raised by
Clinton, according to preliminary figures released Thursday by
their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the mayor raised nearly $12 million, compared to the
first lady's $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   With seven months left to go before the election, Giuliani has
already raised more money than Chuck Schumer raised in total for
his successful Senate campaign in '98, putting the Clinton-Giuliani
race easily on track to be the most expensive New York campaign
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a candidate does this well raising money, it's reflective
of the fact that the candidate has tremendous support,'' said
Giuliani's campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the candidate with the most money does not always
win. Recent high-profile races in which Republicans have outspent
Democrats but then lost include Al D'Amato's campaign against
Schumer, Oliver North's campaign against U.S. Sen. Charles Robb of
Virginia, and Michael Huffington's campaign against U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson said he was happy with her
fund-raising results and unsurprised that Giuliani raised more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had an outstanding period,'' Wolfson said, adding:
''They raised more than us in the last period. Given the strength
of their secret fund-raising campaign, I suppose that will be true
this period as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign has complained about the Giuliani campaigns
refusal to release the texts of their direct-mail fund-raising
solicitations. Teitelbaum on Thursday said there was no need for
the Giuliani campaign to release the letters because the Clinton
campaign had already made them public.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign had estimates of their cash on hand, which
would reflect how much has been spent out of the money they have
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Formal filings of contributions and expenditures for the Jan. 1
through March 31 period must be filed with the Federal Election
Commission by April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the money came from every county in New York,
and every state in the country, with roughly half from in-state
contributors. He said the average contribution was $70.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson did not have a breakdown for the money Clinton raised,
but in the last filings, both candidates had raised about half
their money from out of state donors.

<HEADLINE> Top Female Officer: 'I Was Harassed'  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is investigating a complaint by its
most senior female officer that she was sexually harassed by a
fellow general, defense officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation was made by Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, 52, the
Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence. She is the first
female three-star general in the history of the Army and is due to
retire this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials refused to comment on the matter, saying it was
Army policy not to discuss an ongoing investigation. Defense
Secretary William Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, also refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. John G. Meyer Jr., the chief Army spokesman, said he
could not confirm that Kennedy had filed a complaint of sexual
harassment. Meyer said Kennedy had informed his office that she
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was first reported in Thursday's editions of the
Washington Times, which said it had not learned the identity of the
accused general. The Times did not say when Kennedy lodged her
complaint, but it said the allegation stemmed from an incident in
her Pentagon office in October 1996 when she was a two-star major
general and was in the post of assistant deputy chief of Army
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified Army source as saying
Kennedy accused the general of ''inappropriate touching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times said the Defense Department inspector general's office
was investigating the accusation and had interviewed people who
were on Kennedy's staff in 1996. Susan Hansen, a Pentagon
spokeswoman, said the Defense Department inspector general's office
was not investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Other defense officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition they not be identified, said the investigation was being
handled by the Army's own inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said a former officer told its reporter that he was
interviewed by the accused general's defense lawyer, who asked him
about Kennedy's ''demeanor on a certain October date in 1996 and
about her office layout.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who is not married, is a career intelligence officer.
In 1997 she served on a special task force that examined the
problem of sexual harassment in the Army and concluded that it
existed ''throughout the Army, crossing gender, rank and racial
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   In an October 1997 interview published in USA Weekend, Kennedy
said she had experienced sexual harassment in the Army and she
spoke at length about how she and other women should respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer asked her how she dealt with it when she was
younger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I dealt with it individually,'' she said. ''I just said 'no'
in the way I needed to say 'no,' and there were times when I had to
say 'no' very forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can remember making an absolute threat to someone that if he
ever did this to me, or said it or made me even think he was about
to, I would be taking him in to see the person that was pretty high
up in our chain (of command). So you have to come back like that
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview she made no specific reference to having been
harassed as a general but she said men had made passes at her.
</P>
<P>
   ''But a pass is different from harassment,'' she said. ''What's
illegitimate is when you work for him, or he works for you, one of
you is married and not to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also spoke about the difficulty of reacting to acts of
touching that may not be immediately recognizable as harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you say something immediately, it's very likely he will
back off and say you've misunderstood,'' she said. ''All of a
sudden you're the problem, not him. But if you hang back, he'll do
it longer and more inappropriately.''

<HEADLINE> Census Chief Defends Questionnaire  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt chided
several congressional Republicans on Thursday for telling
constituents to ignore what they consider intrusive Census
questions, accusing them of opposing an accurate count for ''their
political purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats ''haven't gotten criticism'' about the
form but Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle said his office has
been getting questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt, D-Mo., maintained, ''the Republicans have been
trying to frustrate this census from the beginning. They don't want
more people counted because they think it serves their political
purpose. That's a pretty shoddy reason to do what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott: ''If he's not getting any calls, I think he's the only
member of Congress who isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's office and at least two House Republicans said they had
received a number of complaints in recent days about questions on
census forms. Reps. Nick Smith, R-Mich. and Tom Coburn, R-Okla.,
were specifically critical of the long-form questionnaire, sent to
one in six of the country's 115 million households.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Czwartacki said that Lott has been heavily
promoting the census in his state, but was also suggesting to
callers concerned about privacy to leave unanswered those questions
they felt were intrusive and mail it back to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, D-S.D., said, ''It is of concern, I think, to people
that the questions asked and the length of time required has made
it somewhat problematic.'' Daschle said he has advised people not
to skip questions. ''I'm not sure that it is anything that we ought
to address, at least at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop in Milwaukee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the likely GOP presidential nominee, said he encouraged people
''who are worried about some of the questions and about the
government interfering in their personal lives to think about it.''
He later added he was not telling people to ignore census forms
because they're important ''for a head count.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long supported incorporating a statistical method
known as sampling to raw census numbers. Sampling would adjust
actual head counts to account for populations with traditionally
low response rates, such as minority groups in cities. Republican
lawmakers have opposed sampling, fearing it could force a redrawing
of boundary lines to their disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said Lott has done television and radio ads
encouraging census participation. But he added it was better to
leave questions unanswered because ''if the choice is between the
trash can and partially filling it out, we're going to tell people
to fill out as much as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt on Thursday called the long form
an ''essential tool'' to help communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even questions that some Republicans labeled as intrusive, such
as ''how old is your home'' and ''are you a veteran?'' are useful
to determine how local services are provided, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 53 questions on the long form this year, down from 57
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress received a detailed list of the questions
two years ago from the Census Bureau and had a chance to weigh in,
said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the House
Government Reform Committee's census panel.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said that six months ago, Lott and Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., sought to require all recipients of the short form to state
their marital status.
</P>
<P>
   ''You really cannot have it both ways, Senator Lott,'' Maloney
said. ''You can't say you want to add questions and then complain
that there are too many questions.''

<HEADLINE> Sweden Approves Defense Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Swedish lawmakers voted Thursday to
drastically slash the size of Sweden's military, revamping it to
deal with new threats like terrorism instead of its old nemesis,
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, the army, navy and air force will reduce
the number of military compounds by half and the military will cut
seven of its 13 brigades, each of which comprises 5,000 conscripts
and officers.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six remaining units will be primed to participate in
a rapid-reaction force being created in Europe. In addition, a
smaller amphibious brigade will replace the obsolete coastal
artillery unit to protect the nation's vast archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, which parliament passed by a 180-125 vote, were to
begin taking effect July 1 and were expected to be completed in
about four years.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the cuts were necessary to modernize the forces
to rapidly meet new threats. Criticism largely came from officials
in areas that will lose an employment base when military facilities
are closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the Cold War, we had a defense like most other
countries that had one purpose only -- to be prepared to mobilize
and face a massive invasion,'' armed forces spokesman Peter Larsson
said. ''Now we have units you could use both for traditional
military operations and for new threats like terror groups who are
able to use nuclear, biological weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Commander in Chief Gen. Owe Wiktorin welcomed the new
policy, though he said he regretted that uncertainties remain over
which facilities will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never before in modern times has there ever been such
extensive defense decision,'' he was quoted as saying by the
Swedish news agency TT. ''But there is still a defense left after
this parliament decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said the cuts will allow for savings in the
defense budget, which it intends to cut from about $4.6 billion to
$4.1 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden has steadily reduced defense spending since the collapse
of the Soviet Union in 1991, saying Russia no longer poses a
threat. In the early 1990s, about 38,000 young Swedish men were
called to compulsory military service each year. Last year, about
16,000 were drafted.

<HEADLINE> Reno Troubled By Elian Turmoil  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno, a Miami native
who was the elected state prosecutor for 15 years there, is visibly
troubled as she deals with that city's large Cuban exile community
over the ''heartbreaking'' case of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a community I was born in, raised in. It's a community I
love. And when it's hurting, it hurts me,'' Reno told reporters
Thursday -- her eyes glistening briefly with tears she blinked away.
</P>
<P>
   Reno often opens her weekly news conference with a word-by-word
recitation of a staff-written statement, but Thursday she brought
only two sentences she had typed and a few phrases she had written
by hand.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old attorney general spoke for about five minutes
with evident emotion about the hometown that elected her five times
and the ''very wonderful contribution'' made to it by the Cubans
who began arriving 40 years ago. She explained her view of the case
she called ''heartbreaking for everybody involved.''
</P>
<P>
   As is her custom with critics, she refused to characterize
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas and 22 mayors of nearby towns
who accused her of provocations that could lead to violence and who
vowed not to help take Elian away from his Miami relatives and
return him to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is no stranger to violence in Miami. In 1979, she charged
five white Miami-Dade police officers with the manslaughter of a
black insurance executive after a motorcycle chase.
</P>
<P>
   When they were acquitted, black rioters chanting ''Reno, Reno,
Reno'' burned and looted. Sixteen people died; damage reached $200
million. Reno prosecuted the rioters, then worked hard to win back
the black community's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Cubans who came to Miami often worked three jobs
at a time, built strong families and became ''leaders of Miami ...
the bankers, the businessmen, the physicians and doctors and
lawyers ... the musicians, the poets, the professors and architects
who have built a splendid city shining in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they came to this country to incite violence,''
Reno said. ''I think they came to this country to able to speak
their mind, to follow the law, to respect others.... For the Cuban
community I know, we're in solid agreement that the rule of law
should apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and acquaintances from Miami call Reno frequently. On
Wednesday night, the Cuban-American pop singer Gloria Estefan
telephoned to express concern for Elian; Reno spent 15 minutes
explaining her position, according to Justice aides, who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the law is clear,'' Reno said Thursday. ''The
father must speak for the little boy because there is a sacred bond
that must be honored -- and the boy must be reunited with his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes Fidel Castro runs a repressive society in
Cuba, but said that is not the deciding issue. ''I ... have seen
people raised in Cuba who have come to this country who are
perfectly wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered this argument by example of what should be the
deciding issue:
</P>
<P>
   Suppose an accident killed a mother, badly injured a father but
spared their son. The boy ''went to live with Aunt Lucy, who's
rich, lived in a big house, had moderate political opinions, and
did everything just right by the little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the disabled father sought to get his boy back, ''Aunt
Lucy said, 'No. I can far better raise this boy. To take him away
from me now would be terribly damaging to him psychologically. I
can do better by him ... and I don't like his father's political
beliefs.'
</P>
<P>
   ''To say that father couldn't get that child back in those
circumstances tears at the very fabric of the family
relationship,'' Reno said. ''We have got to have some presumption
in favor of the family and of parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the government could have already taken custody of the
boy: ''Nothing, no court order, prevented us from doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   But the department held back to let Elian's relatives take the
issue to court, where they lost. Discussions continue with those
relatives ''to ensure that an appeal is heard in a timely way,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing will be done to return Elian if that happens and
everybody agrees that they will abide by the ruling that comes
down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she is prepared ultimately to enforce the law, Reno
replied, ''You bet.''

   Nasdaq Off 186.49; Dow Ends Off 38.16
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index narrowly averted its
worst day in history today, ending a volatile session sharply lower
as investors bailed out of stocks that have run up sharply in
recent months. The Nasdaq fell 186.49 to close at 4,458.18, a loss
of 4.0 percent. With less than 30 minutes remaining in the session,
the Nasdaq was down 289 points before recovering ground as
investors guessed the index had reached rock-bottom. The Nasdaq's
plunge carried over to the broader market, dragging the Dow Jones
industrial average into negative territory after it had risen
sharply earlier in the session. The Dow ended down 38.16 at
10,980.56. Technology stocks have been in a slide since March 10,
when the Nasdaq closed at a record high of 5,048.62. Today, several
factors pushed the Nasdaq well into market watchers' definition of
a correction -- a reversal of an upward trend.

   Tiger To Liquidate Funds Worth $6B

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Julian H. Robertson Jr., a scion in financial
markets, told investors today he is liquidating the $6 billion
Tiger Management investment funds, calling the current market
frenzy for technology stocks a ''Ponzi pyramid destined for
collapse.'' Robertson, who had used a strategy of picking
undervalued industrial stocks, took 18 years to build Tiger into
the largest hedge fund family in the world with assets of $23
billion. Tiger's demise took just 18 months. Robertson's reversal
of fortune highlights the radical shift in the markets to
technology and Internet stocks and away from traditional

   Icahn Seeks 100M Shares of Nabisco

to begin a cash tender offer of $13 a share for 100 million shares
of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. He said he would consider selling
the entire company if he gains control of it. The plans that Icahn
outlined in a letter today represent his most ambitious effort yet
to gain control of the company that was created when RJR Nabisco
Holdings spun off its cigarette holdings in the face of mounting
litigation against tobacco companies. The Parsippany, N.J.-based
Nabisco Group Holdings' sole asset is an 80.5 percent stake in
Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food company that makes Ritz crackers,

the fastest growth rate in nearly 16 years, the government reported

papers have split profits evenly for the past 35 years. Both
newspaper deals were to close tomorrow. After a transition of four

that the company was also bulking up its full-size truck capacity
to 1.7 million vehicles in 2001, up 300,000 vehicles from current
levels. The new models include Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickups
and GMC and Cadillac full-size sport utility vehicles. GM's

fecal contamination on it or signs of poultry diseases that
threaten human health. Agriculture Department officials who
released the study today said the contamination rate is relatively
low but they expect to cut it further under an experimental new
inspection system. Chicken carcasses are subject to additional
cleansing after they pass the inspectors, so all fecal material
should be eliminated before the meat reaches consumers, industry
officials say. The study was conducted over the past year at 16
poultry plants that have agreed to take part in the new inspection
system.

<HEADLINE> 30-year Mortgage Rates Hold Steady  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rates on 30-year mortgages held steady this
week but are still up more than 1 percentage point from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was
unchanged from last week at 8.23 percent, according to a survey
released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. This time a
year ago, 30-year mortgages stood at 6.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, the rates on 30-year mortgages hit a 3{-year
high of 8.38 percent. That was the highest since a 8.42 percent
rate for the week ending July 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, were
also unchanged this week at 7.84 percent, matching last week's
level.
</P>
<P>
   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 6.76 percent this week, down slightly from
6.78 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three
types of mortgages.

<P>
   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A prototype ''lifeboat''
for the international space station made its highest and longest
test flight on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The unmanned X-38 -- a wedge-shaped craft with no wings and no
engine -- was dropped from under the wing of a B-52 bomber at 39,000
feet and parachuted safely to the desert floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vehicle flew just about as we expected,'' said Bob Baron,
X-38 project manager at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center. ''We
purposely put in some pitches and rolls. All that looked very, very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA is working to develop a similar vehicle that the astronauts
aboard the space station could use to return to Earth in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   For the first years of the space station, astronauts will have
to rely on a three-man Soyuz capsule for emergency escapes. NASA
hopes to put a seven-person lifeboat on the space station in 2005
or 2006.

House Committee Passes Hmong Bill   
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Judiciary Committee Thursday
unanimously passed legislation that would make it easier for
America's former Laotian allies during the Vietnam War to become
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, Chairman Henry Hyde said, is needed ''in recognition
of their compelling circumstances and extraordinary sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Hmong and Lao veterans packed the hearing, dressed
in green military fatigues. They applauded when Hyde announced that
the committee had passed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., waives
the English-language requirement for Hmong and Laotians who were
recruited by the CIA in Laos for covert military actions.
Supporters say the Hmong, an ethnic group in Laos, have found it
difficult to learn English because their language did not have a
written form until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, R-Ill., called the Hmong a ''tribal, semi-nomadic''
society and displayed an illustrated ''story cloth'' that Hmong use
to communicate their history and culture from one generation to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were recruited often as boy soldiers, giving the best
years of their lives to the United States secret army in Laos,''
Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were fierce allies of American forces and rescued many
American pilots,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the top
Democrat on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has passed the legislation in previous years, only
to see it stalled elsewhere in Congress. But Philip Smith,
Washington director of Lao Veterans of America, said the chances
are much better this time because 103 members of Congress,
including Hyde, have signed on as co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our expectation is that it will pass the full House soon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Hmong and Lao veterans marched to another House
building to see their governor, Jesse Ventura, who was testifying
on another issue Thursday but supports the bill.

<HEADLINE> Clinics for Poor Cutting Back  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning of possible closures, a panel of
experts urged the government Thursday to spend $2.5 billion to keep
afloat public hospitals and clinics stretched thin by large numbers
of uninsured patients and the loss of paying patients to HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These trends are beginning to place unparalleled strain on the
health care safety net in many parts of the country,'' the report
by the Institute of Medicine cautioned in recommending the infusion
of federal aid over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many providers may be unable to survive the current
environment,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Local health care providers applauded the recommendations by the
IOM panel of private health experts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very simple -- you can't provide care to everyone without
having sufficient revenue,'' said Robert Sillen, executive director
of the Santa Clara Valley Health and Hospital System in California.
</P>
<P>
   The term ''safety net'' refers to organizations that are legally
obligated to provide care to people who cannot afford it. They
include some 700 community health centers and 1,300 public
hospitals. Though estimates vary, more than 8 million Americans get
basic health care from these providers.
</P>
<P>
   The IOM panel also noted that federal oversight of safety net
providers is fragmented and recommended establishing a single, new
agency to monitor them.
</P>
<P>
   Currently some nine agencies are responsible for programs
affecting safety net providers, but there's no coordination, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Many safety net patuents are covered by Medicaid, a
federal-state health program for the poor that reimburses safety
net providers and is the single biggest source of revenue for them.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last decade, many states have converted Medicaid to
managed care to cut costs, inviting health maintenance
organizations and other private providers to compete for Medicaid
patients.
</P>
<P>
   While paying patients benefited from having more choices in
medical care, public hospitals and other safety net providers lost
6 percent of their Medicaid patients, the IOM report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals and clinics have joined managed care groups to
compete, but reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients under those
plans are sometimes less than what it costs to provide care, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, welfare reform laws passed in 1996 and the balanced
budget act the following year reduced federal subsidies for public
health centers.
</P>
<P>
   With this backdrop of financial pressures, the number of
uninsured who rely on safety net providers grew by 20 percent
between 1988 and 1998 and now numbers an estimated 44 million, or
nearly one in five Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have already frayed the safety net -- in Washington
D.C., where 15 publicly funded clinics once operated, only 5
remain, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It also cited a study of 400 local health departments that
showed 23 percent of urban centers and 17 percent of nonurban
centers had stopped providing basic health care services.
</P>
<P>
   Most safety net providers have been able to survive, relying on
a patchwork of federal, state and local grants and private money,
the report said. But experts warned many will fail or be forced to
cut back care.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gage, president of the National Association of Public
Hospitals and Health Systems that represents 100 hospitals, said
some institutions are cutting back hours, closing clinics,
eliminating support services and charging copayments for doctor
visits that were frees.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one want to go down this slippery slope, but when you're
losing money on every case, it's hard to keep going,'' Gage said.

<HEADLINE> Visa for Elian's Father Hits Snag  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A procedural snag today prevented the American
lawyer for Elian Gonzalez's father from applying for visas for the
father and other family members to travel to the United States, a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, who represents Juan Miguel Gonzalez, went to the
State Department and was informed by an official that applications
had to be submitted to the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Craig had hoped to get State Department approval for a U.S.
visit by the father, his wife, 6-month old son and National
Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, a specialist on U.S. issues.
</P>
<P>
   Craig visited the State Department shortly after telling
reporters of his intention to ''submit formal applications'' for
the visas. According to officials, Craig submitted a letter
requesting the visas and not visa applications.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person that has the legal and moral authority to
speak for Elian Gonzalez is his father,'' Craig said. ''Juan Miguel
Gonzalez is ready at a moment's notice to come to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Elian's father would travel to the United States as
soon as he is assured that he will be given custody of his son.
''The time has come for the INS (Immigration and Naturalization
Service) to make those assurances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said U.S. officials had negotiated patiently with
the boy's Miami relatives to arrange a prompt, orderly transfer of
custody to the father. ''We fear that the negotiations have
failed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has demanded that the boy's Miami relatives agree
to surrender Elian if they lose their court fight to keep him. Both
sides met for five hours late Wednesday, then resumed talking this
morning. There was no comment from either side today.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, the INS delayed the revocation of Elian's
temporary residency status 24 hours, until 9 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When Juan Miguel Gonzalez receives word that he will be able to
take custody of his son, Craig said, he also would seek permission
to allow the boy's classmates, teacher and doctors to travel to the
United States to ''help smooth the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney also accused the Miami relatives of exploiting the
boy's case in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''The circumstances that now surround Elian's life in Miami,
including the decision to allow camera crews into Elian's bedroom,
the decision to permit a network news program to film a two-day
interview with Elian without the father's permission, and the
decision just last night to parade Elian in front of demonstrators
in the streets of Miami, make it clear that Elian's best interests
lie with his father,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been living with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who
has said he would be willing to release Elian to his father if Juan
Miguel Gonzalez came to Florida from Cuba. He said he would not
deliver the boy to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently calling the great-uncle's bluff, Cuban President
Fidel Castro said Wednesday that not only would the father go to
the United States, he would stay for the entire court process as
the Miami relatives appeal federal orders to surrender custody of
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time anyone has said the father was ready to
come to the United States immediately and stay for the court fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The passports are ready,'' Castro said. ''And of course the
airplane is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government today issued a list of 31 people who would
accompany Juan Miguel Gonzalez, including his wife and their
6-month-old son -- Elian's half brother. It also included Ricardo
Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and Castro's point
man on American affairs, who was listed as an ''adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference in Washington, Attorney General
Janet Reno said that if Gonzalez comes to the United States, one
option would be to move the boy to his custody in this country
while the appeals court considers the case. Other than that, she
quickly added, ''I don't do what-ifs.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro has proposed that Elian and his Cuban relatives stay at
the home of the chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.
Other members of the delegation would stay with other Cuban
diplomats based in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the head of Cuba's diplomatic mission in Washington,
Fernando Remirez, met today with State Department officials to
discuss the possibility of Gonzalez's visit. Speaking briefly with
reporters after the meeting, Remirez said no visas had been
requested for the group as yet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the international dispute over Elian erupted after the boy
was rescued at sea more than four months ago, Gonzalez has been
reluctant to travel to the United States to claim his child. The
boy's mother, who was divorced from Elian's father, was among 11
people who died when their boat sank during the journey from Cuba
to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Swiss To Protest Austrian Visit  </HEADLINE>
By ONNA CORAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Jewish organizations said Thursday they
will join Swiss anti-racist and left-wing groups in protests
against a state visit by Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel,
whose government includes a far-right party.
</P>
<P>
   Former Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber said he was ''pained
and embarrassed'' by the government's invitation to Schuessel, at a
time when Switzerland has been struggling to sort out its own
wartime actions. Schuessel arrives on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have only just emerged from a series of painful events
relating to our past,'' Felber told Le Matin newspaper, in
reference to allegations that neutral Switzerland colluded with the
Nazis during the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   ''And yet again, we are using false excuses to conceal the fact
that we don't dare to distance ourselves from a government
supported by a party whose head -- regardless of what he says --
represents Nazi or Neo-Nazi tendencies,'' said Felber, a social
democrat.
</P>
<P>
   European Union member nations have sought to isolate Austria
since Schuessel's government came to power in February, including
Joerg Haider's Freedom Party. Haider has made -- and since
apologized for -- statements in sympathy with aspects of the Nazi
regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian chancellor traditionally makes his first state
visit to neighboring Switzerland, which is not an EU member. The
Swiss government plans to accord Schuessel full diplomatic honors.
</P>
<P>
   Sigi Feigl, honorary president of the Jewish community in
Zurich, said he had rejected an invitation to attend a reception
with Schuessel in a Zurich hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''By becoming the first host to the Austrian chancellor who has
compromised with the far-right, Switzerland dissociates itself from
the Europeans and accords him deplorable and condemnable support,''
said a statement from the European Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The congress complained that a half-page advertisement featuring
the statement had been rejected by one of Switzerland's main
newspapers, the Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's acting editor, Hansrudolf Kamer, said the paper
refused to accept the text, calling it factually incorrect and
insulting to Schuessel. He said it was wrong to maintain that
Switzerland was an accomplice to right-wing extremism purely by
receiving the Austrian chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The highly respected Neue Zuercher Zeitung -- traditionally
sympathetic toward the business and banking establishment -- has
criticized the EU stance toward Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Environment ministers from France, Belgium and Italy called for
Austria's continued isolation at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Israel to Slow Plans  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is urging Israel to
slow its drive for international help in a July withdrawal from
Lebanon, a U.S. official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy was planning a trip to the
United Nations in an attempt to arrange international intervention
to ensure a smooth retreat.
</P>
<P>
   But at the behest of the Clinton administration, Israel has
agreed to at least a temporary delay, said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. Levy also will delay his trip,
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak reaffirmed his intention to
pull out of a security zone in southern Lebanon after President
Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed on Sunday to reopen
Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. request for a delay is intended to allow more time for
Assad to change his strategy and to offer new proposals to Israel,
as Clinton called for at a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the pro-goverment Egyptian newspaper Al-Gomuria quoted
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as saying en route home that he
had told Clinton at the White House on Tuesday that Assad ''is
unable to offer any compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak also was quoted as saying Barak had told him he wanted
some land claimed by Syria and ''my answer to him was that is
impossible. I have repeated this in front of Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria objects to a unilateral Israeli withdrawal. It seeks,
instead, to have an Israeli pullback included in an overall
agreement with Israel in which Syria also would recover the Golan
Heights, a strategic highground it lost in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon have slain Israeli
soldiers. One of Barak's main reasons in seeking an agreement with
Syria is to avoid more losses by giving up the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel withdraws without an agreement, it may have less of a
need for a treaty with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, James B. Foley, said the United
States would like to see all foreign forces -- presumably Syrian
troops as well as Israeli soldiers -- quit Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley said the administration preferred that an Israeli
pullback be part of an overall settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While the Israeli-Syrian negotiations that broke down in
mid-January have not resumed, ''the process is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say whether the United States would make
proposals of its own to Syria in an attempt to bridge differences
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Syria agrees to rein in Hezbollah guerrillas in south
Lebanon, a withdrawal from a border zone Israel occupies to protect
its northern towns could lead to an escalation of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the Israeli interest,'' Levy said Wednesday in
Jerusalem, ''if international elements will take steps to ensure
the quiet and prevent a deterioration of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday said Israel had offered to relinquish a
''significant'' portion of the contested Golan Heights but Assad
was simply stonewalling on terms for peace.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough that Assad say, ''I don't like your position''
and demand all the land Syria lost in the 1967 Middle East war,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you know what the other side wants and you don't think
you can do it, then you ought to come up with some alternative way
of trying to respond to the underlying concerns that are behind the
position,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Couric Helps Colon Screening Rise  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Roddy kept putting off a colon cancer exam until she and
6.7 million other viewers got a personal reminder from Katie
Couric.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Today'' show host's month-long public-awareness campaign --
during which she underwent a colonoscopy on the air -- is sending
extraordinary numbers of people to the doctor for colon cancer
checkups and casting light on a widespread killer that many are too
embarrassed to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably would have waited until the end of the year,'' said
Roddy, 64, of Indianapolis, a few minutes after her test this week.
''It's one of those things you want to put off and put off. It's
embarrassing, but the alternative is worse.'' Her news was good.
</P>
<P>
   It is the strongest wave of public interest since 1985, when
President Reagan underwent surgery to remove a suspicious polyp
from his colon. Two feet of the intestine was removed, and tests
days later revealed that the growth was cancerous but had not
spread far.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors this week are reporting a crush of patients seeking the
already common test, many of them for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of patients who were reluctant have seen the Katie
Couric thing and now say, 'Yeah, this is the thing to do!''' said
Roddy's physician, Dr. Douglas Rex of the Indiana University
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Popp Jr. at the University of South Carolina said:
''I've had people who literally said, 'I'm here because of Katie
Couric.'''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Today'' broadcast Couric's test March 7 during her
week-long series on colorectal cancer. The test, which is done with
a long fiber-optic tube, showed images from inside Couric's colon,
or large intestine.
</P>
<P>
   Couric's husband, TV legal analyst Jay Monahan, died two years
ago from the disease, which was discovered too late.
</P>
<P>
   ''My message all along has been: 'Talk to your doctor, talk to
your doctor, talk to your doctor.' And that's obviously what people
are doing,''' Couric said Thursday in an interview. ''I couldn't be
happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Even researchers got a boost. Two study groups seeking patients
got about 5,500 calls after their telephone numbers were broadcast
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll guess that 99 percent of the calls were due to that
broadcast,'' said Susan Booker, an administrator at one of the
research programs at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Couric also joined in other efforts in March, which the Senate
designated as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. On March 1, she
and others from the entertainment industry founded the National
Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance. The group has raised more than
$10 million, mostly for research. Couric's picture appears on
educational brochures handed out, along with free blood stool
tests, through about 25,000 drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 colon and rectal cancer cases were diagnosed last
year in the United States. About 56,600 people died from the
disease, which is second only to lung cancer in causing cancer
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Risk factors that may warrant testing include a family history
of the disease, blood in stool, or being over 50. The survival rate
is high when the disease is caught early.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Seeking China Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling it the ''biggest economic decision of
the 21st century,'' Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura urged Congress to
pass China trade legislation during a hearing Thursday on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   ''If you don't forge ahead to open China's markets, rest assured
the window of opportunity will be lost,'' he told members of the
House Ways and Means Committee. ''The Europeans would like nothing
better than for the U.S. Congress to continue fussing over this
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration hoped that Ventura's star appeal
would help win support for granting permanent normal trade
relations with China. The legislation, which would open the way for
China to join the World Trade Organization, faces an uncertain
future in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents include labor unions, critics of China's human rights
record. Leaders of the Reform Party, which Ventura quit last month,
also oppose normalizing relations with China.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan, who is leading
the opposition, released a letter signed by 18 lawmakers who in the
past have voted in favor of annual renewal of China's trade
privileges. These legislators said they would oppose permanent
normal trade status for China, which would eliminate Congress'
annual review.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We are all at this moment united in our opposition,'' said the
letter, which the group addressed to President Clinton. Also
signing the letter was Rep. Joe Baca, D-Calif., whose predecessor,
the late Rep. George Brown, had voted in favor of the annual
renewal of China's trade privleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Padilla, a spokesman for the Business Coalition for
U.S.-China Trade, the main lobbying group in support of permanent
trade relations, questioned whether opponents would be able to
produce as many votes as they are claiming.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides have conceded the House vote will be extremely close.
The administration is expected to have an easier time in winning
Senate passage of the legislation to scrap the annual review of
China's trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We don't have to approve of their human rights record to help
improve them,'' Ventura said. ''Opening their doors to our
businesses practices, our culture, and our democratic ideas will
open their process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura said that such a deal would help feed the Chinese,
adding, ''Isn't simple food on the table human rights?''
</P>
<P>
	   It would also help U.S. businesses and farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I don't want protectionist feelings in Congress to stand in
the way of progress for Minnesota,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the committee threw mostly softballs and platitudes
toward the celebrity-governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ''You just hit a home run,'' declared Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas. ''...You today have made this a tripartisan
effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   ''I thought it was a body-slam,'' Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif.,
told the former professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
	   But the biggest booster was Minnesota's own Rep. Jim Ramstad, a
Republican, who said that if every member of Congress had been
present for Ventura's testimony, ''I don't have any question that
we would pass PNTR for China.''
</P>
<P>
	   Only one member of the panel asked Ventura a pointed question.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Does it concern you that some corporations will go to China to
get low-paying jobs?'' asked Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   ''If they're our corporations, it's our job to look after them,
right?'' Ventura answered, adding that in Minnesota, the problem
isn't unemployment but too few employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura also pushed for normalized relations with Cuba, noting
he had brought it up in a meeting with Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I told him I'm tired of feeling like a criminal every time I
want a Cuban cigar,'' the governor quipped.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Pledging to end delays in
reconstruction efforts in the Balkans, international donors
promised $2.4 billion Thursday to revitalize the region's economy
and bolster its shaky democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money will go to 35 ''quick-start'' projects due to
start this year, including the repair and construction of roads,
bridges, power-grids and water supply networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're coming to the stage where projects become concrete
reality, become construction sites,'' said Bodo Hombach,
coordinator of the international Stability Pact for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The first project gets underway Friday: a $7 million plan to
improve a Kosovo-Macedonia border crossing by building parking
lots.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we say quick start, we mean it,'' said Daniel Hamilton,
the Stability Pact coordinator for the U.S. State Department. He
said another venture to improve Macedonia's highway network will
begin in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $1.8 billion sought for this year's projects,
the 44 nations and 36 international organizations attending the
Stability Pact conference pledged an additional $600 million to
prepare for projects over the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done well, we've exceeded expectations,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the international help, Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Macedonia and Romania have committed to democracy and
economic changes to attract private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Hombach said the international aid should help attract Western
companies to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''My main task as of tomorrow will be mobilizing private
investment,'' Hombach told a news conference. ''I don't think state
money can really deal with the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the government aid is coming from Europe. The European
Union's head office pledged $530 million, and the 15 EU nations
made individual pledges. The United States pledged $77.65 million.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the economic aid, the money will also fund
democracy-building projects such as training for local government
officials, improving history teaching and support for free media.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia was excluded from the package as donor nations continue
to demand Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bow to demands for
more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as Milosevic is in power, there will be no cooperation
with the federal government,'' said Hombach, adding that aid for
projects in Serbia could be freed up ''the moment that Serbia is
democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hombach said authorities in some EU nations planned to
expand aid to Serb cities run by opposition mayors by financing a
temporary ''humanitarian'' bridge across the Danube in the city of
Novi Sad to replace those destroyed by NATO bombing last year.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Named OPEC President  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- OPEC's latest meeting has confirmed
Venezuela's higher profile in the oil cartel: its oil minister was
named OPEC president and the group approved a Venezuelan proposal
to use frequent output changes to counter price instability.
</P>
<P>
   But Venezuela's share of OPEC's agreed output hike -- about
125,000 barrels a day -- may not be enough to rescue the South
American nation's faltering economy. And President Hugo Chavez is
being criticized by some oil experts who say he's courting Arab oil
producers at the expense of petroleum investment at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are your real partners OPEC or are they the partners that are
investing money with you?'' asked Luis Giusti, former president of
Venezuela's state oil monopoly, Petroleos de Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries and a top supplier of oil to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez was a key negotiator in
helping bring about Wednesday's agreement in Vienna, Austria,
raising oil output to rein in the prices that have reached
nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   After Iran reversed a decision not to raise output, the cartel
is now likely to increase production by around 1.7 million barrels
a day. Taking into account non-OPEC member Mexico's decision to
increase production -- and the probability of continued cheating on
quotas by major producers -- the total increase is likely to reach
the 2 million barrels a day sought by the United States and other
oil-importing nations who have seen a steep runup in gasoline and
heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna gathering appears to have sealed Venezuela's new
international oil policy stressing cooperation with OPEC. Rodriguez
was elected president of the cartel for one year in a move some
said was an attempt to reward Venezuela for reversing its
long-standing position as OPEC's perennial quota buster.
</P>
<P>
   The Chavez administration's decision to reduce output, honor
quotas and persuade other major producers to do the same was partly
behind the recent tripling of world oil prices from near historic
lows a little over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said OPEC had unanimously agreed to Venezuela's
proposal for an informal system of frequent output changes to keep
prices within a set range. He did not give any indication of what
the floor and ceiling of that range might be.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as the present administration is concerned, I would say
this (the Vienna meeting) is a big success for them,'' said Andres
Sosa Pietri, another former president of Petroleos de Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa also said the emphasis on cooperation with OPEC can be
no substitute for expanding Venezuela's production capacity beyond
its current 3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   He called Venezuela's share of the output hike ''window dressing
as far the economy here is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, he said, must capitalize on its comparative
advantages: the largest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere,
relatively low extraction costs and proximity to the United States,
which purchases most of Venezuela's oil.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's economy shrank by more than 7 percent last year,
partly because the country cut back on drilling and investment to
meet its OPEC export limit.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who tried to overthrow
Venezuela's elected government in 1992, has underscored Venezuela's
independence from Washington -- though the South American nation of
23 million people is still considered a moderate within OPEC.

<HEADLINE> Study: Microwaves Help Treat Tumors  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- When tumors on the cervix are too big to remove
surgically, heating them with microwaves during a course of
radiotherapy could work better than radiation alone at eliminating
the cancer, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Radiotherapy, a standard treatment for battling advanced
cervical tumors, often fails to work, partly because the tumors
contain high levels of oxygen-deprived cells, which do not respond
well to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say evidence has grown that radiotherapy should be
combined with chemotherapy, which can make cancer cells more
sensitive to radiation. The new findings could further contribute
to the way doctors attack cervical cancer, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal that
cervical tumors disappeared in 83 percent of women given
radiotherapy when the growths also were heated, compared with 57
percent of women given radiotherapy alone. The first group of women
also survived longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This the first really good randomized trial'' of the combined
radiotherapy-heat treatment in cervical cancer, said Dr. William
Hoskins, chief of gynecology in the Department of Surgery at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ''It's pretty
impressive data.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for some time that hyperthermia, whereby
temperatures are raised to about 108 degrees, is effective when
combined with radiation or chemotherapy, but the problem has been
developing a technique that delivers the heat correctly, Hoskins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Further study involving heat treatment added to a combined
radiotherapy-chemotherapy regimen is needed to assess how useful
the technique will be ultimately, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350,000 women worldwide are diagnosed with cervical
cancer every year, about 14,000 of them in the United States,
according to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins said treatment in the United States now usually involves
both radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Radiotherapy works best on tumor cells when they are dividing, a
time when they are most vulnerable. But when cells are deprived of
oxygen, they slow down and take longer to divide, giving them time
to repair damage. They are then stronger when they do divide and
can resist the radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the heat therapy probably works by killing
some of the cells directly and making others more susceptible to
conventional cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the study by researchers at the Rotterdam-Daniel University
Hospital, 358 people with inoperable bladder, rectal or cervical
tumors were given daily radiotherapy for five weeks. The cervical
group comprised 114 women whose tumors were so large they covered
other nearby tissue in the pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   Half the patients in each group also had weekly heat treatment
using targeted microwaves applied through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements were seen in each cancer, but the results were most
convincing for cervical tumors, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did cervical tumors respond better to the addition of
heat in a three-month follow-up but, three years after the study
began, 51 percent of the women given both techniques were still
alive, compared with 27 percent of those who got only radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is more good news for women with cervical cancer, coming
on the heels of five recent American studies showing improved
results in cervical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy along
with radiotherapy,'' said Dr. Stephen Rubin, chief of the Division
of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of Pennsylvania Health
System.

<HEADLINE> House Advances Doctors' Rights Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation giving doctors collective
bargaining rights with HMOs advanced in the Republican-controlled
House on Thursday, a measure backed by organized labor --
traditional foes of the GOP -- and opposed by the party's
benefactors in the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee voted 26-2 in favor of the legislation,
which would suspend antitrust restrictions that prohibit doctors
and other health care professionals from collective bargaining with
insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., the bill's leading advocate in
Congress, called the development a ''tremendous victory'' against
dictates by health maintenance organizations that can hamper
doctors and wind up curtailing patient care.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate Republican and Senate candidate who long has
advocated the measure, Campbell said House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., had pledged to allow the bill to the floor within several
days.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leadership expressed scant enthusiasm for the bill,
however, and several sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said a political bargain was at work.
</P>
<P>
   These sources, Republican aides and lawmakers who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Hastert pledged last fall to give
Campbell a vote on his measure, at the same time he was seeking the
Californian's support for a $792 billion tax cut measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressman Campbell does not trade votes,'' an aide said.
Campbell voted for the tax cut, which passed the House by a
relatively narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of various interest groups underscored the unusual
political forces at work on the doctors' bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Insurance Association of America attacked the measure
and said it would permit health care providers to ''boycott, fix
prices, engage in work slowdowns and stoppages and form unregulated
unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign funding reports show the HIAA has made $230,000 in
donations from 1997 forward, with $180,000 to Republicans and
$50,000 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a larger industry group, which includes employers,
the Health Benefits Coalition, has donated nearly $10 million over
the same period, roughly 80 percent to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, AFSME, a traditional Democratic ally that
represents state, county and local government workers, supports the
measure. Under current law, said the union's president, Gerald W.
McEntee, ''managed care insurers have been able to strong-arm
doctors into signing one-sided contracts which often violate
professional and ethical standards. It is these contracts that give
managed care insurers a license to deny and delay patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association, which represents doctors, also
supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity,
expressed frustration that the measure was advancing at the same
time lawmakers were attempting to fashion a compromise on a
patients' bill of rights -- a measure the health insurance industry
also looks on with disfavor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, public opinion polls indicate that HMOs are unpopular, and
several lawmakers from both parties expressed agreement they are
too powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The measure declares that permitting professions to bargain
collectively ''will create a more equal balance of negotiating
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Pease, R-Ind., expressed support because because of a
''problem for physicians and other health care producers.''
</P>
<P>
   He initially sought approval for an amendment that would have
required either the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice
Department's antitrust unit to stipulate in advance that bargaining
would ''promote competitive and enhance the quality of patient
care.''
</P>
<P>
   A second Republican, Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, suggested
that government pre-approval be required only for groups that made
up less than 20 percent of health care professionals in an area.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., argued that would provide
protection ''as long as you are weak enough not to have enough
Democrats argued give its approval before any negotiations could
begin. Goodlatte's proposal was adopted, 17-13, but then wiped out
when Pease withdrew his amendment without seeking a vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not before Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of the most
conservative lawmakers on the committee, said he found it ''very
strange to hear Republicans arguing'' for adding additional
government regulations to legislation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Challenger: Chavez Is Corrupt  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A fellow ex-coup leader who is
challenging President Hugo Chavez for Venezuela's highest office on
Thursday accused the head of Congress and a key Chavez ally of
being a ''delinquent.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arias, a former army officer who helped Chavez stage
his 1992 coup attempt, personally delivered a series of corruption
charges against congressional head Luis Miquilena to the attorney
general's office in Caracas, the capital. The charges stem from a
government printing contract Miquilena allegedly gave to a company
in which he holds shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''A country cannot keep a congressional president who is a
delinquent,'' Arias told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Miquilena dismissed the allegations, insisting Arias was the
corrupt one because he mishandled funds in the Zulia state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Arias was governor of the oil-rich state of Zulia until earlier
this month. He is one of three former army officers who helped
Chavez carry out the coup attempt but who recently broke with the
president, saying he has betrayed the original goals of their
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Because Arias is not associated with the traditional political
parties that Chavez's leftist coalition has all but destroyed, he
is seen to have a chance at victory in May 28 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Arias said he ''deplored'' Chavez's decision to use Miquilena
and Cuban leader Fidel Castro as ''guides for running a country.''
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution pushed through by Chavez last year requires
most public offices, including the presidency, to be
''relegitimated'' through new elections. Chavez took office just
over a year ago promising to carry out a ''social revolution'' and
rule in favor of the poor.

<HEADLINE> House approves millions to aid lobstermen  </HEADLINE>
cbstfpr
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. House Thursday approved $8.6 million
to help lobstermen hit hard by the mysterious deaths of lobster in
the Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The money will pay for additional research into the cause of the
massive die-off and create a revolving loan fund to help lobstermen
refinance their business obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriation was part of a $13 billion package of money for
the Pentagon, Colombia and recovery from Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   While the money is helpful, it's also not nearly enough, said
Rep. Christopher Shays.
</P>
<P>
   ''The House appropriated $40 million for citrus growers to
compensate for lost production due to the unexpected breakout of
citrus canker. Like them, the Long Island Sound lobstermen deserve
our help,'' the Stamford Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not merely a bad year for the lobster crop on the Long
Island Sound. It is the disappearance of an entire species. It is a
disaster no one anticipated and therefore no one prepared for,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is working on a similar version of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Bush Unveils Teacher Training Plan  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- On a campaign day that took him from finger
painting to fund raising, George W. Bush borrowed from former rival
John McCain and the Clinton administration in formulating ideas for
supporting teachers and ensuring classroom discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, also gave a glimpse
Thursday into how he will select a No. 2 for his ticket as he
rolled out another $3 billion in federal education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at Milwaukee's Fritsche Middle School with Gov.
Tommy Thompson, Bush was asked about the open speculation that
surrounded Bob Dole's 1996 pick of a running mate. Thompson, who
was passed over by Dole, had complained at the time about the
indignity of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not yet put a strategy in place, but promised
''a quiet effort to screen potential candidates'' by a selection
committee of people who can ''keep their counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There does not need to be a lot of needless leaks, rumors and
gossip,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion with a dozen education policymakers in the
Fritsche library, Bush enumerated his plan for a big expansion of
the ''troops to teachers'' program for turning highly skilled
retired military personnel into math and science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator McCain talked a lot about this in the course of the
primaries and I appreciate him bringing this issue to our
collective attention,'' Bush said of the program begun during
President Clinton's first term. Bush proposed increasing funds from
$2.4 million to $30 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a signal that says there are a lot of good people who
should be welcomed into the ranks of teachers,'' said Bush, the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other proposals, which would bring the total cost of
Bush's education agenda to $13.4 billion over five years were:
</P>
<P>
   --An additional $400 million each year for state programs that
currently get $2 billion annually from Washington to recruit new
teachers or retrain existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   --A tax deduction of up to $400 a year for teachers who buy
school supplies with their own money.
</P>
<P>
   --A ''Teacher Protection Act'' to ''shield teachers from
meritless lawsuits when they enforce reasonable classroom rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat battling Bush in this
presidential contest for the upper hand on education, has, by
contrast, proposed to boost the federal investment in education by
$115 billion over 10 years -- more than four times Bush's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real centerpiece of his agenda is an enormous tax cut that
may force him to go back on these promises,'' said Gore campaign
spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''He hasn't said how he's going to pay for
the tax cut without cutting education programs, dipping into Social
Security or dragging us back to deficit spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed the spending gap. ''His motto is, 'Vote for me;
I'll spend more money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Taking questions from reporters, Bush confessed that he has not
yet opened his census form. ''I've been traveling, as you know,''
he said. But he sympathized with those Americans facing the ''long
form'' census, which has 53 questions that some congressional
Republicans have criticized as intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want as accurate a count as possible but I can understand
why people don't want to give over that information to the
government. And if I have the long form I'm not so sure I would
either,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, the subject of a
criminal investigation into past financial dealings, Bush said
''Mr. Coelho ought to be innocent until proven guilty, of course.
But the vice president ought to be taking this seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not addressed the substance of the allegations against
Coelho, saying only that Coelho was doing a good job on the
campaign and would remain on staff.
</P>
<P>
   Before a 45-minute flight to Milwaukee, Bush toured a preschool
class at Locust Lane Elementary school in Eau Claire, Wis. The
business-suit-clad candidate mischievously eyed the finger paints.
''No, I better not,'' he said. But within minutes he was back at
the paint station, rolling paint-smeared marbles across white
paper.
</P>
<P>
   He beamed as he showed of his artwork: ''A Rorschach test of
me!''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, he had toured Milwaukee's Harley-Davidson plant
because, as spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, it is ''a symbol of
Wisconsin pride.'' Bush also headlined a $75-per-plate benefit
dinner for the Waukesha County GOP.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Determined in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia's U.N. ambassador decided Thursday to
go it alone --at least on the trip from the airport -- when all 15
members of the Security Council made an unprecedented visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sharing a bus with some of the other members, Sergey
Lavrov took a Russian Embassy car to the State Department, the
first stop in a hectic schedule that also took them to the Capitol
and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Courteous but outspoken, and determined not to be overwhelmed by
Washington's power brokers, the ambassadors stepped gingerly onto
the political stage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in advance if he would be outspoken during the day's
meetings, Lavrov said he was in Washington in a ''private
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   He elaborated: ''You know that being in a private capacity means
we would be acting on impulses, not instructions, so we'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Lavrov joined his fellow ambassadors on the
bus from the State Department to the Capitol, to avoid getting
caught in Washington traffic. The bus had a police escort.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On a daylong outing from what Lavrov called the boredom of New
York, the ambassadors got a lesson on U.S. history and were treated
as VIPs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like a tourist,'' Lavrov said after listening to Senate
historian Richard Baker. ''I came as a tourist for that lecture,
and I listened as a tourist and I was not bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though several ambassadors insisted repeatedly that they
were in Washington as individuals -- not as THE Security Council --
Sen. Jesse Helms, the host for the day -- managed to get the 15
ambassadors to pose for a class photo with him after a 2{-hour
roundtable with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he
heads.
</P>
<P>
   The main business of the day was U.N. reform, a pet project of
Helms who has been one of the most vocal critics of the world body,
and U.N. peacekeeping, which in the past nine months has expanded
dramatically to Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone and Congo. But
underlying the visit was the frayed relationship between the United
States and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
invited Helms to speak to the Security Council in January and the
senator reciprocated with an invitation to the Capitol. But Lavrov,
among others, did not accept until Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright also extended invitations on an individual basis for a
briefing and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh's U.N. Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, the current
Security Council president, told Helms that his visit in January
''was an ice-breaking one.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the dessert served at a lavish lunch -- called ''The
Capitol Dome with white chocolate mousse'' -- he said ''ours ... was
a chocolate-breaking one.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Canadian envoy Robert Fowler ended his serious remarks about
U.N. reform with a personal plea to Helms and the other senators
for a ''a technical contribution'' to the Security Council -- the
timing device in the committee room with green, yellow and red
lights that warns speakers when their time is running out. He said
it could ''significantly streamline'' operations at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it worth a billion dollars?,'' quipped Sen. Carl Levin of
Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, who also briefed the council members. The United States
contends it owes the United Nations $1 billion though the U.N.
officials say the debt is $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Many Security Council members are frequent visitors to
Washington, and well-versed in American history, but it was the
first trip to Washington for China's new U.N. ambassador, Wang
Yingfan.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the Statuary Hall, where the House of
Representatives once met, the Capitol's top tour guide Ted Daniel
told the ambassadors that if they stood in one spot, they could
hear him speak from across the noisy room. They listened -- and
heard him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Origins of the CIA,'' quipped Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the beginning of eavesdropping,'' added Bangladesh's
Chowdhury.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market
mutual funds rose by $6.32 billion in the latest week to $1.005
trillion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose
by $5.76 billion to $835.29 billion for the week ended Wednesday,
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund
assets rose by $559.5 million to $169.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $11.64
billion to $698.73 billion for the same period. Among institutional
funds, taxable money market fund assets fell by $11.35 billion to
$646.99 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $296.7 million
to $51.74 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Total money market assets stood at $1.703 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.709 trillion to
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 5.38 percent from 5.32 percent the
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal

   The seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.53 percent from 5.46
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to
5.45 percent from 5.42 percent, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 48 days, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage
yield available on money market accounts remained unchanged at 2.04
percent as of Wednesday from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing
checking accounts rose to 0.83 percent from 0.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.88 percent
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.85 percent the
previous week. Yields were 5.32 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 5.31
percent; 5.59 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 5.56 percent; and
6.00 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.95 percent.

<HEADLINE> Congo Limits Tribunal's Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A military tribunal that has passed
hundreds of death sentences will no longer have blanket authority
to try civilians, Congo's president said following condemnations of
the court by the United Nations and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also setting up a committee to review the
court's convictions, according to a statement from President
Laurent Kabila, read on state-run television Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, known as the Military Court of Order, was set up
by Kabila to handle discipline problems within the army after he
seized power in 1997. But it has slowly extended its jurisdiction
to non-army matters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United Nations said over 250 people -- both
soldiers and civilians -- had been executed over the previous two
years by order of the tribunal for crimes against Kabila's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions of the court, which is headquartered in Kinshasa with
branches across the country, have until now been irreversible.
Kabila did not say, however, when the review committee would be set
up or how it would function.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal will continue to handle military matters, the
statement said. Civilians will be tried by regular courts except
under ''exceptional cases called for by the law,'' Kabila said
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the United Nations or
rights groups, which have said the panel should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kabila, journalists, opposition members and rights
activists have been repeatedly harassed in this central African
nation, which is divided by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire agreement was signed last summer by Kabila and his
allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by the main rebel
factions and their allies, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But fighting continues, with both sides accusing each other of
violations.

<HEADLINE> Counsel: 'Disconnect' on E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House counsel Beth Nolan said Thursday
there was a ''disconnect'' in the White House e-mail controversy,
with computer specialists aware of a widespread problem in 1998
while presidential lawyers were not.
</P>
<P>
   The ''technical people knew'' many e-mails were not being
archived so that they could be searched for possible turnover to
various investigations, Nolan told the House Government Reform
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no question there was a disconnect'' with
the White House counsel's office being aware of a ''glitch'' but no
major problem, Nolan said under questioning by committee chief
counsel Jim Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan revealed that the White House lawyers' point of contact
about the ''glitch'' was presidential aide Mark Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay has been accused by a White House contract employee,
Betty Lambuth, of threatening her with jail unless she kept quiet
about the e-mail problem. Lindsay denies threatening employees, but
says he did ask them to keep quiet because he did not want a lot of
office gossip on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said that Lindsay and then-counsel Charles F.C. Ruff
discussed what Ruff thought was a narrowly defined computer problem
that was quickly being solved.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said that the White House double-checked in order to be
certain that all e-mails relating to Monica Lewinsky were being
produced to investigators. When that check was completed and no new
e-mails were found, the counsel's office thought the problem was
taken care of, said Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the White House to say that there was a disconnect is
flatly false,'' committee spokesman Mark Corallo said after the
hearing. ''There was ample evidence of a widespread problem in the
form of a memo to the deputy chief of staff. The White House made a
calculated decision to keep a lid on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan also suggested that a 1999 court affidavit describing the
White House e-mail system was literally true, even though it gave
no indication of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''E-mail was archived, but some e-mail was not captured,'' she
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that is not what the affidavit says,'' snapped the
committee chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan and Justice Department lawyer Robert Raben said they did
not know who assisted White House computer specialist Daniel Barry
in filing the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inconceivable you come up here and not have any of the
answers,'' Burton told Raben, who promised to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Burton sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department
suggesting that Barry committed perjury in the affidavit filed in a
lawsuit. The affidavit stated that ''e-mail within the EOP
(Executive Office of the President) system ... has been archived in
the ... Automated Records Management System.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems -- which White House officials learned of
in June 1998 -- did not become public until February in a lawsuit
over the Clinton White House's gathering of FBI background files of
Republican appointees from past administrations.
</P>
<P>
   It may take 170 days to reconstruct e-mail back-up tapes and
conduct a thorough search of e-mails that haven't been reviewed,
Nolan testified. There are 625 back-up tapes for Vice President Al
Gore's office alone, Nolan said. The time estimate of 170 days was
a sharp reduction from an earlier estimate of one to two years.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer To Elian's Dad Knows Politics  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE PFLEGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gracing the evening news and handling
high-profile cases is nothing new for Greg Craig, the attorney for
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   As the special counsel for President Clinton during his
impeachment trial, Craig took the spotlight as one of the
president's chief defenders and spokesman for his legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Since graduating from Yale law school in 1972, Craig has
represented a variety of clients. He helped defend John Hinckley
after his failed attempt to assassinate President Reagan and has
lobbied Washington power brokers on behalf of a wealthy Haitian
family who tried to ward off economic sanctions harmful to their
business.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, Craig -- an attorney with a top Washington law
firm, Williams &AMP; Connolly -- traveled to Cuba with two U.S.
religious leaders for a meeting with Cuban officials and Gonzalez.
He agreed to help Gonzalez try to regain custody of his son Elian,
the 6-year-old Cuban refugee who was found floating at sea after a
shipwreck more than four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our trip to Cuba was really exploratory,'' said Rev. Dr. Joan
Brown Campbell, former general secretary of the National Council of
Churches. She went on the Cuba trip and hosted Elian's grandmothers
on their visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Craig ''wanted to be very clear that he could
represent the father and the father would be a free agent.'' And
Craig wanted to be sure Gonzalez would accept his counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Craig asked the State Department Thursday for visas for Gonzalez
and other family members to come to the United States during the
immigration appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez ''is ready at a moment's notice,'' once he gets
assurances that Elian will be put in his custody during the legal
proceedings, Craig told a crowd of reporters outside his office.
''He has been ready, willing and waiting for too many weeks, for
too many months.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig's legal services will be paid through contributions to a
humanitarian fund established by the General Board of Church and
Society of The United Methodist Church, the Washington-based
organization said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At 55, Craig is not a stranger to politics.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy during the 1980s, Craig advised
the Massachusetts senator on foreign policy and defense. Later, he
offered him counsel during the 1991 rape trial of Kennedy's nephew,
William Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also served as the State Department's director of policy
planning, as well as a stint overseeing the department's Tibet
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to the press, Craig, a father of five, chastised
Elian's Miami relatives, who have him in custody, for allowing news
cameras into his bedroom and parading him before demonstrators in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one on the face of this planet care more about the
well-being and welfare of Elian Gonzalez than does his father,''
Craig said. ''Can anyone doubt that the time is long overdue for
this boy to be reunited with his father?''

<HEADLINE> Indian Tribes Work To Be Counted  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to get a more accurate count of the
country's American Indian population, the Census Bureau is turning
to tribal leaders and residents on reservations to help overcome
long-standing feelings of wariness or anger toward the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship hasn't been stress-free, tribal leaders say,
but there has been marked improvement from 1990, when Census
officials estimate it missed about 4.5 percent of the American
Indian population. The national undercount rate was 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation
that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, about one in
eight Navajos were not counted in 1990. The tribe is determined not
to let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've created an alliance with the Census Bureau where the
Navajo nation has profound control over the count, by way of hiring
our own Navajo people to go out and enumerate, and the maps for
enumeration were created by Navajo chapters,'' said Mellor Willie,
spokesman for tribal president Kelsey Begaye.
</P>
<P>
   More alarming to the National Congress of American Indians
governmental affairs director Jack Jackson, Jr. is that an
estimated 12.2 percent of all Indians living on reservations were
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was
that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps, and may
have been unaware of tribal customs, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo government estimates there are about 250,000 Navajos
today. Willie said the Navajos missed out on $110 million in
federal funding in the 1990s because of the undercount.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think a lot of Navajo people within the last census
count knew this was helping in their communities,'' Willie said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, the Census Bureau sought more input from tribal
governments five years ago, said Tom Beavers, partnership
specialist for the regional census center in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we hire now, we want to hire people who live in their own
communities to work in their own communities, and we have told
Indian leaders in our communities that,'' said Beavers, himself an
American Indian, who in his job works with tribes in Oklahoma and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Federal programs distributed to American Indians based on census
data include the Native American Employment and Training Programs,
grants to local education agencies for Indian education, and family
violence prevention and services.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has gone smoothly though. Earlier this month,
leaders on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana threatened to
arrest census workers after complaints that local census managers
failed to keep him informed of hiring decisions and other business
on the reservation. The order has since been rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Others like Brenda Boyd, census liaison for the Mille Lacs Band
of Chippewa in Onamia, Minn., complain that at times, there is too
much red tape in getting simple answers from regional census
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees, though, that they are better off than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''This census is much better,'' Boyd said. ''Last time, the
count was way off.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Dives 186.78; Dow Off 38.47  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index narrowly averted its
worst day in history Thursday, ending a volatile session sharply
lower as investors bailed out of the high-tech stocks that have run
up dramatically in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   A confluence of factors battered the sector, but analysts said
investors' growing uneasiness about the high prices for many
technology stocks was the biggest contributor to the selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 186.78 to close at 4,457.89, a loss of 4.0
percent. With less than 30 minutes remaining in the session, the
Nasdaq was down 289 points before recovering ground as investors
guessed that the index had reached rock-bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's plunge carried over to the broader market, dragging
the Dow Jones industrial average into negative territory after the
Dow had risen as much as 124 points earlier in the session. The Dow
ended down 38.47 at 10,980.25.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 20.60 to 1,487.92 and the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 11.43 to 531.57.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have been in a slide since March 10, when the
Nasdaq closed at a record high of 5,048.62. Just this week, the
Nasdaq has fallen 505.14 points. It suffered its fifth-biggest
one-day point drop Thursday; its largest drop ever was 229.46
points on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Triple-digit point swings in the Nasdaq are becoming more
commonplace amid continuing volatility in technology issues. Nine
of the index's 10 biggest one-day declines have come this year, as
have nine of the 10 biggest one-day point gains.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several factors derailed the high-tech sector,
pushing the Nasdaq well into market watchers' definition of a
correction -- a reversal of an upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   At the core, investors hoping to capture profits continued a
selloff of stocks that have performed especially well this year.
What's more, with the end of the first quarter on Friday, mutual
fund managers dumped technology stocks so quarterly reports won't
show faltering high-tech names.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless data company Qualcomm fell 12 17/64 to 145 15/64 and
network equipment maker Cisco Systems fell 2 7/16 to 73|. Apple
Computer lost 10 3/16 to 125}.
</P>
<P>
   The selling pressure knocked the Nasdaq below 4,450 -- a
so-called technical benchmark that prompted a wave of
computer-driven selling. Only as the Nasdaq headed toward 4,400 did
investors step back into the market, bringing the index back from
its nadir.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors' increasing jitters over the highly
volatile technology sector are preventing many from
bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The psychological nerve of the market is slowly beginning to
unravel a bit,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist
at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The market's swoon followed the announcement that Tiger
Management, a family of hedge funds, will soon shut down. Tiger,
run by renowned money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr., was once
among the world's largest hedge fund families with $21 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson made his name and his fortune by investing in
undervalued industrial or transportation companies. His resistance
to technology stocks contributed to his funds' downfall -- Tiger
recently had about $6 billion in assets -- and subjected him to
criticism from some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's parting shot to the sector contributed to Thursday's
selling pressure, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current technology, Internet and telecom craze, fueled by
the performance desires of investors, money managers and even
financial buyers, is unwittingly creating a Ponzi pyramid destined
for collapse,'' Robertson said in a letter to Tiger's limited
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in technology marred a strong advance by many
old-line industrial companies. United Technologies rose 3} to 61],
3M rose 1] to 89 and Coca-Cola gained 1 11/16 to 48 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology specialists are starting to use the 'v' word --
value,'' said Zane Brown, vice president at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co.
''People are questioning valuations and are less willing to buy
technology stocks at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco rose 2 7/16 to 11} after financier Carl Icahn said he is
prepared to begin a cash tender offer of $13 a share for 100
million shares. The plans represent his most ambitious effort yet
to gain control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were further unnerved by a report that the U.S.
economy soared to an annual growth rate of 7.3 percent in the final
three months of 1999, the strongest performance in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the gross domestic product -- the country's total
output of goods and services -- was sharper than analysts had
expected, and raised worries that the Federal Reserve will continue
raising interest rates in order to force a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered
decliners by a 6-to-5 margin. On the Nasdaq, decliners led
advancers by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.43 billion shares, compared with
1.28 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Germany's DAX index fell 2.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE
100 lost 2.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 3.0 percent. Japan's
Nikkei stock average fell 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Spirit Accuses Northwest As Unfair  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH L. DICKEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines, no stranger to
accusations of unfair competitive practices, faces a new legal
challenge by a low-fare carrier that says Northwest muscled it out
of several routes from Detroit in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Spirit Airlines, a low-fare carrier based in Miramar, Fla., said
in a complaint filed in Detroit federal court Wednesday that
Northwest forced it to abandon flights from Detroit to Boston and
Philadelphia by slashing prices and flooding those routes with new
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, dominates
service in Detroit, one of its three hubs, with about 75 percent of
all passengers who pass through Detroit Metro Airport. Spirit
handles about 2 percent of Metro's passengers, flying mostly to
East Coast resort cities.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, based near Minneapolis, said in a statement Thursday
that it has competed fairly. Northwest contended that Spirit is
healthy, citing the fact that it has opened new routes and has
acquired more aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Spirit's complaint alleges that Northwest's reaction to its
emergence in the market was predatory pricing: willfully losing
money in the short term to drive out competition, then recovering
losses by raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also alleges Northwest thwarted Spirit by charging
discriminatory prices for access to gates it controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to teach low-cost new entrants a lesson: Don't
mess with our hub,'' said Albert Foer, president of the American
Antitrust Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nearly impossible to prove in court, Foer said. The
challenge lies in demonstrating that the major competitor operated
at a loss in the particular market and strove to recoup losses in
that same market.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Northwest that operate in networks are capable of
recovering losses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Spirit is not the first small rival to complain to regulators
that Northwest maintains a stranglehold on its markets.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, AirTran Airways, the former ValuJet, said it
would reconsider planned new service from the Twin Cities to
Atlanta after Northwest added 40 percent more seats to the route.
Northwest maintains it decided to add the seats before AirTran
announced its intentions, and the purpose was to compete with
Atlanta-based Delta Airlines, not AirTran. Two members of Congress
and the Twin Cities' Metropolitan Airports Commission want federal
officials to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint came from Sun Country Airlines, a small
carrier based in suburban Minneapolis which began scheduling
low-fare flights last summer to markets served by Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Sun Country complained when Northwest excluded a
big Minneapolis area travel agency from Northwest's discount ticket
promotions. That agency had sold more Sun Country tickets than any
other agency in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also banned the courtesy practice of selling airline
parts to Sun Country, and discontinued arrangements in which Sun
Country paid Northwest to use its facilities for crew training.
Both moves sent the smaller airline scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   And now-defunct carriers Reno Air, Kiwi Airlines and Access Air
have all complained of being bullied by Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In a case similar to Spirit's, the Justice Department accuses
Dallas-based American Airlines of undercutting fares to drive out
tiny Vanguard Airlines. American raised its fares once Vanguard
withdrew, according to the lawsuit. Foer said it's the first such
suit brought in a generation, and will help determine the future of
airline regulation.

<HEADLINE> USDA Bans Ozone-Depleting Pesticide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The worldwide phase-out of an ozone-depleting
pesticide could cost U.S. consumers and producers $400 million to
$450 million a year if alternatives aren't developed for farmers to
use, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loss from the phase-out of methyl bromide would be
to growers of strawberries, tomatoes and other vegetables,
according to a study released by the Agriculture Department's
Economic Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Methyl bromide, an odorless, colorless gas, is used to fumigate
the soil, treat commodities while in storage and control pests
during government-imposed quarantines. California and Florida
account for 80 percent of its use as a soil fumigant.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, use of the pesticide was to be cut by 25
percent last year, 50 percent in 2001, 70 percent in 2003 and then
eliminated in 2005 except for limited purposes, such as
quarantines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The phaseout of methyl bromide will cause substantial,
short-term losses to U.S. producers and consumers of crops treated
with methyl bromide until more cost-effective alternatives are
developed and made available,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Imports of Mexican-produced tomatoes, peppers and eggplants
would likely increase because Mexico is not phasing out methyl
bromide until 2015, USDA said. Mexico is classified as a developing
country under the treaty that required the elimination of the
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely alternatives to methyl bromide as a soil
fumigant are chemicals called Telone and chloropicrin, but
California and Florida have restrictions on both due to air and
water quality concerns. Other chemicals have not been approved by
federal regulators.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Loses Vs. Major Currencies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar lost ground against most European
currencies and fell against the Japanese yen. The euro bounced up
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The weakened dollar was attributed to the declines in U.S.
stocks, led by a big selloff Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The Nasdaq index fell 186 to 4,457, a loss of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 96.13 cents, up
from 95.17 cents late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar fell to 105.46 Japanese yen from 105.81 yen
Tuesday. Yen buyers were encouraged by the industrial output data,
which suggested that parts of Japan's ailing economy may be moving
toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6576 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6751, and 1.4554 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4575. The
dollar fell against the British pound, which fetched $1.5954,
compared with $1.5944 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0348 German
marks, down from 2.0556; 6.8244 French francs, down from 6.8943;
and 2,014.43 Italian lire, down from 2,035.07.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Soar on Stock Selloff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose across-the-board Thursday as
investors sought safety during a stock market selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 11/32
point, or $13.44 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, plunged to 5.87 percent from 5.97
percent at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors contributed to the rally, but bond prices
surged primarily because stock prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   Investors bailed out of technology stocks for a fourth straight
session, sending the Nasdaq composite index on one of its worst
one-day slides in history. The index closed down 186.78 to close at
4,457.89, a loss of about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline spread to the broader market, dragging the
Dow Jones industrial average down 38.47 at 10,980.25.
</P>
<P>
   The market for government-backed Treasury bonds is frequently
seen by investors as a safe haven when the stock market skids.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries also benefited from concern that the U.S. government
might cut its ties with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which hurt the
market for mortgage-backed and agency debt this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader bond market, prices of short-term and
intermediate Treasury securities also rose. Short-term notes rose
5/32 point to 7/32 point, while intermediate notes rose 13/32 point
to 25/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information
service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.87 percent as the
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.70 percent. Six-month
yields were 6.14 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage
point to 5.87 percent. One-year yields were 6.23 percent as the
discount fell 0.05 percentage point to 5.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 11/32 to 95 11/32. The average yield to
maturity fell to 5.98 percent from 6.01 percent Wednesday.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian police arrested seven suspected
Hamas extremists Thursday in the West Bank and confiscated weapons
and ammunition there, Palestinian security sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of the
men arrested was Khaled Hadj, 35, the Hamas spokesman in Jenin, a

   The seven suspects were taken to a prison in Jenin for
interrogation after they were detained by agents of Preventive
Security, an arm of Yasser Arafat's self-rule Palestinian Authority

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Lucent Hoax, 1st Ld-Writethru,635  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Houston man was arrested Thursday on charges
that he violated securities laws by posting a phony press release
on the Internet that caused the stock of Lucent Technologies to
plunge in value.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Moldofsky, 43, was blamed by prosecutors in Manhattan for
causing the value of the stock of the world's top manufacturer of
communications equipment to fall as much as 3.6 percent from $62.62
to $60.37, enough to trim the value of the company to Wall Street
by $7.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared Thursday in U.S. District Court in Houston, where
Assistant U.S. Attorney George Tallichet requested that Moldofsky
be held without bail as a flight risk. Moldofsky agreed to remain
in custody until a bail hearing in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A federal defender assigned to represent Moldofsky in Houston
did not immediately return a telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
charged Modofsky with securities fraud, alleging he posted the
phony earnings warning on March 22 in the form of a press release,
the same day he traded 6,000 shares of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   It said he tried to hide his fraud by using phony names and
addresses on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is the latest example of our commitment to the
speedy investigation and prosecution of those who choose to use the
Internet as the medium through which to commit securities fraud,''
said U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who seek to deceive the investing public should be
forewarned that the Internet provides no anonymity and offers no
insulation from law enforcement,'' she said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   The bogus Internet release alleged that the former division of
AT&AMP;T expected its operating results for its second fiscal quarter
of 2000 to be lower than analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The fake announcement was made at a time when companies
typically issue any warnings about their earnings prior to the
actual earnings reports later in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Murray Hill, N.J., company actually had warned
that its earnings would fall short of expectations, causing
analysts to slash estimates and the value of the company's stock to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, U.S. Postal Inspector Thomas F.X. Feeney said
the phony posting was made on an electronic bulletin board attached
to the Web site entitled, ''Yahoo? Finance.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said a Yahoo user identified as ''hot like wasabe''
posted a message at 6:57 p.m. captioned, ''LUCENT RELEASES EARNINGS
WARNING! DAMN!''
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the message was the phony news release, Feeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Between March 22 and March 23, a user identifying himself with a
screen name that mimicked the name of someone who regularly gives
stock advice on the Internet posted messages such as ''LUCENT
Warns!'' ''We're all doomed tomorrow!'' and ''LUCENT WARNS! I'm
going to cut my throat.'' Each of the messages, he said, allowed
readers to connect to the bogus news release.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said the wording of the phony news release was similar to
that of a Jan. 6 news release in which Lucent announced that its
first quarter earnings would be lower than analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said he eventually tracked down the man who posted the
bogus news release as an American Online user identifying himself
online as ''WALLSTREETWEEK.'' In a home page, Moldofsky said he was
a full-time online stock investor, according to the investigator.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Moldofsky could face up to 10 years in prison and
a fine of $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss resulting from
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Moldofsky was arrested at his Houston home by federal agents and
was being held in that city for an initial court appearance.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Party leader says Bush to headline dinner  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the expected
Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to speak at the annual
dinner of the New York Conservative Party, the head of the
influential third party said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long said Bush's decision to
speak at the New York City event on May 17 was ''a clear signal''
that the governor's presidential campaign isn't writing off the
heavily Democratic state for November, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts have said they do not expect the GOP to
contest New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to me the governor and his campaign have not made
up their minds to walk away from New York,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said ''we
have not yet accepted this invitation ... It's something that's
under consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tucker said Long was correct in assuming that Bush
was not writing off New York and noted the Texas governor had
attened a $1,000-a-person, fund-raising reception for the Bush
campaign in New York City on Wednesday hosted by Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ''He intends to campaign there. It's going to be a very
competitive state,'' Tucker said. ''Traditionally, Democrats do
very well in New York, but at this point we are not conceding any
ground anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Told about Tucker's comments, Long said ''my understanding is
it's a green light'' for Bush to attend the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe they haven't formally accepted it, that's possible,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican presidential candidate has carried New York, where
Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-3 margin, since Ronald
Reagan pulled it off in 1980 and 1984. Reagan courted New York's
Conservative Party early on, speaking at its annual dinner in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's possible to do it again,'' Long said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people aren't going to sit on their hands in this race,''
Long added. ''They don't want (Democrat) Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has not been officially endorsed by the Conservative
Party, Long said he expected the Texas governor would easily win
the party's backing.
</P>
<P>
   Long said Bush's appearance at the $500-a-person dinner would
not only help him in New York, but because of media coverage
spilling into neighboring Connecticut and New Jersey, could help
him in those states as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is expected to attend the Conservative Party dinner, as
he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   Not on the invitation list is New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, the Republican running for the U.S. Senate against
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Giuliani, who has had Liberal Party backing
in his mayoral campaigns, has never been invited to the annual
Conservative Party dinner. Long has been looking for a
Giuliani-Clinton alternative to run for the Senate on the
Conservative Party line.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, third party support can be important in close races
because unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates
to add the votes from minor party ballot lines to their totals.
Pataki won the 1994 governor's race over Democratic incumbent Mario
Cuomo on the strength of the vote on the Conservative Party line.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Targeting Money Laundering  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) -- The United Nations launched a
drive Thursday to enlist secretive offshore havens in the struggle
against money laundering -- appropriately, at a conference set on a
tiny island that is the world's fifth-largest banking center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amounts involved in these financial scandals have gone
beyond what the world community is prepared to tolerate,'' said
Pino Arlacchi, a U.N. undersecretary general and executive director
of the Vienna-based U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference was aimed at getting offshore havens to
adhere to a set of banking regulations laid out by the Paris-based
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
   But some countries said stricter regulations could drive them
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a fact that in the offshore sector there's a greater
scope for money-laundering because of the confidentiality and
secrecy involved,'' the director of international financial
services for the South American nation of Belize, Gian Gandhi, told
the AP. ''But for fledgling new industries like ours it would be
suicidal to enforce those laws at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   To put the problem in perspective, Arlacchi cited last year's
case of at least $7 billion that Russian criminals moved through
the Bank of New York -- and compared it to Jamaica's gross domestic
product of $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact that it was a New York bank showed that ''the
issues involved must also be relevant to 'onshore' jurisdictions,''
said George McCarthy, financial secretary of the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven of the world's 55 offshore centers attended the
conference, representing more than 50 percent of offshore business,
organizers said. The only major player absent was Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 developed nations in the Paris-based OECD are targeting
countries with ''harmful tax practices'' to fight the loss of
billions of dollars to tax-free havens. And the United States is
targeting states that allow criminals to legitimize their illegal
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald J. Ranochak, a former U.S. Federal Reserve official who
is coordinating the U.N. forum, said the United Nations would offer
technical assistance and training to countries ''seen to move
forward'' in the anti-money laundering battle.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the countries require only a few thousand dollars to
register a company that can then be used to shelter tax money or
criminal proceeds. Creating several such fictitious companies and
shuffling money among them makes it even harder for regulators to
detect its origin.
</P>
<P>
   The task is made more difficult, speakers noted, by
globalization and technology that moves money from country to
country with the push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi said the tainted money included not only hundreds of
billions of dollars in drug proceeds but profits from trafficking
in migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This traffic has become so profitable that even drug
traffickers are beginning to switch,'' he said, noting an estimated
10 million people are smuggled illegally each year.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the Cayman Islands, a British Caribbean territory
of 40,000 that holds more than $500 billion in deposits from
foreign financial institutions, has tried to develop responses to
money laundering, but noted that some jurisdictions cannot afford
either the time or the resources.
</P>
<P>
   Countries at the conference included a string of Caribbean
islands, Panama, British territories in the Caribbean and several
Pacific island nations, including the island of Niue.

<HEADLINE> Capital Punishment Plan Praised  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Illinois Gov. George Ryan -- a death penalty
supporter who prompted a flurry of activity after suspending
executions in his state -- lent his backing Thursday to federal
legislation seeking stronger protections for capital defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know of anything that's really more important if we're
going to have an America with the kind of justice system that works
and works well,'' the Republican governor said at a Capitol Hill
news conference where a bipartisan group of House members
introduced the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see who could be against it, frankly,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Innocence Protection Act'' is sponsored by Democratic Rep.
William Delahunt, who was a prosecutor for 20 years and opposes the
death penalty, and Republican Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois, who
favors capital punishment. It mirrors a measure already introduced
in the Senate by Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks to ensure defendants in capital cases get adequate
legal assistance, including access to DNA testing that could prove
their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Federal defendants would be guaranteed access to DNA testing,
and states would not get DNA-related federal grants unless they
made the testing available to state inmates. One of the measure's
more controversial provisions would allow inmates to sue in federal
court if a request for DNA testing is denied.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters earlier
that he had not seen the bill but believes it contains
''common-sense protections'' that should be part of the criminal
justice process. He did not promise to advance the measure, though
he pledged to give the legislation a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly we don't want people on death row at risk of losing
their lives if they're innocent,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood said Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
promised hearings on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We absolutely have to be 100 percent sure when someone
receives the death penalty,'' LaHood said. ''I've tried, in my
limited time here, to work on a number of issues. This, to me, is
one of the really big ones that addresses a very serious problem in
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said his experience as a prosecutor outside Boston
taught him ''daily lessons in human fallibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The justice system is comprised of human beings and nothing we
can do can bring absolutely certainty to such a system,'' Delahunt
said. ''But we do have the tools to at least minimize the
possibility of error.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Ryan imposed a moratorium on executions in Illinois
until as task force could determine why more death sentences have
been overturned there than carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed states to reinstate
capital punishment, Illinois has executed 12 people. Since 1987,
the state has released 13 from death row after their convictions
were overturned, second only to Florida, which has exonerated 19
people.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 87 death row inmates have been freed since 1973,
according to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been a federal execution since 1963, but the
number of people put to death by the states is growing, including
26 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, nearly 3,600 people are on death row.

<HEADLINE> Health Industry Sues Tobacco Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Nearly 150 hospitals joined a health care
industry group in filing a $3.4 billion lawsuit Thursday that seeks
reimbursement for the cost of treating uninsured patients suffering
tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A number of tobacco companies expressed confidence that the
lawsuit would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the tobacco industry marketed and sold
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, despite knowing the
products are harmful, addictive, and lead to serious illness and
death. It was filed in state court by the hospitals and the
Healthcare Association of New York State, an industry group that
represents hospitals, health systems, nursing homes and other
health care agencies throughout New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to recover costs of care provided to the
uninsured, as well as Medicaid and Medicare patients whose publicly
financed plans did not fully cover the costs of their care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although it is part of the charitable mission of New York's
nonprofit hospitals to care for all who come to us, we should not
have to bear the burden of intentional fraud, deceit, and greed of
Big Tobacco,'' Healthcare Association President Daniel Sisto said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include: Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
Lorillard Tobacco Co. Inc., Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., the United States Tobacco Co., Council for Tobacco
Research U.S.A., Inc. and the Tobacco Institute, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said he couldn't
comment because he hadn't seen a copy of the suit, but noted
similar lawsuits filed around the country have been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds spokeswoman Carole Crosslin also declined to
comment about the specific case, but said, ''If this suit is like
the other suits that attempt to recover medical costs, we believe
that it will be dismissed, as all other similar suits have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The case filed Thursday is similar to a Justice Department suit,
which accuses cigarette makers of conspiring for 45 years to
mislead the public about the dangers of smoking and seeks to
recover billions of dollars spent by Medicare and other federal
health programs to treat smoking-induced illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Calls Clinton Judge Biased  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who ruled this week that President
Clinton committed a crime is being asked by Pentagon spokesman Ken
Bacon to remove himself from a lawsuit filed by Linda Tripp on the
grounds that the judge is biased.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, lawyers for Bacon said U.S. District Judge
Royce Lamberth prejudged one of the central issues of the Tripp
lawsuit, whether her privacy rights were violated when the Pentagon
released damaging information about her.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon and Pentagon employee Clifford Bernath, who joined Bacon's
motion for Lamberth to recuse himself, are being sued by Mrs. Tripp
for violating her privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judge Lamberth is prejudiced against'' Bacon ''in the purest
meaning of the word,'' his attorney William Murphy wrote in a
20-page motion joined by Bernath.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ''has prejudged one of the ultimate issues in this
case, without any valid basis for the prejudgment,'' Murphy added.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's lawyer cited federal law which states that ''any ...
judge ... shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his
impartiality might reasonably be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In a March 13 opinion, Lamberth stated in a footnote that ''the
Tripp release presents such a clear violation of the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is suing Bacon, Bernath, the Pentagon and the
Executive Office of the President over the Pentagon's release of
information to The New Yorker magazine about Mrs. Tripp. She stated
on a security clearance form she had never been arrested, when in
fact she had.
</P>
<P>
   She was arrested for grand larceny when she was a teen-ager,
pleaded innocent and a judge disposed of the case by reducing the
charge to loitering.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's lawyers filed their motion with the court before
Lamberth's ruling Wednesday in a separate lawsuit that Clinton
violated the Privacy Act by releasing letters from presidential
accuser Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mrs. Tripp's lawyers, David Colapinto, likened the
recusal motion to the unsuccessful effort of Watergate figures John
Mitchell and John Ehrlichman to have Judge John Sirica recuse
himself from their criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't work for Ehrlichman and Mitchell and it shouldn't
work for Bacon and Bernath,'' Colapinto said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Headlining Party's Dinner  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- George W. Bush, the likely Republican
presidential nominee, has agreed to speak at the New York
Conservative Party's annual dinner, its chairman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long also said the Texas governor's decision to speak at
the May 17 event in New York was ''a clear signal'' that his
campaign isn't writing off the heavily Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-to-3 margin, and some
political analysts have said they do not expect the GOP to contest
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to me the governor and his campaign have not made
up their minds to walk away from New York,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said they
have not yet accepted the invitation. ''It's something that's under
consideration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker also said Long was correct to assume that Bush was not
writing off the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Traditionally, Democrats do very well in New York, but at this
point we are not conceding any ground anywhere,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Long said his understanding was that there was a ''green light''
for Bush to attend.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican presidential candidate has carried New York state
since Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. Reagan courted New York's
Conservative Party early on, speaking at its annual dinner in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's possible to do it again,'' Long said Thursday.
''Our people aren't going to sit on their hands in this race. They
don't want (Democrat) Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has not been officially endorsed by the influential
third party, Long said he expected the Texas governor would easily
win the party's backing.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki, a Bush supporter, also is expected
to attend the $500-per-person dinner, as he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, third party support can be important in close races
because unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates
to add the votes from minor party ballot lines to their totals.
Pataki won the 1994 governor's race over Democratic incumbent Mario
Cuomo on the strength of the vote on the Conservative Party line.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive captured in turnpike shootout gets life term for bankrobbery  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A fugitive captured with his gang in a
shootout at a New Jersey Turnpike rest stop was sentenced Thursday
to life plus more than 39 years in prison for robbing two Camden
County banks and attempting to rob an armored car.
</P>
<P>
   Unless his appeals succeed, Charles ''Crazy Charlie'' Rodriguez,
33, will die in prison since federal prisoners are not eligible for
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear you are a miscreant and a threat to society. Your
life has been dedicated to antisocial behavior and evil,'' U.S.
District Judge Joseph A. Greenaway Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   He sentenced Rodriguez's brother, Joseph Rodriguez, 32, to life
plus more than 36 years in prison for the same offenses. A third
Camden man, Jose Soto, 28, got 37\ years in prison for the planned
heist and weapons offenses.
</P>
<P>
   All ''richly deserve'' the sentences, Greenaway said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three spoke during the all-day sentencing, but all
plan to appeal their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The three were arrested in September 1998 after being fired on
by some of the more than 90 officers awaiting them at the Walt
Whitman service plaza in Cherry Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Their stolen Buick was rammed by a tow truck driven by an FBI
agent. Three agents testified last year that Soto pointed an
assault rifle, prompting agents to open fire. The suspects did not
fire. All escaped serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Agents found the gang wearing bulletproof vests, automatic
weapons and hundreds of armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The trio had gone there to rob an armored car they believed
carried $1 million, not realizing their coconspirator, Rodriguez
cousin Fernando Flores, was an FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   Flores told them an armored car would be delivering cash to an
ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   Flores had been enlisted by the FBI to get the gang off the
streets. Flores, a Merchantville police officer for two years in
the mid-1990s, testified he got $14,500.
</P>
<P>
   After a seven-week trial, a jury in July rejected defense
assertions of entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway on Thursday rejected entrapment motions for a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were convicted on all nine counts they faced,
including armed bank robbery, attempted robbery, carjacking,
conspiracy and weapons offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Soto was convicted on four counts regarding weapons offenses and
the planned heist, but acquitted on the five charges regarding the
bank robberies, which included carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rodriguez still faces state charges, including attempted
murder, stemming from a February 1997 shooting in Camden that
wounded Camden County Park Police Officer Stephen Leoniy III. The
officer was approaching a suspected stolen car when gunfire
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   That made Rodriguez among the most wanted fugitives in southern
New Jersey. An $11,000 reward was offered for his capture and he
was twice featured on the television show ''America's Most
Wanted.'' He got his nickname from his violent criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway also ordered the Rodriguez brothers to repay $64,039
to the CoreStates Bank in Woodlynne for a robbery July 19, 1997;
and $15,373 to the Commerce Bank in Moorestown for a robbery May
28, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, their lawyers contended that bank surveillance
pictures offer no proof that the Rodriguez brothers and Soto were
behind the ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors countered that the masks and jackets in the pictures
are those that the Rodriguez brothers were wearing when captured.
</P>
<P>
   ''These robberies were well executed, and maybe but for the fact
that these people liked wearing the same clothes, we might not be
here today discussing bank robberies,'' Greenaway said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Asked To Help in Voting Case  </HEADLINE>
By CANDACE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia officials asked Attorney
General Janet Reno to bring some Justice Department support behind
an effort to win voting rights for the residents of the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Reno met with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., Mayor Anthony
A. Williams, Council Chairwoman Linda W. Cropp and other officials
behind closed doors Thursday on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said she asked the Justice Department to write a brief in
the voting rights case that would express empathy for the fact that
district residents cannot choose a voting member in Congress as
residents of the other 50 states do.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Tuesday sent Norton a letter stating his
support for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   On March 21, a three-judge federal court ruled 2 to 1 that
district residents do not have a legal right to vote in Congress.
The justices ruled on two lawsuits filed by different sets of D.C.
activists. The district government joined one of the suits.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department argued that the Constitution states that
only people in states can elect representatives and that the
district is not a state and therefore does not have a
constitutional right to elect voting members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in both suits plan to appeal the cases to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said Reno seemed sympathetic to the district's argument.
</P>
<P>
   Reno would only give a ''yes'' answer when asked by reporters if
she supported statehood for the district.

<HEADLINE> INS: Elian To Dad, If He Comes  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service
said Thursday that it would be ''hard pressed'' not to grant
temporary custody of Elian Gonzalez to his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, if the elder Gonzalez comes to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The INS spelled out its position in response to a proposal by
Cuban President Fidel Castro that the father come to Washington to
be reunited with his son. But Gonzalez's lawyer, Gregory Craig,
said the plan could be scuttled if the administration cannot
provide assurances that temporary custody is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrations officials have demanded that Elian's Miami
relatives promise in writing to turn over the boy if they lose
their custody fight in federal court. The INS has also said that it
will remove Elian from the custody of his great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, unless the relatives sign such an agreement by 9 a.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official, requesting anonymity, said the
agreement under discussion also would allow the INS to end his
great-uncle's temporary custody in the event of a material change
in circumstances, ''including his father's coming to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are questions about whether the State Department will
give the green light to another Cuban proposal -- that Elian's
classmates and some doctors be allowed to form part of the
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Craig attempted to apply for visas Thursday for family members
and a senior Cuban official but a State Department official
informed him that the applications must be filed at the U.S.
diplomatic mission in Havana. Efforts to reach Craig after his
State Department visit were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rare coincidence of views between the U.S. and Cuban
governments over the issue of a visit by the father. Both agree
that the father should be reunited with his son here at least until
the legal process is completed. Elian has been staying with his
great-uncle, who is fighting to keep the 6-year-old boy in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do believe that when the time comes to transfer Elian, the
smoothest and least traumatic transition would be if he were to go
from Lazaro Gonzalez's house to his father's side,'' INS
spokeswoman Maria Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   Said State Department spokesman James Foley: ''We believe his
presence in the U.S. can be helpful to a successful resolution of
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   And both Washington and Havana have strongly opposed the efforts
of many in the Cuban exile community in Miami to prevent the return
of Elian to Cuba because of the communist system on the island. The
case has produced the first deep rupture between the exile
community and the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican members of House leadership accused the
administration on Wednesday of heavy-handed tactics by demanding
that Elian's Miami relatives agree to surrender the boy if they
lose their court fight to keep him. If the relatives rule out such
a promise, the administration has warned that Elian could face
imminent deportation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton, the four said the Justice
Department was threatening ''removal action'' against Elian while
his case is pending before an appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   ''This practice must end,'' the letter said. It was signed by
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and three other members of
the House GOP leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian case has exhausted the staff at the small Cuban
diplomatic mission here. Fernando Remirez, who heads the mission,
was up most of the night on Wednesday mapping strategy with
officials in Havana, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   He was at the State Department early Thursday morning,
delivering a copy of Castro's Wednesday night speech on his
proposal for a U.S. visit of Elian's father. If Gonzalez comes
here, he would stay at Remirez's home.	   The big question was whether Elian's
Miami relatives would be
willing to surrender the boy to his father. If the relatives
refuse, Craig said Juan Gonzalez won't make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez wants to come here accompanied by his wife, 6-month old
son and National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, a specialist
on U.S. issues. At some point, they would be joined by almost 30
others, including Elian's classmates and several doctors.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, administration officials were examining visa
regulations to determine how many of the would-be companions would
be eligible to join the elder Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   There are strict eligibility limits for Cuban visas. Athletes,
artists, clerics and others with a professional interest in
visiting the United States are eligible, as are visits of a
humanitarian nature.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to speculate on whether the entourage being
proposed by Castro would be granted visas. They were mystified as
to why Castro would propose that so many classmates of Elian be
taken out of school to come to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Modified Food Vote in Mexican Senate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Senate voted unanimously Thursday to
require the labeling of foods that contain genetically modified
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The measure appears to generally agree with the U.N. biosafety
protocol adopted at a meeting of 140 national representatives in
Montreal, Canada, though that applies only to imported foods.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries, notably in Europe, already require such
labels, though they are not required in the United States. Food
industry representatives have argued they would create unwarranted
concern among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Mexican measure, genetically modified foods would have
to bear a label reading ''transgenic food.'' Those containing some
genetically modified ingredients would need a label reading: ''Food
made with transgenic products.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure approved by the Senate now must be approved by the
lower house of congress, the Chamber of Deputies, before going to
the president for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Major agricultural companies, many of them in the United States,
have argued that there is no scientific basis for concern about
genetically modified crops, which are often designed to be more
productive, durable or disease resistant.
</P>
<P>
   However, many environmentalists argue that a lack of experience
with such foods means it is too early to rule them safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican branch of the environmentalist group Greenpeace
issued a news release late Thursday welcoming the decision, saying
it ''recognizes the concerns expressed by diverse social sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also urged Mexico to halt the import of genetically
modified corn, which it said could endanger traditional Mexican
corn varieties.

<HEADLINE> McCain Giving Some Delegates to Bush  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- John McCain is giving former GOP
presidential primary rival George W. Bush six of the Michigan
delegates he won and has similar deals or is close to agreement in
several New England states the Arizona senator won before
suspending his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached Thursday in Michigan allows Gov. John Engler to
attend the National Republican Convention as a Bush delegate and is
the latest move toward GOP reconciliation after the divisive
primary contest. At one point, McCain and Engler talked by phone, a
McCain aide said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain agreed to give Bush six delegates to add to the six the
Texas governor won in the Feb. 22 Michigan primary, leaving the
Arizona senator with 46 of the state's 58. McCain has suspended his
campaign, and Bush has won enough delegates to clinch the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp said delegate agreements also had been reached
or were close in New England states where the senator won
primaries, including Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and
Massachusetts. A McCain aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
had no details.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain aide said that the senator, in his first campaign
swing next week on behalf of Republicans, will campaign for Sen.
Lincoln Chafee, who's vying to maintain the seat once held by his
late father, John. Rep. Robert Weygand, D-R.I., is running for the
seat.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also will hold a town hall meeting at Columbia University
in New York on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain won 51 percent of the vote to 43 for Bush,
largely on the strength of independent and Democratic voters who
supported him in the open primary. But he couldn't sustain his
momentum two weeks later in the March 7 Super Tuesday primaries and
suspended his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal also names state Sen. John Schwarz co-chairman
of Michigan's national convention delegation. Schwarz headed up
McCain's Michigan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement followed two meetings and numerous telephone
conversations between Schwarz and Engler. It ''recognizes that
McCain won Michigan,'' said Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a commonsense solution,'' said Engler. ''It puts
Governor Bush back on track to win Michigan in November, and that's
the bottom line.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. charges eight online pharmacies violate consumer protectionlaws  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey announced Thursday it has sued
eight online pharmacies, most of which specialize in selling
Viagra, charging that the operators failed to tell consumers that
they are not licensed to practice in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative lawsuits also charged that the drug sales
were done by ''virtual'' doctor visits via the pharmacies' Web
sites that fall short of New Jersey standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pharmacies and pharmacists must follow state laws whether they
do business in New Jersey neighborhoods or on the Internet,'' state
Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Viagra, an anti-impotence drug that one of the
Web sites described as ''one of the defining drugs of the '90s,''
many of the eight pharmacies promoted the hair growth drug Propecia
and the weight-loss drug Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover investigators from the state Division of Consumer
Affairs made a total of about a dozen purchases, ranging from $100
to $300, from the pharmacies, agency spokeswoman Jennifer Salvato
said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, investigators ordering Viagra mentioned that they
were taking other medications indicating a heart condition, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart patients who take nitroglycerin for chest pain are warned
not to use Viagra, since the combination can trigger a dangerous
drop in blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't even come back with questions for the person. The
prescription was just filled,'' Salvato said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency chose not to charge the pharmacies for lacking New
Jersey licenses, only with failing to tell that to consumers. Asked
why, Salvato said officials cited ''prosecutorial discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Affairs Director Mark S. Herr will hear the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach operators of the cyber drugstores on Thursday
were unsuccessful:
</P>
<P>
   --AmericanMedicine.com Inc., of Pittsburgh, posted a notice on
its Web site that it was being renovated and not currently
operating. No phone listing could be found.
</P>
<P>
   --Sites operated by ClickThruPharmacy.com Inc., of Miami, could
not be accessed and no phone listing could be found.
</P>
<P>
   --A phone listing for Confimed.com LLC of Seattle rang unanswered
and its Web site said: ''At the present time, we cannot fill orders
for patients. We will notify you when we can ship orders. We are
making changes to the web site to better protect your health and to
comply with Federal &AMP; State Regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   --An e-mail sent to Kwikmed Inc., of Phoenix, through its Web
site was not returned and no phone listing could be found.
</P>
<P>
   --A phone message at The Pill Box Inc. of San Antonio was not
immediately returned.

</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Pharmacy can be called at 1-800-242-5846 to
determine if a person is a licensed pharmacist.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cowboys Star Claims Lottery Prize  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Thomas
''Hollywood'' Henderson surprised lottery officials when he showed
up at their headquarters Thursday to claim his $10.43 million
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who relished the spotlight when he played in the NFL,
told lottery officials he wants minimal press coverage, said
Kristina Childress, a lottery spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, accompanied by his lawyer, entered the offices
through a secret passageway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a total surprise. We didn't even know he was coming in
today,'' Childress said.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who also played for the Houston Oilers in a career
plagued by drug use, purchased the winning Lotto Texas ticket
drawing last week at an Austin pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket with the Nos. 5, 8, 17, 35, 38 and 41 passed a
preliminary validation by the lottery, and was declared official
Thursday when Henderson brought it into the Austin headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, 47, hit the March 22 drawing that had a $28 million
jackpot. Because he chose a lump sum, he'll receive $10,433,690
after taxes. The funds will be transferred electronically within
the week, Childress said.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was awarded to HHH Fifty-Six Investments Ltd. of
Austin, a partnership of HHH Fifty-Six Management Inc., of which
Henderson is president.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who served 28 months in prison in California after a
1983 drug arrest, said Friday that he wanted to use a portion of
the money to continue supporting his charities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am just going to continue to do the charities that I do,
take care of my children and buy my momma a Town Car,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Threat Suspect Denied Bail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A judge denied bail Thursday for a Canadian man
of Egyptian origin who police suspect made a threatening phone call
to the Israeli consulate and who has been linked to a cache of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Ayman Bondok, 23, was charged with extortion and possessing
explosives when arrested March 9 with Kim St. Louis, 31, who also
was charged with possessing explosives. She has been released on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   After the Israeli consulate received the threatening phone call
in early March, police received a tip about explosives in a
Montreal apartment. Police found the explosives and counterfeit
money in a March 4 search of the apartment and arrested the
occupant, Tarek Adealy Khafagy, an Egyptian refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy denied any knowledge of the explosives and counterfeit
money or the threatening phone call. Police investigators later
said they believed Bondok made the call and also provided the tip
about the explosives in Khafagy's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after her arrest, St. Louis said Bondok may have
been trying to frame Khafagy due to a family feud back in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy was granted bail last week and faces a preliminary
hearing in his case on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Bondok's attorney, the judge imposed a
publication ban on Thursday's bail hearing that prohibited details
of the evidence from being reported.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Tries To Spoil UConn  </HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Andrea Garner had the whole gang over to her
house for a Final Four party, and Penn State coach Rene Portland
didn't mind one bit. In fact, she sounded like quite the party
animal.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this is Penn State's first trip to the Final Four,
Portland sees no reason to feel like the oddball. She refuses to
let her players fear top-ranked and heavily favored Connecticut in
their semifinal matchup Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Those who like the stars to remain exactly in alignment might be
rooting for a UConn-Tennessee matchup for the national
championship. Portland knows there are two games to be played
before that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went to Andrea's house last night. We could have said we
were tired and we want to go home, but I want them to be excited
and I want to point things out to them,'' Portland said Thursday as
the Lady Lions (30-4) prepared to take on UConn (34-1). ''It's
almost like your wedding day. It's such a big day, and sometimes
the bride doesn't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are the brides right now. Remember everything that's
happening, keep a smile on your face, take great pictures and when
it's time to say, 'I do,' get to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beating UConn is quite a task, but Portland and Penn State are
not new to upsets. The Lady Lions have knocked off third-seeded
Iowa State and top-seeded Louisiana Tech on their way to
Philadelphia. Before this year, they'd upset 17 opponents ranked
ahead of them in Portland's 19 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't read too much about the matchups as far as UConn and
Tennessee goes,'' Garner said. ''I know we're not going to let them
get there easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland, who coached St. Joseph's in the 1970s, brought her
team to the old Fieldhouse on 54th and City Line for practice
Wednesday. Afterward, the Lady Lions convened at Garner's house.
The center, who was born in Philly, is a cousin of former
Philadelphia Eagles running back Charlie Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Though Portland has the relaxed demeanor of a winner -- she won
three straight national titles playing for Cathy Rush at Immaculata
-- her players could be showing some of the classic signs of ''First
Timers Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm still in shock a little bit,'' said guard Helen
Darling, whose matchup against Sue Bird could be a key to the
outcome. ''We came in and there were a lot of people outside
waiting for us and cheering for us. I'm really happy and excited
that we were able top make it here, and I'm just looking forward to
what else the Final Four brings.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Lady Lions are still in shock at 9:30 p.m. EST Friday
night, they'll be in big trouble. The Huskies, playing in their
fourth Final Four, are not easily intimidated -- and they can sense
if an opponent is ''just happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn holds another advantage, having beaten Penn State 87-74 in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is March, and it is different,'' said Shea Ralph, the
Huskies' vocal leader. ''They have been practicing and getting
better, and so have we.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams held open practice for fans and the media Thursday,
but that isn't real practice. They work out on their own at
selected sites away from the circus-like atmosphere of the host
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ralph was shouting encouragement to teammates, slapping
five with a vengeance and taking her head fakes very seriously. It
was an interesting snapshot of how determined the Huskies are to
add a national championship trophy to the one they captured in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   UConn beat Tennessee for the championship in '95, but lost to
the Lady Vols in the national semifinals in '96 and the regional
championship in '97.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not looking to that Tennessee matchup yet,'' Ralph
said. ''I know I've heard a lot about it and there's been a lot
written about it. For so many years now it's been a tradition,
UConn and Tennessee. I've heard that it's been voted the
second-biggest rivalry or something on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not everything on the Internet is true, it is safe to say
that UConn is used to this kind of attention. They get it every
time the ball goes up in the air at their raucous arena in
hoops-crazy Storrs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very comfortable in this position,'' Ralph said. ''A
lot of us have been in this position most of our lives. ... Going
into this tournament, I think I'd rather be sitting in our locker
room than any other.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Gain in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo's main share index gained slightly early
Friday after an overnight decline on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar
was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 9.53 points,
or 0.05 percent, to 20,451.03 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Thursday, the average closed down 265.15 points, or 1.28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.84 yen, up 0.30 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 105.46 yen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei started lower after overnight
falls in U.S. high technology issues, but managed to move into
positive territory on buying of domestic demand-related shares.
</P>
<P>
   But traders said the Tokyo market remained weak overall on
profit-taking by corporate investors at the fiscal year-end and
drops on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.47 to
10,916.25 at Thursday's finish. The Nasdaq composite index closed
at 4,457.89, down 186.78, or 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 8.40 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,704.05.
The TOPIX finished down 20.39 points, or 1.18 percent, the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar followed through on its
overnight strength in New York and was also boosted on a Japanese
government report showing continued weakness in Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that the Tokyo-area consumer price index
fell 0.7 percent in March from a year earlier for the eighth
monthly year-on-year decline.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is struggling to bail out of its worst economic downturn
in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 101.75 yen, up from
100.47 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8000 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7900 percent. Its
price fell 0.09 point to 100.85.

<HEADLINE> Corzine apologizes for remarks about Italian-Americans  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Jon S. Corzine's U.S. Senate campaign
stumbled Thursday as he apologized for offending Italian-Americans
who said he made remarks that perpetuate the stereotype that they
are involved with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting he made the remarks, the former Wall Street
executive apologized for offending anyone and said he wouldn't do
it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never intended to cause embarrassment. I never intended to
offend,'' Corzine said Thursday at a news conference where he
accepted the endorsement of the Unite garment workers' union. ''I
shouldn't have said what I am reported to have said, and if I did,
I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who said he is of Italian descent, was backed Thursday
by Italian-American politicians who said the remarks were not
intentional slurs, but was denounced by civil rights groups and
other Italian-Americans, including his primary opponent, former
Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud of my background,'' said Florio, who is facing
Corzine in the Democratic Senate primary on June 6 in a state where
one out of four Democrats is Italian-American.
</P>
<P>
   To make ''derogatory stereotypes of whole classifications of
people is at a minimum insensitive and at a maximum is callously
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice
Committee, demanded an apology from Corzine for ''ethnic slurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfano said Corzine made the first offensive remark several
months ago at a Newark restaurant, where Corzine was seeking the
support of six prominent Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano, who was not at the meeting, said that upon being
introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine remarked, ''Who
is Dave Stein? He's not Italian, is he? Oh, I guess he's your
Jewish lawyer who is here to get the rest of you out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfano said the second remark occurred two weeks ago when
Corzine met an Italian-American contractor and quipped, ''Oh, you
make cement shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine campaign manager Steven Goldstein said the candidate
''never, ever'' uttered the alleged reference to the ''Jewish
lawyer.'' Stein, the lawyer, said Thursday he did meet with Corzine
four to six months ago but does not recall the comment.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine didn't dispute the remarks about Italian-Americans,
although he said he doesn't remember the exact wording. He did not
say in what context he meant the remarks, and Goldstein did not
return telephone calls to elaborate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, is locked in a
hard-hitting battle with Florio for the Democratic nomination to
succeed retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. A Quinnipiac College
poll released on Wednesday found him trailing Florio 2-to-1,
despite the $4 million he has already spent to get his name known
in a state where Florio, the former governor, enjoys widespread
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano said Thursday that he has not yet decided who to support
in the campaign, but said the Italian-American stereotypes had to
end.
</P>
<P>
   ''This constant barrage of mob movies ... people think they can
say anything to Italians and we're not going to be offended,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of four national Italian-American groups said
Corzine's comments showed ''both insensitivity and arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Corzine has shown his obvious and incredible disrespect to
Italian-Americans in New Jersey, the home of Ellis Island where
millions of Italian immigrants arrived and later settled,'' said a
statement by groups that included the Italian American Democratic
Leadership Council and the Order Sons of Italy in America.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine found support Thursday from Italian-American politicians
like U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli and Assembly Minority Leader
Joseph Doria, who accused the Florio campaign of trying to distract
the press from the issues. The New York Times first printed the
remarks in Thursday editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're trying to make an issue of a slur, a political issue
and that's not right,'' said Doria. ''In the end, it is not an
issue that should be the central issue of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't control what Mr. Corzine says,'' said Florio
spokesman Walter Fields, who added that the campaign first learned
of the remarks from the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Doria and more than 20 other Italian-American politicians later
signed a statement of support for Corzine, saying they accepted his
apology as ''sincere and heartfelt.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: Hip Fractures Are Increasing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hip fractures among women 65 and older have
climbed 40 percent between 1988 and 1996, with about a third of
older Americans suffering serious falls each year, the government
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the
increase in part to a growing number of people 85 and older.
</P>
<P>
   People are living longer because of advances against such
killers as heart disease, stroke and cancer. But older people run a
higher risk of falls because they are generally more sedentary,
have weaker muscles and poorer balance, and take more medication
that can make them dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 340,000 people 65 or older were hospitalized with a
broken hip. Of those, 80 percent were women. In 1988, the rate of
hospitalization among women 65 and older was 972 per 100,000. By
1996 it had climbed to 1,356 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   More adults 65 and older die from fall-related injuries each
year than from any other kind of injury. The CDC said 9,000 such
deaths occurred in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that one in three older adults requires
hospitalization for a fall each year, with a broken hip the most
common and serious injury. Half of those who break a hip do not
regain their former level of mobility or independence, ending up in
a nursing home or moving in with relatives, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hip fractures can really mark the beginning of the end for
seniors,'' said Judy Stevens, a CDC epidemiologist. ''It can lead
quickly to decline and death.''
</P>
<P>
   America had 31 million people 65 and older in 1990. That number
is expected to more than double by 2040.
</P>
<P>
   Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuries five
times more often than for other injuries, and women are nearly
three times more likely than men to be hospitalized for falls, the
CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC suggests older people remove clutter and throw rugs from
their homes, and exercise to increase muscle strength and balance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on congressional GOP: 'No shame'  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republican
congressional leaders on Thursday of sabotaging his hopes of
securing a nuclear weapons pact with India and Pakistan. ''They
have no guilt and no shame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to South Asia last week, Clinton failed to make
any arms control deals. India and Pakistan both refused to reverse
their nuclear weapons programs, and Pakistan's military leaders
refused even to promise a quick return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the nuclear rivalry between India and
Pakistan, Clinton has called that region among the world's most
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told a Democratic audience in Manhattan that upon his
return last week he was angered by Republican criticism that he did
not ''get anything'' for his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism ignores a critical fact, he said: ''I lost all
leverage I had when the Republican Senate defeated the ratification
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is real gall, man,'' Clinton said to applause. ''That
requires a lot of moxie, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Clinton continued: ''One of their great strengths, by
the way, is they have no guilt and no shame. I mean, they'll say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, has
called Clinton's trip ''a bust.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay has also said Clinton has little
to show for his week of diplomacy in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said Thursday that GOP criticism of Clinton's trip was
''pretty muted'' and consisted of ''disappointment that he wouldn't
use the authority he had.'' He said he had worked hard the last two
years to give Clinton waiver authority to lift economic sanctions
on India and ''the president goes to India and hardly lifts any
sanctions at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a relationship that is ripe for growth and instead we
got a trip that was mostly symbolic,'' Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., questioned the importance of the test ban treaty
rejected by the Senate last year compared with an arms control pact
with India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''These countries have already signed and broken a nuclear
non-proliferation treaty,'' Czwartacki said. ''It's hard to believe
that more paper is the answer. I think this president needs more of
an emphasis on diplomacy and less emphasis on photo-op foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear testing in 1998 -- first by India and then by Pakistan --
shook the Indian subcontinent and the world. Since then, both
countries have tested both medium range and short range missiles,
Pakistan as recently as last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton lost a bitter, 51-48 vote for ratification of
the test ban treaty. Only four Senate Republicans voted for the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The United States thus became the first nuclear power to
specifically reject the 154-nation agreement on ending nuclear
weapons testing, and Clinton called the vote ''reckless
partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   The president had campaigned hard for the treaty, saying it was
a vital gesture to countries with nuclear aspirations. The United
States has voluntarily stopped the kind of testing covered by the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in New York for a full day of fund raising and to
campaign for his plan to extend and reform the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Republican leaders in Congress don't care
about shoring up the Medicare and Social Security systems, because
they want those federal programs to go private. He attacked
Republican tax cut proposals as shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wont have any money to help Social Security and Medicare
when the Baby Boomers retire, but that's OK with them because they
want to privatize them,'' Clinton said. ''And I think it's a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Revamping Medicare, the federal health care program for the
elderly, is a major element of the president's domestic legislative
agenda for his final year in office. He wants to add coverage for
prescription drugs that would be available to all; Republicans want
to target that coverage to the neediest elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also worked in plugs for the New York Senate candidacy
of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the presidential bid of
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want Al Gore to be president because he's been the best vice
president in history and I love him,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> DiFrancesco proposes 'smart gun' law, eventual ban on sale of oldhandguns  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- With a coalition of antigun and school
groups and Democrats behind him, Republican Senate President Donald
DiFrancesco has decided it is time to give gun control another shot
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco on Thursday unveiled legislation to mandate the sale
of so-called ''smart guns'' equipped with sensor technology that
disables the gun unless the owner is holding it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill leaves open when the mandate would take effect. Rather
than pick a date, the bill specifies that a three-year clock would
be started once the state attorney general certifies that handguns
with sensor technology are commercially available.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mandate does take effect, only such guns could be sold
in New Jersey. Gun dealers would be prohibited from selling any
conventional handguns, new or used. The bill would not interfere
with private transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a similar bill from DiFrancesco last year, but
it was opposed by Democrats and scuttled by the state Assembly.
DiFrancesco this time has a coalition that includes the state PTA,
child-advocacy groups and Ceasefire New Jersey, the leading
gun-control lobby.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said he had not yet consulted Assembly Speaker Jack
Collins on the proposal, and Collins promptly issued a news
statement denouncing the measure as ''political opportunism.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican legislative leaders have said they intend to run
for governor in 2001, and Collins' sharp statement Thursday broke
the polite distance they have been keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Collins last year shepherded an alternate bill through the
Assembly mandating trigger locks on new guns and funding a state
study of smart guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The text of this latest smart gun proposal may have been
altered to appease certain individuals, but the basic fact that
smart gun technology still does not exist remains unchanged,''
Collins said. He said the technology was ''promising'' and that he
would lead efforts to mandate such guns once they were available.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Miller, head of Ceasefire New Jersey, praised DiFrancesco
for his ''courage and commitment.'' He said his organization
decided to ally with DiFrancesco on this measure because it
provides a clearer point at which to start the three-year clock to
institute the mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ross of the Association of New Jersey Rifle &AMP; Pistol Clubs
denounced DiFrancesco's bill as a political maneuver that could
endanger lives. ''(The bill) would put untested firearms on the
market that could actually be hurtful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said smart guns should be a choice, not a mandate. ''It is
like someone is being told the only car they can buy would be a
BMW, and they can't buy any other car in the state,'' she said.
''It is actually going to end up to be a ban because there will be
no other firearms available in this state once these firearms
(rules) go into effect.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco's bill would require the bullet-mark
''fingerprinting'' of every firearm sold in New Jersey so police
would have records enabling them to trace handguns used in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco's bill would also prohibit anyone from getting a gun
permit until they are 21. Current law permits gun permits at age
18.
</P>
<P>
   Collins agreed with the age change but added a political dig,
noting in his news statement that this change was approved by the
Assembly in a previous session and scuttled by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Helms, U.N. Security Council Spar  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, playing host to the U.N.
Security Council, appealed to delegates Thursday to ''disagree
agreeably and proceed in friendship.'' Council members matched the
conservative Foreign Relations Committee chairman in civility, but
still bristled at U.S. terms for a U.N. overhaul and reduced
American payments.
</P>
<P>
   All 15 members of the Security Council --five permanent and 10
rotating members -- showed up for the unprecedented daylong
gathering, arranged by Helms, R-N.C., after he became the first
American lawmaker to address the Security Council at U.N.
headquarters in New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon session billed as a ''roundtable discussion,''
delegate after delegate said they supported some form of U.N.
overhaul to make the organization more effective. But U.S. mandated
terms, tying future U.S. payments to some of the changes, drew
criticism -- the strongest from top U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   They all spoke in English. At the United Nations, they usually
speak in their native language.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't like it -- withholding money that is due,'' said Peter
Van Walsum, the Netherlands representative. He said that while most
of the 188 countries in the United Nations wanted improvements in
the system, ''we do not like to do so under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   British delegate Jeremy Greenstock said that the United States
must understand that it should view its contribution as an
investment and, ''like any good investment, it is going to take
some risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fowler, Canada's delegate, said, ''Not only is the United
Nations not perfect. It will never be perfect. It is not
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations puts back U.S. dues at $1.7 billion but the
United States calculates it at closer to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year voted to pay $926 million of the arrears over
three years, with a $100 million first installment. But to get the
balance, the United Nations must meet about a dozen conditions
drafted by Helms and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the panel's
senior Democrat. Those terms generally have not been well received
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They include a reduction the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget from the current 31 percent to 25 percent and of the regular
budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, one of the fiercest of congressional critics of the
United Nations, played the part of cordial host as he showed the
delegates around the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the delegates in the ornate but relatively small Old
Senate Chamber -- used from 1810 to 1859 -- with a pointed civics
lesson on the active role of the Senate in foreign policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it has been suggested to you that the president alone
speaks for the United States in foreign affairs. And in most of the
nations of the world -- even the great democracies -- that is indeed
the case,'' Helms said. ''Not so the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms cited the Senate's power to ratify treaties, confirm
ambassadors and provide funds for foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the delegates joined senators for lunch in the richly
finished room that was the setting for the Senate Army-McCarthy
hearings in the 1950s and the Senate Watergate hearings in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In a toast, Biden said he hoped the visit in addition to
promoting better understanding would show Security Council members
''how disorganized we are -- and how many different voices we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Security Council president, Bangladesh Ambassador
Anwarul Chowdhury, toasted the Senate in exchange, saying both
organizations ''seek the understanding and realization that the
United Nations is the most-needed organization in today's world.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the State Department, the delegates stood before the
flags of their countries and were greeted by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At the afternoon session, a long square table covered with green
cloth allowed Security Council members and senators to sit
together. ''I hope that we can agree to disagree agreeably, and
proceed in friendship in a search for common ground,'' said Helms.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yingfan, the Chinese delegate, said China supports U.N.
overhauls as does the United States. But, noting the enormous
influence of the United States, he said that, ''We must make it
more effective not just for the few but for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to peackeeeping, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, told delegates: ''Don't take
on more than you can do.'' He cited being ''heavily involved in
Bosnia and in Kosovo'' while eyeing other engagements.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were designated as unofficial -- and delegates were
invited individually and made their own way here.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, President Clinton, who was in New York, called
U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke during the middle of a meeting to
ask him how it was going. Clinton ''wanted to say how pleased he
was by the fact that they were here,'' said Holbrooke.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks S.F. Chronicle Sale  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday temporarily
blocked the Hearst Corp.'s $660 million purchase of the San
Francisco Chronicle and said he was concerned that San Francisco
may become a one-newspaper city.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the U.S. Justice Department approved the sale, U.S.
District Judge Vaughn Walker issued a temporary restraining order
against it. He said a private antitrust suit had raised doubts
about the survival of Hearst's 120-year-old San Francisco Examiner
after the Chronicle changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst announced March 17 that it was transferring ownership of
the Examiner, the Chronicle's longtime rival, to owners of the
Independent, a local free-distribution paper. Hearst said it agreed
to subsidize the owners with $66 million over three years after
fruitless contacts with 80 potential buyers, including the nation's
major newspaper publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But political consultant Clint Reilly, who sued to stop Hearst
from buying the Chronicle, argued that the subsidy was far too
small to keep the Examiner alive and would leave Hearst with a
local newspaper monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle is the largest newspaper in Northern California
and the 13th-largest in the nation, with circulation of 456,000
compared to the Examiner's 107,000.
</P>
<P>
   After a 40-minute hearing, Walker said Reilly had raised a
significant enough issue to delay the purchase until April 13, when
a hearing is scheduled on a preliminary injunction that would stay
in effect until the suit went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Serious questions have been raised about ''the continuing
viability of the Examiner as an independent newspaper'' under new
ownership, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The two newspaper deals had been scheduled to close Friday, but
Walker said the Chronicle and Examiner have been publishing under a
joint operating agreement since 1965 and would suffer little
hardship by waiting another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosch, lawyer for the Chronicle Publishing Co., argued that
the antitrust laws didn't require Hearst to provide any subsidy or
any guarantee that the Examiner would survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this enterprise cannot support itself, your honor, then it
ought to go under,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst lawyer Gary Halling told Walker that Hearst agreed to the
''absurd'' idea of a subsidy in order to keep in the good graces of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has come forward willing to take the Examiner even if
we gave it to them,'' Halling said.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent's publisher, Ted Fang, has announced plans to
switch the Examiner from afternoon to morning publication in August
and compete with the Hearst-owned Chronicle, which has offered jobs
to the Examiner's current staff.
</P>
<P>
   Under a joint operating agreement, which was scheduled to run
through 2005, the Examiner and Chronicle have combined their
business operations and split profits 50-50 while maintaining
separate editorial staffs. The sale would terminate the JOA.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco remains one of 47 cities in the nation with two or
more dailies.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said Thursday that its concerns about
competition were satisfied by Hearst's agreement to transfer the
Examiner to owners who would continue daily publication.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in 35 years, San Francisco will have two
independent daily newspapers,'' said Antitrust Division head Joel
Klein. ''Consumers, such as advertisers and readers, will obtain
the benefits of full competition between two daily morning
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reilly, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor last fall and also
bid unsuccessfully for the Examiner, contended the terms of the
deal guaranteed failure for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said experts in newspaper operations and finance have
advised him that a subsidy of at least $250 million was needed to
make the Examiner a viable competitor. He accused Hearst of using
the joint operating agreement to fend off other bidders for the
Chronicle, who offered far less than $660 million because they
would have had to assume the Chronicle's obligations under the JOA.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Executive Editor Matthew Wilson said the delay has
stirred anxiety in his newsroom. ''I think all of us here at the
paper wish that this would speed up and move on,'' he said. ''It's
been a long number of months for us, waiting for the paper to
sell.''

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Co. Settles Racial Charge  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New York mortgage company settled federal
charges Thursday that it singled out black women for higher loan
prices and approved loans for low-income homeowners who would have
difficulty repaying.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Funding Corporation of Woodbury made a quarter of its
annual loans in minority neighborhoods in New York City, where
between 1996 and 1999 it violated housing laws by charging black
women higher broker fees than white men who had similar financial
circumstances, the Federal Trade Commission and the Housing and
Justice departments charged.
</P>
<P>
   The company also approved loans without regard to borrowers'
ability to repay, burdening homeowners with debt and exposing them
to an increased risk of defaulting on their loans, said Jodie
Bernstein, director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delta targeted these low-income homeowners for high monthly
payments, turning the American dream of home ownership into a
nightmare,'' Bernstein said in a statement. ''That's a dangerous
policy for borrowers because it could lead to the loss of thousands
of dollars and even their home.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was also charged with paying kickbacks and unearned
fees to brokers to induce them to refer loan applicants to Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the company must revise its lending
practices and is banned from any discriminatory actions. Consumers
harmed by the company's violations may be compensated by two funds
totaling more than $12 million that were created in a separate
settlement with the New York State Banking Department in September.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by Delta, the company said that it has not
violated any law. President and CEO Hugh Miller said the company
was ''pleased to have resolved all outstanding issues'' with the
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who earlier in the day told a
Senate panel that his agency will propose new laws to fight home
lending abuses, said homeowners should not be burdened with unfair
mortgage costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lenders and mortgage brokers are put on notice by this
settlement agreement that HUD and the federal government are
prepared to fight for borrowers who are being victimized by
predatory mortgage lending practices,'' Cuomo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court.

   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Admitting that he was torn in both
directions, Arizona's 7-foot-1 center Loren Woods announced
Thursday that he would not leave school for the NBA and would
return for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ''By me coming back, I'll definitely be a better player,'' Woods
said, ''but I think I'll also be a better person. By me growing up
and maturing in a year, it will be a huge difference than if I
would have gone to that level this year -- emotionally, handling
things on and off the court. I'll definitely be more mature after
another year.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' decision means that all seven players who played
regularly for the Wildcats will return from a team that shared the
Pac-10 championship and was the No. 1 seed in the West in the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're not preseason No. 1, then there's something wrong
with the polls,'' said Woods' teammate, Richard Jefferson, who
briefly toyed with the idea of turning pro but decided to return
next season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the returning players from this season, Arizona
will have the services of tough power forward Eugene Edgerson, who
sat out a year to get his teaching degree, as well as whatever
freshmen recruits coach Lute Olson can get.
</P>
<P>
   Woods led the Wildcats in scoring at 15.6 points per game, and
was one of the most prolific shot blockers in the country. He tied
an NCAA record with 14 blocks against Oregon. But he missed the
final seven games because of a compressed disc in his lower back.
The injury would have prevented him from participating in any
full-scale tryouts for NBA teams.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects a complete recovery by next season.
</P>
<P>
   Woods kept his decision a mystery throughout his long statement
during a news conference at McKale Center, until the very end. When
he announced it, several teammates and friends cheered and
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Woods insisted he didn't make up his mind until about 40 minutes
before the news conference, even though Olson said earlier this
week that he thought the big center would be coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said people close to the Arizona program urged him to
return because the team could have a shot at the NCAA championship,
while others not close to the program said he should leave and go
for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the people who know me personally have been saying just to
follow what you feel in your heart,'' Woods said. ''Sometimes I
feel like I should stay, sometimes I feel like I should go. So I
don't know about taking that advice, because my heart has been torn
in two different places -- the love for the game playing against the
best competiton by going to the NBA or the love for the University
of Arizona just for letting me be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he talked with several NBA general managers and said
all told him that while he would be one of the top picks, there
were questions about his strength and he wouldn't be expected to
make a big impact right away. Woods said strength will still be a
problem after next season, but he plans to work on that as much as
possible until then.
</P>
<P>
   Woods played at Wake Forest for two seasons before transferring
to Arizona, and had to sit out the 1998-99 season before becoming
eligible. He said that he was influenced by watching Wake Forest's
Tim Duncan after he returned for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He definitely became a better player by coming back,'' Woods
said.
</P>
<P>
   By staying in school, Woods will be able to get his degree,
something that will please his mother, although he said that was
not a major factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Olson was at the NCAA tournament Final Four and unavailable for
comment, but associate coach Jim Rosborough sat next to Woods when
he made his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm extremely pleased, very pleased, for a lot of reasons,''
Rosborough said. ''Over his two years here, we've grown to like
Loren a great deal. He's a very good person.''

   MILTON, N.Y. (AP) -- A flight instructor and student were killed
when a single-engine airplane crashed and caught fire shortly after
takeoff from Saratoga County airport Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby resident saw the four-seater Cessna fixed wing aircraft
turn upside down and fall along the edge of a densely wooded area
in the southwest corner of the airport at around 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The deceased are 24-year-old Daniel T. Melita of Gloversville,
the instructor; and 31-year-old Alfred W. Sutch Jr. of Broadalbin,
according to the E.M. Rooney, a chief deputy with the Saratoga
County sheriff's office. Officials did not say who was flying the
plane.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Opposed to Andro Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA is attempting to ban androstenedione,
the testosterone-boosting supplement made famous by Mark McGwire,
but the players' association has filed a grievance to block the
move.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA issued a statement Thursday saying the joint drug
committee of the league and the players' association had added nine
substances to its banned list, including andro.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Basketball Players Association quickly filed a
grievance, putting the matter before arbitrator Roger Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baseball hasn't seen fit to ban it, and at this time we're not
ready to add it,'' union director Billy Hunter said. ''Tests that
have been done (on the effects of andro) are inconclusive, and the
stuff is still legal. This isn't mutually agreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Their grievance has no basis,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Andro is banned in many sports and the Olympics, but not by
baseball. McGwire used andro when he hit a record 70 home runs in
1998 but said last year he stopped taking it before the 1999 season
because he was concerned others interpreted his use as an
endorsement of the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Other substances added to the NBA's banned list were
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), fluoxymesterone, methyltestosterone,
nandrolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   The union's grievance also challenges the addition of DHEA to
the banned list.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Leader Targets Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Responding to a spate of corruption
scandals in Congress, President Andres Pastrana on Thursday
proposed a national referendum to combat the ''dark cancer'' of
graft.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised address, he urged Colombians to
support the referendum to be submitted to Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, dishonest and corrupt practices against the
budget belonging to all Colombians continue, like a dark cancer, to
eat away at the country's morale,'' Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   Although graft and the use of public money for political favors
has been rampant in all branches of government, Pastrana's ballot
would focus on cleaning up the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Voters would be asked about proposals to punish corrupt
lawmakers, reform campaign finances and make politicians' voting
records public, among other measures. The government hopes to hold
the referendum by October.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, of the Conservative Party, was elected in part on
promises to clean up government following the scandal-plagued
administration of his Liberal Party predecessor, President Ernesto
Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can veto the referendum plan, but Pastrana said he was
confident lawmakers would go along. There was no immediate reaction
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although accustomed to almost daily reports of corruption,
Colombians were disgusted last week when allegations arose of fraud
and kickbacks in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged misuse of $2.5 million dollars in contracts for
unrealized work and exorbitant decorations led to the resignations
this week of three senior lawmakers from leadership posts, and the
arrests of two congressional staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Charges also surfaced in the Senate, as the attorney general
this week suspended the body's chief executive officer on suspicion
of handing out phony contracts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police arrested a senior health ministry official
after catching him in a restaurant demanding a bribe in return for
a government contract.
</P>
<P>
   The recent cases are tiny in financial terms compared to huge
corruption scandals, including one involving tens of millions of
dollars in apparently phony public pensions, that have come to
light during Pastrana's 19 months in office.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Media: Next Move is Israel's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Official Syrian media on Thursday
rejected President Clinton's remark that Syria must take the next
step toward peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said this week that he told Syrian President Hafez Assad
in Geneva on Sunday about the options for a peace accord with
Israel, ''so the ball is in his court now.'' The meeting aimed --
but failed -- to bring the resumption of Israeli-Syrian peace talks
that stalled in January.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Baath newspaper, the mouthpiece of Syria's ruling Baath
party, countered that since the peace process was launched in 1991,
''the ball has never been in the Syrian court because Syria has
clearly announced that it opts for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrian newspapers are closely controlled and reflect the
government's views.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa briefed EU ambassadors to
Syria on the Geneva meeting, saying the talks had started
''cordially,'' the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when President Clinton told President Assad that Israel
wants full sovereignty over the Jordan River waters and Tiberias
(Sea of Galilee) ... President Assad categorically rejected it,''
al-Sharaa told the EU diplomats, according to SANA.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has hinted he would give back
all of the Golan except land bordering the Sea of Galilee -- a major
water source -- that Damascus also claims.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa was quoted as saying Assad would not ''relinquish the
right of the people and the country, whatever time it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak, with his known obstinacy, hesitation and lack of an
in-depth decision-making spirit, has torpedoed a great achievement
that could have been reached by the summit,'' said an editorial by
the director general of SANA, Fayez Sayegh, in Wednesday's
Al-Thawra.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Baath newspaper on Thursday urged the United States not to
abandon the process, saying it was not deadlocked despite the
summit's failure.
</P>
<P>
   In Tel Aviv, Barak all but eulogized U.S.-led efforts to hammer
out a peace agreement between Israel and Syria, but said he is not
closing the door on the possibility of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said, ''Of course it would have been preferable'' to have
an agreement with Syria that would ensure quiet on Israel's
northern border when it pulls out of southern Lebanon in July. But
he insisted that even without a deal, he would go through with the
pullout plans from the occupied zone Israel has held there since
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon and Israel wants it to
ensure Hezbollah guerrillas do not conduct cross-border attacks.
Syria opposes a unilateral withdrawal, saying it wants it as part
of a complete deal settling the Golan issue as well.

<HEADLINE> Penn State 74, N.C. State 72  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK JR., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Crispin made an uncontested layup with two
seconds left and intercepted Damien Wilkins' inbounds pass to lead
Penn State to a 74-72 victory over North Carolina State in the
consolation game of the National Invitation Tournament on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After N.C. State's Kenny Inge tied it 72-72 on a short jumper
with 13.6 seconds left, Crispin calmly dribbled the ball up the
court and drove in for the game-winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   Crispin, who finished with 14 points, then intercepted Wilkins'
long pass to seal the victory for the Nittany Lions (19-16).
</P>
<P>
   The game preceded Wake Forest's 71-61 victory over Notre Dame in
the final at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett Stephens added 28 points on 11-of-18 shooting for Penn
State, which beat N.C. State for just the third time in 17
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins led N.C. State (20-14) with 21 points, and Inge added 18
points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   With Penn State trailing 70-67, Titus Ivory hit a 3-pointer with
2:08 left to tie it. The Nittany Lions then took their first lead
of the half when Crispin made two free throws with 1:11 left to
make it 72-70.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State went on a 15-6 run early in the second half to lead
56-45 with 12:13 left, highlighted by Inge's dunk. The Nittany
Lions couldn't get the lead under nine until Crispin's 3-pointer
with 8:31 left made it 62-56.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Nittany Lions, who lost to Notre Dame in the
semifinals, slowly chipped at the lead.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State's biggest lead of the first half was 19-10 with 12:46
remaining on Clifford Crawford's layup. Penn State went on a 9-0
run, keyed by two baskets by Stephens to tie it at 19-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack took leads as large as five points, but the Nittany
Lions came back to lead 29-27 on Crispin's 3-pointer with 3:57
left.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins hit a 16-foot running jumper at the buzzer to tie it
37-37 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens scored 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting in the half to
lead the Nittany Lions, who were 16-for-29 from the field. Wilkins
had 13 points for the Wolfpack.

<HEADLINE> Nets 107, Raptors 103  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A foolish technical foul and an
unfortunate encounter with a rookie ruined Vince Carter's 39-point
night, and the Toronto Raptors lost for the fifth time in six
games, 107-103 to the New Jersey Nets on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carter picked up a technical for halfheartedly throwing the ball
at Scott Burrell after a hard foul with 3:31 left, then had his
shot blocked by rookie Evan Eschmeyer with 35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The two plays were keys for the Nets, who kept their slim
playoff hopes alive as they pulled within 4{ games of idle Orlando
for the final playoff spot in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Carter matched his third-highest scoring output of the season
but got little help from his teammates. Starting point guard Doug
Christie did not score, and shooting guard Tracy McGrady scored all
10 of his points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors, currently fifth in the conference, had their lead
over sixth-place Charlotte cut to just a half-game. The Raptors and
Hornets play Friday night at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn had 32 points to lead the Nets, who got a big
boost from Eschmeyer in his second straight start. Three of
Eschmeyer's four blocks came against Carter, and the 6-foot-11
rookie from Northwestern also had eight points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury added 17 points, Kerry Kittles had 16 and Elliot
Perry 12 for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets opened up a 21-point lead early in the third quarter on
a jumper by Kittles that made it 60-39, before Carter started going
to work to pull the Raptors back into it. Carter scored 17 points
in the third quarter, which ended with the Raptors trailing 77-73.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took its first lead of the game on a dunk by Antonio
Davis that made it 80-79 less than 2{ minutes into the fourth
quarter, and Carter gave them their final lead on a pair of foul
shots that made it 82-81 with 8:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Johnny Newman each had a jumper and a drive in an 8-0
run that put the Nets up 89-82 with 5:52 left, but Toronto had one
comeback left.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors trailed only 93-89 when Carter picked up his
technical, and Van Horn made the foul shot to make it a five-point
game. Carter then went to the line and made just one of two,
turning an opportunity to make it a two-point game into a wash.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Toronto got after that was 96-95 on a three-point
play by McGrady with 2:12 left, but Kittles and Van Horn followed
with 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 102-98 with under 50 seconds left when Toronto
rebounded a miss by Kendall Gill, but Eschmeyer went up and blocked
Carter's shot underneath the basket, the ball went out of bounds
off Toronto, Marbury hit a foul shot and the outcome was all but
assured.
</P>
<P>
Notes: New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman attended the
game and visited with injured Nets center Jayson Williams at
halftime. ... Toronto coach Butch Carter picked up a technical foul
in the first half for arguing that a hard foul by Perry against
Vince Carter should have been ruled a flagrant foul. ''If Oak does
that it's a flagrant,'' Carter yelled. ... Carter led the Raptors
in scoring for the 27th consecutive game. ... The Nets salvaged a
split of the season series. They lost by 20 and 29 in the teams'
first two meetings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mary Fowler Brennan, wife of the late Supreme
Court Justice William J. Brennan, died Tuesday of cancer. She was
83.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brennan, a 40-year Supreme Court employee, worked for
nearly 26 years as Brennan's secretary. After the death of the
justice's first wife, he and his longtime secretary were married in
1983 -- her last day as a court employee.

<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Leonora G. Edwards, whose husband
sailed the last whaling voyage from New Bedford, died Tuesday. She
was 103.
</P>
<P>
   She was the widow of Capt. Joseph F. Edwards, who began his
whaling career aboard a square-rigged vessel commanded by his
brother in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   By 1918, as the commander of the Charles W. Morgan, one of New
Bedford's most famous whaling ships, Edwards took a year-long sperm
whaling expedition off Brazil and the West Indies even as WWI
German U-boats dotted the seas. He went on to lead whaling voyages
across the globe. In 1927 he commanded the last expedition in
America from what was once the world's busiest whaling port.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her life, Edwards shared her whaling ties with the
Whaling Museum and took part in its oral history program. She was a
member of the Boston Marine Society and the Descendants of Whaling
Masters.

Rudolf Kirchschlaeger
</P>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Former President Rudolf Kirchschlaeger,
who fathered the deal that led to Austria's independence after 10
years of occupation following World War II, died Thursday of a
heart attack. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Kirchschlaeger represented his country during the Austrian
Neutrality Pact negotiations in 1955, which led to the pullout of
Allied and Soviet troops. He served as president from 1974 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In his final interview, Kirchschlaeger lamented Austria's recent
isolation after the election of a far-right party whose leader was
linked to statements sympathetic to Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1970, Kirschlaeger served as ambassador to then
Czechoslovakia. During the ''Prague Spring,'' Kirchschlaeger left
the doors of the embassy open to people trying to flee Soviet
troops.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first presidential election in 1974, and six years
later, won more than 80 percent of the vote in winning his bid for
a second term.

Lily Simha Hood
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- French Quarter pianist and chanteuse Lily
Simha Hood, whose fans included Tennessee Williams, died March 24
of kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   She was cagey about revealing her age, and her husband asked
that the secret remain with her death.
</P>
<P>
   Her musical career began on a whim. After dinner one night in
1976, the Hoods and a friend stopped at Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop,
a Bourbon Street bar across from their house. Mrs. Hood played a
few tunes on the piano for her friend and was hired on the spot,
even though she wasn't looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, ''Miss Lily'' had a crowd of regulars including Tennessee
Williams, who would bring in a songbook for her to sing from.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hood never formally studied the piano and never learned to
read music. She was self-taught and learned by listening. She
performed at Lafitte's for 16 years, but health problems ended her
career about seven years ago.

<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Frances Gray Patton, best-known for her 1954
novel ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' died Tuesday. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   The book was translated into 10 languages and became a movie
starring Jennifer Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's short stories appeared in The New Yorker and Harper's,
among other prominent national publications.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, who taught creative writing at Duke and University of
North Carolina, published three short story collections, and she
once had a contract with The New Yorker for a series of 29 stories.
</P>
<P>
   She was known in the literary community for supporting and
encouraging fellow writers. She was honored for her contributions
by the North Carolina Writers Conference.

J. David Watson
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM (AP) -- J. David Watson, an advice columnist who
answered questions both serious and comical from readers of the
Winston-Salem Journal for 15 years, died Wednesday of a heart
attack. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, known as Sam, the Straight-Answer Man, could handle even
the most arcane question.
</P>
<P>
   He received hundreds of letters and telephone calls a week, most
involving serious questions about finances, law or city government.
</P>
<P>
   Other readers wanted to know why people have hair but animals
have fur, or why they couldn't drive naked.
</P>
<P>
   If Watson didn't know the answer, he and his staff did whatever
it took to find it.
</P>
<P>
   He began his newspaper career in Hickory before joining the Twin
City Sentinel in Winston-Salem in 1974. He moved to the Journal in
1985 when the Sentinel folded.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is survived by his wife, Sharon; two sons, Aaron and
Evan; and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. J.D. Watson.

<HEADLINE> Class-Action Suit Against Bank OK'd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday granted a motion
requesting class-action status for a discrimination lawsuit filed
against the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The bank plans to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, U.S. District Judge William Hibbler said the
class could include black employees who worked below the level of
officer from 1964 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in February 1998, alleges that the federal bank
refused to promote qualified black employees. It also claims that
those employees received lower wages, were denied training and were
degraded by on-the-job racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Stein, the lawyer representing the more than 34 employees
included so far in the lawsuit, said the class could now grow to
include more than 2,000 employees in the bank's district. The
district includes offices in Peoria, Detroit and Milwaukee, as well
as parts of Indiana and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling ''allows us to reach back to 1964 to examine
the practices and policies of the Federal Reserve Bank for the last
35 years,'' Stein said Thursday. ''We know we're going to find the
skeletons and the evidence on the trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lapinski, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, said the bank
plans to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very disappointed with the ruling, we don't agree with
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more than $25 million in damages, the lawsuit
seeks lost wages and 10 percent of the bank's net worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve of Chicago is a branch of the
Washington-based Federal Reserve and handles such things as check
processing for the Midwest region.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hans Jonsson scored 2:25 into overtime to give
the Pittsburgh Penguins a 4-3 victory over the Washington Capitals
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Washington earned a point for the regulation tie to pull even
with New Jersey for the Eastern Conference lead. The Capitals and
Devils both have five regular-season games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson beat goalie Olaf Kolzig with a hard shot from between
the circles to finish a 3-on-2 rush. Jonsson was the trailer on the
play and took a good centering pass from Martin Straka.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Chris Simon scored his 29th goal of the season with
6:08 left in the third period to force overtime. The Capitals are
18-2-3 in their last 23 home games and 29-8-5 overall since Jan.1.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh played without Jaromir Jagr, the NHL's leading
scorer, who was sidelined for a second straight game because of a
bruised back.
</P>
<P>
   Washington wasted numerous scoring chances throughout the game,
missing several in a wide-open first period when it had 16 shots.
The Capitals held a 35-32 overall advantage in shots, but had
trouble beating goalie Ron Tugnutt (29 saves).
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Halpern gave the Capitals a 1-0 at 5:18 of the first
period, knocking in the rebound of Ulf Dahlen's shot. Dahlen swung
out from behind the net with Pittsburgh defenseman Jiri Slegr on
his left arm and somehow got off a shot that bounced off goalie Ron
Tugnutt and over to Halpern.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Alexei Kovalev tied it with a power-play goal at
15:16 of the period. Richard Zednik gave the Capitals a 2-1 lead 43
seconds later following a pass from Joe Murphy on a 2-on-1 rush.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy was hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct call on the
goal, and Robert Lang tied it with an extra-man goal 1:04 later.
Washington's penalty-kiling unit entered the game tied for fourth
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Beranek gave Pittsburgh a 3-2 lead with the team's third
power-play goal with 9:20 left in the third period. Beranek sneaked
in from Kolzig's left side and knocked a loose puck into the net.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Car Bomb Kills Four  </HEADLINE>
By CESAR GARCIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A powerful truck bomb exploded in a
tourist town west of the capital on Thursday, killing four people
and injuring at least 14 others, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's explosion ripped through the town square in Cachipay,
a getaway location for capital residents just 25 miles from Bogota.
It was the second fatal car bombing in the area in less than a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have blamed both attacks on the country's largest
leftist insurgency, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC. The rebel group has not claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Television images showed the town offices in ruins and debris
scattered about the square. On the street lay the twisted hulk of
the vehicle that exploded, a small truck loaded with soft drinks,
according to witnesses interviewed on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FARC is bringing back memories in Colombia of the days of
Pablo Escobar,'' national police operations director Gen. Alfonso
Arellano told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The late former head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, Escobar
waged a campaign of bombings and assassinations a decade ago to
avoid his extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials blame the FARC for a car bomb that exploded Sunday in
Girardot, a major tourist town just to the south. That explosion
near a marketplace killed a police cadet and injured 16 bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials and Colombia's Defense Minister, Luis Ramirez,
said the attacks could be linked to a rebel extortion scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors in Cundinamarca State, where both Cachipay and Girardot
are located, have complained of FARC threats of violence if they
refuse to hand over 10 percent of their town budgets to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel violence has continued unabated in Colombia despite the
opening of peace talks 14 months ago between the FARC and the
government of President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel attack on a remote northern town last weekend left 21
police officers and eight civilians dead, including the mayor and
two young children.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculate the guerrillas are stepping up violence
in an attempt to strengthen their hand in the peace talks. But
recent rebel violence has been widely repudiated by Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   A car bomb exploded in Bogota in November, killing eight
passers-by and injuring 45. Many believe that attack was carried
out by mafias trying to pressure the government against extraditing
drug suspects to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Blues 3, Bruins 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Jochen Hecht scored twice and Roman Turek stopped
20 shots as the St. Louis Blues beat the Boston Bruins 3-2 on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues improved to 43-0-0 when scoring three or more goals.
They also snapped a two-game winless streak; they have not gone
more than three games without a victory all season.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton and Sergei Samsonov scored for Boston, and John
Grahame made 33 saves. The Bruins are 0-3-1 in their last four
games, and have not beaten St. Louis in seven tries since Nov. 18,
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Blues a three-point cushion over Detroit in
the race for the most points in the NHL's regular season. St. Louis
has already clinched home-ice advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton made it 1-0 at the 6:47 mark of the first period when
he picked up a loose puck on the left side of the goal,
stickhandled in front and backhanded it in. It was his team-leading
57th point and his 22nd goal of the season, tying him for the team
lead with the injured Anson Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht tied it at 15:16 of the first when he knocked in the puck
after Grahame failed to kick it away.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis made it 2-1 at 14:34 of the second when Grahame
blocked Stephane Richer's slap shot, but left the puck sitting in
the crease. With the goalie looking around for the puck, Bruins
defensman Don Sweeney kicked the puck loose and Hecht tapped it in.
</P>
<P>
   Michal Handzus pulled Grahame and the lone defender out of
position before sliding it over to Scott Young, who had an open net
to shoot at. His 21st goal of the season made it 3-1 with 4:37 gone
in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov beat Turek with his 19th of the season at the 8:44 mark
of the third to make it 3-2. But the goalie stopped Samsonov from
point-blank range with 2:40 left in the game to preserve the
victory.

<HEADLINE> Heat 105, Bulls 80  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tim Hardaway had 16 points and eight assists as the
Miami Heat clinched a playoff berth for the fifth straight year
with a 105-80 victory over the Chicago Bulls Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning added 15 points in only 18 minutes of action,
and Jamal Mashburn scored 12. Three Heat reserves -- Clarence
Weatherspoon, Otis Thorpe and Rodney Buford -- each added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The victory avenged two earlier embarrassing defeats to Chicago.
It was Miami's second-largest margin of victory this season. The
Heat beat the Celtics 115-89 on Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, in first place in the Atlantic Division, led Chicago
53-39 at halftime. The Bulls pulled within 64-55 on a 14-foot
jumper by rookie Elton Brand with 4:51 to play in the third
quarter, but the Heat responded, pushing the lead back up to 17.
</P>
<P>
   Brand was the only bright spot for Chicago, with 17 points. Fred
Hoiberg had 15.
</P>
<P>
   Miami jumped on the Bulls early. The Heat shot 62.2 percent from
the field (23-of-37) in the first half and led by as many as 17.
Mourning had 13 in the half on 6-of-8 shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   After leading 9-7, the Bulls never were ahead again. Miami has
won 15 of its last 16 at home, with the only loss coming last week
to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls are 6-33 against teams at .500 or better, and now have
a 13-game road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was coming off two poor outings. The Heat scored a
record-low 19 points in the second half of its loss Sunday in
Orlando and blew a 28-point lead at home against Phoenix on Tuesday
before pulling out a win.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Miami and Boston are the only teams the Bulls have defeated
more than once this season. ... Mashburn was back in the starting
lineup after missing Tuesday's game against the Suns with the flu
and played 27 minutes. ... Hardaway earned an $800,000 bonus
because Miami reached 45 wins. ... Miami coach Pat Riley is now
eight wins away from becoming the second coach in NBA history to
record 1,000 career victories. Atlanta's Lenny Wilkens was the
first. ... Chicago's 25 turnovers were a season-high for a Miami
opponent this year. The previous high was 21.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Major Accepts Discharge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- An Air Force major was discharged from the
military on Thursday, ending his fight against an order to take an
anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Sonnie Bates, 35, had initially faced a court-martial for
refusing an order. He was believed to have been the highest-ranking
officer in the Air Force to face a court-martial for refusing an
order to take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, a pilot at Dover Air Force Base, contended the vaccine
could jeopardize his health. The Pentagon insists the vaccine is
safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force last month said it wouldn't court-martial Bates
and later offered him a general discharge under honorable
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we really want to come out of all this is for
Congress to take this issue to the floor and debate it,'' Bates
said. ''I don't have to worry about the vaccine, but there are a
lot of people who do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department wants to vaccinate all 2.4 million of its
active and reserve uniformed personnel against anthrax, a deadly
biological weapon. About 200 to 300 service personnel have
disobeyed the order. Some have been prosecuted, and some reservists
have quit instead of taking the shots.

<HEADLINE> Nike Ends Brown University Contract  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Nike is terminating its contract to
provide hockey equipment to Brown University, fearing the school
might try to make it comply with guidelines of a group pushing for
better working conditions in clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
   Nike said it objects to being held to the code of conduct
outlined by the Workers Rights Consortium, of which Brown was a
founding member, because the company disagrees with the group's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The WRC is based on a 'gotcha' monitoring technique,'' Simon
Pestridge, Nike's labor practices manager, said. He said they go to
factories and report on what they find, rather than work with
factories to effect change.
</P>
<P>
   He said the WRC's definition of a ''living wage'' is too vague.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no way we can commit to a document that is not
finished,'' Pestridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown notified Nike in late January that it wanted to
renegotiate its contract with the Beaverton, Ore., company, to
require it to comply with Brown's code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's code is not unlike Nike's, Vada Manager, Nike's director
of global issues management, said. But because the school is a
founding member of the WRC, Nike's lawyers said the school could
try and impose the WRC's code on Nike, Manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was the first school involved with the WRC to ask for a
renegotiation of its contract with Nike, Manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Nike were in the middle of a three-year contract, in
which Nike provided the men's and women's hockey teams with skates,
gloves, pads, and other goods under the Nike and Bauer labels. Nike
has no other contracts with Brown, Manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spokesman Mark Nickel could not be reached for comment.
Sports information director Christopher Humm declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They market mainly to college-aged kids ... and if Nike pulled
out from Brown they'd get a lot of criticism,'' Maria Roeper of the
WRC said.

<HEADLINE> Milan indictment stirs passions of supporters, detractors  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Embarrassment or martyr?
</P>
<P>
   Those widely varying descriptions of Camden Mayor Milton Milan
emerged Thursday after the leader of New Jersey's poorest city was
indicted on corruption charges linking him to the Philadelphia mob.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, 37, was charged in a 19-count federal indictment with
bribery, conspiracy, extortion, money laundering, fraud and lesser
offenses. He was freed after putting up property he and his wife
own as collateral for his $150,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Ali Sloan-El, Milan's harshest critic, called
the indictment ''an embarrassment to this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were in his shoes, I would have stepped out,'' he said.
''My position is a long time ago he should have stepped down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said he is preparing memos to his fellow council members
urging them to take unspecified action against Milan, although he
stopped short of saying he would seek the mayor's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-El said the criminal charges will make it even harder for
the economically struggling city to attract new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''That weighs across the state and across the nation against
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential impact on the city's fitful efforts to redevelop
itself was also on Gov. Christie Whitman's mind Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Camden has been a troubled city for years and we have put lots
of money, lots of time and attention into that city, and this kind
of disruption to the process of government is very, very
concerning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, you're innocent until proven guilty. He has turned
himself in, but you cannot ignore the severity of these charges and
the disruption that it will cause in a city that is already very,
very troubled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fulbrook, president of the Cooper-Grant Neighborhood
Association, cited testimony from a recently completed drug trial
that named Milan as a drug customer and dealer in the 1980s before
he was elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question was, did he leave that lifestyle in the past, or
did he bring that with him to the city council and the mayor's
office,'' Fulbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges made public Thursday did not involve narcotics, and
Greg Reinert, a spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor's
Office, said he knew of no pending drug-related case or
investigation involving Milan. The statute of limitations on
narcotics activity is five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Walker, who served as assistant city business
administrator under Milan until last June, said he and other city
workers saw no obvious signs of corruption on the mayor's part.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''There was always a lot of speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a drumbeat of negative publicity emerging from the drug
trial and the federal grand jury probe that culminated in
Thursday's indictments, Milan's supporters cautioned against a rush
to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Gilbert ''Whip'' Wilson said the mayor should be
presumed innocent until charges are proven.
</P>
<P>
   ''An indictment does not prove guilt,'' Wilson said. ''He has to
go through the system like anybody else. I'm a retired police
officer and I believe in innocent until proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was flanked by supporters, and bystanders walked up to
shake his hand as he strode with reporters and cameramen the two
blocks from his City Hall office to the courthouse to surrender at
midmorning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Edwin Martinez of the Door of Salvation Church in
Camden lent his support to the embattled mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm standing here as a pastor to let him know I'm by his
side,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said many other ministers in Camden, particularly in its
sizable Hispanic community, still support Milan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here because he needs us now,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Camden resident Royal Upshaw watched the Milan procession make
its way to the courthouse, then went to get his hair cut at a
barber shop on Spruce Street. He said he has supported Milan since
he took office, but isn't sure what to make of the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel too good about it,'' he said. ''The man did some
good things for the city. The streets are cleaner than they were,
and we've gotten some new businesses. We're doing better with him
than we were under the last three or four mayors.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the former assistant business administrator, said
regardless of the outcome of the legal case against Milan, the case
should serve as a wake-up call to Camden residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly will clearly encourage all of us as residents of
Camden to review the standards by which we judge our elected
leadership.''

<HEADLINE> Former Liquor CEO Charged in Scam  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The former chief operating officer of the U.S.
subsidiary of the world's No. 2 liquor company was charged in
Manhattan with diverting more than $15 million from the company
into offshore bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Valdes was charged in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
with conspiracy and money laundering in connection with the scheme
to steal from Domecq Importers Inc. of Old Greenwich, Conn., from
the late 1980s to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, a former president and vice president of sales
pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege that they managed to divert approximately
$15.6 million out of Domecq Importers Inc. with help from outside
vendors of advertising, display materials and other services.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Valdes and the others convinced the
vendors to bill Domecq Importers for goods never produced or
services never performed. Once the bills were paid, the vendors
then agreed to issue checks to shell corporations controlled by
Valdes and co-conspirators, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The checks were usually deposited in offshore accounts so income
tax could be evaded, the government alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes worked at Domecq Importers between 1984 and 1996, holding
numerous jobs related to finance. In 1995, he became the company's
vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Domecq Importers Inc. has been a U.S. subsidiary of
Allied Domecq PLC, the world's second-largest liquor company behind
Britain's Diageo, whose brands include Tanqueray gin and Guinness
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Domecq is based in London and employs more than 70,000
people worldwide. The U.S. subsidiary imports and distributes
numerous brands of liquor, including Sauza tequila, Courvoisier
cognac and Beefeater gin.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Valdes could face up to 20 years in prison and as
much as $500,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Valdes did not immediately return a telephone
message seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Japan Residents Fear Eruption  </HEADLINE>
By KAORI HITOMI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Roads began cracking Friday as fissures grew
on the flanks of a snow-capped Japanese volcano, signs of magma
swelling below the earth. Experts warned a major eruption could
come at any time.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11,000 people have been forced to leave their homes
near Mount Usu on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. They've
been warned not to venture back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything in the house is probably upsidedown,'' said
Masanori Ueyama, a 66-year-old farmer. ''I'm very, very anxious to
see what is happening in my house and in my field.''
</P>
<P>
   Intense earthquake activity went into a fourth day Friday.
Thousands of quakes have been registered around the 2,416-foot
mountain, 475 miles north of Tokyo. While tremors were less
frequent by Thursday evening, officials said they were gaining in
intensity because of the movement of magma underground.
</P>
<P>
   But the appearance of fissures was seen as particularly ominous.
The location of the cracks indicate an eruption may come from
somewhere other than the volcano's current crater.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorological agency issued an emergency warning Friday to
announce that cracks on the mountain are increasing in number and
growing in length, splitting roads in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Observers aboard a military helicopter found that magma had
pushed open cracks on the volcano's western slope and near its base
Thursday. One fissure on the western slope stretched 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that an eruption would melt the snow on the volcano's
flanks and cause mudslides, authorities ordered the evacuation of
4,137 homes in this town at the volcano's base and two others --
Sobetsu and Abuta. Together, the towns have a population of 51,300.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation was becoming a problem as residents taken to shelters
were unable to take baths, and everyday necessities were running
low, said Yoshio Nagasaki, mayor of Abuta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer the duration of the wait, the harder it becomes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The area is known for a scenic lake and hot spring resorts, but
hotel owners began turning tourists away Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Residential areas near the volcano were deserted except for
police cars blocking the roads, town officials checking for
stragglers and abandoned dogs scampering about the streets.

   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes, according to Japan's meteorological agency.
The agency describes an active volcano as one that has erupted at
least once over the last 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Usu last erupted in 1977 and mudslides caused by eruptions
that continued into the following year left two people dead and
destroyed nearly 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe an eruption of Usu would probably be similar to
Mount Unzen in southern Japan in 1991, when several eruptions sent
avalanches of hot rocks sweeping down, killing 43 people and
leaving nearly 2,300 homeless.

<HEADLINE> Expo Helps Usher Women's Movement  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- When Lisa Briddle was a teen-ager, she and her
mother were regulars at feminist conferences and Equal Rights
Amendment rallies.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Raleigh, N.C., woman will initiate a third
generation into the women's movement. She'll bring 7-year-old
daughter Kelsey to Baltimore for Feminist Expo 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want her to really know a lot of the history of women and
the struggles they've been through, and that being a girl is
special,'' said Briddle, who will soon include her toddler son in
the gatherings. ''I want her to know that being a girl doesn't mean
she can't do anything she sets her mind to.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day expo, which will begin Friday at the Baltimore
Convention Center, will offer both a retrospective of the movement
and a call to arms for the coming century. Organizers, who say the
women's movement is more necessary than ever, hope the event will
rally the next generation of feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders at the forefront of the modern feminist movement, such
as Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan and Eleanor Smeal will be joined
by relative newcomers such as writer bell hooks and Jordanian
journalist Rana Husseini.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expect up to 6,000 people to attend, including about
2,000 college students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young women today believe that they have the right to be
treated equally. But I think what they find when they get into the
real world is that there are more barriers to that than they
expected,'' said Sarah Boonin, campus program director for the
Feminist Majority Foundation, which organized the expo. ''Now they
are not fighting for the concept of equality -- they are fighting to
make that concept a reality.''

Elian Dad's Visa Attempt Hits Snag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father asked for a visa today to come to the
United States and take the boy back to Cuba. The attempt hit a procedural snag,
however, when the State Department told the father's lawyer that applications
must be submitted to the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana. Discussions between
immigration officials and the boy's Miami relatives, meanwhile, ended without a
resolution. The talks were set to resume Monday. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service had warned that it would revoke Elian's right to stay in
the United States unless the relatives promised to turn him over if their legal
appeals were rejected. But after today's meeting, the INS pushed back the
deadline for a second time to at least Tuesday.

Senate Looking At Gas Tax Rollback
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate took a halting step today toward acting on
legislation that would temporarily roll back 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax.
The measure has little chance of House passage and does not offer much relief
for motorists coping with spiraling prices at the pump. Republicans led by
Majority Leader Trent Lott are making the issue prime fodder for this election
year, referring to it as the ''Gore tax'' because Vice President Al Gore cast
the tie-breaking 1993 Senate vote to make it law. GOP presidential candidate
George W. Bush favors ''efforts to lower gas prices'' but has not taken a stand
on the temporary repeal, spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.

House Approves $13 Billion Measure

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a $13 billion measure today for the

Appropriations Committee plans to write a roughly $6 billion version of the bill
next week, despite long-running opposition by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. But Lott is under growing pressure to reverse himself. The legislation
provides money for popular causes like American soldiers and drug-fighting
overseas and road-building, natural disaster recovery and farmers at home.

eBay Reveals Federal Investigations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Online auction company eBay Inc. revealed in federal

investigations into its business practices. EBay said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the Justice Department last week
subpoenaed documents relating to an investigation begun in 1997 of Sotheby's and
Christie's of alleged price-fixing in commissions. The auction houses, which
control 95 percent of the $4 billion worldwide auction market, have said they
are cooperating with prosecutors, and news reports have said the auction houses
are being scrutinized for failing to charge fees to their wealthiest clients.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Enron Field Opens Doors  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Fans cheered when Enron Field's doors officially
opened Thursday afternoon. Their mood only got better upon first
inspection of the sunny grass field of the Houston Astros' new
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I kind of have a lump in my throat,'' said longtime
fan Wade Upton. ''This really shows Houston is back. State of the
art, top of the world. That's how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Upton's brother, Dave, got his 53rd birthday celebration off to
a memorable start when Astros outfielder Julio Lugo tossed a
practice ball up to his perch on the balcony that juts over the
left-center field warning track.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, who played the first game in the Astrodome
35 years ago, were on hand to open Houston's new stadium in an
exhibition game. The Astros won 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,624 fans who attended Houston's first outdoor
major-league game in 36 years were greeted by sunshine, mild
temperatures and low humidity one day after Houston endured the
kind of shirt-soaking mugginess that inspired the Astrodome a
generation before.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans entered through the refurbished Union Station
building, the city's primary train depot until falling into
disrepair in the 1970s. Some immediately flocked to the seats set
315 feet down the left-field line, which Ken Caminiti was busy
peppering with batting practice homers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best ballpark Houston ever had,'' veteran Astros
fan Mike Maher said as he and others in the Crawford Street boxes
stretched for souvenir balls.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this historically blighted northeast corner of
downtown was under control by mid-afternoon even as rush hour and
incoming baseball fans converged.
</P>
<P>
   For Jose Saldana, co-owner of Mexican restaurant Habanero Blue
two blocks east, the thought of at least 81 home dates a year
brought a smile as he surveyed his three-month-old eatery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of 40,000 people, if I get 200 of them I'm happy,''
Saldana said.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the area that includes the third-largest county jail
system in the country, there are more bail bondsmen than
restaurants within two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Though an upscale high-rise housing development soon will sprout
just beyond center field, some of the nearest residents to the park
currently are homeless men at the Star of Hope mission, just a
couple of Jeff Bagwell homers up the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to hire some of these people,'' off-and-on shelter
dweller Leo Sentera said. ''They need to put some of these people
back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentera said police rarely hassled anyone camping out in this
section of town until this year, dispersing them to shelters or
less-visible campsites, such as under nearby U.S. Highway 59.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel kind of bad that they moved us aside, but I understand
that it's all about money,'' said Melvin Jones, who said he has
spent many a night sleeping on nearby La Branch street.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, both Sentera and Jones, wearing a circa-1990 Astros batting
practice jersey, say they welcome the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''This area needed it,'' Sentera said.

Volcano Erupts in Northern Japan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- The Mount Usu volcano erupted Friday, spewing hot rock,
gas and a plume of ash and smoke over the snowy countryside of Japan's
northernmost main island. There were no immediate reports of injury. Experts
monitoring seismic activity had predicted the eruption, and had already
evacuated more than 11,000 residents from homes at its base. Roughly 51,000
people live in this town and two others near the 2,416-foot mountain, 475 miles

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jocelyn Thibault made 27 saves for his third
shutout of the season as the Chicago Blackhawks beat Toronto 4-0 on
Thursday to end a three-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zhamnov and Michael Nylander each had a goal and assist for
Chicago, which ended Toronto's two-game winning streak. Anders
Eriksson and Bob Probert also scored for the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs are 3-5-0 since March 15, with four of the five
losses to teams out of playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksson opened the scoring with 1:24 left in the first period,
beating screened goalie Glenn Healy with a 50-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   After Zhamnov was high-sticked by Dmitri Yushkevich, the Chicago
forward scored during the ensuing power play to make it 2-0 lead at

</P>
<P>
   One of Thibault's best stops came with 2:50 left in the second,
when he made a point-blank pad save on Mats Sundin.
</P>
<P>
   Nylander made it 3-0 at 1:36 of the third period on a 25-foot
wrist shot that went under Healy's blocker. Probert scored at 5:53,

   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan had 19 points, 17 rebounds and six
blocked shots and David Robinson scored 27 points as the San
Antonio Spurs beat the Golden State Warriors 102-90 on Thursday
night for their fifth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs started slowly, trailing 19-7 midway through the first
quarter, but finished strong in handing the Warriors their eighth
straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio (47-25) took control with a 23-8 run to open a 76-60
lead in the third quarter. Golden State got as close as eight
several times in the final period, the last time with just under a
minute to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mookie Blaylock had 19 points and Larry Hughes 17 for the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had 13 points and nine rebounds in the first quarter as
the Spurs trailed 31-26.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs coach Gregg Popovich attempted to get his team untracked
by calling two time outs in the first four minutes and three in the
first quarter. The Spurs finally cut the lead to five by the end of
the first quarter, but still trailed most of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Only a three-pointer by Jaren Jackson with 6.7 seconds left gave
San Antonio a 53-52 edge, its biggest lead of the first half.
Notes: San Antonio may activate guard Terry Porter from the injured
list for the two-game Eastern swing to Miami and Orlando on Sunday
and Tuesday. Porter has missed 13 games with a sprained ligament in
his left knee. ... Of the Spurs last 10 games, only two are against
teams with a losing record -- Vancouver twice. ... Golden State went
1-15 in March and it took the Warriors two overtimes to get that
win in Chicago . . . The Warriors Adonal Foyle set a career high
with eight blocked shots.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Cyclist Kidnapped, Again  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Retired Colombian cycling hero Oliverio
Rincon was abducted for the second time this year by leftist
guerrillas, authorities said Thursday. He was later freed after 24
hours in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon's previous, monthlong kidnapping -- and the abduction
earlier this month of the country's best-known cyclist, Luis
Alberto ''Lucho'' Herrera -- outraged sports fans and athletes in a
country where kidnapping has become a thriving industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon was released Thursday evening in his car, which he drove
to an army base 30 miles from where he was abducted a day earlier
in central Boyaca State, army anti-kidnapping chief Col. Jesus
Bohorquez told Radionet Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Bohorquez did not provide details, and Rincon had yet to make
any statements.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old athlete -- one of Colombia's top cyclists of the
1990s -- was seized Wednesday along with his family by armed men who
intercepted his car as he drove along a country road with his wife,
mother-in-law and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Two men wearing ski masks and waving pistols forced Rincon's
Ford Explorer off the road near Duitama, his hometown in Boyaca,
state police commander Col. Pedro Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   The men then boarded the car and drove for several hours into a
mountainous region dominated by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest leftist insurgency,
Ramirez told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon was told a rebel commander wanted to speak with him, but
was given no more details, the police chief added. Police have had
no direct contact with the kidnappers, and based their account
largely on information provided by Rincon's wife, Gilma Rincon.
</P>
<P>
   Gilma Rincon, her children and mother were released Thursday
morning in Duitama.
</P>
<P>
   ''They treated us well and when I said goodbye the men told me
not to worry,'' Gilma Rincon told Colombia's Caracol Radio
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She said the kidnappers -- who identified themselves as members
of FARC -- had not made any demands and had promised not to hurt her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Rincon spent 10 days as captive of another leftist
guerrilla group, reportedly the smaller National Liberation Army,
or ELN. He was released Jan. 30, the same day hundreds of Colombian
athletes marched in Bogota to demand his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon said he had not paid a ransom, the most common objective
of the roughly 3,000 kidnappings committed annually in the South
American nation, mostly by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon gained national famed for racing in major international
events including the Tour de France, Tour of Italy and Tour of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera was kidnapped by guerrillas earlier this month and
released the next day following a nationwide outcry.
