<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Repay IMF Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday decided to
repay 2.8 billion U.S. dollars of its International Monetary Fund
(IMF) loan due on December 18, the Ministry of Finance and Economy
said.
</P>
<P>
"Usable foreign exchange reserves have reached an all-time high
of 46.5 billion U.S. dollars at the end of November, compared with
less than four billion last year," said a ministry spokesman on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 2.8 billion dollars is part of the IMF's supplementary
reserve facility, a short-term emergency loan with an interest
rate of 7.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised to South Korea that it would provide support
to the nation again if its economy deteriorated abruptly after
returning the loan, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
After the 2.8-billion-dollar reimbursement, the nation's usable
foreign exchange reserves will be 47 billion dollars at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea expects its usable foreign reserves to amount to 50
billion dollars next year, provided that the current account
surplus reaches 20 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Crown Prince Meets EU Envoy on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan met
European Union (EU) peace envoy Miguel Moratinos Wednesday on
regional peace issues.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the latest developments in the Mideast peace
process and the efforts being exerted by all parties concerned to
achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace in the region, Jordan`s
official news agency, the Petra, reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan stressed the importance of implementing the
Palestinian-Israeli Wye River agreement to push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos started his regional peace tour at a time when
Israeli government has suspended implementing the Wye peace accord
signed in October in Washington with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have accused the Palestinian self-rule authorities
of inciting violence in the West Bank. Under the accord, Israel
should hand over 13 percent more of the West Bank land to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The violence has been quickly spreading in the West Bank during
the past week which witnessed stoning passing motorists and clashes
between the Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops. At least
one has been killed and many injured during the confrontations
over the issue of release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, meanwhile, also expressed Jordan`s appreciation of the
EU`s role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived in Jordan earlier this week on a brief
visit. He is scheduled to visit other countries in the region
later.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Prince Escapes Car Accident in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The limousine of Japanese
Prince Tomohito, the nephew of Emperor Akihito, was hit by a van
on a Bangkok expressway Wednesday, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
The prince, who leads Japanese athletes in the 13th Asian
Games, left the Oriental Hotel at 9 a.m. local time and headed for
the Muang Thong Thani Sports Complex, north of Bangkok, to watch a
snooker tournament. His motorcade, comprising two Mercedes Benz
and a Toyota Sedan, was escorted by two police motorcycles and two
police cars.
</P>
<P>
The motorcade entered Bangkok's second-stage expressway system
at the Surawong toll plaza and came cross with a van at 9:15 a.m.
while building up speed at 200 meters, Thai News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The van braked suddenly, swerved toward the black Mercedes of
the prince, and hit the front-right mudguard of the limousine. The
police arrested the van driver, Cherdchai Pimpakham, 27, from
Kalasin province.
</P>
<P>
The driver said he was simply shocked on sight of the police
vehicles escorting the motorcade and applied a sudden brake before
losing control of his van.
</P>
<P>
The incident gave the Mercedes a minor dent and Prince
Tomohito's motorcade continued the trip. The policemen providing
the escort said the prince and his bodyguards did not mind what
had happened, considering it as an accident.

<HEADLINE> No Consensus Reached on Cambodia's Entry Into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of Singapore's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said here Wednesday that member
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
have not reached consensus on Cambodia's admission into the
grouping.
</P>
<P>
In a response to press queries, the spokesman, who did not
identify himself, said that divergent views have been expressed in
consultations between Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs
Shunmugam Jayakumar and his ASEAN colleagues on the timing of
Cambodia's admission into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"Some ASEAN foreign ministers would like to see Cambodia
admitted at the Hanoi summit (later this month)," the spokesman
said. "Others feel that while ASEAN should welcome the recent
developments in Cambodia as positive, ASEAN should not rush into
admitting Cambodia when key aspects of the agreement reached among
the parties in Cambodia have yet to be implemented."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Jayakumar wrote to his ASEAN
colleagues at the end of last week to report the outcome of his
consultations with other ASEAN foreign ministers in capacity as
chairman of the ASEAN standing committee on the Cambodia issue and
asked them to convey the outcome to their respective leaders.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that "the issue is not about whether
Cambodia should be admitted into ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
"That decision had already been taken by ASEAN and there is no
change to ASEAN's position," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is only one of timing, for example, whether Cambodia
should be admitted at the Hanoi summit," he explained further.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "there is therefore no consensus on this
issue and the ASEAN foreign ministers will continue their
discussion in Hanoi."
</P>
<P>
"If there is still no consensus, the next step would be for the
ASEAN leaders to consider the different views of the ASEAN foreign
ministers," the spokesman concluded.
</P>
<P>
In view of the political uncertainty in Cambodia in the past
year, ASEAN had decided not to discuss the issue of Cambodia's
admission into ASEAN until a new legitimate government was formed.
A week ago, Cambodia set up its new government, making great
progress toward national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans to Work Out Articles of Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Republicans of the U.S.
House of Representatives Judiciary Committee worked to complete
proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee started a two-day impeachment hearings
against Clinton Tuesday in relation to the Monic Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said the committee's Republicans
Wednesday hoped to finish "a working draft we can stand behind" of
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
In Judiciary Committee offices behind the hearing room, the
Republican staff -- with help from some members of Congress --
continued to rework draft language on three or four proposed
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Committee officials said a possible perjury article alleges
that Clinton testified falsely under oath, but doesn't spell out
each alleged lie.
</P>
<P>
There was a possibility the article could be separated into two
articles, one dealing with Clinton's deposition in the Jones case
and the other with his grand jury testimony, the sources said. One
source said the committee wanted to emphasize the grand jury
perjury allegation as the most serious charge.
</P>
<P>
However, The White House sought to win over Republican
moderates with a new, energetic defense. It summoned five former
federal prosecutor to testify before the committee Wednesday that
the case against Clinton was too weak to be pursued.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts New Policy on South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Wednesday announced new proposals to strengthen Europe's
relationship with South Korea and support economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said it adopted the new policy
document, entitled "European Union Policy Towards the Republic of
Korea," which sets out a guideline for EU-South Korea ties.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it was a good time to review EU policy because of
three developments in South Korea, including the start of major
economic reforms following the financial crisis and the election
of the reformist and former dissident, President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The EU also cited major progress in relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the development
of "constructive engagement" between South Korea and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The EU holds that despite its slide into recession, South Korea
remains one of Europe's major trading partners and Europe has
significant political and economic interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
The document sets out continued support for the economic reform
process undertaken by Kim and stresses the need for South Korea to
improve market access.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive agency, said that
it backed closer EU-South Korean cooperation to build worldwide
support for a new round of trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The document also endorsed the new South Korean policy of
seeking to diffuse tensions with the DPRK through "engagement with
the international community rather than isolation".

<HEADLINE> Weld Proposes Alternative to Impeachment against Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Massachusetts
Governor William Weld Wednesday suggested a series of alternatives
to impeachment against President Bill Clinton to preserve the
"dignity of the country."
</P>
<P>
"The most appropriate result is something other than removing
this person from his office," said Republican Weld, appearing
before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee as a
witness for Clinton in relation to the Monic Lewinsky affair. But
he said the situation "demands something more than merely
censure."
</P>
<P>
Even as Weld outlined his alternative, committee Chairman Henry
Hyde said Republicans hoped to complete proposed articles of
impeachment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Weld outlined "a five-part deal" to stop short of impeachment
that might appeal to his fellow Republican moderates in the House,
seen as swing votes on which any impeachment vote in the full
House hinges.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a vote of censure combined with: a written report
on Clinton's conduct; written acknowledgment of wrongdoing by the
president; a fine paid by Clinton; and leaving open the
possibility of criminal prosecution once Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
"It's a political suggestion, but this is in part a political
process," Weld said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman James Kennedy said Weld's proposed deal
was not something the White House knew about in advance or had
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Chief White House counsel Charles Ruff was to wrap up
Wednesday's committee hearing by focusing on evidence favorable to
Clinton that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr left out of his
report alleging impeachable conduct.
</P>
<P>
In Judiciary Committee offices behind the hearing room, the
Republican staff, with help from some members of Congress,
continued to rework draft language on three or four proposed
articles of impeachment.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Economy in Good Shape: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that his country's economy is now in good shape
and is continuing to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing a donors' conference in
the International Conference Center here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inflation control is one of the areas that can reflect the
government's achievement. Inflation rate was 240 percent in 1987
and is now 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's average economic growth rate has been 6.5 percent for
the last 11 years and this year the projected growth rate is
seven percent, one of the highest the world over, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
"We are now able to finance 100 percent of our recurrent
budget. The export earnings were 465 million U.S. Dollars in
1997/1998 and are projected to be 542 million Dollars in
1998/1999," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the total non-donor inflows into Uganda are now at
711 million Dollars and national reserves can fund imports for
4.9 months.
</P>
<P>
He attributed all these dramatic developments to
liberalization of economy, macro-economic stability, improvement
of infrastructure and introduction of the universal education.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is expected to ask for more than two billion Dollars
from donors in the next three years to support its socio-economic
development. It got more than 800 million Dollars from donors in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Mountainous Terrain Hampers Search for Crashed Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Mountainous terrain covered with
forests and snow has hampered efforts to find the possible crash
site of a Sukhoi Su-27 fighter that disappeared Wednesday over Russia's
far eastern territory of Khabarovsk.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of the Military Aviation Force Anatoly Kornukov
said the search would continue at daybreak Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said the aircraft had crashed into the ground, but
probably did not catch fire.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the pilot escaped and that we will find him," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Two An-12 military planes, two Mi-8 helicopters and an Il-18
plane participated in the search, the defense ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The fighter, piloted by Major Alexi Kitayev, was making a test
flight after it had had two engines replaced Komsomolsk-on-Amur.
</P>
<P>
"The radio location controllers watched the aircraft until the
very moment of its disappearance. The fighter was losing altitude
on the way to the airport from which it had taken off," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Su-27 is one of the most reliable and modern fighters
in the Russian air force. The former Soviet Union launched its
design work in 1969 to counter the F-15 fighter of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Mass production began in the mid-1980s. It is believed to be
the most powerful mass-produced aircraft in its class.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1988 it set 27 world records in climb velocity
and flight ceiling, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The Su-27 is manufactured in Komsomolsk-on-Amur and exported to
a dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted the defense ministry as describing December as
a bad month for the Russian air force.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, three Su-27 fighters from an elite air force
group crashed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, 1996, a MIG-25 fighter-bomber hit boulders
during takeoff and caught fire in Monchegorsk, northwest Russia.
</P>
<P>
One week later, an AN-12 transport plane crashed in Tver
region, northwest Russia, killing commander of the Leningrad
military district Sergei Seleznyov. The same day a MI-8
helicopter crashed in Malino near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, an AN-124 Ruslan transport plane carrying two
Su-27 fighters crashed in a residential area in Irkutsk, Siberia,
killing 72 people.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Hampers Uganda's Development: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni told a donors' conference here Wednesday that corruption
by the state officials is one impediment to more rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference attended by delegates from more
than 40 donor countries and agencies, Museveni said the
government is doing its best to uproot corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said:"By 1986, the state agencies of Uganda were not only
the epitome of corruption, but of the most despicable
criminality. Extra-judicial killings by state officials were a
daily occurrence."
</P>
<P>
It is his government that stopped extra-judicial killings by
taming the army. All the present developments, including the free
press and the fight against corruption by the public, is only
possible because of this decisive contribution by the National
Resistance Movement, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the problem of fighting corruption in
Uganda today is not lack of political will or institutions.
Attention should be directed to investigation, prosecution and
judgement, he added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government's single-minded struggle
against corruption can be seen in the way the government has
attempted to liquidate the biggest base of corruption-- the
parastatal sector that used to be a hot bed for embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
By privatizing 59 parastatals, "we have eliminated a large
base of corruption in addition to revamping and reviving the
economy," he said.

<HEADLINE>   Palestinian Youth Killed in West Bank Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- One Palestinian youth was
shot dead by Israeli soldiers during clashes Wednesday in the West
Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
This is the first death after days of clashes in the West
Bank between Palestinian protests and Israeli soldiers, sparked by
the dispute over Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
17-year-old Jaber Ayad, who came from the Palestinian village
of Silwad on the outskirt of the West Bank town of Ramallah,
was shot in the chest by a live bullet fired by Israeli soldiers
in violent clashes near Ramallah, local media reported. Scores of
otherreas, which was
intended to shore up the agreement signed in October between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Clashes also broke out in other West Bank towns and East
Jerusalem as Palestinians continued their demonstrations over the
prisoner issues and marked the 11th anniversary of their uprising
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The fatal incident and the start of a hunger strike by Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), were likely to trigger new violence.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have flared up in the West Bank in the last few days
because of a dispute over Israel's inclusion of 150 common
criminals in the first group of 250 Palestinian prisoners
freed in November in the first stage of the implementation of
the new interim deal.
</P>
<P>
Yassin began the hunger strike at his home in the Gaza
Strip to join the Palestinian protest over this issue.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Israel had made a verbal promise
during the talks in the U.S. that all 750 prisoners due to be
released according to the agreement will be political detainees,
those who took part in anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insisted that it had never agreed to release
those with "blood on their hands" or members of militant groups
like Hamas, accusing the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of
encouraging the violence.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, who was in the region in
preparation for the Clinton's visit, which starts Saturday night,
urged the two sides to resolve their difference through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner issue is highly emotional because it touches
nearly all Palestinian families. Almost every family has had a
member or relative arrested at some point since 1967, when Israel
seized the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel said last week that it will not carry out the upcoming
troop withdrawal in the West Bank until the Palestinians stop
pressing for the release of political prisoners and pledge not to
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, when the
interim period stipulated in the Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
Washington rejects the new conditions and called on the two
sides to adhere to the timetable set in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of his Fatah movement being held in the West Bank
town of Hebron, PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that
Israel has no right to stop the Palestinians from declaring an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
He also reportedly praised the Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails are "our heroes."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians staged a general strike to mark
the 11th anniversary of the intifada, or uprising. A commentary
carried by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, the
official Palestinian news service, said that the uprising has
showed that the only solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
is "the mutual recognition."

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Predicts World Illiteracy Rate Will Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one-sixth of the
5.9 billion people in the world cannot read or write, according to
a survey published here on Wednesday by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The study predicts that illiteracy rates will steadily grow
into the next century because one of every four children in the
poorest nations is now in school. More than half those denied
educations are girls, UNICEF said in its annual report, "The State
of the World's Children 1998."
</P>
<P>
The study found worsening educational conditions in the former
Soviet Union, where levels had been high.
</P>
<P>
Apart from deepening divisions between rich computerized
societies and those without even the rudimentary tools of
knowledge in the third world, the report says, illiteracy has a
direct relationship to important health indicators and fertility
rates.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming percentage of illiterates are in countries
with high population growth like India and Pakistan, where
better education for women and children could significantly
reduce other problems, the report said.

<HEADLINE> More Protection From Bankruptcy Bill Urged in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's senators have urged
the government to ensure that the proposed bankruptcy bill give
more protection to debtors, Thai News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Senators' Committee studying the government's economic
rehabilitation bills have found that the bankruptcy bill set the
overdue debt amount of an individual at only 500,000 baht (13,888
U.S. dollars) and that of a juristic body at only one million baht
(27,777 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Paisarn Kumanvisai was quoted as saying the
"too low" minimum debt level would easily force debtors to face
bankruptcy lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Their financial problems might be only a certain level of
liquidity problems but did not deserve a bankruptcy fate, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The panel wants to increase the minimum debt amounts by 10
times for each category.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy bill, along with 10 other bills, has passed the
first reading in the government and is waiting approval from the
parliament. The opposition parties criticized the bills which they
said would allow foreigners to buy too much local assets thus
losing control of the economy.

Speaking to the press, Butler, Executive Chairman of the

inspection was illegitimate are simply unacceptable, against the
law, that is the resolutions of the Untied Nations Security Council."

Butler said "Iraq had asked us to give them a list of what we

of course we did not so."

He said he had spoken by telephone with the the chief
inspector in the field several times during the course of the

<HEADLINE> No Decision Yet on Military Action in Comoros: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- No decision has yet been
made to intervene militarily in the Comoro Islands, Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force is the last possible consideration," South
African Press Association quoted him as saying in Pretoria,
capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the type of action to be taken would be determined
by the feedback of an OAU fact-finding mission led by South
Africa, which arrived in the Comoros earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of this mission is to make a proper,
professional assessment of the situation and examine all the
options on how to assist in the restoration of the normal
situation in Anjouan and how to end the current state of
affairs," said the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
A militia faction has seized control of the capital of the
breakaway Comoran island of Anjouan, where summary executions,
looting and burning have followed three days of fierce fighting
since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out after supporters of self-styled Anjouan
"prime minister" Abdou Mohamed tried to assassinate "president"
Abdallah Ibraham, who reportedly wanted to rejoin the federal
Comoro state.
</P>
<P>
The Anjouan island unilaterally declared independence in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Expressing grave concern at the state of affairs, Salim said
many people have been killed or injured, and thousands more have
been displaced.
</P>
<P>
"What has disturbed us, is the extent of the violence that has
taken place, the extent of casualties inflicted on ordinary
people, and the extent of polarization which has taken place on
the island," he noted.
</P>
<P>
OAU received a number of appeals for intervention from the
Comoran government. Salim said the developments in the Comoros
were of great concern to African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU mission should have arrived at Moroni, the
capital of the Comoros, by about noon. It comprised about 10
senior military and security officials from Kenya, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa, led by South Africa's
Brigadier-General Jan Lusse. The mission should last 72 hours at
most.
</P>
<P>
On their return to South Africa, the delegates would report
back to South Africa, which was the coordinator of efforts to
secure peace in the Comoros. South Africa, in turn, would report
to the OAU, after which African leaders would decide what the
next step should be.
</P>
<P>
Salim arrived in South Africa Sunday night, coinciding with
the outbreak of violence in Anjouan.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he had held consultations with the South African
government and representatives of countries in the region about
ways to achieve peace and stability in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the matter would be high on the agenda of a meeting
of the OAU's conflict resolution organ in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, next Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Wednesday urged the business community and public sector to be
committed to the highest standards of environmental performance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Half Yearly
Dinner, Tung said that a strong economy for the future needs a
good environment to support that economy.
</P>
<P>
"Without a healthy environment, we don't have a healthy
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He outlined all the actions that the SAR government is taking
to improve the environment and the vision that the government is
working to achieve.
</P>
<P>
These include the improvement of water quality, sewage
treatment and food safety as well as solution to the air pollution
problem and better arrangements for waste management.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "Our objective is to provide healthy living
conditions for the growing population of our territory, while
reducing the impact each of us has on the waters and coastal areas
that are so important to the economy and to our enjoyment of our
city."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a strong economy for the future also needs a
society in which ambitions for economic progress are matched with
understanding of the environmental dangers that the people face.

<HEADLINE> French Far-right National Front Faced with Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- France's far-right National Front
is faced with split as the party's number two Bruno Megret openly
challenged the party's number one Jean Marie Le Pen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Megret joined a growing number of party members by
calling for the holding of a special congress to resolve the
disputes within the party which came down from his power struggle
with Jean-Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen has rejected the proposal to hold such a congress.
</P>
<P>
Megret rejected the idea of resigning from the party, as was
suggested by the daughter of Le Pen, Marie Caroline Le Pen, who
urged him to either disown rebels or face consequences.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen dismissed several of Megret's supporters and one of his
own loyalist in the past week, accusing them of a "coup" against
him.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Megret, 49, called for the holding of a congress of
"unity and renewal" in January to "democratically" solve the
problem within the party.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between the 70-year-old Le Pen and Megret came up
since Megret suggested leading the party in the 1999 European
elections, if Le Pen was unable to run for the election because of
legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
The National Front, which is France's third largest party, has
been gaining votes from French voters because of its
anti-immigrant and national preference policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Endeavour's astronauts
gave the new up-and-running space station a safe and higher orbit
Tuesday, said the Washington Post Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts fired the shuttle thrusters to climb to an
altitude of about 248 miles, 5.5 miles higher than before.
</P>
<P>
NASA wants to leave the international space station in as
high an orbit as possible, because spacecraft gradually sink
owing to the atmospheric drag and need to be boosted periodically.
</P>
<P>
The seven-story, 35-ton station swung a foot back and forth
in Edneavour's cargo bay, its solar wings flapping, as the
shuttle moved higher and higher. The astronauts kept close watch
on the quivering stack during 20-minute ride.

ATHENS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov on Wednesday called for the early
presidential elections in Russia, saying that the call for the
elections had now ripened.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his Greek counterpart, Aleka
Papariga, Zyuganov said that the Russian Communist Party had
restructured and was now the best organized party in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said that he was optimistic about the result of the
presidential elections, regardless of when they were held.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party was cooperating with the new government
led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
But before the elections could take place, he said, reforms had
to be introduced to the electoral law and constitution.
</P>
<P>
The communist leader also criticized the United States,
charging that Washintong's influence during the past few years on
President Boris Yeltsin and his associates had been disastrous for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, who arrived here on Wednesday for the first ever
visit, discussed with Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Secretary
General Papariga and Honorary President Harilaos Florakis
relations between the two parties, the situation in the Balkan
region and developments in Russia.

<P>
LUANDA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister
Venancio da Silva Moura complained here Wednesday that the U.N.
Security Council standing committee members have not put due
pressure to force the opposition UNITA to comply with the Lusaka
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), has not shown any
respect for the relevant Security Council resolutions, is due to
lack of pressure, Moura said while meeting with Britain's new
ambassador to Angola, Carolinne Elmes.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also briefed the ambassador on Angola's
new stand, which is no more negotiation with Savimbi. Meanwhile,
Moura asked the standing committee members of the Security
Council, including Britain, to follow the steps of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and recognize the UNITA
Renovation Committee as the only legitimate dialogist on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moura reiterated the necessity of international support for
the Renovation Committee, saying the splinter group which uphold
peace and democracy as its ideal are genuine patriots.
</P>
<P>
Only if the government cooperates with these people, could it
accomplish the final tasks stipulated by the Lusaka Protocol and
achieve national reconciliation and lasting peace in the southern
African country, he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade current
account deficit hit a new high of 61.3 billion U.S. dollars in the
third quarter of this year, a fourth consecutive record, the
Commerce Department reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit rose 8.1 percent in the third quarter as compared
with a deficit of 56.7 billion dollars in the second quarter,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This constituted the fourth straight quarterly record for the
current account, the broadest measure of the country's
international trade, which tracks not only trade in goods and
services but also investment flows and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the U.S. economy overall has continued
growing at a steady pace amidst the financial chaos in foreign
markets, the U.S. manufacturers and farmers have been apparently
affected negatively.
</P>
<P>
The current-account deficit is on its way to a record high of
220 billion dollars, far surpassing last year's deficit of 155.2
billion dollars and could easily top the previous record of 168
billion dollars set in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Namibian PM Calls for Peaceful Solution to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob appealed Wednesday for peaceful solution to the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"We have meager resources... We support efforts for peace,"
Geingob said, pressing for immediate ceasefire in the war-torn
central African country, where rebels are fighting to topple the
government of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Dar es Salaam
International Airport before winding up a three-day official
visit to Tanzania, Geingob said, "There should be territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
"We have to respect the governments which are in power," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Geingob, however, did not mention Namibian troops in DRC which
are fighting along with the DRC government army against rebels
allegedly backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, the Namibian Prime Minister held
official talks with his Tanzanian counterpart Frederick Sumaye,
visited Dar es Salaam Harbor, Zanzibar isles, paid a courtesy
call on President Benjamin Mkapa and attended celebrations for
the 37th anniversary of Tanzania national independence.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued Wednesday between the two prime
ministers said the two sides have reviewed progress toward
resolving the current conflicts in the DRC, Angola, Lesotho,
Comoros, Burundi, Somalia, Sudan as well as the border dispute
between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"They noted that the on-going conflicts could further
destabilize the African continent and cause untold loss of human
lives, misery and wanton destruction of socio-economic
infrastructure," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers urged all parties to the conflicts to
commit themselves to "all peaceful overtures aimed at resolving
these conflicts," it said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, Geingob told reporters that Namibia
will learn experiences from Tanzania in developing tourism, and
exchange expertise and establish joint ventures for fisheries.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed wishes to speed up cooperation in the
sectors identified in the Agreement Establishing the
Namibia-Tanzania Joint Permanent Commission on Co-operation
signed in April of 1991 in Dar es Salaam.

<HEADLINE> Adoption of Declaration Is a Milestone in History: GA Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights half a century ago was not
only a "giant step forward" in the protection of human rights, but
also "a milestone in the history of the advance of civilization,"
the president of the 53rd General Assembly (GA) session, Didier
Opertti of Uruguay, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
constituted not only a giant step forward in the development of
the system for protection of human rights, but above all a
milestone in the history of the advance of civilization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in a message issued Wednesday on the
occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"This advance, nevertheless, cannot obscure the fact that we
are still very far from attaining the goal of full enjoyment of
his or her rights by each individual on the planet," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a vast amount of work to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The system for protection of human rights instituted following
the adoption of the Universal Declaration has brought with it an
improvement in the living conditions of thousands, perhaps
millions, of people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But many regions of the world are still faced with the brutal
reality of populations, groups and individuals who are victims of
intolerance, discrimination and prejudice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adopted in the aftermath of the World War II, the declaration
was intended to prevent a repetition of the horrors of the
Holocaust and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the pronouncement that "all human beings are
born free and equal in dignity and rights," the U.N. document set
out to cover the range of human existence. It has become at once
the most quoted international document of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Central Bank Announces Cuts in Key Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Greece, the
country's central bank, on Wednesday announced reduction in three
key interest rates, signalling that rates across the board will
decline.
</P>
<P>
The central bank cut the lombard rate, which shows a
longer-term trend, to 15.50 percent from the current rate of 16.00
percent. It also lowered two working rates in the domestic money
market, indicating that rates on a day-to-day basis will decline.
</P>
<P>
The rate on two-week interbank deposits, which the central bank
often uses as an intervention in Wednesday tenders and signals the
outlook for rates, dropped by 50 basis points to 12.25 percent
from 12.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The overnight rate in the interbank market, which is a gauge of
liquidity in the interbank system and may also be used as an
intervention, fell to 11.60 percent from 11.90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Greece, the country's largest commercial
bank, was the first to follow suit, also announcing reductions in
lending rates between 0.50-3.55 percentage points and a 0.25
percentage point reduction in deposit interest rates, as well as a
series of new products in home loans and financing for
developmental schemes in both drachma and euro.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Emergent Aids to Angolan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations food agency
Wednesday called upon the international community to make an
emergent aid of 66.7 million U.S. Dollars to some three million
Angolans affected by the military conflicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan News Agency (ANGOP), spokesman of the
World Food Program (WFP), Christiane Berthiaume, said in Geneva
that people in half of Angola can not have access to the
international humanitarian aids as the conflict in the country is
intensifying.
</P>
<P>
Berthiaume noted that the road traffic has been cut off in
these areas with more than one-third of the Angolan population,
citing that many parts of the highway linking coastal city of
Lobito and central province of Huambo have been destroyed by the
troops of the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The provincial capital city of Huambo has been out of touch
with the outside by road, said the spokesman, adding that its
200,000 residents are in need of aids.
</P>
<P>
However, the strengthened airlifting can only provide some 20
percent of the materials needed.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-November, the Angolan government troops have
launched attacks at the UNITA-controlled areas in the provinces
of Huanbo and Bie.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. military observers evacuated from those
areas, fierce fightings are still going on around the cities of
Bailundo and Andulo where the UNITA is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that due to the escalating conflicts, the
number of the Angolan refugees has increased by 400,000 this year
to reach 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are living without guaranteed daily necessities.
As early as in May this year, the WFP estimated that some 470,000
tons of grain would be needed in 1998/99, 120,000 tons of which
would be urgently delivered by the international community.

UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Administrator of
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), James Gustave
Speth, will represent U.N. chief Kofi Annan at a Consulative Group
Meeting for the Reconstruction of Central America on December 10
to 11 in Washington, UNDP said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be hosted by the Inter-American Development
Bank and participants will discuss wide-ranging measures for
relief and recovery for victims of hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
At the Washington meeting, the U.N. Economic Commission for
Latin America will present an initial assessment of damage
caused by hurricane Mitch in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras
and Nicaragua. The assessment was financed by UNDP.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission, nearly half a million people are
still living in shelters in the four countries, and 9,146 are
still missing. The official death toll resulting from the
hurricane currently stands at 9,028.
</P>
<P>
The Commission estimates the direct and indirect cost of
damage cause by the hurricane Mitch at 5.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
UNDP has already appealed to the international community for
25.5 million dollars for housing, temporary shelters and
education for the population hardest hit by the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Is One of Most Corrupt Countries: World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is one of most corrupt
countries in the world, a World Bank (WB) report has said.
</P>
<P>
According to the WB report presented to a donors' conference
being held here, petty corruption is rampant in the land-locked
country and, in the opinion of most people, growing.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the National Integrity Survey as saying that
the very agencies that should be in the forefront of the
anti-corruption struggle -- the police and the judiciary -- are
perceived to be the most corrupt public institutions with which
the general public has contact.
</P>
<P>
According to Transparency International's annual Corruption
Perception Index where the rankings represent the average of
perceptions of a country in the minds of the international
business community, Uganda ranks among the 15 most corrupt in the
total of 85 countries chosen for investigation.
</P>
<P>
It said lack of experience of local officials and a poorly
informed citizenry can lead to mistakes and abuses.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the procurement system suffers from severe
weaknesses. Over 90 percent of the complaints received by the
government relate to procurement, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that diversion and misuse of public funds
amounts to as much as 10 to 20 percent of expenditures, the
report warned.

<HEADLINE> Israel's High Court nullifies Army Exemptions for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) - Israel's High Court Wednesday
nullified the current arrangement that grants army exemptions to
ultra-Orthodox Jewish men of the country.
</P>
<P>
A 11-judge panel of the High Court ruled that the
arrangement dating from the establishment of Israel is "illegal"
and can not be in force.
</P>
<P>
The panel ordered the Knesset (parliament) to amend the
arrangement and work out a new one in a year. Otherwise, the
panel said the current arrangement will automatically become null
and void.
</P>
<P>
There are about 30,000 students in Israel who get monthly
stipend from the government and study in the religious
seminaries, but have been exempted from being drafted into
the army.
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that since the religious students are not
allowed to work they have become a financial burden to the
state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman welcomed the ruling and urged
the ultra-Orthodox leaders to accept the national service.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for a
compromise that would be supported by both the secular and the
ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing parties presenting the ultra-Orthodox have
threatened to topple the government if any change was made
to the current exemption arrangement.
</P>
<P>
And the ultra-Orthodox leaders rejected Wednesday's ruling,
saying they will fight it in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
that he will obey the ruling, noting he will ask the ministry's
officials to study the ruling and draw recommendations before the
Knesset begin to deal with the issue.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Concerns on Falling Oil Prices Dominate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Oil price slump and its
economic impact dominated the three-day 19th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council which ended here Wednesday. The Gulf leaders
decided to continue with oil output cuts until the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the summit, the leaders
also called on other oil producers to follow suit and said the
Gulf countries are ready to cooperate with them to stabilize the
oil market it they agree to abide by already pledged cuts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the summit was held at a time when the oil prices
hit a historic low of less than 10 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The six Gulf oil-producing nations, namely, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
have been hit hard by the sharp decline in prices.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and the leading
power in the GCC, had originally projected a budget deficit of
4.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, but analysts predict the
deficit will reach 15 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The projected increases in the GCC budget deficit are
expected to leave a negative impact on the economies of the
six member states whose oil earnings account for about
three-quarters of their revenues.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz rang the alarm bells
at the summit when he said the boom days of easy petrodollars are
gone forever.
</P>
<P>
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has imposed
two rounds of output cuts this year, which have failed to stop
the flagging trend of oil prices. The oil prices now on average
are running lower than at any time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in GCC's 18-year history, leaders from
outside the bloc were invited to attend the summit. U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan, South African President Nelson Mandela and
some other leaders took part in the summit opening ceremony. They
were apparently invited to give weight to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf leaders also urged Iraq to respect all
U.N. resolutions and blamed the Iraqi government for the
sufferings of its people under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The summit took place at the end of a year in which the Iraq
arms crisis has twice come close to military conflicts, the first
in February and the other just last month.
</P>
<P>
Iraq narrowly averted U.S. military strikes in November in a
last-minute decision to resume cooperation with U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) for Iraqi disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Iran, the Gulf leaders in their communique called
on Tehran to withdraw from three strategic islands also claimed
by the GCC member UAE.
</P>
<P>
The GCC urged Iran to halt its "occupation of the islands of
Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and its policy of fait
accompli," the leaders said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders added they welcomed the efforts of U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to open negotiations between the UAE and Iran
on the three islands.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders expressed their keenness to encourage
investment and enhance the role of the private sector in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
They noted that agreement on a long-delayed GCC customs
tariffs as a step to unify Gulf economies should be completed
by December 1990.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Plane Crisis Over: Security Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian flight-hijacking
crisis ended when the plane landed in Tunisia and passengers
aboard left the airliner peacefully, a security source at Cairo
international airport said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot is contacting Tunisian authorities to see if he can
fly the plane back to Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
quoted the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The MD-90 plane owned by the Egyptian AMC company was
hijacked by two masked men shortly after the flight took off
from Yemen for Tunisian capital Tunis.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 150 Libyan, Yemeni and Tunisian passengers
on board at the time.
</P>
<P>
The two masked men demanded the plane fly to Libya's Tripoli
airport, apparently violating a U.N. flight ban against
Libya. They were later joined by more Libyan passengers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1992 to
force Libya to turn over two Libyans suspected of blowing up the
Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, however, managed to land at an airport on the island
of Jerba, 350 kilometers south of Tunis.
</P>
<P>
Jerba is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going
on to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the passengers got off the plane, complaining of
exhaustion, while many others remained on board demanding that the
aircraft be refueled and fly to Libya. But they left the aircraft
later without further trouble.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Libyan and Yemeni passengers carried daggers, a
custom among men in the two countries, the agency said. But no
violence against the crew was reported, it added.
</P>
<P>
No other details were available and it was not clear if any of
the passengers was detained.

coordinate stances on key issues in the Arab world.

WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Henry Hyde, chairman of the
U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said he would
give dissenting Democrats a committee vote on a proposal for
censure instead of impeachment against President Bill Clinton in
relation to the Monic Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to have a vote on a resolution for censure,"
Hyde told reporters as he stepped outside the hearing room where
the White House continued to present its two-day defense of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Hyde also said he intends to talk to Republican colleagues in
the House about the case against the president, but would not
lobby them to support impeachment. His message will be to "keep
their powder dry" until they have all the facts, the chairman
added.
</P>
<P>
Hyde made his comments as the White House seemed to be gaining
modest ground in the effort to head off impeachment in the full
House. Amo Houghton, a moderate Republican lawmaker, announced he
would oppose impeachment and support censure of the president.
</P>
<P>
White House aides hoped other moderate lawmakers would follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
Hyde's decision to allow a vote on censure in committee was
deemed as a gesture, since majority Republicans are certain to
defeat it on a party-line vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Thomas Miller, the U.S. state
Department Coordinator for Cyprus, will pay a 24-hour visit to
Cyprus on Thursday to "evaluate the situation" on the island,
reliable sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cyprus, Miller is scheduled to have a
meeting with U.N. Resident Representative Dame Ann Hercus to
discuss "matters of mutual interests", according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Hercus embarked on shuttle talks between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides in mid-October, in a bid to resume talks and reduce
tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
Miller will leave Friday for contacts in Athens before
flying on to Istanbul, to attend a meeting of businessmen from
Cyprus, Greece and Turkey, which U.S. Presidential
Emissary on Cyprus Richard Holbrooke will also participate.
</P>
<P>
Miller's visit comes at a time when speculation is rampant here
that efforts are being made to try and sort out the problem of
the deployment of Russian anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense,
a move rejected by Turkey which has threatened to launch
preemptive strike on the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and others have voiced their opposition
to the deployment of the missiles and U.S. ambassador in
Nicosia, Kenneth Brill, said the U.S. would be ready to discss
the deployment of the missiles anywhere but Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Russia has made representations over Brill's statements, saying
that the Russian government will honor the missile contract it
has signed with the Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns Israeli Mock Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Wednesday strongly
condemned Israel's mock air raids on its several major cities
earlier in the day, appealing for intervention by an
international cease-fire committee.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter-bombers Wednesday morning swooped low over
Beirut and the country's southern cities of Sidon, Tyre, Nabatiyeh
and Iqlim Toufah area. Resounding sonic booms shattered windows of
buildings, sending fearful residents running into basements or
shelter.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn Israeli aggressive and provocative acts
against Lebanon. We called on April Understanding Committee to
look into what Israel has done today," said Salim Hoss, Lebanon's
prime minister-designate.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation committee, comprising the United States,
French, Syrian, Lebanese and Israeli officers, was set up to
supervise the cease-fire between Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.- brokered truce was reached in April 1996 after an
Israeli air and artillery attack on Lebanon which killed nearly
200 Lebanese, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been spearheading a
guerrilla war to try to oust the Israeli-occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
Hoss told reporters that Lebanese new government will not be
puzzled by Israeli violence and will continue its cause to
liberate south Lebanon from Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
Newly elected President Emile Lahoud was sworn in on November
24. He appointed Hoss to form a next government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri also denounced Israeli mock
air raids, saying its escalating violence against Lebanon is
nothing but an attempt to disturb Lebanon's process to rebuild
itself from the devastating 15-year-old civil war, and to escalate
the tension in the region.

<HEADLINE> China Has Religious Freedom: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The policy on religious freedom
is not only guaranteed by the Chinese Constitution, but it is
being well implemented as a whole, President of China Christian
Council Han Wenzao said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenzao made the remarks on the church situation in China
while attending the Eighth Assembly of the World Council of
Churches in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said, "you can see this from the growth and vitality of our
churches. We had only 700,000 Christians in 1949, but now we have
more than 12 million."
</P>
<P>
"In 1979, we had only three churches throughout China. But we
now have over 13,000 and new churches are opening at the rate of
three every two days. In addition, we have over 35,000 meeting
points or Christian home meetings, mainly in rural areas," Han
said.
</P>
<P>
The council president said books on religion have been put out
in great numbers, and since 1980, 23 million copies of Bibles
have been printed and distributed. "We have also emphasized
theological training. In 1980, we opened our first theological
seminary, but now we are having 20 seminaries and Bible schools."
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the Chinese government has adopted the policy of
"internal reform and opening to the outside world", he noted,
adding that "this policy allows us to develop ecumenical
relationships with churches all over the world."
</P>
<P>
He denied "religious persecution" in China, but admitted
individual cases. "there is no general persecution of religion in
China. However, because our country is so vast, one cannot expect
government policies to be consistently implemented everywhere and
all of the time, and this includes the policy of religious
freedom. individual violations of religious freedom do occur,
especially at the grass-roots level.
</P>

<P>
All border posts had been checked, and no records existed of
Banana entering or leaving South Africa, Interpol executive

<HEADLINE> Uganda Is One of Most Corrupt Countries: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is one of most corrupt
countries in the world, a World Bank (WB) report has said.
</P>
<P>
According to the WB report presented to a donors' conference
being held here, petty corruption is rampant in the land-locked
country and, in the opinion of most people, growing.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the National Integrity Survey as saying that
the very agencies that should be in the forefront of the
anti-corruption struggle -- the police and the judiciary -- are
perceived to be the most corrupt public institutions with which
the general public has contact.
</P>
<P>
According to Transparency International's annual Corruption
Perception Index where the rankings represent the average of
perceptions of a country in the minds of the international
business community, Uganda ranks among the 15 most corrupt in the
total of 85 countries chosen for investigation.
</P>
<P>
It said lack of experience of local officials and a poorly
informed citizenry can lead to mistakes and abuses.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the procurement system suffers from severe
weaknesses. Over 90 percent of the complaints received by the
government relate to procurement, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that diversion and misuse of public funds
amounts to as much as 10 to 20 percent of expenditures, the
report warned.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears New Policy on South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Wednesday announced its new proposals to strengthen Europe's
relationship with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said it adopted the new Communication,
a kind of shaped policy or strategy, entitled "European Union
Policy Towards the Republic of Korea", which sets out a
comprehensive new strategy for relations between the European
Union (EU) and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it believes now it is a good time to review EU
policy because of three developments in South Korea: first, the
start of major economic reforms following the financial crisis;
second, the election of the reformist and former dissident
President Kim in December 1997; and third, major progress in
relations with Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and
the development of "constructive engagement".
</P>
<P>
The EU also holds that despite its slide into recession, South
Korea remains one of the EU's major trading partners and Europe
has significant political and economic interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Communication sets out continued support for the economic
reform process undertaken by President Kim and stresses the need
for South Korea to improve market access.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said it backs closer EU-South Korean
cooperation to build worldwide support for a new round of trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Communication also endorsed the new South Korean policy of
seeking to diffuse tensions with the DPRK through "engagement with
the international community rather than isolation", said the
European Commission, the EU's executive agency.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tripartite Meeting Bogged Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Apparent mistrust among members
of the Zimbabwean National Tripartite Committee bogged down
Wednesday morning's meeting, resulting in matters on the agenda
being rescheduled till Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of labor, business and government argued over
the agenda, with the government pushing for debate on the social
contract while the other two partners demanded that
macro-economic issues be discussed first, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Labor and business presented to the meeting a number of issues
on national economic performance to which they sought information
from the government.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues the other two parties wanted to discuss was
the action being taken by the government to stabilize the local
currency suffering heavy battering on the foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar is presently under-valued by more than
60 percent, negatively affecting imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Demands were also made on the government delegation to provide
information on the cost of Zimbabwe's involvement in the war in
the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwe sent troops since
August to fight on the side of President Laurent Kabila against
rebels backed by Rwandans and Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Florence
Chitauro, who chaired the meeting, said most of the information
related to the Ministry of Finance could be answered by Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa who was not at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A paper on the importance of the social contract was presented
at the meeting, after which it was agreed that a nine-member task
team would be set up to draft specific clauses of the contract.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Green Paper on Radio Spectrum Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) had
adopted a Green paper aimed at launching a broad debate on the
definition of a radio spectrum policy, the European Commission
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Green Paper asks a number of questions in order to help EU
to find appropriate solutions to new policy and regulatory issues.
Under the Green Paper, a debate will be launched among all
concerned parties including industry, consumers, non-commercial
users and public authorities.
</P>
<P>
The commission, EU's executive body, said comments will be
expected by April 15, 1999, which will be taken up in the context
of the foreseen 1999 review of the EU telecommunications
regulatory framework.
</P>
<P>
Radio spectrum is the wireless infrastructure for a large
number of activities including telecommunications, broadcasting,
transport, research and public services. Each radio application,
for example garage door openers, baby monitors, cellular
telephones, global positioning systems, has its own frequency band
within the radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Actual use and demand for certain frequency bands have created
a situation of congestion because demand for frequencies is much
greater than what is available. This is mainly due to the
globalization of services and players, the increasing number of
commercial and public applications and easier access to frequency
spectrum with digital technologies.
</P>
<P>
A number of EU policies rely on the availability of radio
spectrum, the commission said, the political and legal context of
these policies, however, differs significantly from sector to
sector.
</P>
<P>
Considering that demand for certain frequency bands exceeds
supply, the implementation of these policies is faced with the
situation where radio spectrum availability can no longer be taken
for granted. Therefore, the commission said, it needs to be
addressed as a key issue.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arms Inspection Modalities Being Challenged: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Modalities of U.N. arms
inspections in Iraq is being challenged by the U.N. Special
Commission that oversees the Iraqi disarmament (UNSCOM), says a
senior Iraqi official on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Modalities of inspections is the most important issue now,
and it is a very principle issue, because the position of the
UNSCOM is that these modalities are no more valid," said Amir
Mohammed Rasheed, Iraqi oil minister, at a press conference on
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister stressed that these modalities "are valid
and they are well endorsed in the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Iraqi government and the U.N. Secretary-General
and there has been no challenge to this before. "
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an incident that occurred on Wednesday
morning that a U.N. arms inspection team was refused to conduct a
surprise visit to a regional headquarters of the Ruling Baath
Party, which is a small building inside Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said that "it is really not a sensitive site, it is a
private site, because it is non-official, it is a party belonging
to the people, We have such a modality for private sites."
</P>
<P>
So the Iraqis accompany the team asked the chief Inspector (CI)
of the team to adopt modalities of sensitive sites. However the CI
said 'I am sorry, I will not adopt the modalities for sensitive
sites, I am adopting Butler's modalities, '" the minister revealed
the details.
</P>
<P>
"To facilitate and not to create problems and not to give
justification, because we know this is the objective of the
Special Commission, specially by (UNSCOM Chairman Richard) Butler
and his deputy to create problems, the Iraqi minder allowed the CI
and three of the inspectors, according to the sensitive sites
modalities, to enter the small building," he went on.
</P>
<P>
The four inspectors entered the building, said Rasheed, adding
that "when they came back, it seems that they have had contact
with New York, they insisted that all the 12 inspectors should
enter that building. but the Iraqi minder rejected their demand."
</P>
<P>
The oil minister, who participated many previous talks between
Iraqi side and UNSCOM, accused UNSCOM of endeavoring to take
actions to promote or generate crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
He said that "on the first day of the arrival of the
above-mentioned team two days ago, we have informed the CI that we
would cooperate fully, we would facilitate all the surprise
inspections."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister said the Iraqi side had made it clear to the
CI if he wanted to visit sensitive sites, he should follow the
agreement of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Iraqi
government and UNSCOM in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
In response, the CI said that to his understanding these
modalities for the inspections for sensitive sites "are no more
valid," said Rasheed.
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum of Understanding between the Iraqi government
and the U.N. secretary-general on February 23, 1998 has two
aspects: UNSCOM has the right to have non-notice inspections to
any sites on the one hand, and on the other hand, UNSCOM has to
respect the security and dignity and legitimate concerns of the
Iraqi government, said Rasheed.

ties with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Darwish, World Bank deputy president for the Middle East
and North Africa, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency the bank
has provide to Egypt 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in long-term loans
since 1970. The loans were used in the country's education,
agriculture, industrial training and health care.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also planned to supply Egypt with a further 500
million dollars to finance its projects in education, health
services and other areas, Darwish said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the World Bank, alongside the International Monetary
Fund, sponsored for the country a three-phased economic reform
program for a period from 1991 to 1998, which has significantly
promoted Egypt's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Darwish is here for talks with Egyptian officials on continuing
bilateral cooperation and attending a forum organized by the bank
on economic trends in the Middle East and the Arab region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt is, to a large extent, unaffected by the
financial turmoil in Southeast Asia due to its limited foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development last month said the foreign investments in Egypt stood
at 834 million dollars in 1997.

WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese scientists at Kinki
University in Nara, Japan, have cloned eight calves from a single
adult cow, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newly cloned calves are not the first to be grown from

</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese scientists used so-called cumulus cells
taken from a cow's ovaries or skin cells taken from that cow's
fallopian tubes -- a kind of cell never before used for cloning.
</P>
<P>
They placed those cells in laboratory dishes, each one resting
alongside a cow's egg cell whose own genetic material had been
removed. An electrical shock forced each pair of cells to fuse
into one. Mysterious natural compounds inside the egg cells
"erased" the genetic memories of the donor cells, making each
donor cell "forget" it was an ovarian cell and begin to divide as
though it were part of a newly developing embryo.
</P>
<P>
Two by two, 10 such embryos were transferred from their dishes
into five surrogate mother cows. Eight developed to maturity and
were born, seven naturally and one by Cesarean section. Four died
soon after birth from infections and other "environmental" causes,
but all appeared normal.
</P>
<P>
They had another batch of clones developing now, made from
liver, kidney and heart cells, with births expected in the spring,
the Japanese scientists said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Arab League to Help Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf on Wednesday urged the Arab League (AL)
to seriously help lift the eight-year-old U.N. economic sanctions
imposed on his country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to AL Secretary-General Esmat Abdul Majeed,
Sahhaf stressed "all Iraqis demand that AL fulfill its national
obligations and provisions of AL Charter" to help lift
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister wrote in the letter that the Iraqi people
have been suffering for eight years because of the unjust
U.N. sanctions and despite the fact that Iraq has fulfilled all
its obligations toward relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"There are certain political motives behind the prolongation
of these sanctions on Iraq," asserted Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have caused and are still causing tremendous
harm to the people of Iraq, children, women and the elderly
in particular, said Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of medicine and food, widespreading diseases and
malnutrition have increased the mortality rate," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said the AL secretary-general and some Arab officials
had expressed solidarity with Iraq and its people, but he
stressed it is time for them to translate their words into sincere
efforts to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted unless U.N. arms inspectors
verify that it is free of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> "Iron Lady" Thatcher Condemns Latest Pinochet Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Former United Kingdom Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher Wednesday attacked Home Secretary Jack
Straw's decision to let extradition moves against former Chilean
Leader Augusto Pinochet go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"He had ample power to end this shameful and damaging episode.
He has chosen instead to prolong it," Thatcher, who was famous for
her staffness when serving as British Prime Minister, told the
Press Association in London.
</P>
<P>
The former Conservative Party leader, who was ousted after 11
years as premier in 1990, said Home Secretary (Interior Minister)
Straw made a "grave mistake."
</P>
<P>
"This was a political decision," she said.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher had invited Pinochet to tea at her London home just
nine days before the 83-year-old general was surprisingly arrested
while recovering from a back surgery in a hospital in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Chile supported Britain during the 1982 Malvinas (Falklands)
War, in which Britain had a brief and bloody conflict with
Argentina over the sovereignty of the remote South Atlantic
islands.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was the leader of Chile at that time and had from then
on established a close relationship with Thatcher, who was British
prime minister during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On November 25, immediately after Britain's Highest Court ruled
that Pinochet did not enjoy immunity against prosecution, Thatcher
issued a statement asking Straw to allow "the old, frail and sick"
Pinochet return home "on compassionate grounds."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Postpones Debate on Petrol Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Wednesday postponed a debate for two months on a bill to limit an
increase in petrol price due to its sharp difference with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The bill sets the petrol's ceiling price per liter at 250 rials
(about 8.3 U.S. cents at official rate) for next Iranian year
starting March 21, 1999, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The government, burdened with huge fuel subsidies, had proposed
to keep the current petrol price at 200 rials (about 6.7 cents) a
liter for the first 45 liters bought each month and 750 rials
(about 25 cents) a liter for additional amount.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian said Wednesday
said that the government spends 30,000 billion rials (about 10
billion dollars) a year as energy subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The proposal aroused serious concern on possible price hikes in
the country and the conservative-dominated Majlis expressed
strong opposition to the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh has warned the Majlis
that Iran will have to import 300 million U.S. dollars worth of
petrol next year to meet the high domestic demands and it
will have no crude to export in a few years with the current
consumption growth.
</P>
<P>
Putting the country's annual petrol consumption growth rate at
more than 7 percent, Zanganeh said that it is not fair for the
country to spend so much on imports, which is mostly benefiting a
specific group.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's proposal helps preserve the
country's natural resources, prevent excesses, encourage
consumption cuts.
</P>
<P>
It also helps social justice, environment protection and
reduction in government's foreign exchange expenditure, he added.
</P>
<P>
If the Majlis passes the bill, the government will have an
additional 4 trillion rials (about 1.3 billion dollars) deficit.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes GCC Decision to Broaden Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Assefi here on Wednesday welcomed a
statement by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on its
willingness to broaden relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Assefi said that Iran is seriously committed to broadening
relations with all its neighbors, especially Muslim states in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is glad to note the willingness of the Persian Gulf
states to broaden relations with it," the spokesman said in a
response to the statement issued by the GCC summit in Abu
Dhabi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Assefi reiterated that the three islands of the
Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Moussa in the Persian Gulf are
"an integral part of Iran."
</P>
<P>
"The misunderstandings on the part of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) in connection with the three islands" will be
solved only by direct negotiations between Iran and the UAE
without the involvement of an intermediary, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed hope that the UAE will accept
Iran's offer for talks on the topic without any pre-conditions
and on the basis of a 1971 accord between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands in 1971, but both Tehran
and Abu Dhabi have claimed full sovereignty on the islands.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan informed Iran on
Monday that the UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan
has voiced readiness to resume talks with Iran over their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Zayed's expression was welcomed by Iranian officials who also
called on the UAE officials to come to Tehran for talks
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Iran insisted on bilateral talks to
solve the "misunderstanding" between the two countries, while the
UAE demanded for an arbitrary by the International Court of

<HEADLINE> White House: Clinton's Conduct Does Not Warrant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair was "morally
reprehensible" but does not warrant impeachment, the president's
top lawyer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff made the remarks in a
final defense of the two-day impeachment hearings starting Tuesday
in the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ruff's dramatic appearance came as Republicans finished
drafting proposed articles of impeachment and planned a vote in
the Judiciary Committee on censure of Clinton as an alternative to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"The president has not committed a high crime or misdemeanor,"
Ruff said. "His conduct, although morally reprehensible, does not
warrant impeachment."
</P>
<P>
"In order to have committed an impeachable offense, the
president must have acted to subvert our system of government and,
members of the committee, that did not happen," the lawyer argued.
</P>
<P>
As Ruff spoke, committee Republicans were put finishing touches
on the formal charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on
Wednesday morning that he would give dissenting Democrats a
committee vote on an alternative proposal for censure.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to have a vote on a resolution for censure,"
Hyde told reporters as he stepped outside the hearing room where
the White House continued its defense of the president. The White
House said Hyde's decision was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Hyde also said he intends to talk to his Republican colleagues
in the House about the case against the president, but would not
lobby them to support impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman also wrote a letter to the full House to
"respectfully request that you withhold making any decision" until
the committee votes on articles of impeachment and committee
members "have had an opportunity to discuss the merits with you."
</P>
<P>
The hearings played out as the White House seemed to be gaining
modest ground in the effort to head off impeachment in the full
House. Amo Houghton, a moderate Republican lawmaker, announced he
would oppose impeachment and support censure of the president.
</P>
<P>
White House aides hoped other moderate lawmakers would follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the core issue of perjury, Ruff said he believes
Clinton testified "truthfully before the grand jury, but that no
matter what judgment you reach about that testimony there could be
no basis for impeachment under any reasonable reading" of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Hyde's decision to allow a vote on censure in committee was
largely a gesture, since majority Republicans are certain to
defeat it on a party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it leaves open the question of whether the House
Republican leadership will give Democrats a vote on censure when
the impeachment issue comes to the floor, as it is expected to do.
</P>
<P>
Inside the committee room, several White House witnesses
continued to argue the case against impeachment. Among them was
William Weld, a former moderate Republican governor of
Massachusetts, who enjoyed a reputation as a tough crime fighter
during an earlier career as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
"The most appropriate result is something other than removing
this person from his office," said Weld, appearing before the
committee as a witness for Clinton. But he said the situation
"demands something more than merely censure."

PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here on Thursday that she has been
reassured by French President Jacques Chirac that future European
defense policy will not undermine NATO.
</P>
<P>
"It was very clear that the European defense ideas were
complementary, that there was no attempt to undermine NATO," she
said after meeting Chirac and French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
She said that the European defense force, promoted by France

Europeans to be able to deal with their problems, to be able to
have a force that they could use to defend themselves but in no
way to undercut NATO".
</P>
<P>
She said that she had made it clear to Chirac that a European
defence identity must be a complementary structure instead of
duplicating any part of NATO or undermining the vitality of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
agreed at their summit in Saint Malo that the European Union
should have an autonomous capacity to take action, backed by
credible military force and the means to use it.

<P>
DAMASCUS, December (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam expressed on Thursday strong opposition to the
idea of changing the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam told reporters while receiving his Iranian counterpart
Hassan Habibi at Damascus International Airport that the
U.S.-European proposal to change the ruling regime in Iraq was grave
because it would set a precedent against peace and security
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"No country has the right to meddle in the internal affairs of
another one," Khaddam asserted, adding that "only the people of
the country have the authority to change their regime."
</P>
<P>
"All the Arab and world countries are against the U.S. idea," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Vice President pointed out that he would discuss
the situation in Iraq with Habibi who is here to attend the joint
Syrian-Iranian Supreme Committee session.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned with the situation in Iraq as it will has
impacts on the whole region," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The talks with the Iranian side would lead to a common point
of view in favor of the Iraq's unity and territorial integrity,"
Khaddam noted.
</P>
<P>
"What we, Arabs and Muslims, are interested in is to ward off
the dangers facing the Iraqi national and political unity and
geographical integrity as such dangers are in favor of the Israeli
design to dismember the Arab and Islamic worlds," he continued.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent Syrian-Turkish security accord, Khaddam
voiced satisfaction with it saying "the accord is being
implemented normally and we are satisfied with that."

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Hiring Russian Weapons Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday refuted
Western media reports that Tehran is trying to recruit Russian
scientists in the development of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iran "has not and will not try under any circumstances to get
access to such types of arms", said a statement issued by the
Iranian Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that cooperation between Tehran and Moscow
was absolutely transparent and met the non-proliferation
commitments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It said Iran was conducting peaceful research programs, some in
bacteriology. These studies were related "to genetic bacteria and
directed at combating AIDS and lung diseases, tuberculosis in
particular, for which Iran actively delivers vaccines to countries
requiring them".
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Western media reports that Iran is
trying to recruit Russian biological weapons experts.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Tuesday, "Iranian officials who
report directly to the leadership of the Islamic state have
approached dozens of scientists who once made germ weapons,
offering as much as $5,000 a month to people who earn far less
than that a year in the increasingly chaotic Russian economy."

<HEADLINE> China Wins All But Two Individual Gymnastic Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Despite a seldom scene with
four gymnasts sharing the silver in the parallel bars, it was
China that displayed its dominance in the apparatuses by taking
all but two out of the 10 individuals at stake in the Asiad's
gymnastic competitions which concluded here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wei opened China's gold rush by taking the men's floor
exercises with 9.775 points and 16-year-old Xing Aowei grabbed the
second gold after sharing the top place with former Olympic and
World champion Pae Kil-su of DPR Korea, both socred the event-high
9.800 in pommel horse.
</P>
<P>
China's third gold came from Kui Yuanyuan, whose 9.537 points
was good enough to edge other seven finalists who all had mistakes
in the women's vault.
</P>
<P>
Local gymnast Unchai Amornthep outscored his Chinese rivals to
take the rings title, stopping China from sweeping the gold
medals. The 23-year-old Thai gymnast had the best score of 9.800
points to award Thailand its first gymnastic gold medal in 20
years in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand had been waiting for this gold for 20 years," said
Areekul Nanakorn, secretary genaral of the Thailand Gymnastics
Association.
</P>
<P>
"Unchai missed the bronze medal in the Hiroshima Asian Games by
just 0.025 points. And we know he is the best on the rings after
being coached by Uzbekstan Nikolay Makhort in the past two years."
Nanakorn added.
</P>
<P>
Makhort, a former Uzbekstan national team coach with more than
25 international outings, said he had done "no new exercises to
Unchai but worked for his stability."
</P>
<P>
Unhai was not the last gymnast to challenge the Chinese men
gymnasts as South Korea's Yeo Hong-chul, silver medalist at the
1996 Atlanda Olympics, jumped ahead with soaring vaults and spins
for the event-high 9.775, edging China's Li Xiaopeng by 0.38
points.
</P>
<P>
However, the women gymnasts of other teams could not stop China
from repeating its clean sweep of all the four golds in Hiroshima
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jing, 16, scored the best of 9.775 points in the floor
exercises where world champion Kui Yuanyuan had to settle for a
silver in 9.700.
</P>
<P>
World beam champion Liu Xuan, winner of the women's all-around
title Wednesday, proved her statue of "Queen of the Beam" by
scoring the day-high 9.850 points.
</P>
<P>
China's world uneven bar champion Bi Wenjing also had her
graceful routine between the bars to complete China' sweep of the
women top honors.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wei, 16, in his international debut, scored an outstanding
9.775 points in the floor exercises, beating South Korea's
vaulting king Kim Dong-Hwa to second as Kim was awarded 9.650.
</P>
<P>
In the last event of the day, Zhang Jingjin came out last but
scored the best of 9.725 points to award China its 12th gold medal
from the gymnastic competitions.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Zhang, key member of the world and Olympic
champion teams, beat the injury to his left feet with excellant
routines on the horizontal bar, clouding his rivals at the
gymnastic hall of the Muang Thong Thani Sport Center.

<HEADLINE> French President to Visit U.S. in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has accepted an invitation by his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton to
visit Washington in February, said U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here Wednesday evening to join the
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human
Rights, made the announcement after a breakfast with Chirac at the
Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Chirac will come two months before a summit in
Washington marking the 50th anniversary of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), of which France remains a member but
has stayed out of the integrated command since 1967.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that
Chirac will discuss with Clinton "all the current issues" ranging
from NATO, the Middle East to Iraq, but ruled out a discussion on
the return of France to the integrated command of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she had a very good discussion with the French
president about NATO, Iraq and Clinton's scheduled trip to the
Palestinian territories and Israel later this week.
</P>
<P>
Chirac wished Clinton success in the forthcoming trip, which he
said would be difficult but was an important gesture which he
appreciated highly.
</P>
<P>
"France and the United States hope to see the exact application
of the Wye agreement," said the French spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Albright appealed to Palestinians to meet their promises on
security guarantees for Israel, while calling on Israel to
continue withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States wished that all the components of
the Wye agreement be implemented, including the withdrawal of
troops by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit was inscribed in the framework of the Wye
agreement, she added.

<HEADLINE> Mowlam Says Northern Irish Peace Progress Urgent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam said on Thursday she felt "a sense of urgency"
was needed in the province's peace progress.
</P>
<P>
"The longer we leave it the harder it's going to be to sell
things on either side," she said in an interview with BBC's
Radio 4.
</P>
<P>
"I personally would like to see progress before Christmas. In
the end it's up to the party leaders to find between themselves a
sense of accommodation," she added.
</P>
<P>
The issue of decommissioning - the handover or disposal of
terrorist weapons and explosives - remains a major obstacle to
implementing the Northern Ireland peace agreement, which was
struck in April.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said arms disposal remained "essential" but was not a
pre-condition to talks.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists are insisting the IRA's political wing,
Sinn Fein, is barred from taking up seats in the province's new
executive committee until decommissioning begins, plunging the
peace process into crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam also congratulated John Hume and David Trimble, the
leaders of Northern Ireland's main republican and unionist
parties, who were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence-building is what the process needs, which is why
the Peace Prize is such good news. It needs confidence-building
by all parties," she said.

<HEADLINE> Torlarp Wins First Swimming Gold for Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Torlarp Sethsothorn brought
the best gift for the anniversary of his parents' marriage here on
Thursday when he took the men's 400-meter freestyle gold medal,
the first Asian Games swimming gold for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Sethsothorn, in lane three, overtook pacesetter
Masato Hirano of Japan in the 250-meter mark and touched home in
3:53.61.
</P>
<P>
Although Hirano made a powerful sprint to the finish, he could
not catch up with the host swimmer and had to settle for the
silver in 3:54.13.
</P>
<P>
Kuok Kin-Ming from Hong Kong, China, was third in 4:00.44.
</P>
<P>
Sethsothorn scurried to the poolside after the win. He hugged
his father, shouting: "I did it, father. I did it."
</P>
<P>
"Today is the 24th anniversary of my parents' marriage, and
they expected me to win the gold," said Sethsothorn, who had been
training in Australia before returning to Thailand this year.
</P>
<P>
"When I went to training, my parents always took pains to
accompany me, so this gold is the best reward for them," the
excited Sethsothorn added.
</P>
<P>
Sethsothorn felt uneasy before the match. "My result in the
preliminary wasn't good and when I entered the aquatic center, I
found so many people cheering for me. This brought pressure on
me," he said. "I hope my win will stir up enthusiasm for swimming
in my country."
</P>
<P>
There were over 5,000 swimming fans jampacking the Thammasat
University aquatic center. They erupted when the Thai national
anthem was sung for the first time at the poolside in the games.
</P>
<P>
The remaining four golds were split by China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ayari Aoyama, Japan's title hopeful in women's butterfly,
displayed stronger mentality when she swam away with the gold
in women's 100m butterfly in 59.44.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old high school student was unnerved by the raucous
spectators and lost her lead halfway in the same event in the
world championships in Perth last January. She finished with a
silver there.
</P>
<P>
But this time she became mature and never showed jitters in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
Ruan Yi of China followed Aoyama in second in 1:00.57, with
Japanese Hitomi Kashima third in 1:00.87.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Zhu Yi snapped Japan's winning momentum as he
unexpectedly triumphed in the men's 200m breaststroke in 2:16.26.
Ratapong of Thailand placed second in 2:16.47 and Miyazaki
Yoshinobu of Japan was third in 2:16.97.
</P>
<P>
"I was not certain of the win before the race, because
Yoshinobu's registered result is better than mine," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, this is the first time for me to represent China in
the Asian Games. I was a little nervous," the 21-year-old
Chinese admitted.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach didn't expect him to win.
</P>
<P>
"This gold is a windfall for us," said Zhang Xiong.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's teammate Li Wei followed suit to win the women's 100m
breaststroke in 1:08.95. Another Chinese Xu Shan came in second in
1:10.00, with Masami Tanaka third in 1:10.30.
</P>
<P>
But Japanese laughed last when they clinched the gold in men's
4x100m freestyle in 3:25.53, beating their Chinese rivals into
second.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foursome clocked 3:25.86 and Kazakhstan timed
3:28.53 for the bronze.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform is the Creation Of The Masses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- In a commentary titled
"Reforms: the Great Creation of the Masses", Xinhua marks the 20th
anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in December
1978, which is regarded as the starting point of the reform and
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
It quotes Chief Architect of the Reforms Deng Xiaoping as
saying that many things related to the reform and opening-up came
from the masses and reflect the wisdom of the masses and the
collective. Deng said that his own merit lay in having summed
these new things up and in advocating them.
</P>
<P>
It was the CPC that respected the creativeness of the masses,
summing up, and perfecting the aspirations, demands, wisdom and
experience of the people, and making them the Party's general
guiding principle for the New Period, and leading the Chinese
people in carrying out a historical revolution, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
It says that the creativity of the masses burst forth like a
volcanic eruption, after October 1976, when the "Gang of Four"
were smashed, and then afterwards, when the CPC led them in making
order out of chaos,
</P>
<P>
The secret agreement signed by farmers in the village of
Xiaogang in east China's Anhui Province to carve farmland up into
small plots for families to manage on their own lifted the curtain
on the country's rural reforms, which soon spread to Sichuan,
Guizhou and many other parts of the country, it says.
</P>
<P>
While the rural reforms were spreading all over the country,
factories in cities were also pushing for changes, and this was
followed by the setting up of four special economic zones and the
opening up of 14 coastal cities, it says, and lists many other
"new things" of the past two decades: private businesses,
overseas-funded enterprises, labor markets, bankruptcies in state
factories, and rural industries, all of which were created by the
masses.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, It says that the third generation of leaders with
Jiang Zemin at the core has made new ideological breakthroughs,
removing blocks to state enterprise reforms and breathing new
lease of life into economic development as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have been the choice of millions upon million of
people, and they should continue to create more, and to have
better and still fresher experiences in the great practice of
reforms, the commentary concludes.

ADDIS ABABA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of

Meeting on Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in Africa
will be held in the Sudanese Capital of Khartoum from December 13

<P>
An OAU press release issued here said the ministerial meeting
will address the magnitude of the refugee problem on the

</P>
<P>
The objective of the meeting, said the press release, is to
find durable solution to the refugee problem by discussing
aspects of protection and assistance in emergency situations
including the capacity building of the non-governmental
organizations.
</P>

opportunity to ministers in their capacity as the decision makers
of the OAU to assess the implementation of the OAU Convention on
Refugees signed in 1969.
</P>
<P>
The decision to convene the Khartoum meeting was taken by the
66th Ordinary Session of the OAU Council of Ministers in June
1997 which requested the OAU Secretary General to convene the
meeting in close collaboration with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

<HEADLINE> SES, CITIC to Acquire AsiaSat Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Holding Limited (AsiaSat) announced here
Thursday the signing of a definitive agreement for the
restructuring of the ownership of Bowenvale Limited (Bowenvale), a
company owned by Cable and Wireless plc (C&AMP;W), China International
Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) and Hutchison Whampoa
Limited (Hutchison).
</P>
<P>
Bowenvale holds 68.95 percent of the ordinary shares of
AsiaSat.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, C&AMP;W and Hutchison will sell
their entire share holdings in Bowenvale to Societe Europeenne des
Satellites (SES), Europe's leading satellite operator, and CITIC
for a cash consideration of 372 million U.S. dollars, or an
average price of 18.33 HK dollars per AsiaSat share.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the transaction scheduled for January
15, 1999, CITIC and SES will vote their shares as a block at
AsiaSat shareholders' meetings. If there is a disagreement on a
given resolution, CITIC and SES will each vote an equal number of
shares at the AsiaSat shareholders' meeting. Bowenvale's share
holding in AsiaSat will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"CITIC is committed to the continued growth of AsiaSat, and our
decision to increase our ownership reflects our commitment," said
Qin Xiao, president of CITIC.
</P>
<P>
Describing SES as an ideal partner for both AsiaSat and CITIC,
Qin said this partnership will confer significant benefits upon
AsiaSat, its shareholders and its customers.
</P>
<P>
"The transaction positions SES and its ASTRA Satellite System,
together with AsiaSat, to play a leading role in the planned
establishment of a global broad band satellite infrastructure,"
said Romain Bausch, director general and chairman of SES's
Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
CITIC and SES will each appoint four directors to AsiaSat's
Board of Directors. And there will be three independent
non-executive directors and two executive directors. Qin will be
named chairman of AsiaSat's Board of Directors and SES will
appoint the vice-chairman. Peter Jackson will continue as chief
executive officer and executive director, and William Wade will
remain as deputy CEO and executive director of AsiaSat.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-based AsiaSat, a leading provider of satellite
transponder capacity in Asia, owns and operates three
communications satellites providing broadcast and
telecommunications services to over two-thirds of the world's
population in 53 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Based in Luxembourg, SES as Europe's leading provider of high
quality satellite transponder capacity for Direct-to-Home
broadcasting services, is the third largest satellite service
provider in the world based on revenue. Established in 1985, SES
operates eight satellites with 148 transponders.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Quits Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Three and a half months
after joining the government, the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) Thursday decided to quit, alleging that
its ruling partner Nepali Congress (NC) has failed to implement
the agreements reached with it and other left parties.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML said in a press statement that it joined the
government in the context of the agreements, but they are not
enforced, so its eight ministers, two state ministers and three
assistant ministers had tendered resignations to Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala.
</P>
<P>
It said that though the agreements are in favor of the nation
and the people, the prime minister did not enforce them as
promised.
</P>
<P>
The 25-point agreement and nine-point agreement the NC reached
separately in August with the CPN-ML and the nine left parties
including the CPN-ML cover a number of issues such as the law and
order situation in the country, withdrawal of Indian troops from
Kalapani of far-western Nepal, reviewing of the controversial 1950
Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty and holding of general elections in a
free and just manner.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML issued a sternly-worded ultimatum on November 17,
threatening to quit the government if the agreements were not
implemented by December 1.
</P>
<P>
Later it agreed to extend the deadline as Prime Minister
Koirala requested for more time to work out a solution.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-term polls in November 1994 produced a hung
parliament where no single party holds a majority, a coalition
government has been an alternative in Nepali politics.
</P>
<P>
The country has witnessed five governments since then.

DHAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The by-election of the Pabna-2
constituency in northwest Bangladesh ended peacefully Thursday in
all the 81 polling centers, the Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Voters cast their ballots from 08:00 to 16:00 local time at 402
booths of 81 polling centers in Pabna, about 200 kilometers
northwest of here, to elect their representative to the 69th seat
of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The seat was vacated in June after the death of a member of
parliament from the ruling Bangladesh Awami League.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has so far received the results of two
centers, which showed that the candidate from the ruling party had
received more votes than his two rivals.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known when the final results would come
out.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Would Win Re-election if Vote Held Now: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
would be re-elected if a presidential election was held now,
according to a poll published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the IFOP polling institute and published
by the Evenement news magazine, said that Chirac would win 53
percent of the vote against 47 for Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
France will hold its next presidential election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 957 people, made on December 4 and 5, suggested
that Chirac was gaining an upper hand over Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, his rival in "cohabitation" power-sharing, for the first
time in 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Chirac mistakenly dissolved parliament in the spring of 1997
and allowed the leftist coalition to come to power in an early
legislative election which rejected the former right-wing
majority.
</P>
<P>
Chirac relaunched his offensive against the leftists last week
when he appealed for a restriction of the right to strike, closer
ties between politicians and the voters, and more power for local
governments.
</P>
<P>
His speech, which was made in Rennes, Britanny, won strong
approval from the French public.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Hails Zhuang Autonomous Region's 40th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, is to carry an editorial tomorrow (Friday),
hailing the 40th anniversary of the founding of Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The founding anniversary of the autonomous region carries
special significance as it coincides with that of the renowned
Bose Uprising led by Deng Xiaoping in 1929 and the region's
overall liberation in 1958, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the social and economic achievements the region has
made over the past 40 years, it points out that the gross domestic
product (GDP) has expanded 17.8 times between 1957 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
And since the early 1990s, the regional economy has been
growing at an annual rate of 16.7 percent; actually six percentage
points higher than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
Located in south China, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
has a population of 46 million broadly dispersed among 12 ethnic
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Despite rapid economic growth in the past 40 years, it
remains basically a traditional agrarian region and lags behind
other parts of China, with 3.6 million people still living below
the poverty line, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
However, the region has great tourism resources and relatively
sound infrastructure like railways and harbors as well as being
geographically close to Hong Kong, Macao and southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a conclusion the editorial urges the government and people
of Guangxi to make good use of the region's advantages and fully
tap its potential to strive for a brighter future.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Decides to Open Up Television Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
Thursday announced its decision to open up the television market
following the one-month-long consultation.
</P>
<P>
K. C. Kwong, Secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting, said that an opened-up television market would speed
up technology transfer, attract investment, stimulate the growth
of the broadcasting and related industries, and create new
employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a vibrant television industry in Hong Kong will
not only widen viewers' program choice, but also enhance Hong
Kong's position as a leading broadcasting hub in the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said the government would promote the efficient use of
the capacity of the in-building network by giving priority in the
allocation of the frequency for channels to services using digital
and other advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
He said an internal working group will be set up to look into
ways to rationalize existing frequency allocations in the
in-building network so as to maximize the capacity for channel
distribution.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, the working group will seek to develop and
formulate an optimal frequency layout plan and draw up technical
specifications on the standards of distribution for consultation
and agreement with the industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also make the necessary amendments to the
existing Satellite Master Antenna Television Licenses to enable
the licensees to carry pay TV services.
</P>
<P>
During the one-month consultation on the 1998 Review of
Television Policy in September, 46 submissions were received, the
majority of which supported the government's policy initiatives to
liberalize the television market.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Quit OPEC: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will never quit the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mines and
Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto has said.
</P>
<P>
"Who said that? We have no intention of leaving the OPEC. It
never crossed our minds," Antara News Agency Thursday quoted
Kuntoro as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rachmat Sudibyo, a member of the board of
commissioners of the state oil company Pertamina, said the
government was thinking of quitting the OPEC since it could no
longer control plunging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"After considering it, it is possible that we may quit the
OPEC," Sudibyo said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuntoro, Indonesia would remain a member of the
11-nation organization, because if Indonesia left the oil cartel,
the image of the organization would worsen, which in turn could
cause a further drop in the world market price of oil.
</P>
<P>
The price of Indonesia's benchmark Minas light crude has slid
to 9.60 U.S. dollars a barrel from about 12.80 dollars a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
While the average cost of recovery in Indonesia runs between
2.50 and 3 dollars per barrel, extraction in some remote areas
runs up to seven dollars per barrel, making production costly,
Gatot Wiroyudo, head of Pertamina's division for foreign oil and
gas contractors, told Antara.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's output quota is 1.28 million barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Reporters Visit Iraqi Party Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign reporters on Thursday
were invited to visit the regional headquarters of the ruling
Baath Party to which U.N. arms inspectors were denied access on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), in charge of the arms
inspections, "has no right to inspect the party headquarters, "
said Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the party's leadership at a
press conference held in the yard of the al-Adhamiya branch office.
</P>
<P>
"Why do UNSCOM elements search for materials pertaining to the
weapons of mass destruction in the headquarters of a political
party?" said Jassim, the former information minister who is the
Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM's mandate is to investigate weapons of mass
destruction and they (weapons) have nothing to do with the
headquarters of political parties," he told reporters who were
just allowed to enter the yard of the headquarters, but not the
building.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this act is provocative and we expect more acts
of this kind from UNSCOM," said the Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. arms inspectors would not be allowed to enter the
two-story building if they should come back due to the fact that
party headquarters are not subjected to inspections.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing worth inspecting here," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, a team of 12 U.N. inspectors was turned
back when it tried to enter the office.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded they first
provide a written declaration "on the material and items "they
sought.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Sugar to Export Through Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's sugar has started to
stream out through the Nacala Corridor in northern Mozambique
twenty years after the passage was shut up for traffic.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500 tons of sugar has already been sent out from
Malawi to Mozambique through the corridor, Filipe Nhussi, a
senior official from the Mozambican Ports and Railways Company,
announced Wednesday in country's northern port city of Nacala.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Thursday quoted Nhussi as saying that
due to the civil war and lack of maintenance, the corridor had
been out of use for 20 years, forcing the sugar export from
Malawi to take a round-about way through South Africa or
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Nacala Corridor starts from Nacala port on the Indian Ocean
coast in the east and ends in neighboring Malawi in the west.
</P>
<P>
According to Nhussi, if the experiment of 500 tons of sugar
turns out as expected, 5,000 tons more will be exported through
the passage, which means 60 percent of the sugar Malawi exports
currently to Portugal might use the corridor.

<HEADLINE> Basic Law Provides Double Protection to Human Rights in HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Home Affairs
David Lan of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
said here Thursday that the Basic Law on the Hong Kong SAR not
only entrenches the provisions of the two covenants on human
rights, it affords them double protection by guaranteeing them in
specific terms.
</P>
<P>
Lan was speaking at a celebration party for the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),
which was organized here by non-governmental organization "the
Friends of the UDHR".
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said in a statement Wednesday
that Hong Kong has had a long tradition of respecting and
safeguarding the rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration.
The rights have been given legal substance through the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(ICESCR).
</P>
<P>
The two covenants have applied to Hong Kong for more than 20
years and are entrenched in its constitutional document, the Basic
Law, Lan said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is proud of its human rights record and welcomes any
who question it to come and see for themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with that challenge, and with the tradition of
openness to the world, the SAR government has invited
representatives of the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to visit Hong Kong prior to
the hearings of the government's reports in relation to the ICCPR
and the ICESCR. "As always, our guests will have free reign to
see whatever they wish and to meet whoever they choose without
interference from the government," Lan said.
</P>
<P>
Lan recalled that, before Hong Kong's handover in July last
year, there were dire predictions that the rights and freedoms of
Hong Kong residents were about to be curtailed. "Events have
shown that they were greatly mistaken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Records showed that in the first year after the handover, there
were some 1,800 public meetings and processions and some 880
societies were registered or exempted from registration under the
Societies Ordinance. And the police have not once objected to any
applications to hold such activities.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the last 18 months have clearly demonstrated
the importance that the Central People's Government attaches to
the protection of our rights and freedoms in accordance with the
Basic Law, Lan said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Universal Declaration has no binding legal effect,
the moral authority is no less compelling. The Declaration's
principles have been given substance through the ICCPR and the
ICESCR which, as applied to Hong Kong, are enshrined in the Basic
Law, Lan continued.
</P>
<P>
The ideals of democracy and personal freedom in Hong Kong are
thus secure under the many layers of protection afforded by
legislation, international treaties and the moral force of the
Declaration, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lan announced earlier Thursday that for celebrating the special
occasion, the key human rights treaties are now online and are
available in both English and Chinese on the Home Affairs
Bureau's Homepage. A bilingual edition of the Declaration was
published and Hongkong Post has launched a souvenir commemorative
cover.

<HEADLINE> PNC Convenes on Nullifying Anti-Israel Clauses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Central Committee of
the Palestinian National Council (PNA) Thursday met in Gaza to
discuss the nullification of the clauses in the Palestinian
Charter that call for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to approve a letter from the PNA
Chairman Yasser Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton detailing
which provisions in the charter have been nullified.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight members of the committee took part in the
meeting. And the meeting is considered to be the last stage before
the approximately 730-member PNC plenum is to open on Monday, in
the presence of Clinton, to reaffirm the nullification.
</P>
<P>
Israel is insisting that the PNC take a vote in Monday's
gathering, but the Palestinians say a vote is not required by the
Wye River peace agreement signed by the two sides in October.
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross, who arrived
here early this week, is trying to arrange a compromise over the
issue before Clinton began his visit to the region on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians continued their protests on Thursday
against Israel's refusal to release Palestinian political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, hundreds of the relatives of prisoners gathered and
urged Israel to fulfill its commitments under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel would release 750 prisoners by the end
of January in phases.
</P>
<P>
In the first phases last month, Israel freed 250 prisoners, but
most of them were common criminals instead of the security
prisoners, who were arrested due to anti-Israel activities, as
demanded by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Meissnitzer Claims Second Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer
dominated the women's Super-G on Thursday in Val D'isere of
France and collected her third World Cup victory in the season,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian, 25, finished the 1,985-meter Piste-G course in 1
minute, 21.95 seconds, leaving the rest of the field in her spray.
</P>
<P>
Meissnitzer won the Super-G for the second time at this World
Cup event and took a convincing 0.79 ahead of Germany's Martina
Ertl.
</P>
<P>
France's Regine Cavagnoud delighted the home crowd, finishing
third in 1:22.94, ahead of 1997 overall World Cup champion
Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, fourth in 1:23.08.
</P>
<P>
Coming into the season with three career World Cup vitories,
Meissnitzer has since doubled that number, winning the
season-opening Super-G in Lake Louise, Canada, as well as a giant
slalom in Park City, Utah three week ago.
</P>
<P>
It was her fourth career World Cup Super-G win.
</P>
<P>
The victory pads Meissnitzer's lead atop the rankings, where
she sits with 525 points. Ertl's second place finish, however,
prevented Meissnitzer from digging too wide a gap. The German is
still close on her heels, with 383 points.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China has made unremitted
efforts and scored tremendous achievements in promoting and
protecting human rights and basic freedoms over the past two
decades in line with its specific national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao gave this remark during
a routine press conference today in Beijing, in reply to a
question about China's stance on the human rights issue in terms
of the 50th anniversary of the 'Universal Declaration on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that coincidentally this happens to be the 20th
anniversary of the introduction of China's own reform and
opening-up policy,
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that a developing country such as China with
a huge population of 1.2 billion yet a comparatively backward
economy has to identify that the most urgent requirement is to
improve the living standards of its people," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"China has therefore rightly declared that its avowed
priorities are economic survival and progress while continuing the
reform and opening up policy," he added. "This has resulted in the
Chinese people enjoying enormously better economic, social and
cultural rights."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu said China has continually made efforts to
enhance the democratic process and its legal system, so that its
people can enjoy wide-reaching civil and political rights through
legal means.
</P>
<P>
He cited the forward looking decisions made by the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China as a clear
example of how the country continues to perfect its legal system,
maintains the correct application of law and looks after people's
rights; while at the same time introducing democratic elections
and decision-making procedures.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on: "China is also proud of the way it has managed
its policy of instituting democratic systems, which guarantee that
its people enjoy extensive legal rights and freedom, and that
human rights are respected and also guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
While devoting itself to promoting and protecting human rights
throughout its boundaries, China has carried on numerous dialogues
and cooperation with regard to human rights with such countries as
Britain, Canada, Australia and a trench of nations in the European
Union (EU); and is especially proud of the successful visit by
United Nations high commissioner Mary Robinson.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already registered 17 international
covenants on human rights, and has successively signed the
"International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights",
as well as the "International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights", Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry spokesman also voiced his belief that so
long as China continues to march along the road of growth in
conformity with Chinese characteristics, the country will realize
even more major progress in economic and social development, and
the Chinese people will enjoy human rights at a far higher level.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Stock Prices Surge 7.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul stock market Thursday
shot up 7.8 percent, with the leading composite price index
surging 41.09 points to 567.61.
</P>
<P>
The market enjoyed across-the-board gains, with the exception
of mining stocks, with shares of banks and securities firms
leading the surge. Trading volume hit a record high of 356.56
million shares worth 3.13 trillion won (2.6 billion U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
Winners outnumbers losers by 771 to 71, with 43 remaining
unchanged. A total of 287 listings rose to the day's limit highs
while only one fell.
</P>
<P>
The market rocketed as investors rushed to buy stocks based on
predictions for an earlier economic recovery, said observers.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government's strong will to reform ailing
business groups, especially the nation's five largest family-owned
conglomerates -- Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung. LG and Sk -- also had a
positive effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the market would rise further due to
falling interest rates and the South Korean won's strength against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Many dealers said that the market would break through the
600-point mark before the end of this year, saying that the bourse
might experience a short-term period of correction after
rebounding above the 600 level.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts warned that the market was becoming too
overheated and proposed that investors refrain from engaging in
speculative buying sprees.
</P>
<P>
Some cautioned that the economic fundamentals were not all rosy
at the moment and that South Korea had not made much progress in
restructuring its troubled corporations and financial
institutions.

</P>
<P>
The plant, with an estimated production capacity of 100
megawatt, will be located in the Sidi Daoud region along the
northern coast.
</P>
<P>
The project was prompted by the Tunisian government's efforts

of oil and gas reserves in its major oil wells.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Producing Biological Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Assefi on Thursday rejected the allegation by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Iran is working
with Russia on developing biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Assefi termed the charge as "a propaganda ploy" to hinder
technological development of Iran, particularly in the field of
biological sciences, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Albright on Wednesday warned Russia in a meeting with new
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that Moscow would lose
millions of dollars in U.S. aid if it did not stop assisting Iran
in its missile programs.
</P>
<P>
Albright's allegation is "part of a plot being engineered by
certain anti-Iran circles in America for particular
ecological-political purposes," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He described Iran's scientific cooperation with Russian
research and scientific centers as being "quite transparent" and
for "peaceful purposes."
</P>
<P>
The results of many research programs jointly conducted by
Iran and Russia have so far been published worldwide as
scientific achievements, Assefi said. But he did not give details
of the achievements.
</P>
<P>
Iran will go ahead with its peaceful scientific and research
projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite of its mounting pressures on Russia, the U.S. has made
little progress so far in persuading Moscow of its views on
Iran's nuclear and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
Russia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Iran
last month on constructing more nuclear reactors in Bushehr,
southern Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Afghan women staged a rally
Thursday outside the United Nations office in Islamabad condemning
the Taliban militia for trampling women rights in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by the Revolutionary
Association of the Women of Afghanistan to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators lashed out at the Taliban leadership for
their "poor human rights record" and anti-women policies, urging
the world community to take serious note of the hard-line
militia's policies.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan women held banners and placards, inscribed with
slogans against the Taliban and other Afghan leaders.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued on the occasion said that "the world
community and human rights organizations would be meaningless
without unequivocal condemnation of the Taliban, who deride the
civilized concept of human rights."
</P>
<P>
While condemning the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance led by
former president Burhanuddin Rabbani, the statement said that
during Rabbani's rule relentless fighting between rival Islamic
factions destroyed vast sections of the capital city of Kabul and
left 50,000 people dead, most of whom were civilians.
</P>
<P>
The association also slammed some of Afghanistan's neighbors,
accusing them of supplying money and weapons to various Afghan
factions in the bitter and protracted conflict.

<HEADLINE> Business Globalization to Expand in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest
companies will continue to expand through globalization next year,
despite changing financial conditions and economic uncertainty,
according to a U.S. professional services body.
</P>
<P>
And in the years to come, just three to four large companies
were likely to emerge in each industry, said
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in a study of business trends
published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Today's economic conditions force companies to focus on the
areas where they can realize the greatest benefit," said PwC.
</P>
<P>
Referring to global enterprises, PwC said size and cultural
diversity still weighed heavily and cross-border combinations
would become even more prevalent as companies sought to compete on
a worldwide scale.
</P>
<P>
Companies that sought to successfully globalize their
operations would also have to manage their workforce on this
scale, PwC said.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, companies needed to instill a sense of team work
and sharing, to provide consistent education and training to
ensure that employees had strong skills and served customers
consistently, and to hire and retain quality professionals.
</P>
<P>
As for leadership style, PwC advocated the importance of
instilling a vision in employees and giving them the flexibility
and autonomy to be able to make this vision a reality.
</P>
<P>
While public attention was drawn to the effects of the Internet
on business-to-consumer relationships, PwC said, immediate
benefits of computer trade would be realized in
business-to-business transactions.
</P>
<P>
The Euro was set to rival the U.S. dollar as a dominant global
currency, PwC predicted. This raised significant opportunities
and demand for change among organizations operating or planning to
operate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The challenge of building global brands lay in building a
powerful brand identity that took into account local cultural
sensitivities.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt: Talks With Marcoses Not Affected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that the Supreme Court's decision voiding the deal forged
in 1993 between the Marcoses and the government on the family's
wealth will not affect the proposed negotiations between the
government and the family.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace also said that it will let the courts
decide if there is basis to grant immunity to former first lady
Imelda Marcos in exchange for her testimony to speed up the
recovery of the assets.
</P>
<P>
The palace said it would provide Mrs. Marcos with security
should she request for it.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said he did not see any
legal impediment to future compromise talks with the Marcoses
because the Estrada administration has long committed to making
the negotiations public and transparent.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said President Joseph
Estrada remains open to a possible compromise with the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
But the compromise, he said, would be hinged on four
conditions: "the family members speak as one, the negotiations are
publicly disclosed and transparent, the compromise agreement will
benefit the government and the Filipino people, and it is with
judicial approval."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of the Philippines Wednesday voided the
compromise agreement signed by the government in 1993 on 570
million U.S. dollars in Swiss deposits and other assets of the
Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
The court meanwhile ordered the Presidential Commission on Good
Government to make public all settlements to be forged with the
Marcoses on recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth of the
family.

was declared to be the residence of the Belorussian President. EU
diplomats argued that their residences, located within the Drozdy
complex, were protected by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations and therefore did not want to move out.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed to try to secure long-term contracts for
the EU mission heads to move into new residences, which the EU
hoped to take over as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
EU diplomats will return to Minsk after the new residences are
ready and then withdraw from their rented residences in the Drozdy
complex within one month.
</P>
<P>
The existing lease agreements with the diplomats will be
considered terminated once the diplomats vacate their residences,
the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is ready to provide compensation, the amount of which
will be determined by "bilateral agreements starting without delay
after European ambassadors have vacated their residences" in the
complex.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Free From Fear and Want: Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese human rights
expert has stressed that the Chinese people now enjoy freedom from
fear and want, proclaimed as "the highest aspiration of the common
people" in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights issued by the
United Nations 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"They also realize that their human dignity is respected and
that equality is a continuing and ongoing priority," declared Zhu
Muzhi, president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies.
</P>
<P>
"The release of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was a
landmark event in the struggle of people worldwide for human
rights," said Zhu, speaking at a Beijing forum marking the 50th
anniversary of the publication of the Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration, which followed victory in the world's battle
to defeat Fascism, reflects the common aspirations of people
across the globe to eliminate any and all barbarous acts against
human life and to safeguard its dignity, commented Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese people had begun fighting for
their human rights way back in the mid 19th century in the then
uneven struggle against imperialism, but didn't succeed until the
the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) showed the
way forward.
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidance and leadership of the CPC, the Chinese
people finally earned independence and liberation, and have since
achieved constant progress in various aspects of human rights,"
Zhu continued. "And they now enjoy such fundamental rights as
subsistence and development within the whole political, economic,
social and cultural spectrum." he added.

<P>
Zhu said that China's Constitution and other laws all have
explicit stipulations protecting the people's human rights, which
include political equality, freedom of speech and association,
freedom of worship, personal liberty, the right to work and
education, and the right to sue government officials.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he insisted that everyone in China is entitled to all
the above-mentioned freedoms and rights, without distinction of
any kind in respect of nationality, sex or religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the great improvement in China's human rights
conditions to the theory of "building socialism with Chinese
characteristics", which was initiated by the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"This theory fits in perfectly with China's national conditions
and will lead to a fundamental solution for China's human rights
issues," said Zhu. "It will help provide human rights protection
for the entire people instead of only a few persons."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that within the international community there
are now various prevailing attitudes about human rights conditions
in China; some of them are kind and friendly suggestions and
should be taken seriously and accepted at face value, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, there are also some people that don't understand
China's situation and require us to follow their own example. For
them we have to patiently explain the differences," said Zhu.
 "There are even those with ulterior motives who try to use human
rights as a pretext to achieve their secret and dark goals. We
will make every endeavor to expose them and refute their
ill-informed allegations."

<P>
However, Zhu also conceded that China's human rights conditions
are still far from perfect and agreed that there is a long way to
go before the Chinese people are completely free from fear and
want and enjoy full dignity and equality.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the 15th National Congress of the CPC, which was
held in Beijing in September 1997, had attached great importance
to protecting human rights in China and guaranteeing the Chinese
people's various rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
"At present, our major task is to fully implement the decision
of the 15th National Party Congress and further expand our
people's right to subsistence and development and other human
rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing country, China has made a
tremendous contribution to the world's human rights cause by
greatly improving human rights conditions for its 1.2 billion
people, which represents nearly one fourth of the world population,
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"As our country keeps on developing, we can surely make more
and greater contribution to human rights development worldwide,"
he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Regrets Moody's Rating Demotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The China Export and Import
Bank (Eximbank) today expressed deep regret over Moody's recent
lowering of its long-term foreign currency debt rating.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua this afternoon, the vice-president
of Eximbank, Zhu Degui, said that it's hard to understand and
deeply regrettable that Moody's has lowered the bank's long-term
foreign currency debt rating from A3 to Baa1.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons stated in Moody's announcement concerning the
downgrade failed to tally with our actual situation and is
unfair," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Eximbank is a wholely state-owned policy-oriented
financial institution, directly under the State Council, providing
policy financial support to the country's electrical and machinery
products exporters.
</P>
<P>
"To reach this policy target, the central government has
provided Eximbank with comprehensive capital support and a series
of preferential policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said all the details regarding the bank's operations were
included in a report presented to Moody's for their annual
ratings, and this report showed the bank's asset status is "very
good" and that there is "no problem of any deterioration."
</P>
<P>
He explained that Eximbank is a new bank which assumed no
assets or liabilities from any other bank or institution when it
was founded in 1994. Over the past few years it has enjoyed
constant improvement in its own financial strength and support
from the central government.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Some four million out of the 20
million Nigerian children do not have access to basic education,
according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Presenting "The State of the World's Children Report for 1999"
on Wednesday, UNICEF officer-in-charge in Nigeria, Stella Goings,
said that gender-based inequalities form part of the low access
to education by girls particularly in the northern states of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Goings said that the phenomenon of early withdrawal of boys
from schools is a matter of growing concern in the southeastern
states of the western African country.
</P>
<P>
About 49 percent of Nigeria's adult population are able-bodied
illiterates while women form the overwhelming majority of those
lacking in basic education, This Day newspaper Thursday quoted
Goings as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF official said that efforts are being made by the
Nigerian government in cooperation with the UNICEF to bring the
benefits of education to the Nigerian people.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has been undertaking a 1997-2001 program designed
to address the education problem in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has already mapped out strategies to revolutionize
education in Nigeria through the development and implementation
of Non-Formal Education (NFE) curricula for girls and boys from
Koranic schools and other non-formal education systems, Goings
added.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of NFE initiative is aimed at improving
access to education for marginalized groups, particularly girls
through Koranic schools and vocational centers, she said.

<HEADLINE> DRC Denies Kabila's Branding S. Africa as Puppets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Embassy of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in South Africa Thursday
categorically denied local reports that President Laurent Kabila
has branded South Africa as "puppets of aggressors."
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, Pierre Mahinga, a DRC
embassy official in charge of protocol and media affairs, said
that Kabila could not have made such remarks.
</P>
<P>
Mahinga said the so-called rebels, not South Africans, are
puppets of aggressors.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the rebels are using South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The point is the aggressors are using South Africa," he said.
"South Africa does not understand the whole situation in the
DRC."
</P>
<P>
The DRC official complained that South Africa does not
understand that the current war in the DRC was not an internal
problem.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is invaded by foreign troops," he said. "We know
we've got internal problems, but we don't want our neighboring
countries to intervene."
</P>
<P>
"All we want from South Africa is to condemn Uganda and Rwanda
for invading our country, and they (South Africa) have to
recognize that the so-called rebels are puppets of Rwanda and
Uganda."
</P>
<P>
He denied that there are rebels in his country.
</P>
<P>
"If they are rebels, they can't allow Rwandan and Ugandan
troops to loot our gold and take it to Kigali and Kampala."
</P>
<P>
He severely condemned Rwanda and Uganda, saying that the two
countries are trying to destabilize the DRC for their own gains.
</P>
<P>
"They are mad about our country, about what we've got," said
the DRC official.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) Thursday quoted a South
African Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that the branding of
South Africa as "puppets of aggressors" by DRC President Kabila
was most unfortunate because it was untrue.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that the rebels are a factor in the eastern part
of the DRC, more particularly that they are the ones carrying
arms and waging an insurgency against the government," spokesman
Marco Boni was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Boni said South Africa believed that unless this fact was
accepted, there would be no progress in finding a solution to the
crisis in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's position remains unchanged since the
signing of the Pretoria declaration in August that it is critical
that a cease-fire be implemented without delay, and that it
should be followed by the withdrawal of all foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
"This is in the interest not only of the Congolese, but of the
entire region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The civil war started in the DRC in early August when the
Tutsi-led rebels launched a drive to topple Kabila, who had
ousted long-time dictator Mobuto Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda are allegedly backing the rebels while
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad are supporting Kabila.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has played a primarily mediating role and, along
with other African countries, it has hosted meetings which
attempted to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Two more meetings are to be held next week -- one in Lusaka on
Monday and another in mid-December in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso,
led by the Organization of African Unity.

<HEADLINE> China Marks 50th Anniversary of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The China Society for Human
Rights Studies today held a commemorative meeting marking the 50th
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a letter of congratulations
to the society.
</P>
<P>
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the first
specific U.N. document on human rights issues, Jiang said in his
letter.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration has played an active role in guiding the
development of international human rights theory and practice, and
has pushed forward the progress of this cause, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have combined the universal
principles of human rights with the specific national conditions
in China, making great efforts to promote and protect human rights
and scored outstanding achievements, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to strengthen the socialist democratic and
legal system and implement the rule of law," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China will further push forward the progress of human rights in
the country and fully safeguard the democratic rights and freedoms
of the Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, president of the society, said the Chinese
people began to fight for their human rights in the middle of the
19th century, but did not succeed until they found the leadership
of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people finally
won independence and liberation, and have achieved constant major
progress in various aspects of human rights, such as the right to
subsistence and development, and political, economic, social and
cultural rights," Zhu said.

<P>
After the founding of new China on October 1, 1949, the Chinese
people were provided with adequate food and clothing, and more
recently have begun to enjoy a comfortable life, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are basically free from fear and want,
proclaimed "the highest aspiration of the common people" in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and enjoy dignity and
equality, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zhu noted that the 15th the CPC National Congress,
which was held in Beijing in September 1997, attached great
importance to the protection of human rights in China, and
guaranteed the Chinese people's various rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
"At present, our major task is to fully implement the decision
of the 15th National Party Congress and further expand our
people's right to subsistence and development and other human
rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 human rights experts and scholars from colleges
and universities, research institutes and governmental bodies
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They all praised the Declaration and said they esteem it as the
origin and basis of development for international human rights in
theory and in practice.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing nation, China should seize
opportunities, deal with challenges, and study the new situation
together with the international community, they concurred.
</P>
<P>
The society focuses on researching human rights theory and
practice, cooperating with their international counterparts, and
advancing human rights progress in China and the progress and
development of humanity.

<HEADLINE> Fund Managers Optimistic About Malaysia's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Most fund managers are
optimistic about the performance of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange and expect the key Composite Index (CI) to touch the
750-point level before the first half of 1999, Nik Ezar Nik Bolia,
vice-president of the Federation of Malaysian Unit Trust Managers,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 750-point level is achievable as the CI's component
companies are mostly well-structured, he told reporters after the
federation's annual general meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Nik Ezar said that at present the CI is hovering around 500
points, thus presenting a good opportunity for investors to buy
unit trusts for long term investment. In five years, the CI could
rebound to 1,000 points, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fund managers also expect to see more money coming into Asian
markets in January and February next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition, the World Bank has also made a
favorable projection that Malaysia's gross domestic product would
grow by 1 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the capital control measures introduced by the
government in September this year had somehow helped foreigners
who had kept their funds in Malaysia as there was no risk in
currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether foreign fund managers would inject
their funds in Malaysia with the existence of the capital control
measures, Nik Ezar said, "That has yet to be seen."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federation's President Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi
said the unit trust fraternity feels that the value of unit trust
would climb to 35 billion ringgit (about 9.21 billion U.S.
dollars) by June next year from 28 billion ringgit (about 7.368
billion dollars) in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The expected increase in unit trust value would come from the
sale of new funds and efforts to register all unit trust agents
so that investors' confidence would be built up further, he said,
adding that all the 16,568 unit trust agents in the country would
have to sit for an examination called Unit Trust Pre-Registration
Examination from next year.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the best ways to gauge the market is to look at
the number of funds launched so far.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Azim said that if the market is receptive there would be
more funds launched.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, eight new funds were launched by eight
companies, he said, adding that at present, there are 88 unit
trust funds in circulation.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Chief Calls for Better Protection of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata on Thursday urged
governments to renew their commitment to asylum as the cornerstone
of refugee protection.
</P>
<P>
In a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, Ogata said: "Promoting respect for
human rights values and creating conditions which make it possible
for refugees to return home cannot be done by humanitarian
agencies alone".
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR chief said "Eliminating the causes of refugee flight
requires continued commitment and timely political involvement by
the international community."
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad fact that 50 years after the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights was adopted, violations of basic human rights continue to
create refugees in many parts of the world," Ogata said. "That is why
the institution of asylum remains indispensable."
</P>
<P>
"Today, one in every 120 people on earth has been forced to flee
because of violence or persecution," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR statistics, 1998 has seen the outbreak of
several fresh conflicts which have generated new refugee
flows. 215,000 people fled from Sierra Leone, where rebel forces
have committed terrible atrocities against civilians.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leoneans are now Africa's biggest refugee population,
numbering 440,000 in Guinea and Liberia. The outbreak of open
conflict in Kosovo forced more than a quarter of a million people to
flee their homes.

BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai-Cambodian border in
Thailand's eastern province of Trat will be reopened soon for the
transportation of processed wood from Cambodia to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai News Agency reported on Thursday that the reopening would
become reality since peace had returned to the border area on the
Cambodian side.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently has large quantity of processed wood
stranded in Cambodia and is eager to bring back the wood.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful situation has allowed a Thai logging company,
which has a 25-year logging concession in Cambodia, to resume
operation there.
</P>
<P>
The company is seeking approval from the Thai Interior Ministry
to reopen border checkpoints in Trat to import the stranded
processed wood. Sources close to the ministry said a decision to
reopen the border would soon be made.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Divers Sweep in Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese divers made a clean
sweep of all four gold medals at stake after they bagged the last
two with Zhou Yilin and Cai Yuyan putting on world-class
performances here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, 24, amassed to 712.020 points for the gold in men's
three-meter springboard, beating teammate Yu Zhuocheng by 2.9
points. Suchart Pichi of Thailand was third in 654.750.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Cai garnered 549.570 points, only 1.77 points
more than the runner-up Li Na..
</P>
<P>
The duel between Zhou and Yu was thrilling as the latter gain a
2.7-point lead in the penultimate round with an inward 3-1/2
somersaults, which was awarded 84.660.
</P>
<P>
But the dive that made the difference at the Thammasat
University aquatic center was Zhou's last attempt, also a 3-1/2
somersaults which earned him 89.760 points, the highese score in
the field.
</P>
<P>
"The competition is of world class with our two divers both
surpassing 700," said Chinese diving coach Hu Enyong. "If Dmitry
Sautin of Ukraine was here, he would have been scared at the high
score."
</P>
<P>
Sautin, who claimed the golds in three-meter springboard and
platform in the world champioships in Perth, Australia in January,
is the nemesis of Chinese divers in these two events in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
But Zhou was confident to turn the table on this tough
Ukrainian. He said: "If he was here today, I would have beaten
him. My next goal is to defeat him in the Sydney Olympics."
</P>
<P>
The China's soaring sylphs of the platform won the top two with
barely a splash. Their superiority was so large that even the
bronze medallist Choe Myong-Hwa of the People's Democratic
Republic of Korea was 50.22 points shy of Cai.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for me to enter the Asian Games, and
I'm very happy to win a gold," Cai said. "My next goal is to win
the Olympic gold for China," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese diving team vice team manager Zhou Jihong, who brought
China the first diving gold at the 1984 Olympics, was very pleased
with her proteges' performances.
</P>
<P>
"Their shows today are nearly flawless, and they brought their
best," She said.

<HEADLINE> Hard Times Await Nigerians in 1999: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians should prepare for
more hard times in 1999 as a result of fluctuating oil price in
the international market, Nigerian Finance Minister Mallam
Ismaila Usman has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told members of the Abuja chapter of the Finance
Correspondents Association Wednesday that the 1998 budget which
was initially premised on 17 U.S. Dollars per barrel of oil is
no longer realized and has to be brought down to 13 Dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he added, the situation has continued to
deteriorate as the price of Nigerian crude oil had recently been
down to 10 Dollars per barrel at the international market, media
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We think that we have to face the reality of a very tight
budget or at least a deficit budget in 1999," the Nigerian
minister was quoted as saying in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Nigerian government would exercise
"extreme caution" in the preparation for next year's budget which
may base the fiscal estimates for next year on 13 Dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
Usman noted that a more aggressive revenue drive would be
pursued through further expansion of the taxation net,
strengthening the gas, solid minerals and agricultural sectors,
savings from re-prioritized projects and proceeds from yet-to-be
privatized public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of tax expansion, the minister said: "We
intend to look at VAT with a view to bringing in those items that
were formerly exempted."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economy of the average Nigerian was still
deplorable and further introduction of new taxes would worsen the
situation."
</P>
<P>
On his meetings with the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, Usman expressed hope that the country would get
debt relief from its foreign creditors soon.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that officials from his ministry had been meeting
with officials from the Bretton Woods Institutions and set a
stage for more serious discussions on debt rescheduling and
relief by early next year.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that two billion Dollars set aside
annually to service external debt are grossly inadequate in
comparison to the volume of the country's debt portfolio which
stood at some 27 billion Dollars at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Usman warned that Nigerians should expect a tight budget in
1999 as the government will approach it with extreme caution.

Recently he cooperated with Professor Zhou Jiyan at Nanjing

"It is based on the interaction between Chinese and Japanese
culture over the centuries and I hope it will be handed down
through the generations, indicating that we can live together
peacefully," said Hidemi Kondo.

Meanwhile, American student Iobie Meyer, a Ph.D in Chinese

Frequently she is the first visitor to arrive in the library
and the last one to leave, such is her dedication.
</P>
<P>
Iobie noted that she has already read all the ancient books
about Yangzhou available in the library and has also collected
much valuable information about local culture in Yangzhou City.
</P>
<P>
The blonde woman's devotion to ancient Chinese books has
impressed many librarians and they often invite her to join them
in the dining hall for lunch.
</P>
<P>
Iobie said, "These wonderful books have helped me learn more
about the Chinese people; and the more I read the more I like
them."
</P>
<P>
Gong Aidong, deputy curator of the Nanjing Library, said that
making available these old books to foreign readers and students
is just another tremendous benefit gained from China's hugely
successful reform and opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
He added, "Twenty years ago they were dismissed as merely
representing the dregs of feudal society."
</P>
<P>
"In those days of change and challenge no one could read them
without special permission from the cultural authorities." Gong
went on.
</P>
<P>
However, since the mid-1980s, and specifically in more recent
years, their wide availability has served as links to many
international cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, more than 2,000 foreign readers and
students from 20 different countries, including Japan, the United
States, Germany, Australia and the Republic of Korea, have visited
the Nanjing Library because of its fantastic collection of antique
books.
</P>
<P>
Now a number of major foreign libraries, including the American
Library of Congress, the Russian State Library and the Australian
National Library, have sent delegations to Nanjing Library in
order to engage in academic exchanges aimed at swapping methods

<HEADLINE> First Pakistan Business Summit to Be Held in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The first ever Pakistan
business summit will be held in the first week of January 1999 to
set pace for the year to become the year of growth, official
sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the event has been organized as part of the
Pakistan 2010 Program to start the new year with hope and a
renewed zeal.
</P>
<P>
About 250 economic leaders representing finance, agriculture,
business, entrepreneurs, analysts and other economic fields will
participate in the day-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
The summit will provide an opportunity to promote the idea of
private sector-public sector partnership in various economic
activities, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which came into
power in February 1997, has announced a number of packages for
agriculture, industry, banking and stock market which saved the
country from collapse and put it back on the track of development,
the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
They said that before May 28 when Pakistan carried out its
nuclear tests, Pakistan's economy had started showing signs of
resilience, with inflation down to single digit, and the
agriculture sector and the industrial sector showing signs of
robust growth.
</P>
<P>
However, due to post-nuclear tests sanctions, all the programs
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were
suspended, creating serious difficulties for Pakistan on account
of balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
But the sources were confident that with the agreement with
IMF, Pakistan's balance of payments position will improve and will
be back on track.
</P>
<P>
The business summit will have extensive deliberations to
suggest concrete proposals for expediting the country's recovery
process and steering it towards the cherished goal of
self-reliance, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Fighter Crash Site Spotted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Search-and-rescue teams
spotted a crater and fragments of a missing Su-27 fighter Thursday
in Far Eastern Russia, but the pilot has not been found.
</P>
<P>
The jettison seat was missing at the crash site, raising hope
that the pilot, Maj. Alexei Kitayev, could still be alive,
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Ongoing efforts are intensively made to search for the pilot.
</P>
<P>
The fighter jet, on a test flight after it had had two engines
replaced in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, disappeared Wednesday over
Russia's Far Eastern territory of Khabarovsk.
</P>
<P>
The Su-27 is one of the most reliable and modern fighters in
the Russian air force. The former Soviet Union launched its design
work in 1969 to counter the F-15 fighter of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mass production began in the mid-1980s. It is believed to be
the most powerful mass-produced aircraft in its class.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1988, the Su-27, manufactured in
Komsomolsk-on-Amur and exported to a dozen countries, set 27 world
records in climb velocity and flight ceiling, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
December has been seen as a bad month for the Russian air force
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, three Su-27 fighters from an elite air force
group crashed in Vietnam. On December 10, 1996, a MIG-25
fighter-bomber hit boulders during takeoff and caught fire in
Monchegorsk, northwest Russia.
</P>
<P>
One week later, an AN-12 transport plane crashed in Tver
region, northwest Russia, killing commander of the Leningrad
military district Sergei Seleznyov. The same day a MI-8 helicopter
crashed in Malino near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, an AN-124 Ruslan transport plane carrying two
Su-27 fighters crashed in a residential area in Irkutsk, Siberia,
killing 72 people.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Ports of Entry in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China will spend over 20
billion yuan (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the next ten years to
improve port of entry facilities linking Guangdong Province with
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The plan, designed to cope with the ever increasing passenger
and cargo flow, includes upgrading existing facilities and new
construction, and will be carried out mainly in Shenzhen and
Zhuhai, neighboring Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of construction, which will cost over two
billion yuan, includes a joint-checking building at the Gongbei
Port of Entry in Zhuhai, the Lianhua (Lotus) Bridge linking Zhuhai
with Macao, a passenger outlet at the Huanggang Port of Entry in
Shenzhen, and outlets in cities and counties neighboring Shenzhen
and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, involving 20 billion yuan, includes railway
and highway passages in the western districts of Shenzhen and Hong
Kong, and the Lingdingyang Bridge linking Zhuhai with Hong
Kong. Hong Kong will also cooperate in the second-phase
construction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over the past 20 years, Guangdong Province
alone has spent over eight billion yuan to improve port of entry
facilities. The province now has 190 major ports of entry opened
to overseas passengers and vehicles, capable of handling 150
million tons of cargo and 100 million passengers a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of
the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) left here after
two-hour talks Thursday morning with Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi, focusing on foreign troops withdrawal from DRC.
</P>
<P>
At a see-off at the airport, Moi told reporters that they have
discussed the the prospects of a ceasefire in the DRC and made a
joint call for the unconditional pull-out of foreign troops from
the third largest African state.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also urged the European Union and the United
States to "assist in ending the Congolese war" which erupted on
August 2.
</P>
<P>
They have negotiated their positions for the meeting of the
Organization of African Union (OAU) over the DRC truce, which is
expected to open in Burkina Faso on December 18.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy... that President Moi totally supports the
positions of the DRC government," DRC Ambassador to Kenya, Kyumgu
wa Kumwamza told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the DRC government will not negotiate at
any occasion with the rebels fighting to overthrow the DRC
government.
</P>
<P>
The DRC government can only sign the truce pact after the
withdrawal of the troops from Uganda, Rwanda which support the
Congolese rebels, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Ceasefire should be effective immediately after those
uninvited foreign troops withdraw. Then the international forces
can come in and monitor the ceasefire," he said in French.
</P>
<P>
It is due to the U.S. support that these foreign troops
inside his country can be "fancially maintained" by now, said
Kumwamza.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who came to power in May 1997, jetted into the Kenyan
capital Wednesday evening, on his way from Lusaka, Zambia, to
Kinshasa.

TOKYO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower in

by high-tech blue chips, to top the 15,000 line before the morning

However, the stocks lost ground in late trading due to profit
taking, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks Clemency For Detained Filipino Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it is trying to seek clemency for eight overseas
Filipino Workers (OFWs) detained in Saudi prisons.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Thursday morning, Under-secretary Leonides
Caday of the foreign affairs department said that President Joseph
Estrada has appealed to Saudi King Fahad Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud to
grant clemency to Violeta Miranda and seven other OFWs.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada signed Wednesday night a letter asking the
Saudi government to release Miranda, who has been cleared of drug
smuggling charges, Caday said.
</P>
<P>
The other seven OFWs were convicted earlier in Saudi Arabia for
robbery with murder.
</P>
<P>
Caday allayed fears that Miranda, a 51-year old nurse, faces
beheading in Saudi Arabia, saying that such an apprehension is
baseless as there has been no conviction in the first place.
</P>
<P>
About 4.5 million OFWs are working in Asia, the Middle East and
other parts of the world. As OFWs infuse at least six billion U.S.
dollars into the Philippine economy annually, they have been
regarded as "new heroes" of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher  Thursday, gaining more than half a U.S. cent as the
U.S. dollar lost ground against the Japanese Yen.
</P>
<P>
BNP senior strategist, group treasury Clifford Bennett said
that the gains were impressive, but warned that the short term
trend for the domestic unit would be down.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished on its highs here at 62.00 U.S.
cents from 61.43 late Wednesday, after hitting a low during the
day of 61.54 cents.
</P>
<P>
"Today's rally is quite impressive, but it hasn't changed the
trend as yet," Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
"While we are under 62.35 U.S. cents the trend is still down in
the short term."
</P>
<P>
The market received a "little bit of a kick-on" from the
weakening U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bennett said Thursday's jobs figures from the Australian Bureau
of Statistics (ABS) made traders a little nervous at first but
bearish fears did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
The ABS reported that the unemployment rate for November was a
seasonally adjusted 8.0 percent, from 7.7 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 72.94 Japanese yen from 72.96
and 1.0331 German marks from 1.0240.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Worried About Competition From Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada has proved
successful at luring production of television movies and cable
programs from Hollywood, a threat to undermine the U.S. film
industry, reports from the entertainment capital said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, Canada has tempted Hollywood television
and movie productions to its provinces such as Vancouver and
Toronto with the incentives of lower costs, tax breaks and a
growing pool of skilled crews, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
Films start in Canada are running at nearly double their 1997
pace, with each of the nation's provinces aggressively courting
film business from Hollywood, the latest issue of Screen
International unveiled.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that nearly 60 percent of the production in
Canadian province of Ontario is American, with joint U.S.-Canadian
productions making up 23 percent. Canadian productions account for
only 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Hollywood sources' estimation, 11,251 U.S. jobs
will be lost during the 1998-99 TV season due to foreign
competitive production, mostly in Canada, compared with 2,673 jobs
lost three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Both Hollywood unions and California State officials also
claimed worry that the economics of doing business in Canada will
be increasingly seductive, since most U.S. studios and producers
are under intense pressure to control soaring costs.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to encourage producers to look longer and harder at
taking their productions to Canada," said Bryan Unger, assistant
executive director of the Directors Guild of America, one of the
most vocal groups on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But Canadian officials denied that productions are migrating to
their country in high volume, arguing that Canada's film industry
is still tiny compared with California's.
</P>
<P>
"People overstate the amount of production we do in
Canada. We've grown quickly and we've grown a lot, but compared to
California we're not even on the radar," said Pete Mitchell, a
director from Canadian province of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
The production in his province amounts to only 1.8 percent of
California's, Mitchell added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Continue Mock Raids on Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli fighter-bombers
Thursday continued panicking Lebanese residents by breaking the
sound barrier over Beirut for the second straight day.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli jet swooped low over Beirut at 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT)
at supersonic speed, causing two massive sonic booms which rattled
windows and set off car alarms all over the city.
</P>
<P>
Cars grounded to a halt and residents ran for shelter in shops
and apartments blocks, fearing the explosions were an air raid as
the 1996 Israeli air and artillery blitz against the country were
still vivid in their memory.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, Israel launched the "Grapes of Wrath" offensive
against Beirut and southern Lebanese villages, during which almost
200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in three-and-a-half years that Israeli
warplanes had broken the sound barrier at such a low level over
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a total of seven Israeli soldiers were killed by
Lebanese guerrillas' bombing ambushes in south Lebanon where
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army, much weaker than the powerful Israeli military,
has symbolically responded by firing anti-aircraft missiles at
Israeli jets, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also conducted mock raids over Lebanon's
southern cities of Sidon, Tyre and Iqlim Toufah area.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police on Alert Against Somali Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has
intensified security in northern Arusha Region bordering Kenya to
curb possible surprise attacks by Somali bandits in the
forthcoming Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohammed said
in a statement released Thursday that a 300-strong police force
was manning security in Ngorongoro District in the region.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who has just concluded a visit to Arusha, said
that Kenya and Tanzania have made arrangements to cooperate in
the operation against the Somali bandits because the culprits
also launched similar attacks on Kenyan villages.
</P>
<P>
Last month, armed with submachine guns and pangas, a group of
Somali cattle rustlers allegedly coming from Kenya looted at Diri
and Malambo villages in Ngorongoro District and shot dead nine
Maasai residents.
</P>
<P>
The raid was in retaliation to the killing of several bandits
by local policemen in August when they murdered a senior police
officer, the former Ngorongoro Officer Commanding District (OCD),
Isaya Kon'goa.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that the crackdown on the Somali bandits,
originally planned to end last month, will continue in
collaboration with the Kenyan policemen to make sure that harmony
is restored in the area.
</P>
<P>
"We are cooperating with Kenyan authorities in the operation
by exchanging information and launching simultaneous crack-downs
on our respective sides of the border," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the once reluctant residents of that
area are now ready to participate fully in security operations,
asking the government to provide them with militia training to
combat future raids.
</P>
<P>
"Militia training for residents of Ngorongoro District would
be part of a long-term solution to maintain harmony in the area
owing to its size, sparse population and the large distance
between police posts," he added.

push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also warned that there will be no continuation of the
peace talks if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat continues
encouraging violence on the West Bank, making statements regarding
a unilateral declaration of statehood, and calling for the release
of the Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remark when meeting with the U.S. Middle
East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz
</P>
<P>
-- A Palestinian youth was killed on Wednesday near the West
Bank city of Ramallah by Israeli soldiers and some 270 other
Palestinians were wounded in widespread clashes on the West Bank

<P>
CHONGQING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Customs Office of
southwestern China's Chongqing Municipality this year uncovered 23
smuggling cases, 44 percent more than the corresponding period
last year, involving 130 million yuan (15.7 million U.S.dollars),
up nearly 400 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Customs Office also has reduced the number of
duty evasion and fraud cases by 30 percent this year by
strengthening their overall operations.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials checked more than 1,000 account books and
thousands of Customs declaration forms during their investigation
of over 20 enterprises, recovering 4.7 million yuan (567,000
U.S.dollars) in tariffs and value-added duty on imports;
another 60 million yuan (7.2 million U.S.dollars) worth of duty
evasion cases are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has a serious smuggling problem because, as an inland
port of entry, about 85 percent of the city's imports and exports
are transferred at coastal harbors, providing opportunities for
smuggling activities, especially at the end of the year peak
period.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment rate
bounced back to eight percent in November as the number of people
in both full-time and part-time work fell.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Gives Top Protection to Tibetan Antelope: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration
of Forestry today issued a report on the protection of the Tibetan
antelope in the country, saying that both the Chinese government
and the Chinese people are determined to protect this animal.
</P>
<P>
With its high research value and importance to the natural
ecological system of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Tibetan
antelope is under top state protection in China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government pays great attention to the protection
of Tibetan antelope, and all related hunting and trade are
forbidden," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a number of nature reserves have been
established in major Tibetan antelope habitats. Special
conservation administrations also have been set up, and patrolling
and scientific monitoring work are conducted regularly.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that since 1991, China's forestry police force
has discovered some 100 cases of illegal hunting, confiscated more
than 17,000 pieces of Tibetan antelope skin, and seized nearly
3,000 suspect criminals, the report revealed.
</P>
<P>
"A local official, Soinam Daje, has devoted his life to the
fight against illegal hunters in the Hoh Xil natural reserve," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, despite the severe measures
taken by China, illegal hunting and smuggling activities have not
been stopped, and the Tibetan antelope population continues to
decline.
</P>
<P>
The report made an appealed for international joint efforts to
better protect this rare animal.

Five-year Plan (1997-2002) to educate all children is 400 billion
rupees (about 9.5 billion U.S. dollars), which requires just a 0.5
percent increase in GDP every year.
</P>
<P>
As UNICEF consultant and development economist Shiv Kumar said
on Tuesday, not a single party manifesto in the four-state
assembly elections last month mentioned an improvement in the
quality of elementary education as a priority.
</P>
<P>
A bill which was to make elementary education a fundamental
right, introduced in 1996, is still pending in the Rajya Sabha,
upper house of the Indian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappointing performance, the Ministry of Human
Resource Development has already given up its self-assigned target
of spending 6 percent of GNP on education by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices Up at Nairobi Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Prices of coffee fetched
improved prices this week at the Nairobi Coffee Auctions, as the
50-kg bag hit the 12,900 Shillings (215 U.S. Dollars) mark in the
highest grade AA.
</P>
<P>
The new price for a bag of coffee compares to 201 Dollars
(12,100 Shillings) offered in the same grade during the auction
last week, the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There is an indication of an upward trend particularly of
good quality coffee," the paper quoted Charles Gatere, the chief
liquorer at the Coffee Board of Kenya, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other products in grade AA attracted high prices ranging
between 167 to 215 Dollars, as competition among dealers
intensified in the auction hall, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The total number of bag offered at the auction increased to
18,851 bags this week from last week's 16,299 bags, with the
sales totaling 3,196,375 Dollars compared to 2,447,588 Dollars
recorded last week.
</P>
<P>
The coffee board said it sold all 18,851 bags it offered for
sale, adding that it would offer about the same figure in the
next auction scheduled for January 12, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Antelope Faces Danger of Extinction: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan antelope in China
is now in danger of extinction, the State Administration of
Forestry said today in a report on the protection of the species.
</P>
<P>
"Estimated by the number of illegal hunting cases, about
20,000 Tibetan antelopes have been shot annually in recent years,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Living mainly in high mountain areas of Qinghai, Xinjiang,
Tibet and Sichuan provinces and autonomous regions, China's
Tibetan antelope has long been threatened by illegal hunters who
kill them for their special hair.
</P>
<P>
"Since the end of the 1980s, the Tibetan antelope population
has been declining sharpy because of large-scale hunting," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that there were only 50,000 to 75,000
Tibetan antelopes left in China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"They are now rarely seen, even in many places that used to be
the Tibetan antelope's major habitats, and the animal is now on
the edge of extinction," the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the People's
Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, said today that four
city commercial banks in Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Wuxi and Qingdao
have been ratified to become primary dealers in the PBOC's open
market operations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that presently there are 29 primary dealers
in the central bank's open market operations, which were ratified
in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank will recruit new primary dealers
according to the demand of monetary policies. Financial
institutions which trade bonds with the the PBOC are required to
have good management, comparatively large-scale operations,
high-quality assets and asset-liability management, and adequate
internal risk control.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC will also readjust primary-dealer membership in
accordance with the above-mentioned practices, and increase the
impact of open-market operations on the monetary market to promote
the development of the monetary market, and improve its indirect
regulation mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Demand Makes Tibetan Antelope Protection Difficult: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Forestry said today that the major difficulty in protecting the
Tibetan antelope in the country is the overseas demand for the
fine air of the rare animal.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great pity that while China is fighting a hard battle
against illegal hunters and smugglers, the trade in Tibetan
antelope down -- the animal's fine hair -- and related products
still exist in some countries and regions," the administration
said.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of illegal hunting is to get the animal's fine
hair, the administration said in a report on the protection of the
animal.
</P>
<P>
There is no such demand for this product within China, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
"In some places outside China, one kilo of unprocessed Tibetan
antelope down sell for 1,000 to 2,000 U.S. dollars, and a Tibetan
antelope down scarf can cost 5,000 to 30,000 U.S. dollars," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The administration pointed out that high profits stimulate
illegal hunting and smuggling, and the hunters are becoming better
equipped, making it more difficult to protect the animal.
</P>
<P>
The report emphasized that the Chinese people have never made
use of the Tibetan antelope and related products, and that all of
this is consumed outside of China.
</P>
<P>
"International understanding and coordination are needed in
order to better protect the animal," the report said, adding that
all countries and regions, especially those still trading in and
consuming Tibetan antelope down, should take immediate measures to
stop the threat of the animal's extinction.

LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United of England
and Bayern Munich of germany enjoyed a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford
in Manchester on Wednesday and both advanced to the
quarter-finals of the European Champions' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Spanish giant Bacelona beat Brondby of Denmark 2-0
in an away match. But it still failed to qualify from the death
group.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona's Luis Figo and Brazilian midfielder Rivaldo scored
in the 4th and 34th minutes respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the intense Bayern-United encounter, Roy Keane got a
spectacular 43rd minute goal for United. In the 56th minute,
Bayern's Bosnian international Hasan Salihamidzic snatched a
equalizer.
</P>
<P>
Before the match, Bayer piled up 10 points so they only need
one point to ensure the qualification. So did United.
</P>
<P>
However, United manager Alex Ferguson went through a bit nerve
wracking before the equalizer with 10 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who won the European Cup in 1997
with his former club Borussia Dortmund, believed that the two
powers will meet again in the final stages of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Bayern ranked No.1 in the standings while United
qualified as one of the best runners-up with 10 points. Another
qualified runner-up is Spain's Real Madrid with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
Bacelona, finished third place of the Group D and was
eliminated with 8 points.

<HEADLINE> China Has Fewer Water-Related Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China had over 800 accidents
involving ships and boats between November last year and October
this year, a decrease of 19 percent on a yearly basis, according
to a recent national meeting on water transport.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, more than 230 were major accidents, causing
direct economic losses of over 170 million yuan, a reduction of
46.5 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The severe floodings this summer caused a substantial increase
of water-related accidents, but the majority of these involved
individually owned ships and boats, Hong Shanxiang, vice minister
of communications, said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the lackluster transportation market brought
about by the Southeast Asian financial crisis means many
water-transportation companies will reduce spending on safety to
cut their costs.
</P>
<P>
The official urged tougher control and supervision of
water-transportation companies and individuals to further reduce
accident rates.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Rate on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation rate in
November fell to 7.9 percent as against 8.3 percent in October
this year, says the newly published monthly Economic Review from
the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
The CBK said that the three months annualized inflation
remained low at 3.6 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The CBK economic review attributed the low inflation to
the sustained reduction in money supply which tried to be
consistent with the slowdown in production of goods and services
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Stability in the Shilling exchange rate translates into
stability of Shilling prices of imported inputs used in the
production of domestic goods and service," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also attributed the decline to international prices
of most intermediate imports following depressed global demand
occasioned by the economic downturn in some region.
</P>
<P>
However, the transport and communications sector continued to
suffer high inflation due to poor conditions of roads and
inefficient telecommunication services.

</P>
<P>
The growth followed an increase of 9.6 percent in the previous

</P>
<P>
"It is our exporters who will drive New Zealand's return to
strong,
sustainable economic growth," John Luxton, Acting Minister for
International Trade, commented in the statement, after receiving
the
provisional export statistics for October Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"And the continuing improvement in our export statistics
suggests our
exporters are indeed leading us out of difficult times," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed increases in New Zealand's exports to
Australia,

<HEADLINE> National Breast Screening Program Launched in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand launched its
first
national free breast cancer screening program Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The program was suggested by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley in
1995
when she was health minister.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 10 percent of New Zealand women

develop breast cancer and 600 die from it each year.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the launch of the national screening
program,
Prime Minister Shipley issued a statement, urging New Zealand
women in
the at-risk age groups to ensure they have a mammogram (breast
X-ray)
regularly.
</P>
<P>
"The Government recognizes the importance of saving lives by
detecting breast cancer early," she said, adding "if it's detected
early
then the chances of successful treatment are much higher."
</P>
<P>
"Many women treat their own health as a low priority, always
putting
their families first. But breast screening is a relatively simple
procedure with very worthwhile outcomes and I would urge women
between
the ages of 50 and 64 to take advantage of this new free service,"

Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, all women aged 50 to 64 with no
symptoms of
breast cancer would be invited to receive a free mammogram every
two
years.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has
imposed a limit on future spending as it braces itself for three
years
in the red.
</P>
<P>
In its Budget Policy Statement released Wednesday, the
government
forecast a financial deficit of 52 million NZ dollars (27 million
U.S.
dollars) for the current year instead of an earlier planned
surplus of
100 million NZ dollars (52 million U.S. dollars). The current
year's
deficit would be followed by a serious 1.3 billion NZ dollar (676

million U.S. dollar) deficit in 1999-2000 and one billion NZ
dollar (520
million U.S. dollar) deficit in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Thursday quoted Treasurer Bill Birch as saying
that
money penciled in for new policy initiatives in the coming years
has been
pared back from 800 million NZ dollars (416 million U.S. dollars)
to 600
million NZ dollars (312 million U.S. dollars) in response to
gloomy
economic forecasts.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, the New Zealand
Treasury
now expects the economy to grow by just 3.1 percent in the three
years
to 2001, 70 percent less than forecast seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
This year the economy would shrink by 0.9 percent, the Treasury
said,
not by 0.5 percent as forecast in September. It is not expected to
make
strong gains till 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury also expects unemployment to rise from 7.1 percent
in
March this year to 8.7 percent by March next year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Birch as saying that the fiscal policies
announced in
the budget are "no longer sufficiently sustainable over a 10-year
period."
</P>
<P>
"I think there is strong evidence that a recovery is underway
now," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion reported that economists here are "surprised" at
the
extent of the Treasury's revisions. They are of the view that it
has
gone "from being too optimistic at the beginning of the year to
being
too pessimistic now."

BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese young swimmers
performed better than their Japanese counterparts in the ongoing
competitions of the Asian Games, said Barcelona Olympics swimming
gold medallist Zhuang Yong here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese newcomers' performance here is satisfying and I
think they are the hopes of China at the 2000 Sydney Olympics,"
said the 26-year-old Zhuang, who won in the women's 100m freestyle
at the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the Chinese, Zhuang said, the Japanese young
swimmers failed to prove they are strong enough to make a splash
at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Their swimming techniques are not very good and I don't think
they will achieve much at the 2000 Olympics," Zhuang added.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hua, 16, is the most brilliant prodigy in swimming so far.
She grabbed the gold of women's 400m freestyle on Wednesday after
she anchored China to win the women's 4x200m freestyle relay race
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Chen has the ability to rise to the occasion. She is a
swimmer of bright future," said Chinese swimming head coach Zhang
Xiong.
</P>
<P>
Chen's 17-year-old teammate Chen Yan, world record holder of
women's 400m individual medley, however, failed to shine for
suffering diarrhoea. She finished third in her specialty and
withdrew from women's 200m and 400m freestyle events.
</P>
<P>
Chinese young swimmers' show sent some scare to their Japanese
rivals. Takahiro Mori, 18, said after winning the men's 400m
individual medley on Tuesday: "We found the Chinese young swimmers
are very strong. We get nervous when compete against them."

<HEADLINE> Crickets Are Real Treasure For Chinese Farmers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGYANG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The trading of specially bred
crickets in Ningyang County, east China's Shandong Province, has
helped many farmers and rural people prosper with some families
apparently earning thousands of yuan during the season.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cricket lovers travel from cities as far apart as
Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Jinan and even other southeast
Asian countries to pick up cricket bargains in the vast market
places.
</P>
<P>
The routine has been set for many years as at five o'clock in
the early morning with the whole town still in darkness, farmers
arrive outside various hotels with newly caught crickets.
</P>
<P>
Then everyone knuckles down to the real trading as soon as the
keen buyers leave their hotels.
</P>
<P>
As the time moves on more and more tractors, tricycles and
farmers on foot arrive forming a large scale market which
stretches for 5 kilometers along the two sides of the
Jinan-Yanzhou highway.
</P>
<P>
Such is the demand and the money to be made that cricket
catchers come in all shapes and ages from 70-year-old ladies to
eight-year-old kids, all vying with each other to secure the best
prices.
</P>
<P>
All over the county deals are being struck: in the fields,
along narrow roads and throughout almost every village in Ningyang
County.
</P>
<P>
Examples of how breeding and selling crickets can be lucrative
abound. Wang Juemin, 52, was once so poor that he could barely
afford to buy a box of five fen matches. Since latching on to the
cricket trading business he's become so wealthy that he's been
able to afford two new two-story buildings.
</P>
<P>
Wang explains: "I just can't imagine what would have become of
my life if I hadn't got involved in this cricket lark."
</P>
<P>
While Wang is busy brokering cricket deals, his eldest son Wang
Daying discloses that last year they sold 40 crickets for 9,600
yuan (1,156 US dollars) in Shanghai, and then a few days days ago
sold ten for a record price of 8,000 yuan (963.8 US
dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Jiyun, secretary of the Ningyang County Cricket
Research Institute, reveals that by catching and selling crickets
for just two months of the year families can earn between 3,000
yuan (361.4 US dollars) and 10,000 yuan (1,204 US dollars, much
more than they get from farming,
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't cost them a single fen.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, Wang says, as a result many farmers have been
able to increase investment in their farms, built new houses and
even bought motor cycles.
</P>
<P>
The county also boasts 500 households which sell crickets
directly in Beijing and Shanghai. Some of them can earn tens of
thousands of yuan in that short two-month period, Wang declares.
</P>
<P>
Ningyang has a long history of breeding crickets for special
purposes and the county's crickets were acclaimed as the "Number
One Insect in Jiangbei Area" (places to the north of Yangtze
River) as early as the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Even then the
insects were renowned for their size, fierce disposition, ability
to jump long distances and for being tough little scrappers, a
reputation they still have.
</P>
<P>
During the high season almost every village in the county
becomes a center for trading and Wang Jiyuan estimates that nearly
10,000 collectors and fans of the fighting cricket squads visit
Ningyang every year, spending something like 100 million yuan (12
million US dollars) on buying up the best of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
Now Ningyang County has set up a Cricket Research Institute and
published a book, "The Art of Ningyang Crickets", to guide local
farmers in the correct methods for breeding and catching the
little demons.
</P>
<P>
However, traditionally many people believe that getting too
involved in these cricket games can affect a person's progress
both at work and at home. As a result Sheng Hongyan, deputy
secretary of the Ningyang County Committee of The Communist Party
of China, reveals that the county has formulated regulations
prohibiting leading officials and government employees from taking
part in such events.
</P>
<P>
The county has also banned any gambling related to such
activities and has laid down specific guidelines which farmers
must obey when catching and selling crickets.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New PM Eases Mongolian Government Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Great Hural of
Mongolia, or parliament, on Wednesday approved the nomination of
Ulan Bator mayor Janlaviin Narantsatsralt as the country's prime
minister, easing a five-month government crisis.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 is a year of political turbulence for
Mongolia. At its beginning, the Great Hural passed a bill
allowing parliament members to hold governmental posts,
foreshadowing the government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Then on April 22, the ruling Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU),
made up of the National Democratic Party (NDP) and the Social
Democratic Party (SDP), led the Great Hural in dismissing
Mendsaihani Enkhsikhan's government which did not have a single
parliament member.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Great Hural approved the all-parliamentarian
cabinet led by NDP President Tsakhiya Elbegdorj, which soon came
under fire for its behind-the-door merge of the state-owned
Renovation Bank with the private Golomt Bank. After losing a vote
of confidence in the Great Hural, Elbegdorj resigned on July 24.
</P>
<P>
After Elbegdorj's resignation, the MDU nominated four prime
minister candidates one after another, with none of them
acceptable to the Great Hural, thus leaving the country with a
lame-duck interim government until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the political crisis was sparked by internal rows
between the NDP and the SDP.
</P>
<P>
Following the ruling coalition of NDP and SDP winning the 1996
parliament election, its candidate Enkhsikhan formed a government,
but with no parliament members in it causing resentment from MDU
leaders and parliament members, and stepped down.
</P>
<P>
After this, the NDP's internal strifes and its row with the SDP
culminated and forced the new government of Elbegdorj to follow
suit too.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the contradictions between the MDU and the
opposition People's Revolutionary Party, and dispute between the
MDU and President Natsagiin Bagabandi further worsened the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the People's Revolutionary Party called more than
once for a national referendum on the dismissal of the unicameral
Great Hural and early elections if the power vacuum persists.
</P>
<P>
So on November 24, the Mongolian Constitutional Court ruled a
concurrent parliament membership and cabinet portfolio would be in
violation of the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
President Bagabandi and some MDU parliamentarians repeatedly
urged the ruling coalition to nominate a candidate for the
premiership to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the huge pressure, the coalition and the opposition
started talks on the formation of a government.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the coalition nominated Narantsatsralt, not a
parliament member, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
As one of the candidates President Bagabandi recommended,
Narantsatsralt's nonination was immediately approved by the
Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
Now a new prime minister has been chosen in Mongolia, but the
government crisis will not end soon. Observers say Narantsatsralt
will face a difficult task in his cabinet lineup in power sharing;
and his new cabinet will have an even tougher task in dealing with
the current financial crisis to revive Mongolia's crippled
economy.

<HEADLINE> Telecommunications Developing in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- All the villages in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are now connected by
telephone, a Guangxi government official announced.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is the home of twelve major ethnic groups, the Zhuang
people being the largest, and in the past the region has been
limited by its mountainous terrain, so it was behind other areas
in telecommunications until 1990.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Guangxi has attracted overseas
investment and allocated special funds for developing
telecommunications. In recent years, the telecommunications
department of Guangxi has utilized loans from Switzerland,
Germany, Brussels, Finland and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi also set up a series of projects for state-of-the-art
telephones, optic fiber cables, and mobile phones. Now, all
the towns and villages in Guangxi are connected by optic
fiber cables with a total length of 15,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Guangxi earned 3.6 billion yuan of total
income from telecommunications, 400 times that of 1958 when
the Guangxi Autonomous Region was founded.

<HEADLINE> Policy Banks to Expand Public Bidding for Bonds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fact that related bonds can be traded at national interbank
facilities has not only provided buyers with the flexibility to
readjust their capital positions, but has also increased the
varieties of the central bank's open market operations.
</P>
<P>
SDB President Chen Yuan said the bank is establishing a
standard cost effective public bidding mechanism for bond issues
and plans to expand the proportion of related issues subject to
public bidding. The bank is also in the process of developing a
secondary market.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank Vice-President Zhu Degui said his bank also plans to
increase the volume of financial bonds issued through public
bidding. He added that Eximbank is actively researching issue
models, varieties, potential volumes and targeted buyers in order
to offer a wide array of bond classifications to meet the
differing needs of investors.
</P>
<P>
SDB Vice-President Yang Xiaotong described this year's public
bidding as a new issuance model that has lowered the SDB's
fund-raising cost and increased capital resources. He noted the
new system has protected the interests of bondholders and promoted
the development of China's bond market.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out extensive room for improvement in terms
of bond classifications, operations of the new model, and the
organizational structure for underwriters and targeted buyers.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the liquidity of the secondary market is still
relatively low has affected the asset-liability management
capabilities of underwriters, according to Yang. He also pointed
out that the current resale rate for bonds is less than 30
percent, with underwriters holding the major portion of previous
issues.
</P>
<P>
"We're currently considering new measures for improving the
liquidity of the secondary market, increasing bond classifications
and establishing a regular timetable for bond isses," according to
Yang.

<HEADLINE> Policy Banks to Expand Public Bidding for Bonds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's policy banks plan to
expand the proportion of financial bonds issued through public
bidding in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Bank (SDB) and China Export and Import
Bank (Eximbank), two of China's three policy banks, recently
announced that public bidding will play a much greater role in
1999 fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
The two banks successfully used public bidding over the past
few months to issue bonds valued at 36 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The SDB introduced public bidding to bond issues in September
this year when it offered one-year bonds valued at five billion
yuan. Enthusiastic underwriters oversubscribed the issue when the
bidding set the interest rate at 5.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
They responded to the success of public bidding by offering
new bonds over the next two months, with an SDB issue of 25
billion yuan and Eximbank offering bonds valued at six billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The nation's policy banks formerly raised credit capital by
issuing bonds to commercial banks and postal deposit units under
the central bank. However, the new method based on public bids has
offered related organizations an option of whether or not to
purchase bonds, and in the latter case how many to purchase in
line with their capitalization.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the success of public bidding marks a
significant breakthrough in the fund-raising system for China's
policy banks.
</P>
<P>
The public bidding process has helped to establish
complementary relationships between policy banks and commercial
institutions, readjusted the bond structure for the former, and
contributed to developing the nation's monetary and capital
markets, they explain.

<HEADLINE> Bicycle Built for Two Obtains State Patent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A double-seat bicycle
nearly 2 meters long, developed by a Chinese senior engineer,
recently obtained a state patent.
</P>
<P>
The new bicycle has a short body and more speed than the
ordinary bike, said the inventor, Tian Jingxiang.
</P>
<P>
Usually, double-seat bicycle designers at home and abroad place
a middle axle between the crankshaft and the rear axle. To prevent
the two riders from interferring with each other, the required
length between the middle axle and the front crankshaft should be
no less than 60 cm. In this way, the bicycle moves slowly and it
takes a lot of the riders' energy.
</P>
<P>
Tian replaced the fixed rear axle with a short movable axle and
changed the way the chain operates so that the two riders can pedal
independently.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Reservoir Area Attracts 30,000 Professionals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- In the past three years,
some 30,000 non-native professionals have chosen to work in the
Three Gorges reservoir area on the middle reaches of the Yangtze
River, where the world's largest water-control project is now
under way.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Three Gorges Dam will require the
resettlement of 1.2 million local residents, as well as the
relocation of several cities and county seats.
</P>
<P>
Most of the relocation task falls to Chongqing, the country's
newest municipality directly under the central government, and
many professionals are needed for this work.
</P>
<P>
Counties and cities within the Three Gorges Reservoir Area have
all worked out various preferential policies and are offering many
types of preferential treatment to attract more outside
professionals.
</P>
<P>
The Wanzhou Relocation Development Zone, built last March on
the site of the former city of Wanxian, has set up a professionals
exchange center and a job market. It has also released five
documents regarding issues such as the management of professionals
and the duties of the professionals exchange center.
</P>
<P>
A local official said they will soon connect the local job
market with those of other regions to accelerate the influx of
outside professionals.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Plans Massive Farm-Machinery Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province will upgrade most of its outmoded tractors and harvesters
as well as a great number of auxiliary farm machines in the
province's land reclamation zones during the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
The entire upgrading program, beginning next year, will cost
8.67 billion yuan, said Ma Wenqi, head of the Heilongjiang
Provincial Administration of State Farms and Land Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, the huge amount of financing necessary will be
met by overseas investment, raised capital, and funds for upgrading
farm machinery earmarked by the farms themselves.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized farm machinery, such as 160-180
horsepower four-wheeled tractors, 100-130 horsepower caterpillar
tractors, and 150-160 horsepower combine harvesters will be most
welcome, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The province hopes to raise its mechanization level for rice
growing in the province's land reclamation zones to 70 percent by
the turn of the century, and to 90 percent by year 2010. The present
mechanization ratio is quite low.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, some 666,666 hectares of rice are now grown in
Heilongjiang's land reclamation zones, and this area will be
increased to 800,000 hectares in the future.
</P>
<P>
A group of large foreign and domestic farm-machinery
manufacturers already have visited the land reclamation zones to
negotiate business, attend public biddings and promote their own
products.

<HEADLINE> Serbs, Kosovo Albanians Decline US Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Serbs and Kosovo Albanians
declined a U.S. proposal demanding greater self-rule for Kosovo on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Christopher Hill, the U.S. envoy to
the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with concerned parties, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic said the revised formula offered by Hill last week was
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Those present at the meeting agreed that the agreement signed
by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on November 20 should be
the basis for a political solution to the Kosovo issue, the
official Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. proposal conflicted with the main content of
the agreement, they said.
</P>
<P>
A Serbian negotiator dismissed the proposal as "paving the way
for independence for ethnic Albanians," while chief ethnic
Albanian negotiator said the proposal favored the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Seeing a stalled peace process for the embattled Yugoslav
province, Hill headed back to the region and called for stepped up
efforts for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hill met earlier with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and representatives from the European Union after his proposal
incurred negative reactions from both sides of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said the
Yugoslav government would face up to outside pressure that
intended to separate Kosovo from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is an inseparable part of Serbia, Jovanovic said.
Yugoslavia would maintain its positive stance on the Kosovo issue
and continue to hold peace talks but would reject any outside
pressure.

NINGBO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The east China city of Ningbo
City, a port which is rapidly emerging as a major component in the
Shanghai international shipping center, has invested two billion
yuan in transportation projects during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The funding has been been used to construct five highways,

</P>
<P>
Ningbo, located in Zhejiang Province, plans to establish a

<HEADLINE> Zhuang Ethnic Group Drives Away Chicken Devil (1) (Guangxi Ethnic Group Series) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: This is the
last article in a series featuring the rapidly changing lifestyles
and cultures of 11 main ethnic groups, including the Zhuang,
Maonan, Shui and Miao, living in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region which will mark the 40th anniversary of its
founding on December 11.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Zhuang ethnic group living in compact
communities in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
especially people between 40 and 50 years of age, are frightened at
mention of the "chicken devil".
</P>
<P>
Yan Jialaing, 45, recounted his childhood and noted "I would
immediately abandon naughty behavior when my mother mentioned
that the 'chicken devil' was coming."
</P>
<P>
Yan, director of Ethnic Affairs Bureau in Longzhou County,
noted that he is no longer afraid of the "chicken devil", but
nonetheless has lasting childhood memories.
</P>
<P>
"The 'chicken devil' not only brought suffering to large
numbers of people through the history of the Zhuang, but also
frightened outsiders," said Yan.
</P>
<P>
China is home to 55 ethnic groups, with the Zhuang having both
the longest history and largest population. Guangxi's over 16
million Zhuang mainly live in southern and central areas, with the
group accounting for 95 percent of the total population in Longzhou
County.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuang once thought seriously ill and insane
individuals were haunted by the "chicken devil" and relatives would
invite a shaman to perform magic to drive away the evil spirit.
</P>
<P>
The shaman would sing, dance and perform magic before directly
confronting an individual involved and forcing him or her to run
from the house while holding a chicken in his arm.

<P>
The shaman would wave a wooden sword while following closely
behind until the afflicted individual fell to the ground enabling
the chicken to escape. People then believed the shaman had
succeeded in exorcising the "chicken devil".
</P>
<P>
However, the ritual quite often exacerbated illnesses and in
many cases resulted in death. Ironically, related incidents
caused people to fear the "chicken devil" even more.
</P>
<P>
The spread of modern medical science dispelled the myth of the
"chicken devil", and people realized the culprit was in fact
malaria, according to Liang Xianhui, a retired doctor who formerly
worked at the county's epidemic prevention center.
</P>
<P>
Liang was one of the first local doctors to work with the
government's anti-malaria program introduced in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Research revealed that harsh conditions caused the rampant
spread of malaria amongst members of the Zhuang living in
mountainous areas in southern Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
County records show that the incidence rate for malaria in
Longzhou reached as high as high as 80 percent in the 1930s and
1940s.
</P>
<P>
Liang and his colleagues visited every village in the deep
mountains to treat people suffering from malaria, with the small
white tablets used leading to the demise of a large number of
local shaman.
</P>
<P>
"We provided free medical services and had access to ample
supplies," said Liang, adding that the team also treated a number
of shaman in various villages.
</P>
<P>
Local governments joined in the massive anti-malaria campaign
by pooling substantial financial, material and human resources
needed to spray pesticides across vast areas in order to eliminate
causes and control the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria has basically been under control in
Longzhou since the 1980s, with no cases reported since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Every township in the county has a hospital, with clinics
operating in all villages. The county completed an extensive
program to innoculate all local children during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Li Yang, a young farmer in Jinlong Township, simply nodded his
head at mention of the legendary "chicken devil". He said sick
people should seek the help of a doctor.
</P>
<P>
"The township hospital features an extensive array of advanced
equipment, including ultrasound diagnostic equipment," said
Li.

<HEADLINE> By-election Starts in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Voters in northwestern
Bangladesh's Pabna-2 constituency will cast their ballots
Thursday to elect their representative to the Jatiya Sangsad, the
country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The much-talked-about by-election takes place with tight
security provided by the Election Commission, a constitutional
body in charge of the country's general elections and
by-elections, and amid fierce competition between the ruling
Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) and the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The government has declared Thursday as a holiday for
inhabitants of the constituency to facilitate the election.
</P>
<P>
Voting would go on non-stop from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at 402
booths of 81 polling in Pabna, about 200 kilometers northwest of
here.
</P>
<P>
Originally four candidates from different parties were
contesting for the seat of the Pabna-2 constituency, which was
vacated following the death of a BAL member of parliament in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Jatiya Party, the third largest party in parliament,
withdrew its candidate two days before the election, because it
"feels the absence of an election environment" and that the
election would not be "neutral due to the administration's
partisan role."
</P>
<P>
And the BAL and the BNP have accused each other of creating
violence and conspiring to rig the polls.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has considered all the 81 polling
centers as "extremely vulnerable," in terms of the possibility of
clashes between supporters of the two main rival candidates,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic clashes occurred during the past few days. At least 40
people were injured last Saturday in clashes between BAL and BNP
activists over campaigning for the by-election.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,550 security guards, including two companies from the
army, each 157-strong, and 240 personnel from the Bangladesh
Rifles, have been deployed to ensure a peaceful, free and fair
election.
</P>
<P>
For the vote, 81 presiding officers, 402 assistant presiding
officers and 804 polling officers and 81 magistrates would be on
duty to oversee the voting, in which some 188,700 eligible voters
would exercise franchise, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"They would finish duties only when the counting ends," a
returning officer said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Exports, Imports Drop Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade performance
during the first five months (July to November) of the 1998-99
fiscal year remained stagnant as both the exports and imports
dropped dramatically over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures, Pakistan's exports
during the period from July to November declined by 12.3 percent
while the imports in the five months dropped by 19.8 percent over
the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit during the first five months of the current
fiscal year stood at 555 million U.S. dollars. It was 1.021
billion dollars in the same period of the previous fiscal year,
showing a drop of 466 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's export is below expectation due to the post nuclear
test sanctions. In November alone it declined by 20.6 percent,
standing at 612 million dollars as against 771 million dollars in
the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The import bill during the first five months of the current
fiscal year amounted to 3.63 billion dollars, as against 4.52
billion dollars spent in the same period of the 1997-98 fiscal
year, showing a decline of 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the trade performance, sources from the Ministry
of Commerce noted Thursday that although the export performance
was below expectation, imports at the same time were also dropped.
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary imports have been dropped. However, imports of raw
materials are gone up, indicating positive sign for the industrial
sector, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Pakistan's exports in December are to
improve as export of raw cotton, rice and sugar will enter into
arena to boost the exports.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be difficult for Pakistan to realize the
export target of 10 billion dollars for the current fiscal year.
Foreign trade experts believe that the total export for the whole
fiscal year can hardly be expected to exceed upto 8 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Albania Sign Cooperation Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Albania signed two
agreements on economic and social cooperation Wednesday, at the
first day of Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani's visit here.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the avoidance of double taxation and a two-year
program on cooperation in science, education and culture were
signed after Bulgarian President Petar Stoianov and Prime Minister
Ivan Kostov held separate talks with Mejdani, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the leaders focused on the construction of the No.8
trans-European corridor, which will benefit the two countries in
oil transportation and telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
To build an oil pipeline from Bulgaria's Bourgas Port to the
Albanian port of Vlore is part of the corridor project.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed their interest and mutual trust in the
implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
Stoianov said during the talks that the construction of the
corridor depends on the political and economic stability in
Bulgaria and Albania, as well as in neighboring Macedonia where
the corridor also passes through.
</P>
<P>
If some European countries want to speed up the settlement of
conflicts in the Balkans, they should invest more in infrastructure
projects in this region, instead of fielding soldiers, even if
they are in blue helmets performing peace-keeping missions, the
president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kostov believed the conflict in Kosovo could not hinder the
implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo should not be a permanent justification of the delay of
infrastructure projects in south-eastern Europe, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
A joint committee for trade and economic cooperation will meet
here next January on details about the corridor construction.
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Stoianov, a hot-line will be established between the
two presidents to discuss bilateral and international issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Campaign to Promote Reform Bills Gaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai government officials are
beating the drums for a nationwide campaign to promote 11 reform
bills amid mounting criticism from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was aimed at boosting the public and parliamentary
support for the bills, which were moving closer to sealing a major
hard-fought political victory.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai officially launched the campaign
on Wednesday, emphatically insisting that Thailand needs the
reforms bills to tackle private debts of 2.1 trillion baht (50.3
billion U.S. dollars) and to draw foreign investment in order to
jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
Recovery, he said in a nationwide speech, has been slow because
of weak legal tools to handle debt settlement.
</P>
<P>
"We could not have done it (without foreign capital). We are
not strong enough to depend on ourselves simply because we have
not enough capital. We need foreign investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai population increases by about 800,000 each year and
the government could not shoulder the burden of new employment for
all of them, as our land cannot be expanded," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The 11 proposed bills, particularly those covering foreign
investment and bankruptcy, have been submitted to parliament for
approval. Once passed, foreigners would be allowed to buy more
local assets and have greater property rights than before.
</P>
<P>
Five bills are related to debt settlement -- on bankruptcy,
bankruptcy court, foreclosure and other matters associated with
court procedures. The other bills deal with liberalization --
alien business, corporations, condominium and land ownership and
land leasing.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the bills claimed that this would mean the loss of
Thai sovereignty and loss of control of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The opponents, however, failed to capitalize on the live TV
forum on Wednesday during which the public were invited to ask
Chuan and his top economic aides about the merits and potential
drawbacks of the bills.
</P>
<P>
The critics passiveness gave the government a good chance to
hammer home what it wants to achieve through the reform package.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the government managed to paint "the big
picture" for the public, and limited participation by the critics
allowed the government to highlight positive points of the bills.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmahaeminda stated that domestic
private debts have kept bank's non-performing loans high, badly
hurting bank lending capacity and generating a domino effect on
the employment market.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, an effective legal framework is needed to settle
debts and help banks resume normal lending again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi raised several main
reasons why Thailand needs the bills.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, the government wants to create jobs through
foreign investment at a time when local entrepreneurs were saddled
with enormous debts or threatened with insolvency.
</P>
<P>
Second, the country needs to upgrade manufacturing through
foreign high technology to heighten Thailand's competitiveness and
offset the country's shrinking advantage in terms of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
Third, the government wants to expand export markets, and
Foreign investment would bring with new market assess and shore up
local assets prices.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the government does not want to borrow more from abroad
because of high interest rates and Thailand's already enormous
debt burden.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition vowed to push for impeachment of the
government despite the explanation.
</P>
<P>
The New Aspiration Party (NAP), the main opposition, announced
that it would go ahead with filing a motion to the Senate later
this week to impeach the prime minister and finance minister over
the fifth letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), which promises the passage of the 11 bills.
</P>
<P>
The NAP urged the public to launch a peaceful protest or gather

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Reports Slow Growth in Many Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth slowed in
many parts of the United States in November, the Federal Reserve
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Several districts said sales were weaker than expected," while
"manufacturing activity was generally softer, mostly due to output
declines in export-related industries," said the Fed survey known
as the "Beige Book."
</P>
<P>
It said the five regions with slower growth were Atlanta,
Boston, Dallas, Kansas City and St. Louis. The four regions where
growth was unchanged were Chicago, Minneapolis, Richmond and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stronger consumer confidence and lower interest
rates have stimulated home building, mortgage refinancing and a
rebound in commercial construction.
</P>
<P>
The report said that labor markets remained tight in nearly all
regions, but "wage pressures have subsided somewhat."
</P>
<P>
Several districts noted that "some manufacturers were expecting
further reductions in output" and "low prices and weak exports
continued to hammer the natural resource and agriculture
industries," the Beige Book said.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be considered along with other information on
the economy at the scheduled meeting of the Fed policy-makers on
December 22.

<HEADLINE> Asian Record Holder Seeks Second Asian Games at 39 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Asian women's shot put record
holder Li Meisu, 39, said here on Thursday she hopes to win her
second Asian Games gold medal after 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Li, who set one of the oldest Asian record of 21.76 meters in
1988, had skipped all the three Asian Games after she won a gold
at the 1982 Games in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the second time for me to compete in the Asian
Games. After 16 years, I really want to gain a gold again," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Li, a mother of one and the oldest Chinese athlete here, said
the biggest challenge is from Chinese teammate Cheng Xiaoyan.
</P>
<P>
Cheng trailed her to win the silver medal in the Asian Games
trials last October in Beijing with 17.95 meters against her
18.56.
</P>
<P>
"The shotputters from other countris can hardly pose a threat
to us." Li said. "The final will be an all-Chinese affair."
</P>
<P>
The two-time Olympian, fifth placer in Los Angles Games in 1984
and bronze medalist at Seoul in 1988, retired after returning home
from her second Olympics but resumed training in 1994.
</P>
<P>
She has maintained a good shape since, winning three champions
in home competitions and kept her results around 19 meters.
</P>
<P>
But Li was cautious about her gold medal chance because she has
long been plauged with injuries in legs and knees.
</P>
<P>
"I have been training in Chengdu, Sichuan Province in the past
two months," she said. "But the injuries had prevented me from
normal training."
</P>
<P>
"At such an old age, I only want to make another try," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, she won her first international competition after
returning to the field in the 1997 East Asian Games in Pusan,
South Korea, with a shot of 19.07 meters.
</P>
<P>
The veteran was crowned as the continent's champion in the
Asian Championships this summer with 18.63 meters.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Lawyers Offer Concessions to Avoid Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The White House lawyers
reached out Wednesday with a series of concessions and olive
branches to save Bill Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
On the second and last day of the impeachment hearings against
Clinton in relation to the Monica Lewinsky affair before the House
Judiciary Committee, Clinton's lawyers, as his own witnesses,
signaled that he may have lied under oath, would accept a stiff
censure to avoid impeachment, and might be subject to criminal
prosecution after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
Democratic lawmakers, working with the knowledge of the White
House, drafted a tough censure resolution that would reprimand
Clinton for making "false statements concerning his reprehensible
conduct with a subordinate." The resolution flatly said he remains
open to criminal and civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
The moves have been designed to offer political and legal
alternatives to impeachment and appeal to Republicans on the fence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Republicans in the Judiciary Committee prepared
four articles of impeachment, two alleging perjury, one alleging
obstruction of justice, and a fourth alleging abuse of power. They
pressed for a vote by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee is scheduled on
Friday to begin debate on the proposals to make Clinton the second
president in U.S. history to face the prospect of impeachment in
the full House.
</P>
<P>
Approval of at least one count seems assured -- the one
alleging perjury before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
A House vote will occur the following week. Increasingly,
officials on both sides are focusing their energy on the expected
showdown there.

BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Strongman Ayed Khawaideh of
Jordan failed the doping tests in his urine samples, an official
from the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) confirmed here Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
In his A and B samples, Ayed was tested positive for
triamterene, a diuretic which serves either to lose weight or mask
other banned drugs.

This was the first doping case for the Bangkok Asian Games
which features some 6,700 athletes from 41 OCA members in 36
sports.
</P>
<P>
In an urgent meeting this morning, the OCA decided to
disqualify Ayed and order him to leave the Athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan strongman will be punished under the rules of the
International Weightlifting Federation, the OCA said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singapore: Economy Deeper Bitten, But More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The departing 1998 saw
Singapore's economy suffering a deeper bite from the Asian
economic crisis but the city state has become more bullish with a
bigger appetite for the shrinking pie in the region.
</P>
<P>
Just as Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong put it, the financial
typhoon that swept through the region has left behind a trail of
destruction far greater than anyone had imagined and Singapore has
not been immune to the contagion effects of the most severe
economic crisis since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is proud of its "sound economic fundamentals" which
has
made the country the least crisis-affected economy in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, its economy experienced a sharp downturn,
contracting from 7.8 percent last year to 6.2 percent, 1.8 percent
and negative 0.7 percent respectively in the first, second and
third quarter of 1998 and reduced into recession first seen since
1986.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate doubled to 4.5 percent in September from
2.2 percent in March with retrenchments exceeding 20,000, more
than double the number for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has attributed all its economic woes entirely to "the
hostile external environment" which it said is much worse than
what it faced in the 1985-86 recession.
</P>
<P>
Nobody could ignore the fact that Singapore has smartly managed
the financial storm, avoiding a dramatic collapse while remaining
an active player in the global market, especially in the region.
</P>
<P>
But Singapore was slow to react to the economic slowdown,
adopting an attitude of "groping its way in the torrents by
feeling stones."
</P>
<P>
At first, the government was reluctant to take dramatic
measures to challenge the crisis for fear that they might harm
domestic and foreign confidence in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
When voices arose in May calling for aid to companies, little
echoed in response to the SOS signal until more than one month
later when the government announced a 2-billion Singapore-dollar
(about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) off-budget measures at the end of
June to address the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The package failed to stop the rolling down of the wheel of the
economy as expected and was described by some specialists as
trying to put out a burning cartload of faggots with a cup of
water.
</P>
<P>
Growth in all sectors moderated in Singapore in the third
quarter this year and souring relations with neighboring countries
were also seen contributing to the economic woes.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive review of its economic status found that
relative higher business cost has greatly eroded its
competitiveness as neighboring countries significantly devaluated
their currencies and took advantage of the outcome of their
economic expansion and reform in the decade before the crisis
crept into the region.
</P>
<P>
The government did not hesitate to set foot on massive cost
reduction. A 10.5-billion Singapore dollar (about 6.3 billion U.S.
dollars) package came up with an aim to achieve a 15-percent cut
in business cost (amounting to 7 percent of the GDP) and restore
its economic cost competitiveness to the 1994 level.
</P>
<P>
The government warned the people to prepare "to bite the
bullet," and at the same time mounted an effort to patch up
relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The package was designed to reduce business costs by 15 percent
through a 10-percent cut in employers' contribution to employees
account of the Central Provident Fund, a 5-8 percent cut in total
wages as well as cuts and abates in some government taxes and
fees.
</P>
<P>
The measures, apparently not the last resort, are a painful
adjustment to Singapore that has long been an economy with
high-cost, high-wage and high saving rate.
</P>
<P>
The country is forced to give up some high-cost industries and
enterprises and to amend its high-salary policy, as its people
have to
adjust themselves to less income and less comfort although the
change is expected to be slight in terms of their living standard
but significant in terms of their saving rates.
</P>
<P>
The government in adopting the measures is guided by needs to
help companies survive the crisis and compete for market share
during this crisis period, to minimize the cost pressures on
Singapore-based businesses to downsize or relocate so as to
preserve jobs, and to attract more investment and create new jobs
and high value jobs for Singaporeans, thus placing Singapore in a
better position to take advantage of the eventual economic
recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
A battle is surging on across the country to defend
competitiveness and employment as well as social stability.
</P>
<P>
Singapore was slow to prepare a deliberate response to the
crisis. But once it did it showed its smartness and wisdom by
looking beyond the crisis and preparing itself for the eventual
recovery in the region with efforts focused on a bigger share of
the economic pie.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has outlined an eight-prong strategy with a vision to
become an advanced and globally competitive knowledge economy in
the next decade with manufacturing and services as its twin
engines of growth.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is still facing a severe test. It has to build up its
capability to strengthen its competitiveness and overcome its
resource and human limitation, as regional economies would be
stronger in competitiveness after recovering and learning from the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
And the government needs time to persuade citizens to accept
the unwelcome CPF and wage cut. The city state may be able to
influence investors, but it has only limited capability to
increase the external demand for its goods and services, which is
crucial to its recovery.
</P>
<P>
Singapore needs a favorable external environment, but it is
beyond its capability to control the external political and
economic climate, especially taking into account the situation in
Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The big appetite has to be met with plentiful foods. The true
test of a country's resilience is not only its ability to make
vision but also its ability to realize it. The recovery of
Singapore's economy will largely depend on the health of the
external environment.
</P>
<P>
The government is forecasting a 0.5 to 1.0 percent growth for
this year and warned that next year's figure could be negative,
with the preliminary forecast band at between minus 1 percent and
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deputy prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said Singapore may
have to tighten its belt at least for another year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has made it clear that the
cost-cutting package is not a miracle cure to get Singapore our of
the recession.
</P>
<P>
"A decisive cost-cutting strategy forged through national
consensus is Singapore's strong signal to the world that we are
willing to take bitter medicine when situation calls for," the
prime minister stressed.

WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Two astronauts Wednesday
step out the space shuttle to install two antennas for the
international space station under construction.
</P>
<P>
For the two spacewalkers--Jerry Ross and James Newman, their
most important task is to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity
module, the first element for the international space station
built by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
During their 7-hour spacewalking, the two astronauts will lug
two suitcase-size antennas about halfway up Unity and install them
on opposite sides of Unity.
</P>
<P>
The two antennas will provide a direct, virtually uninterrupted
communication link between Unity and NASA's Mission Control.
</P>
<P>
They will also erect a sunshade over a computer mounted to the
outside of Unity. If time permit, they will try to open a stuck
antenna on Zarya, the Russian-built control module.
</P>
<P>
The two spacewalkers on their first spacewalking on December 7
hooked up 40 electrical connections between Zarya and Unity.

<HEADLINE> Study: California Smoking Ban Help Bartenders' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, December 9 (Xinhua) -- San Francisco bartenders
showed dramatic improvements in lung health after California State
banned smoking in bars early in 1998, U.S. researchers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mark D. Eisner and his colleagues at University of
California at San Francisco conducted the study and reported their
findings in the December 9th issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
They said that they interviewed 74 California bartenders both
one month before and one to two months after the state smoking ban
took effect on January 1,1998.
</P>
<P>
Before smoking was banned in California bars, the 74 bartenders
reported respiratory problems including wheezing and cough, and 77
percent said they suffered eye, nose or throat irritation, the
researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
One to two months after the ban took effect, 59 percent of
those who had complained of respiratory problems reported that
they no longer had these problems. And nearly 80 percent, who had
reported eye, nose or throat irritation, said these symptoms had
cleared up, Eisner and colleagues added.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to potentially reducing the long-term risk of lung
cancer and cardiovascular disease, workplace smoking prohibition
appears to have immediate beneficial effects on adult respiratory
health," the study authors conclude.
</P>
<P>
While some states, such as California, have banned smoking in
many workplaces, other states have yet to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial in the same issue of the journal, Dr. Ronald
M. Davis of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit called for
further smoking bans across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the risk of passive smoking, nonsmokers' exposure
to secondhand smoke needs to be eliminated," he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Shipping Rates to Affect Sri Lankan Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Increasing shipping rates are
expected to adversely affect Sri Lanka's export trade, according
to the Exporters Association of Sri Lanka (EASL) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EASL has protested against the growth of shipping rates and
said that with the effects of the currency devaluation in the
Asian region, exports from Sri Lanka will be adversely affected,
the EASL sources said.
</P>
<P>
The exporters have charged that shipping interests had formed
cartels to increase freight rates from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
This was in addition to a proposed increase in the terminal
handling charges which if allowed will seriously affect the
competitiveness of Sri Lanka's exports, the EASL sources said.
</P>
<P>
Shipping lines, however, justified the increases, saying this
had to happen in view of the cost factor that had arisen recently.
Shipping lines have formed themselves into conferences in order to
face a possible rate war.
</P>
<P>
Exporters said that their performance from January to September
1998 had dropped sharply over the same period last year, with
growth being a mere 4.39 percent over a 14.59 percent growth in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The EASL sources said that when the average rate to Europe had
increased by 40 percent, the rate to the United States had gone up
by 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EASL anticipates a major crisis in export with the proposed
increase in shipping rates next year.

<P>
Bangkok Post Thursday quoted the board's secretary-general
Staporn Kavitanon as saying that it was becoming imperative that
regulations must be eased so as to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Thailand had tried for more than 10 years
to amend regulations and laws to cope with the rapidly changing
economy, governments had not lasted long enough to pass
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Board officials would meet next week to discuss improvements,
he said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
He noted that foreign capital would flow into the country soon
because production costs were attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage, he said, was a homogenous and stable
workforce.
</P>
<P>
Staporn outlined investment prospects on Wednesday at a seminar
and exhibition entitled "Must'98 -- Maintenance, Utility, Services
and Subcontracting Technology -- held in Pattaya, 150 kilometers
southeast of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment has helped industries by allowing
majority foreign ownership, regardless of location or the amount
of production exported. To date, 20 billion baht (555 million U.S.
dollars) in foreign capital had been pumped into companies helped
by the board.
</P>
<P>
The board has also waived duty on raw materials imported for
making export products.
</P>
<P>
The board has come under pressure from the International
Monetary Fund which earlier suggested that the board reduce its
role in providing promotional privileges as Thailand was losing
rather than gaining from the moves.
</P>
<P>
In addition, privileges such as tax holidays and reductions
must be phased out within five years as required by the World
Trade Organization.

<P>
BRASILIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso Wednesday declined to back visiting Chilean
President Eduardo Frei, who is lobbying for support to avoid
Pinochet's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
In a lunch in honor of Frei, who is here for the 15th Mercosur
customs union summit, Cardoso said that as a former political
exile in Chile, "I did not like dictatorships or dictators."
</P>
<P>
But Argentine President Carlos Menem said Pinochet should be
brought back for trial by Chilean courts.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw approved Pinochet's
extradition to Spain Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London on October 16 on a Spanish

and disappearance of up to 3,000 people, including some Spaniards,
during his rule from 1973 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Teenager Dropouts Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- As many as 50 percent of the
15 to 18 years old Sri Lankans are out of the school system, a
prominent expert on education revealed.
</P>
<P>
Professor Swarna Jayaweera, head of the Center for Women's
Research, made the remarks here recently at the launching of the
annual State of the World Children's Report of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Assessing the situation, she said that despite education being
one of Sri Lanka's success stories, there were lapses which were
largely due to complacency.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Jayaweera said 12 percent of the 5 to 14 years old did
not attend schools and in the low income area the dropout rate was
about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The quality of education too she said was not very good. Over
the years, there had been a drastic reduction in spending on
education.
</P>
<P>
There was disparity between students in the capital and those
in the outskirts. The system had failed in the development of
creativity and practical skills of children, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Even though the literacy rate was 90 percent the functional
literacy rate was only 50 percent, Prof. Jayaweera added. However,
she was optimistic about the education reforms proposed by
government and education had been made compulsory.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Responses Divided Over Pinochet's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chilean responses were divided
Wednesday over a decision by the British Government to approve the
extradition of General Augusto Pinochet to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Chilean government officials and the military vowed to fight
for the release of the former general, who ruled Chile from 1973
to 1990.
</P>
<P>
President Eduardo Frei in Brasilia called on his countrymen to
"remain calm," saying he "very strongly" rejected the ruling and
"Chile's unity depends on measures" to avoid Pinochet's
extradition. He was there for a Mercosur meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a move to show its displeasure, the Chilean government
Wednesday recalled its ambassador to Britain, Mario Artaza, asking
him to give an immediate report on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean military rejected the ruling as "abusive" and
"arbitrary," calling for the suspension of Chile's diplomatic ties
with Britain and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The president of Chile's Supreme Court, Hernan Alvarez,
stressed that the judicial "does not accept the interference" of
other jurisdictions over crimes committed in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, survivors and relatives of those who were killed or
reported missing under the rule of Pinochet welcomed the decision
of British Home Secretary Jack Straw to let Spain start
extradition proceedings against Pinochet, 83, who is wanted on
charges of genocide and torture.
</P>
<P>
Straw's decision "belongs to all mankind because the whole
world has condemned Pinochet," Missing Detainees Association
president Viviana Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
But at the Pinochet Foundation, many of whose supporters are
retired officers, Foundation President Hernan Briones said that
Straw's decision "trampled" the country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
While Chile's right-wing parties rejected the ruling as "the
most serious attempt this century against the country
independence, leftist politicians reacted with a mixture of
satisfaction and caution, saying that the ruling was "good for
justice and human rights but bad for the stability of Chile."
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London on October 16 on a Spanish
warrant seeking his extradition to be tried for the slaying and
disappearance of some 3,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nanning, Old City in New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A large number of reporters
from throughout China have come swarming into Nanning, capital of
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, days before the remote
southwestern region celebrates the 40th anniversary of its
founding on December 11.
</P>
<P>
The old city of Nanning is enveloped in a festive air. Streets
are filled with banners carrying the theme of celebrations and a
large countdown clock shows the time remaining before the
anniversary date.
</P>
<P>
While Northern China is witnessing heavy snow, Nanning is
basking in warm subtropical weather enabling local residents to
enjoy green trees and colorful flowers.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, which shares a 1,000-km border with Viet Nam, is one
of the five autonomous regions which are home to ethnic minorities
in China. The Zhuang is the largest ethnic group with a population
of 17 million people.
</P>
<P>
Nanning was established in the 4th century and currently has a
population of over 1.3 million people. The city, located a few
hours drive from the China-Viet Nam border, served as the military
headquarters during a border conflict in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Nanning reopened as a commercial city in 1992 following the
resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
In about 10 years, Nanning Airport has expanded into a modern
facility accommodating all types of passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has been the focus of our efforts since the
beginning of the 1990s. Guangxi is on the rise," according to
Huang Haikun, a local official.
</P>
<P>
Single-storey houses which were once prevalent in Nanning have
been replaced by highrise complexes, and motorcycles have taken
the place of bicycles as the common means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
Three bridges now span the Yongjiang River in place of the
single structure a short 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new expressway linking Nanning with the border city of
Dongxing provides businessmen with convenient access to Viet
Nam.
</P>
<P>
Roads leading to Xinxiu Hill, a major suburban tourism site,
are filled with traffic on holidays, and Nanning is attracting a
constantly increasing number of visitors from other cities and
counties.
</P>
<P>
The city becomes a sea of neon at night as local residents
flock to restaurants and entertainment venues, with prospective
customers lacking reservations quite often have difficulty in
finding a seat.
</P>
<P>
The bustling scene usually lasts well into the the early moring
hours.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impact of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia
appears to have had little effect on local residents. The city is
also attracting an increasing number of foreign investors,"
according to a local reporter.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's economy is expected to grow by 10 percent for 1998,
some two percentage points above the national target.

<HEADLINE> Italy May Host Trial on Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Italy may find itself under an
obligation to try Abdullah Ocalan, if no other European Union (EU)
country is willing to host a trial of the Kurdish leader, Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Lower House's foreign affairs committee, Dini
said that if the Court of Appeal in Rome finds enough evidence to
warrant a trial, there would be "almost an obligation" for the
government to try Ocalan in Italy.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Italy's hope to find another EU country to try
the case, but noted that the possibility appears minimal out of
fears for the consequences of hosting a politically volatile trial.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the government is now studying the EU's conventions
on terrorism to see if Italy is obliged to try Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-summit meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on
Monday, Italy won guarded support for trying Ocalan for terrorist
acts in an international court whose venue has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Dini also flew to Turkey on Tuesday to win Turkish approval for
such a trial. But Turkey, which although has agreed to trial
outside Turkey, again rejected a forum where its Kurdish policy
would inevitably be put on trial alongside Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested on international warrant after arriving in
Rome from Moscow on November 12. As the leader of the banned
Kurdistan Workers' Party, he is Ankara's most wanted man for
leading a 14-year armed struggle for Kurdish autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Italy's rejection to Turkish demands for his extradition has
fueled tensions between the two countries.

well-known companies, both foreign and domestic, have invested in
the Chongqing Economic and Technological Development Zone in this

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Stocks Recover From Yearly Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan stocks recovered
from a whole year's loss in two days on Hugo Chavez' election as
president, closing Wednesday up 19.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, stocks had climbed 22.22 percent on Chavez'
statements that he would not devalue the currency or impose
exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Chavez on Wednesday said that the soaring stocks showed that
Venezuela was "advancing toward a situation of confidence and
stability which will make the (new government's) start much
easier."
</P>
<P>
Chavez is scheduled to take power on February 2 next year.
</P>
<P>
The Caracas stock exchange had remained bearish this year due
to a world financial crisis and a worsening oil prices slump.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S.President Jimmy Carter's support of Chavez also sent
investors a signal of confidence to send their funds back to
Caracas.

Chavez' moderate statements caused a lift of prices of
Venezuelan foreign debt bonds sold on world markets, after their
value sharply dropped this year.
</P>
<P>
The post-election fever prompted leading companies to sell the
dollars they had saved in case of electoral problems. The flow of
dollars led to a significant increase in the rates of the
currency, the Bolivar, which closed Wednesday at 565.50 against
the dollar, from Friday's 576.50 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Records Bigger Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's trade deficit rose
sharply in the first 10 months of this year to a total of 2.28
billion U.S. dollars at the end of October, 460 million dollars
more than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Both the import and export sectors registered rise in the first
10 months, climbing by 21.8 percent and 21.4 percent respectively,
said Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Economy Bago
Eszter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the import growth was much higher than that of export,
Bago noted.
</P>
<P>
The Russian economic crisis has inevitably hit his country's
export, Sago said. Exports to Russia in the first 10 months
amounted to only 77.1 percent of what they were in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Hungary was expecting a 18 to 20 percent rise in its export
this year. But import would grow even faster, resulting in a
yearly trade deficit of 2.5 to 3 billion dollars, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Half of World's Hungry People to Have Enough Food by 2015 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Half of the world's population
suffering from hunger is expected to have adequate food by the
year 2015 thanks to advanced biotechnology, the United Nations
Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf said biotechnology projects
would help his organization in its bid to slash the starved
population from the present 800 million to 400 million in the next
17 years.
</P>
<P>
He urged more efforts to develop biotechnology, which he said
not only would raise food output by 10 to 20 percent, but also
could produce new strains of grains and heighten anti-disease
features.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the technology was especially useful in 83
countries in the world listed by the FAO as suffering food
shortage and low incomes.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Vows to Further Human Rights Progress in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin today pledged to push forward the progress of human rights
in China and fully safeguard the democratic rights and freedom of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to strengthen the socialist democratic and
legal system and implement the rule by law," Jiang said in a
letter to a commemorative meeting marking the 50th anniversary of
the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people, together with the international community,
will make their own contribution to a just, equitable, peaceful
and prosperous world," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China has so far signed a total of 17 international covenants
on human rights. It signed the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights last October and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights this year.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China on October
1, 1949, and especially since the introduction of reforms and
opening up in 1978, the Chinese government and people have
combined the universal principles of human rights with the
practical situation in China, made great efforts to promote and
protect human rights, and obtained outstanding achievements,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by
the United Nations 50 years ago, was the first particular
U.N. document on human rights, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
It has played an active role in guiding the development of
international human rights theory and practice as well as pushing
forward the progress of the cause, he said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration encouraged the people throughout the world to
pursue the aims and realize human rights. After World War II,
people globally fought more energetically against imperialism,
colonialism and racism, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The independence of some 100 colonies and dependencies and the
national liberation of more than one billion people blazed an ever
wider trail for the realization of human rights and basic freedom,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the independence and liberation of the Chinese
nation, accounting for one fourth of the world population, was the
most significant achievement in such historic and progressive
trends, he added.
</P>
<P>
The China Society for Human Rights Studies hosted the
commemorative meeting.

<HEADLINE> hke121008 - Indonesian Govt Softens General Election Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the House of Representatives Wednesday agreed to ease requirements
for existing political parties to contest the general election
scheduled for next June 7, the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Parties could contest the poll if they had chapters in nine of
the country's 27 provinces, and branches in at least half of the
243 regencies, said Abu Hasan Sazili, who chairs the House's
Special Committee currently deliberating the political bills.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the bill on general elections stipulated that
parties had to have chapters in 14 provinces before they could
contest elections.
</P>
<P>
"The requirements have been relaxed because most political
parties are new and have yet to establish their networks in
regions," he announced after attending the working committee's
session here.
</P>
<P>
With the new stance, more political parties are expected to be
able to contest the next general election, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are 106 political parties vying to
compete next year's general election in the country. Last month,
Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid estimates less than 10 parties
will fulfill requirements to take part in the general election.
</P>
<P>
Abu however said that for general elections after next year's,
all parties would be required to have chapters in at least half of
the provinces and branches in at least half of the regencies.
</P>
<P>
The committee also dropped a stipulation in the bill that
political parties unable to meet the requirement would have to
compensate by providing at least one million supporters'
signatures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the working committee which deliberated the draft
law on political parties agreed to prohibit parties from receiving
foreign assistance to ensure their independence.

PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary is a time to promote public awareness of the
meaning of the Universal Declaration and its relevance to our daily
lives. Providing information about human rights in the languages
understood by peoples everywhere is one aspect of a global public
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Falling during the Decade of Human Rights Education (1995 -
2004), the anniversary also provides another focus for education and
action. In addition to the 200 language versions already available,
a number of other local language translations are to be released for
the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration is an opportunity
for people worldwide to commemorate the adoption of the landmark
document. It also represents an opportunity to mobilize all strata
of society in a reinvigorated and broad-based human rights movement.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of civil society and non-governmental
organizations in fighting for an demanding recognition of basic
rights has played a central role in the advancement and promotion of
human rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
National committees have already been set up in many countries,
with the aim of undertaking activities to mark the upcoming
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the recommendations made at the 1993 World
Conference on Human Rights for increased coordination within the U.N.
system, Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, said, "I will be a
champion of human rights and will ensure that human rights are fully
integrated in the action of the Organization of all other domains."
</P>
<P>
Human rights, indeed, cut across all the work of the United
Nations, from peacekeeping, child rights, health and development to
the rights of indigenous peoples to education, social development
and the eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Consultations have already taken place among all agencies and
programs of the United Nations, leading to strategies and campaigns
being devised.
</P>
<P>
CHALLENGES OF OUR ERA
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the United Nations, the promotion and
protection of human rights have been at its very core. Reference to
the promotion of and respect for human rights was made in Article 1
of the U.N. Charter and in the establishment of a commission for the
promotion of human rights, mentioned in Article 68 of the Charter.
</P>
<P>
During the past 50 years, the United Nations has created a wide
range of mechanisms for monitoring human rights violations.
Conventional mechanisms (treaty bodies) and extra-conventional
mechanisms (U.N. special rapporteurs, representatives, experts and
working groups) have been established in order to monitor compliance
of state parties with the various human rights abuse.
</P>
<P>
Challenges still lie ahead, despite many accomplishments in the
field of human rights. Many in the international community believe
the human rights, democracy and development are interwined.
Unless human rights are respected, the maintenance of
international peace and security and the promotion of economic and
social development cannot be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The world is still plagued with incidents of ethnic hatred and
acts of genocide. People are still victims of xenophobic attitudes,
are subjected to discrimination because of religion or gender and
suffer from exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Around the world, millions of people are still denied food,
shelter, access to medical care, education and work, and too many live
in extreme poverty. Their inherent humanity and dignity are not
recognized.
</P>
<P>
What's even worse, some Western countries, with an excuse of the
alleged protection of human rights, have repeatedly interfered in
internal affairs of the developing world. Therefore, the future of
human rights lies in our hands. We must act all in one to guard
against such human rights preachment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Universal Declaration of Human Rights: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- December 10, the World Human
Rights Day, will be marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration was one of the first
major achievements of the United Nations, and after half a century it
remains a powerful instrument which continues to exert an enormous
effect on people's lives worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in history that a document considered to
have universal value was adopted by an international organization. It
was also the first time that human rights and fundamental freedoms
were set forth in such detail. There was broad-based international
support for the Declaration when it was adopted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. document represented "a world milestone in the long
struggle for human rights," said a U.N. General Assembly
representative from France.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the Universal Declaration stems in large part from
the strong desire for peace in the aftermath of the World War II.
Although the 58 Member States which formed the United Nations at that
time varied in their ideologies, political systems and religious and
cultural backgrounds and had different patterns of socio-economic
development, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights represented a
common statement of goals and aspirations -- a vision of the world as
the international community would want it to become.
</P>
<P>
Since 1948, the Universal Declaration has been translated into
more than 200 languages and remains one of the best known and most
often cited human rights documents in the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Declaration has been used in the defense and
advancement of people's rights. Its principles have been enshrined in
and continue to inspire national legislation and the constitutions of
many newly independent states.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of this "Magna Carta for all
humanity." The theme of the 50th anniversary -- "All Human Rights for
All" -- highlights the universality, the indivisibility and the
interrelationship of all human rights.
</P>
<P>
It reinforces the idea that human rights -- civil, cultural,
economic, political and social -- should be taken in their totality
and not disassociated from one another.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government to Recapitalize 70 Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
Recapitalize 70 out of the 166 national commercial banks at a cost
of 257.5 trillion rupiah (34.3 billion U.S. dollars) in a bid to
revamp the beleaguered banking industry, a minister said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This recapitalization program aims to quickly mend the banking
system, to make it function again so that the economic wheels will
roll again and employment opportunities will emerge again,"
Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto said after an Economic
Resilience Council meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The banks which will be recapitalized include six state banks,
49 privately-owned banks (including four taken over by the
government) and 15 provincial development banks.
</P>
<P>
As for the eligible private and provincial development banks,
the government would provide 80 percent of the total funds needed
to Recapitalize the banks, Bambang was quoted by national
newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
This recapitalization would increase the banks' capital
adequacy ratio (CAR), the ratio between equity capital and
riskweighted assets, to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks which are qualified to join the recapitalization program
are those which have a CAR of between minus 25 percent and plus 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks with a CAR below 25 percent do not qualify for the
government-sponsored recapitalization program, and must inject
fresh capital within 30 days or risk being closed down.
</P>
<P>
The government said earlier that of the country's 208

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Six relatives of
International Olympic Committee members received scholarships
before U.S. Salt Lake City gained the right of hosting the 2002
Winter Games, Salt Lake Olympics officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials admitted that the bid
committee had spent a total of $500,000 to help those relatives,
but insisted the privately financed fund was for humanitarian
assistance -- not to seek up votes of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
"This was such a minute part of that effort, that to stretch
to a campaign of vote influencing rather than a campaign to work
in the spirit of the Olympic movement, I don't think is
justified," SLOC president Frank Joklik said.
</P>
<P>
But a bid official from Sweden said last week that such
contributions gave the bidders who made them an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
"We would consider it as a bribe," said Christer Persson, head
of Ostersund's bidding committee. "We have understood now that we
cannot win competitions against countries that have other
cultures than we have in this respect because we can never do
things like that."
</P>
<P>
Ostersund lost the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
The IOC relatives, mostly from Africa, received money to cover
their study in U.S. universities.

<HEADLINE> Antigraft Drive Could Save Indonesia Over 1b </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian State Minister of
the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng has said that the
government could save more than one billion U.S. dollars from
anti-corruption measures launched in state companies.
</P>
<P>
Tanri said Wednesday that his office had found 167 projects in
state companies (outside the oil and gas sector), which could
involve "KKN", the popular acronym for corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Of the 167 projects, Tanri said, 70 had been annulled, 29 were
being renegotiated and restructured, 66 had been transferred to
the Finance Comptroller Agency for further investigation, and the
remaining two were proceeding after the corrupt elements had been
removed.
</P>
<P>
"The government's efforts to eradicate corrupt contracts in
state enterprises could save 400 billion rupiah (53.33 million
U.S. dollars) and one billion U.S. dollars in costs," he told a
hearing with House of Representatives' Commission VIII for the
state budget and finance, research and technology affairs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the contracts cut by the government were linked to
former president Soeharto's children and close friends, he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
State oil and gas company Pertamina has also terminated dozens
of contracts, most of which were given to companies linked to the
Soeharto's family and friends.
</P>
<P>
The government has come under increasing public pressure to
combat graft practices following the downfall of Soeharto, who has
been widely charged of enriching his family and close friends
during his 32 years in power.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Voids Govt Compromise Accord With Marcoses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
Philippines Wednesday nullified for its illegality and
unconstitutionality a government compromise accord with the Marcos
family in 1993 over 570 million U.S. dollars in Swiss deposits and
other assets of the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 agreement was signed by Imelda Marcos and her children
and Chairman Magtanggol Gunigundo of the Presidential Commission
on Good government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Marcos family would get 25 percent of
all their alleged ill-gotten wealth and immunity from tax
liabilities and criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
In a 44-page decision written by Justice Artemio Panganiban,
the court spelled out the legal and constitutional requirements of
valid compromise agreements.
</P>
<P>
The court warned that the deal would serve as a "virtual
warrant" for public officials to amass public funds illegally,
since there is an open option to compromise their liability in
exchange of only a portion of their ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
The court said that immunity from criminal suit cannot be given
to the Marcoses in exchange for a portion of their wealth, the
exact amount of which remains undetermined until now.
</P>
<P>
However, the court did not bar further negotiations for
possible compromise between President Joseph Estrada's government
and the Marcos family, subject only to the condition that these be
open to public scrutiny.

House of Representatives Judiciary Committee prepared four
articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton in relation
to the Monica Lewinsky affair on Wednesday and pressed for a vote
by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The Republican committee staff and members recommended two
articles alleging perjury, one alleging obstruction of justice and
a fourth alleging abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The articles of impeachment were drafted on the second day of
the two-day impeachment hearings in the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
Democrats countered with a proposal to censure Clinton, citing
him for "reprehensible conduct with a subordinate," Monica
Lewinsky, the former White House intern, and demanding his
signature on the instrument of his censure.
</P>
<P>
"No person is above the law and the president remains subject
to criminal and civil penalties for this conduct," the Democratic
proposal reads. It does not accuse Clinton of perjury, nor does it
demand he pay a fine.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday, the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee
is scheduled to begin debate on the proposals to make Clinton only
the second president in history to face the prospect of
impeachment in the full House.
</P>
<P>
Approval of at least one count seems assured -- the one dealing
with allegations of perjury before Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
A House vote would occur the following week, and increasingly,
officials on both sides of the issue were focusing their energy on
the expected showdown there.

NEW YORK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed mixed on
Wednesday with the blue-chip index down moderately and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up to another record high.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.79 to 9009.19 in a
second session of moderate losses following a 42 points loss on
Tuesday due to weaker performance of some of the Dow components,
such as financial issues on Tuesday and Coca-Cola and Proctor &AMP;
Gamble on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow now is some 365 points below the peak of 9374.27
reached on November 23 but still up 14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index, which rose to a historic high of 2040.64,
representing a 30 percent plus growth this year on Monday and fell
just 5.89 on Tuesday, moved up 15.67 on Wednesday to a new record
of 2050.42 driven by strong technology shares.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.11 to 1183.49, just about 10
percent below the November 27 record of 1192.33.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners led advancers by a
slim margin with trading volume totaling 692 million shares down
from 723 million previously.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Demands Iraq to Cooperate in Arms Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States warned on
Wednesday that Iraq must fully comply with U.N. weapons
inspections, and it was prepared to act if Baghdad fails to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
"We expect full cooperation by the Iraqis," White House
spokesman David Leavy said, noting "that's what Iraq agreed to."
</P>
<P>
"As the president (Bill Clinton) has said, if UNSCOM cannot do
its job effectively, we remain poised to act," Leavy added.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a U.N. weapons inspection team making a
surprise foray into a headquarters of President Saddam Hussein's
ruling Ba'ath Party for a list of items the team was looking for,
which was, however, stopped by a party official.
</P>
<P>
The official asked the team for written notification specifying
what the team was searching for, but the weapons team refused and
pulled back.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency called the inspection "provocative",
while Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
the blocking by Iraq of the inspection was "very serious".
</P>
<P>
Leavy said Washington was awaiting a report by Butler, who
will assess the overall level of Iraqi compliance with U.N.
requirements to the United Nations next week.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a U.N. weapons team had been prevented
from entering a site since surprise inspections were resumed on
Tuesday. This followed Iraq's Nov. 14 decision to drop its
refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Spend More on Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are spending more
money on government-run gambling activity than ever before, a
report from Statistics Canada indicated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Canadians wagered 6.8 billion dollars (4.5 billion
U.S. dollars) on some form of government-regulated gambling, 2.5
times the total spent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
And gambling has become a multi-billion dollar industry, whose
growth has far outstripped that of most other industries, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1997, gross domestic product in Canada's
gambling industry increased by 125 percent, compared with just 14
percent in all industries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, employment in gambling almost tripled, from
12,000 jobs to 35,000, while employment in all other industries
rose only eight percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, about 82 percent of Canadian
households put some money on at least one gaming activity,
spending an average of 423 dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
About three-quarters of households reported spending money on
government-run lotteries, while 39 percent participated in
non-government lotteries and raffles, and 17 percent said they
spent money at casinos and on slot machines.
</P>
<P>
On average, Canadian households with higher incomes spent more
on gambling than those with lower incomes, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's provincial governments have benefited enormously from
the country's booming gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the provincial governments made 3.8 billion dollars
from gambling, more than double the profit level of 1.7 billion
dollars five years earlier, the agency said.

LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean ambassador to
Britain went to the airport Wednesday night to fly home after
being recalled to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Maria Artaza left his office just a few hours after
the British government decided to authorize the extradition
proceedings against former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"I've got to be brief because I am leaving. I have a flight
within two hours back home," Artaza said in front of the embassy
in central London.
</P>
<P>
Chile's government recalled Artaza for an immediate report in
protest at Wednesday's decision made by British Home Secretary
(Interior Minister) Jack Straw, which it said infringed its
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Chile said it would use all means at its disposal to reverse
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Straw gave British courts authority to proceed with a request
from Spain asking for Pinochet's extradition on murder, torture
and kidnapping charges.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused that the 83-year-old general is
responsible for the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people
during his 17-year rule in Chile which ended in 1990.
